			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">Microsoft laying off 9,000+ people</a> across its whole company resulted in a number of projects being cancelled, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-reportedly-loved-playing-zenimax-onlines-new-game-in-march-only-to-cancel-it-in-july/">a new MMO from ZeniMax Online</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">Perfect Dark reboot</a>, Rare's <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">Everwild</a>, and as we just learned earlier today, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reportedly-stopped-contraband-development-avalanche-studios/">Contraband, from Avalanche Studios</a>. One game that isn't cancelled however, according to a Microsoft spokesperson, is Hideo Kojima's horror game he's making in collaboration with Xbox, OD.</p>



<p>That news comes from Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, who in his reporting on Contraband, asked after the status of OD, which is another project from Microsoft that was announced years ago, though we've heard very little of since. He reports that he was told by a Microsoft spokesperson that OD "<em>is still in development</em>."</p>







<p>OD was first announced during <a href="https://wccftech.com/od-hideo-kojima-horror-game-xbox-revealed-jordan-peele/">The Game Awards 2023 showcase</a>, and was such an exciting announcement at the time, that it was the one game out of everything else announced that year that <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojimas-od-topped-tga-2023-press-coverage-says-fancensus/">dominated press coverage of TGA 2023</a>.</p>



<p>Since then, however, we've heard very little about OD. Kojima has mentioned it and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-provides-update-on-death-stranding-2-and-his-many-other-productions/">work he's doing on it in passing</a>, and has also talked about how his goals with OD is to make something that players have not necessarily seen before. He's called it a <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-says-o-d-is-risky-talks-death-stranding-movie-and-physint-crossmedia-plans/">"<em>risky</em>" game</a> that will be<a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-disappointed-industry/"> "<em>divisive</em>,"</a> but at the same time it sounds like he's excited to be making something that he knows will push players, something he knows that not everyone will fall head-over-heels for.</p>



<p>Horror-director Jordan Peele is also meant to be working on OD alongside Kojima and Xbox, though what we know about Peele's involvement so far is equal to what we know about OD itself, which is very little.</p>



<p>Perhaps now that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> has launched and is on store shelves, we'll soon start to hear more about what's happening with OD, and get a more official word/sign on if it's happening at all. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/splinter-cell-enhanced-mod-pc-steam-deck-2000616399</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-incredible-splinter-cell-mod-offers-the-definitive-experience-of-a-stealth-classic.1265064/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>When the original <i>Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell</i> arrived in 2002, it threatened to dethrone <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>’s tight grip on the stealth genre. And for some purists, it likely succeeded, given its groundbreaking technical displays of light and shadow that were more than just pretty to look at. The game also pushed you to move with more caution, with enemies that, in some instances, were far more perceptive than what <i>Metal Gear Solid 2</i> offered at the time. <i>MGS3</i> would arrive shortly after to up its stealth game, perhaps having learned a thing or two from <i>Splinter Cell</i>, but the original <i>SC</i> and its two direct sequels remain incredible challenges for those of us who like to lurk around in the shadows. And if you’ve been craving a return to Sam Fisher’s first outing, then let me tell you about this incredible mod that makes it hard to go back to the original.</p> <p><i>Enhanced SC</i> is a project from modder Joshhhuaaa that you can <a href="https://github.com/Joshhhuaaa/EnhancedSC">grab on GitHub</a> right now for both Windows and Steam Deck. It introduces a suite of improvements, which include a mission statistics tracker that lets you know just how stealthy your current run is, proper widescreen support, fixes to movement speed, better controller support, maps based on original Xbox versions, the Nuclear Power Plant level from the PS2 version, and <a href="https://github.com/Joshhhuaaa/EnhancedSC/blob/main/PatchNotes.md">so much more</a>.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000616402" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616402"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616402">© Ubisoft / Joshhhuaaa / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>While many mods of this kind sometimes make for an experience that feels quite different from the original game, <i>Enhanced SC</i> feels remarkably faithful to what it was like to play <i>Splinter Cell</i> on PS2 or Xbox back in the day. There are some notable tweaks to the gameplay, such as the inclusion of whistling (which would show up in later <i>SC</i> games), and distinct commands for opening a door fully or partially to peek into the next room. These feel like very natural inclusions to the original game–in fact, until I read through the patch notes, I didn’t realize they <em>weren’t</em> in the first <i>SC</i>.</p>

 <p>Steam Deck support, however, is where this mod really shines. It runs surprisingly well for such an old game on a Linux machine. There’s also a dedicated “EnhancedSC Layout” controller scheme you can download from the community layouts that allows for precision aiming by way of the right touchpad, and a quicksave and load feature mapped to the left one (this makes quickly resetting to your last save for save-scummy playthroughs a breeze).</p> <figure id="attachment_2000616403" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616403"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616403">© Ubisoft / Joshhhuaaa / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>If it’s been a while since you’ve jumped into Sam’s sneaking suit, do yourself a favor and check out this mod. Who knows when (or if) we’re getting <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-7-canceled-games-splinter-cell-assasin-s-creed-1849976552">that damn remake anyway</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>For all of the completionists out there, Mafia: The Old Country provides you with plenty to work towards to complete the entire game. </p>



<p>Hangar 13 returned to the franchise’s roots for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mafia-the-old-country-release-date-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mafia: The Old Country</a>. Instead of an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mafia-the-old-country-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open world</a> as seen in Mafia 3, the latest installment is a linear-narrative driven game. As such, the game has a similar expected run time to the first two games of the series, meaning you can expect around <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-to-beat-mafia-the-old-country-game-length-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10-12 hours of content</a>. </p>



<p>Some fans assumed that less content is what led to the game receiving a $50 pricetag, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mafia-the-old-country-devs-say-game-isnt-short-just-because-its-only-50/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hangar 13</a> assured players that they won’t be “disappointed” by the final package. And although Mafia: The Old Country is shorter than other Triple AAA single-player offerings, there is still a long list of trophies and achievements to earn. </p>

That being said, the normal achievements and trophies mostly just cover weapon mastery and completing a few simple tasks. The secret trophies contain most of the spoilers. </p>

                <p>After a bit of a hiatus, Hot Shots Golf is making a triumphant return with <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Save+On+Everybody%27s+Golf+Hot+Shots+PC+Preorders+And+Unlock+Pac-Man+Early&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-08-07+11%3A51%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-07+11%3A51%3A32&amp;fnarticle_id=6533729&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Feverybodys-golf-hot-shots&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Feverybodys-golf-hot-shots-pc-preorder-fanatical-deal%2F1100-6533729%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Everybody's Golf Hot Shots</a>. Releasing on September 5 for PS5, Switch, and PC, it's looking like a fresh take on the classic golf video game series, featuring simple controls, a variety of solo and multiplayer gameplay modes, and a long list of character customization options. While preorders are available on all platforms, PC players should consider <strong>preordering at Fanatical, where it's on sale for $33.59 (was $40)</strong>. This is the best price we've seen for the upcoming game, and the discount is only available before launch. Preordering the game unlocks the playable Pac-Man character early. You'll also get an additional 5% off voucher for your next Fanatical purchase.</p><p>As if that weren't enough, Everybody's Golf Hot Shots preorders are also eligible for Fanatical's Summer Bonus Drop deal, which gets you a random bonus prize when you spend $15 or more during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fanatical-summer-sale-2025/1100-6533680/" data-ref-id="1100-6533680">Fanatical's Summer Sale event</a>. The possible prizes include free game keys and bonus coupon codes. Grabbing the game at Fanatical gets you an official key redeemable via Steam.</p><p>Everybody's Golf Hot Shots is the first new game in the popular Hot Shots Golf series (known as Everybody's Gold in Japan) since 2017. It's also notable as the first game in the series to launch on PC and Nintendo platforms--all previous games in the series have been exclusive to PlayStation consoles and handhelds, and many were never localized outside of Japan. While the series features many of the core mechanics of other golf sim games--including swing strength meter, varied courses, and even weather conditions to contend with--Everybody's Golf offers a more arcadey take on the genre, with simple controls, cartoony visual style, and multiple gameplay modes, including challenge modes and high-score leaderboards.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4545933-golfpacmanbonus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545933" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4545933-golfpacmanbonus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545933"></a><figcaption>Everybody's Golf Hot Shots preorder bonus</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4545933-golfpacmanbonus.jpg"></figure><p>As mentioned above, Everybody's Golf Hot Shots digital preorders are also available on PS5 and Switch. While the game isn't discounted on those platforms, you can still get the early Pac-Man unlock preorder bonus by securing your copy early. Pac-Man will be available as a character in the full game after launch, too, but preorders unlock him early. Note you'll have to complete the "My First Golf" in-game activity first before you can redeem the early unlock.</p><p>Everybody's Golf Hot Shots is just one of many upcoming PC games that are discounted at Fanatical, so it's worth<a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Save+On+Everybody%27s+Golf+Hot+Shots+PC+Preorders+And+Unlock+Pac-Man+Early&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-08-07+11%3A51%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-07+11%3A51%3A32&amp;fnarticle_id=6533729&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fupcoming-games&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Feverybodys-golf-hot-shots-pc-preorder-fanatical-deal%2F1100-6533729%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> checking out the retailer's listings</a> if you've got PC games on your wishlist.

<p>Hardware this week yields no change in the top ten, with the Switch 2 once again claiming the top spot. Cumulative Switch sales reach 18,637 units this week, while the PS5 has managed a total of 7,141. So yes, despite Nintendo launching a <em>brand new console</em>, mind you, the previous-gen Switch managed to outsell the PS5 by more than 2:1.</p>

However, if you don’t want to wait for what’s next, you can currently save on the <strong>Samsung Galaxy Buds FE</strong>, which are down to $46.99 ($53 off) at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-samsung-galaxy-buds-fe-true-wireless-bluetooth-earbuds-9" rel="sponsored">Woot</a>. That’s their best price yet and a deal that will run until September 2nd or while supplies last.</p><p>Despite being nearly two years old, the Buds FE remain a solid pair of wireless earbuds. They offer good sound and impressive noise cancellation for the price, but it’s the fit that really stands out. Unlike the pricier Galaxy Buds 3 and Buds 3 Pro, the Buds FE feature a wing tip design that provides a more comfortable, secure fit. Meanwhile, a flattened touchpad area makes pausing, playing, and skipping tracks more foolproof.</p><p>The Buds FE miss out on more advanced features, including a conversation mode and proper multipoint Bluetooth support. They also lack wireless charging and carry a meager IPX2 rating for water resistance, which means they could get damaged if dropped into a pool of water. That being said, a transparency mode ensures you stay aware of your surroundings by letting ambient noise in, and battery life is solid enough to last a full day.</p><div><p id="more-deals-to-check-out"><h2>More deals to check out</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>The <strong>second-gen Backbone One with USB-C</strong> is down to $69.99 ($30 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BACKBONE-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-Lightning-iOS/dp/B0CCT2LWT8?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fbackbone-one-usb-c-mobile-gaming-controller-for-iphone-15-16-series-and-android-2nd-generation-black%2F6558725.p" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, and <a rel="sponsored" href="https://backbone.sjv.io/c/482924/2186621/25186?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbackbone.com%2Fproducts%2Fbackbone-one-usb-c">Backbone’s storefront</a>, matching the largest discount we’ve seen this year.

What makes them unique — aside from their retro-future look — is the Zone come with an air purifier you wear over your mouth. The magnetic visor does a decent job filtering pollutants, giving you clean air wherever you may be. They also deliver top-notch noise cancellation — better than the AirPods Max — and are comfortable despite being relatively heavy at 1.3 pounds. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23698352/dyson-zone-review-headphones-wearables-air-purifier">Read our review</a>.</span></li><li><span>The starting price of the <strong>Switch 2 Pro Controller</strong> was recently raised to $89.99 following <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717610/nintendo-switch-original-price-increase">Nintendo’s sweeping price hikes</a>.

While it’s a nice upgrade over the original Switch Pro Controller, it still includes drift-prone potentiometer joysticks instead of the more durable Hall effect or TMR joysticks. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/684602/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review">Read our review</a>.</span></li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Njg3NzE5"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Brandon Russell</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/756210/samsung-galaxy-buds-fe-nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Sony’s massively popular third-person online sci-fi shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-ps5-exclusive-1851785573"><em>Helldivers 2</em> is coming to Xbox later this month</a>. Many fans had assumed that developers Arrowhead had been the ones behind the decision, likely pushing PlayStation to let them port the game to the company’s rival console. But it turns out it was actually Sony’s idea, and that’s just more evidence that the <a href="https://kotaku.com/console-wars-are-over-ps5-xbox-forza-switch-2-sony-1851752956">console wars are over.</a></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851"><em>Helldivers 2</em> launched in early 2024</a> to <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-sony-steam-pc-ps5-players-1851268838">rave reviews and huge player counts.</a> And since then, the game has continued to receive frequent updates, growing larger in scale as it adds more enemies and its massive galactic story of war continues to evolve. But for the last year, the only way to play <em>Helldivers 2</em> was on PS5 or PC. This left Xbox players out of the loop. That changes on August 26, when Helldivers lands on Xbox Series X/S with full crossplay support. And according to Arrowhead’s CEO Shams Jorjani, the decision to port <em>Helldivers 2</em> came entirely from PlayStation.</p> <p>On August 6, as reported by <em>Windows Central,</em> when a player praised Arrowhead for bringing the <em>Helldivers</em> sequel to Xbox, Jorjani stepped in and gave Sony all the credit. “It was all PlayStation. Send them your thanks,” posted Jorjani in the game’s official Discord server. “We were all in support, of course.” The Arrowhead CEO later added, “I think it’s one of the coolest things [Sony’s] done. They’re killing it.”</p> <p>While it might at first seem odd that PlayStation would bring one of its most popular video games in years to a rival platform, the reality is that the console wars have mostly fizzled out. Thanks to crossplay, cross save, Xbox ditching the whole affair after losing last gen, and Nintendo doing their own thing, there’s just not much of a war anymore. <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-podcast-exclusivity-business-update-ps5-hi-fi-rush-1851261518?_gl=1*q9wu73*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM3MDQ1NzEkbzEyOSRnMSR0MTc1MzcwOTY4NCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">Xbox has found great success bringing its hit games like <em>Forza</em> to PlayStation 5</a>, and Sony is following in their footsteps now by bringing games like <em>Marathon</em> and <em>Helldivers 2</em> to Xbox, as well as continuing to port games like <em>Spider-Man</em> to PC. At this point, it just makes more sense to put your games on more platforms. This is especially true for big, expensive live-service games that rely on lots of players actively engaging with the game daily to make money. So I’d expect to see even more Xbox and PlayStation games hopping across platforms in the future. I mean, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-1-reloaded-remaster-ps5-xbox-pc-summer-1851779167"><em>Gears of War</em></a> is coming to PlayStation this year.&nbsp; <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-xbox-exclusivity-helldivers-spiderman-switch-2-1851787122">The walls have fallen. The console wars are over. And only Nintendo seems to care about keeping stuff exclusive</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-26-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/madden-nfl-26-review-in-progress.1265007/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I play a lot of Madden every year, gang. Like, <em>a lot</em> a lot. I’m in a 32-man league, and then I have my own Franchise mode going, and none of that includes all the work that goes into writing a review for IGN, which is… substantial. But no matter how much I play, I’ll always discover something new after that review is done – be it an obnoxious bug or just a better understanding of a system under the hood. I feel like I understand a lot more about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-review"><u>Madden NFL 25</u></a> now that I am about to put down the controller for the final time, but after spending a little time with Madden NFL 26, well… all that stuff’s out the window. Madden 26 changes a lot of what came before, and while I still have more to play before my final review, I’m liking what I see so far. I’m liking it a lot, in fact.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with one of the biggest changes: the Skills Trainer. Madden’s old Skills Trainer was a good way to learn the basics, but it’s been completely overhauled this year, and I’ve gotta say, I’m impressed. There are substantially more drills and the tutorials explaining them are much, much more detailed, to the point where I’m already learning stuff I didn’t know. For instance, if you’re kicking a field goal or an extra point, you shouldn’t hit the red zone of the kick power part of the meter, as that’s what is called an overkick, which reduces your distance. I thought it just meant “Hey, here’s the edge of the meter.” Nope! I asked one of my friends who also regularly plays if he knew that; he didn’t. But we both do now. Madden has always been uncomfortable with explaining itself, largely opting to leave the detailed stuff to YouTubers. Now, a lot more of that detail is in the game. The Skills Trainer will even mark drills as “Beginner,”  or “New to Madden,” so you can find the stuff you need more easily. It’s a huge improvement and something I’ve personally been asking for for years, so I’m ecstatic with this addition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from that, I’ve also been playing around in Franchise, which is to say I’ve mostly been playing with Coach Creation and menus. Madden may try to convince you that it is parkour, reader, but this is a lie. It’s menus all the way down. Coach Creation is totally revamped now, with a ton of new heads that (mostly) look better than last year’s options and several that look like they were made out of Play-Doh or the “Weird and Ugly” section of the Dark Souls character creator. But hey, I appreciate the effort.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you’ve made your custom coach, you’ve got the choice of one of three archetypes built around player development, offense, and defense. The skill trees of old? Gone. Now you spend Skill Points to unlock and upgrade abilities that you equip on gameday for bonuses. Some, generally player abilities, last a few weeks; others, like the ones that allow you to hire better scouts, last all season. It’s different and I haven’t had enough time to see where it all goes yet, but I’m intrigued as it seems more interesting than “this position gets +2 Speed, the Most Important Stat in the Game,” which was how a lot of the skill tree looked last time.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The updated Skills Trainer is a huge improvement I've been wanting for years.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">On the field, things are faster, finding a balance between the zippy arcade feel of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-26-review"><u>College Football</u></a> and the Maddens of yesteryear. The Wear and Tear injury system also makes its Madden debut, though I’m concerned about it in this context; I acknowledge it’s more realistic, but I don’t necessarily like it in College Football, and I particularly don’t like the way the on-field UI has changed to accommodate it. But we’ll see.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Wear and Tear, though, comes some very welcome changes to player development. You can now choose practice intensity for each player, not just for starters and backups at each position, which is a godsend. I’m decent at Madden on the field, but what makes me good in a Franchise league is that I’m great at drafting and player development. For someone like me, this extra control is a huge deal. There’s also some nice QoL changes here, like being able to see player fatigue as a number and not just a meter on the health section of their player card. Like, yes! Finally! I don’t know if this is stuff most players will notice, but if you’re a sicko like me, it really does make a big difference.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Madden NFL Game Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not all sunshine and roses in Menuland, though. Player cards now take more than five seconds to load, which is both substantially worse than in Madden 25 and absolutely infuriating when you really want to dig into your team’s stats. We’re pre-release, and to its credit, EA did fix menu and loading issues in previous Maddens – but man, five seconds to do something as simple as open a player card, which was snappy in Madden 25, when there are 53 players on a team? Please shoot me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of changes EA has made to anger me personally, Madden has once again reworked the name of its QB throwing motions, and introduced several new ones. This is, by my count, the second time that this has happened in the last two years, and it’s maddening (get it?) each time. Throwing motion is hugely important to how QBs play, and now I have to figure out what my favorite throwing motions are, and what draft notes correspond to those motions, all over again. I’m glad that the new names make a little more sense, but I am begging EA to leave these alone for a hot second. Please.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, though, I’m pretty impressed by the changes to this year’s game so far. I have a lot to do before I can render a verdict – I need to play Superstar, dig deeper into Franchise, get more of a feel for the on-field action, and (sigh) spend some time with Ultimate Team. But I’m <em>really</em> liking what I’ve seen of Madden 26 so far. Now I just need to put more time into it and see if that feeling holds up.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Will's Favorite Football Games</h3></p></div></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-26-review]]></content:encoded>

<p>As for the specific issues that Battlefield Studios is aware of, the developer said it knows players may be unable to ping enemies when using stationary weapons. Additionally, the animations for when characters attach to a zipline are bugged. Beyond that, the aim assist feature when players are close to smoke is a work in progress, the studio said. Another known issue is that players can sink into the ground after reviving a teammate.</p><p>Battlefield Studios added that it's aware of weapon-balancing issues specific to recoil. The studio said it knew about these issues for some time but wasn't able to address them for the open beta. There are UI/UX known issues, too, including the "Close Map" button not working properly and the pick-up prompt no appearing on some gadgets.</p><p>You can see a bigger list of known issues below, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1953500544162500657" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as shared by Battlefield Studios</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-apex-legends-switch-2-a-giant-leap-over-the-tragic-switch-1-version.1264971/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I love <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>. I feel like I have to remind myself of that sometimes, as I'm so bored off my face with shooters in general, and don't really play online competitively anymore. I just can't be bothered with the stress and/or real emotion of it all.</p>
<p>However, Apex Legends, once I get over myself and turn it on, does stuff that pleases my monkey brain quite a lot. Back in 2019 when it released, which feels like centuries ago now, I couldn't believe how clever, simple, and obvious this hero shooter's ping system was. How hadn't anyone done this before? It's a game that's built with no-fuss, unobtrusive teamwork at its core. And it makes it a blast for anyone to have fun with.</p><!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/accessibility-report/2700/embed @ 1754590314 -->
<p>The roster of hero characters, which is now enormous compared to when I last played it, is hugely varied, and they all have amplified and incredibly moreish methods of traversal. It's all very zippy, cloaky, boost-jumpy, and very, very fast. The movement and controls and shooting and zooming around collecting stuff endlessly is just as pleasing as the pings. I know you know all of this already, I'm just saying.</p>
<p>Back on Switch 1, Apex Legends managed to arrive feature-complete. However, it was laid low by terrible performance issues. Indeed, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/apex_legends">I gave it a 5/10</a>, saying it was still fun to play, but had notable frame rate issues, muddy textures, unresponsive and laggy controls...yeah, it was basically a really tragic Switch port.</p>
<p>We don't have to worry about any of this now, though. We can concentrate on having a good time with what's surely still one of the very best (if not <em>the</em> best) hero shooter, Battle Royale...eh, thingies out there. It really is that good. I've used my unlock tokens to grab all but three of the full roster, and I've fallen down the rabbit hole once more.</p>
<p>Because, much like how its ping system originally dazzled me, this Switch 2 port has dazzled me all over again by being perhaps the very first fully-fledged and functionally perfect online shooter that I've ever sat and played on my sofa on a portable console. Yes, there are other great online shooter games on Switch, like the majestic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon</a> series, but this scratches a very different shooter itch. And it's free!</p>
<p>In docked and handheld, performance feels great on Switch 2, and bar the odd hiccup as you load into a stage, this is silky smooth stuff, even during busy firefights. It looks perfectly crisp and clear at <em>all times</em>. Add in motion controls for fine-tuning your snipes, a bonus mouse-mode that's fun (I'm still using the normal controls, mind), and you've got a version of Apex Legends that, despite all of its hard-selling of Apex Points and outfits, is very, very hard to pick a hole in.</p>
<p>In fact, Apex Legends redeems itself on Switch 2. This upgraded version gives us 60fps shooting action with crisp, clear resolutions and none of that juddery, unresponsive, blurry stuff we had back in 2021. It's still the best hero shooter/Battle Royale out there for me, with amazingly fluid traversal, best-in-class gunfeel, and a ping system that puts proper teamwork and tactics front and centre. The cherry on top, of course, is that it's free to play, too, so there's no good reason for shooter fans not to dive right in.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends]]></content:encoded>

<p>Turn 10 and Playground Games will “continue to support Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon 5.”</p>



<p>In a post on social media on Thursday, the developers said that they “appreciate the support of [their] incredible community”. They also wanted to make it clear that support for Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon 5 wasn’t ending. </p>



<p>“We wanted to assure players that Turn 10 and Playground Games will continue to support Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon 5,” <a href="https://x.com/ForzaMotorsport/status/1953508994581938364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">they said</a>. </p>



<p>The team <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-motorsport-update-21-featured-tours#logitech" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">then linked</a> to a post going over what’s coming in the future to Forza Motorsport. Those updates include near featured tours, new cars earned through challenges, and new featured rivals. The new update is scheduled to come on September 4.</p>



<h6 id="h-more-xbox-contraband-development-stopped-at-xbox">More Xbox: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/contraband-development-stopped-at-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contraband Development Stopped At Xbox</a></h6>



<p>While current support continuing is good news for players, what wasn’t mentioned in the statement, however, was anything regarding the future of the Forza Motorsport series. </p>



<p>After Microsoft’s latest layoffs at Xbox in July, one studio reportedly hit hard was Turn 10 games. According to reports, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/turn-10-studios-loses-nearly-half-of-its-staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">up to 50% of the team</a> was let go and it was turned into a support studio for the Forza Horizon series with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-motorsport-canceled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the mainline series being canceled</a>. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has made numerous efforts to get clarification on the state of the Forza Motorsport franchise but neither Microsoft or Turn 10 have responded to requests for comment.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 6 is currently in development. Playground Games, the developers of the Forza Horizon series, are also working on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fable-delayed-into-2026-by-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reboot of Fable</a>.</p>



<p>What do you think the future holds for Forza Motorsport? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

		<p>It appears yet another previously announced game has got the chop by Microsoft with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lvt7g4p7fs2k">Jason Schreier from Bloomber</a>g reporting that Avalanche Studio’s Contraband has been cancelled.</p>
<p>That has just been confirmed by Avalanche, although they say development has stopped whilw they “evaluate” the project’s future.</p>



<p>Announced during the 2021 Microsoft and Bethesda Showcase with a CGI trailer for the game and&nbsp; very little else.&nbsp; The official version of the reveal trailer has been removed for YouTube, but here’s a copy.</p>
<p><iframe title="Contraband. Teaser 4K" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/71hMe-XsYx0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>“Contraband is our most ambitious game yet and working closely together with Xbox Games Studios has been a great experience,” said Omar Shakir, Game Director at Avalanche Studios at the to,e. “We can’t wait to share more about the game and the world of Bayan.”</p>

<p>“We’re incredibly excited to work together with a partner such as Xbox Game Studios and look forward to laying the foundation for a long-standing partnership,” added Pim Holfve, CEO at Avalanche Studios Group. “With Contraband, we’re taking everything we’ve learned from 18 years of being in the forefront of open world games as well as bringing the knowledge from running successful live game services focusing on our player communities.”</p>
<p>Some leaks did hit the internet over the past few years, it was said to be a mix of PayDay, Battlefield Hardline, Mad Max, and Dukes of Hazard. It was going to be a four and eight player co-op and seemed to pit a team of cops against a team of robbers who are trying to pull off a heist.</p>
<p>A QA tester posted this on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbZxS5WZ_Es">YouTube</a></p>
<p>“I was one of the first employed QA Testers to experience the game and even in the early stages it was hella fun. As of my last experience the vehicles were fully customizable. You could slap on giant off road tires on what looked like a typical 60s muscle car. You also could get covered in mud and even stuck. Though my personal favourite was the land rover style vehicle. It could go anywhere, really fast and could boost plus at the time had a winch. Basically take all the awesome vehicle driving and customization in Mad Max and put it in the game for the vehicle missions.”</p>
<p>“The island design will be super clean. There was talk about licensed music but they already had a lot of music that you would expect to hear in the 70s in south east asia. The main story had four female protagonists and was the main selling point of the game at the time. So I can confirm that it will be four player. Not sure about the eight player but we did have that as an option, we just didn’t have enough people to test it out. When I mean I was one of the first testers, I’m not joking, the team was only four people, a QA Lead, Test Engineer and two testers.”</p>

			<p><strong>Update 07/08/2025:</strong> Avalanche Studios has <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/contraband-update">published a statement to its official website</a>, confirming that Contraband's development has been put on pause while the game's future is reevaluated. </p>



<p>"<em>Over the past several years, Avalanche Studios Group and Xbox Game Studios Publishing have collaborated on Contraband. Active development has now stopped while we evaluate the project's future. We're thankful for the excitement we've seen from the community since we announced and will give an update on what's next as soon as we can</em>."</p>



<p>A report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-07/xbox-drops-work-on-contraband-video-game-after-four-years?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1NDU4ODAzNywiZXhwIjoxNzU1MTkyODM3LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUME1XUVFHUFFRODIwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.6WMtU9k7__2JZ4r17yiM9eVr04tQ9bfixP9FowIaCs4">Bloomberg</a> also calls the game "<em>cancelled</em>" and in a thread on the Game File Substack, Totilo writes about the semantics as to whether it's officially cancelled, and says that "<em>On the Xbox end, it's canceled. They're done with it,</em>" while noting that Avalanche is careful to not call out Contraband as 'canceled.' </p>



<p>Regardless of the semantics, as pointed out in the original article below, Contraband was due to be a very grand project, the kind that it claimed needed support from a larger partner like Xbox and Microsoft. Even though it might not yet be technically correct to call it cancelled, it's probably a safe bet that Contraband will never make it to your console or PC.</p>



<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>



<p>Microsoft has reportedly stopped development on Avalanche Studios co-op game, Contraband. According to a report from <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/breaking-microsoft-stops-development">Stephen Totilo at Game File</a>, development on the open-world co-op title, which was initially <a href="https://wccftech.com/abalanche-studios-contraband-announced-for-pc-xbox-series-xs/">announced in 2021</a>, has been put "<em>on hold</em>" following <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">Microsoft's layoff of 9,000+ employees</a> across the company, with cuts to Xbox's publishing division specifically impacting Contraband's development.</p>



<p>After Contraband was announced in 2021, we heard basically nothing about the game, at least from official channels. There were rumors that it had hit some <a href="https://wccftech.com/contraband-a-ways-off-report-avalanche-shuts-down-multiple-studios/">development struggles and had been delayed</a> into this year, and even those rumors came after<a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-5-xbox-exclusives-before-july-2023/"> speculation that it was supposed to have arrived</a> sometime between 2023 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-is-targeting-2025-contraband-might-launch-this-year-says-leaker/">2024</a>.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Contraband - Official Reveal Trailer 4K | E3 2021" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t5qlGpqHggw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>When Microsoft began announcing the its layoffs from last month, cuts which <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-call-out-microsoft-mass-layoffs-inhumane-disgusting/">ZeniMax employees called "<em>inhumane</em>" and <em>"disgusting</em>,"</a> Totilo points out that Contraband's initial announcement trailer had been set to <a href="https://x.com/DestinLegarie/status/1942272038045122595">'Private' on the official Xbox YouTube channel</a>, which added oxygen to the fire of speculation that it had also been cancelled alongside other projects like <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">Perfect Dark</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">Everwild</a>.</p>



<p>Totilo's report today shows that there are real flames to that fire, though neither Avalanche Studios nor Microsoft have officially commented on the status of Contraband.</p>



<p>Even though Totilo isn't exactly reporting that Contraband has been cancelled, based on how Xbox had no problem leaving behind projects that were based on established series like the aforementioned Perfect Dark reboot, or from its proven first-party teams, like cancelling Rare's Everwild and ZeniMax Online's new MMO that <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-reportedly-loved-playing-zenimax-onlines-new-game-in-march-only-to-cancel-it-in-july/">Phil Spencer reportedly loved so much he couldn't put it down</a>, it feels fruitless to hold out hope for a title that was being made by an external studio on which Xbox was the publisher.</p>



<p>Of course, something could happen where Avalanche is able to buy the publishing rights from Xbox and finish the game solely on their own dime, but that's not exactly a common scenario for a game on the scale of Contraband.</p>



<p>When Contraband was announced, Avalanche Studios' chief executive officer called <a href="https://wccftech.com/avalanche-ceo-it-made-sense-to-choose-xbox-for-contraband-due-to-the-grandness-of-the-project/">Xbox the partner that "<em>made sense</em>" for the project</a>, specifically because of how grand the project was going to be. </p>



<p>"<em>It made a lot of sense to work with Xbox on this because of the grandness of the Contraband project. It's not a concept we would pitch to every publisher</em>."</p>



<p>Totilo adds that there are no more layoffs expected for the Xbox publishing division with Contraband put on hold, and hopefully Avalanche Studios is able to move beyond this project pause without losing any of its team members. We'll update you on this story if/when more information becomes available.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>On Tuesday, an Indiana Fever and Los Angeles Sparks WNBA game was <a href="https://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/45911373/sex-toy-tossed-sparks-court-third-incident-7-days">temporarily disrupted after someone tossed a large green dildo</a> at the players on the court. This is the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=1760105008213278">third such incident</a> of a sex toy being tossed onto a WNBA court during an active game in the last two weeks. And with some betting markets now taking bets on whether or not a dildo will be tossed at WNBA players at future games, it’s very likely this terrible trend will continue, even as the WNBA reportedly looks to ban fans from bringing bags into venues in an effort to prevent this from happening.</p> <p>The first incident of a dildo being thrown onto a <a href="https://kotaku.com/nba-2k-announces-wnba-players-a-river-of-sexism-follow-1837111136">WNBA</a> court happened on July 29 during a match between the Golden State Valkyries and the Atlanta Dream. Like what happened on Tuesday, a neon green dildo was reportedly thrown onto the court. On August 1, a similar incident involving a sex toy happened during a match between the Valkyries and the Chicago Sky. There are also at least two reports via social media of people attempting to toss dildos onto the court at other WNBA games, but these didn’t make it out of the crowd.&nbsp; However, one of these sex toys, also neon green, reportedly thrown during an <a href="https://x.com/osnapitsari/status/1952914027618943453">August 5 WNBA game in New York City</a>, came close to hitting a child. It’s clear this is becoming a “thing” and players and coaches are understandably frustrated and upset about the situation.</p> <p>“I think it’s ridiculous, it’s dumb, it’s stupid,” Sparks coach Lynne Roberts said after the game on Tuesday. “It’s also dangerous, and players’ safety is number one. Respecting the game. All those things. I think it’s really stupid.”</p> <p>On August 1, <a href="https://x.com/OMG_itsizzyb/status/1951462340890861689">New York Liberty&nbsp;forward&nbsp;Isabelle Harrison posted on social media</a>: “ARENA SECURITY?! Hello??! Please do better. It’s not funny. never was funny. Throwing ANYTHING on the court is so dangerous.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.talkbasket.net/201156-wnba-enforces-no-bag-policy-to-stop-dildo-throwers">Polymarket Sports is reporting</a> that the WNBA is enacting a ban on bags at some upcoming games. However, I was <a href="https://sports.yahoo.com/article/no-bag-policy-wnba-games-234957914.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAIkDZKqrCCX828IDt1RKFGShi0R616NjV0DwR8coONtETZz7gAejcUjpqB0mtSlMwCAmHfs7CXFv-TFrRNg-FV226KCC0yhNs9GP1TqjuqoyMicJ-eEuRHINLQHy0fdcLAMbrXBKCut1eoQ3s4WfGaZqDJw2rFQdZM_pprHaYDp1">unable to corroborate this claim</a>, and Polymarket itself might have a vested interest in the dildo tossing as the gambling site is <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/dildo-thrown-at-wnba-game-on-august-6-13/will-a-dildo-be-thrown-onto-the-court-at-a-wnba-game-on-wednesday?tid=1754503557149">now taking bets on whether sex toys will be tossed at WNBA games</a>. Yes, we are living in a timeline where people are betting on whether someone will toss a sex toy at professional female athletes just trying to play basketball. Shit sucks.</p> <p>On August 2, police in College Park, Georgia, arrested 23-year-old Delbert Carver, the man who allegedly tossed the first dildo during the Valkyries/Dream game.&nbsp; According to law enforcement, he <a href="https://www.espn.com/wnba/story/_/id/45901403/wnba-fan-accused-throwing-sex-toy-faces-multiple-charges" target="_blank" rel="noopener">faces counts of disorderly conduct, public indecency, and criminal trespass</a>. In an affidavit, as reported by ESPN, Carver admitted that tossing the dildo onto the court was “supposed to be a joke” and that it was “supposed to go viral.” Sadly, it seems like it has, and copycats are now tossing more green dildos onto WNBA courts.</p> <p>Not only is this dangerous and annoying for players, but throwing sex toys onto the court of a WNBA game is <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a65614990/why-throwing-dildos-wnba-games/">clearly a misogynistic act against these women</a> who dare to be professional athletes. In an era when professional women’s sports are thriving, <a href="https://www.nielsen.com/insights/2023/womens-sports-viewership-on-the-rise/">with high ratings and stars being created</a>, it’s clear some young men, likely fueled by anti-women politics and the horrible online manosphere, feel empowered and even forced to “fight back.” Tossing dildos at women is done to embarrass them and remind them that, according to these shitbags, they are only sex objects who shouldn’t be playing basketball in front of adoring crowds of fans. Hopefully, WNBA security steps things up and we can stop this shit from happening in future games.</p>

      </p></div><div><p><em><a title="Games > Strange Antiquities" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/strange-antiquities">Strange Antiquities</a></em>, the standalone sequel to <em>Strange Horticulture</em>, will launch for <a title="Platforms > Switch [17,447 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,847 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2885870/Strange_Antiquities/" target="_blank">Steam</a> on September 17, publisher <a title="Companies > Iceberg Interactive [29 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/iceberg-interactive">Iceberg Interactive</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Bad Viking" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/bad-viking">Bad Viking</a> announced. <span id="more-983118"></span></p><p>“We have poured a lot of love into Strange Antiquities and we’re very proud of what we have made,” said creators John and Rob Donkins in a press release. “We’ve taken all the lessons we learned from <em>Strange Horticulture</em>, and made something more ambitious, intricate, and with more depth to it. We wanted to make a game in which players feel like real investigators of the occult, poring over manuscripts and reference materials by candlelight while the rain beats down outside. We’ve made a game that trusts our players to piece things together for themselves—to delve into the details, to follow the breadcrumbs and to notice what matters. We’re excited for you to play it and discover this cabinet of curiosities for yourselves.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2885870/Strange_Antiquities/" target="_blank">Steam page</a>:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Become the custodian of a store dealing in occult antiquities. Explore the quaint and gloomy town of Undermere, where strange goings-on and dark mysteries abound. Find and identify arcane artefacts, use your collection to aid the townsfolk with their unusual problems — and remember to pet your cat!</p><p><strong>A Note From the Shopkeeper</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Dear Applicant,</p><p>I am pleased to offer you the role of Apprentice Thaumaturge at Strange Antiquities.</p><p>You show promise—a sharp mind and a strong stomach—exactly what this work demands. I need you to run the shop while I attend to other pressing matters. You will need a keen eye for detail as you provide the townsfolk of Undermere with occult objects for their arcane needs.</p><p>Undermere might seem unassuming at first—a serene little town on the edge of a grand lake. But it also sits at the edge of our world and the world beyond—and it falls on us to preserve reality’s frayed edge.</p><p>Permit me now to outline your duties—you’ll need to be up to speed from day one.</p><p><strong>On Your Duties in the Shop (Gameplay Mechanics)</strong></p><p>Every day, you will welcome new customers into the cosy, candle-lit interior of the shop. Their needs are unpredictable and often alarming, but never dull!</p><ul><li><strong>Study and Identify</strong> – Examine, identify and catalogue strange artefacts. Observation, deduction, and careful reference to our collection of illustrated tomes will serve you well. Mistakes can be… costly.</li><li><strong>Help… Or Hinder</strong> – When dealing with powerful items, your choices matter. Will you help someone with their problem, or curse them with a horrid affliction? In a small town like this, people remember your misdeeds.</li><li><strong>Explore and Discover</strong> – From time to time, you will have to leave the safety of the shop. Whether investigating rumors or retrieving artefacts, my well-loved hand-drawn maps will guide you to where you need to go.</li><li><strong>Solve and Uncover</strong> – Your day-to-day might already feel like a puzzle, but this store holds many more. Few know how old this building is, and fewer still know what secrets lie within its walls.</li><li><strong>Tending the Familiar</strong> – And, of course, <a title="Companies > Jupiter Corporation [31 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/jupiter-corporation">Jupiter</a>, the shop’s cat, demands daily affection. In return for his company, please oblige him with the occasional scratch behind the ears.</li></ul><p><strong>About My Absence (Narrative and Setting)</strong></p><p>These ravens are an omen. There is a sickness in this town and I intend to investigate it.</p><p>Barton Potter told me that his bad eye has been aching again. That can’t be a good sign. And a creeping dark has set up in Jack Hungerford’s house. I have business in Ravenglass but I will consult with the occult scholar, Verona Green, before I leave.</p><p>There are always forces at play that would see our beloved Undermere unmade. We stand between them and the threshold. If events take a turn, you may be called upon to take a stand.</p><p><strong>In Conclusion</strong></p><p>This shop is my life’s work. And, for the most part, it has been good to me. May it now offer you equal parts reward and mystery! But remember: some curiosities are best left untouched, and some visitors are not what they seem.</p><p>I look forward to your arrival.</p><p>Yours,<br>Eli White<br>Thaumaturge &amp; Proprietor<br>Strange Antiquities, Undermere<br>Purveyors of the Arcane Since 1683</p><p><strong>A Note from the Developers</strong></p><p>We are two brothers from the United Kingdom who have been making games together for over a decade. In 2022, we released our occult puzzle game <em>Strange Horticulture</em>, and the response has been incredible; from amazing reviews and award nominations to appearing in numerous best-of-the-year lists. Most importantly, it has been a joy to read the kind words left by so many of our players on Steam, where we are still rated Overwhelmingly Positive after close to 12,000 reviews!</p><p><em>Strange Antiquities</em> is not a sequel, not a direct one, at least. You’ll see some familiar faces, and maybe some plants will pop up, but it’s a brand new story. If you have a fondness for <em>Strange Horticulture</em> and the dark, but welcoming world we’ve created, know that you’ll feel right at home.</p><p>We want to thank everyone who has played <em>Strange Horticulture</em>, left us a review, told their friends, or supported the game in any way. It has been an amazing journey and we can’t wait to share the next chapter with you.</p><p>Many thanks,<br>Rob and John</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Strange Antiquities - Date Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ylk4JVnt2HA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/strange-antiquities-launches-september-17-for-switch-pc]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wait-are-we-not-all-keeping-our-pcs-on-top-of-our-desks.1264905/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Look, I’m on the record as <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-dont-understand-my-pc-which-i-built" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not being that great at being a PC owner</a>, but there is one thing I thought I knew: you keep your PC tower on top of your desk. This is for a variety of very normal and sensible reasons that I thought we all agreed to, but apparently not.</p><p>This question, which I thought firmly settled, was re-opened last night when Luke <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lukeplunkett.com/post/3lvrmpaweqc2x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted to Bluesky</a> that he’d gotten a new PC (he gets them pre-built, unlike me, an <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-bought-the-wrong-graphics-card-and-i-am-full-of-regret" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">idiot</a>). Aftermath pal and <a href="https://aftermath.site/indulge-us-behind-the-scenes-of-aftermaths-branding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">logo designer</a> Andrew Elmore <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/elmore.zone/post/3lvrqoprxmk2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">replied</a> to praise Luke for “putting that sumbitch down under the desk where it belongs.”</p><p>But <em>does</em> it belong there? I have kept my PC on top of my desk since Kotaku ran an article in <a href="https://kotaku.com/console-repairmen-explain-why-cockroaches-love-ps4s-1794393470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2018</a> about roaches getting into PS4s. “Warm, in an enclosed space and close to the floor, PS4s are great roach nesting grounds,” the article reads.</p><p>What else is warm and close to the floor? My PC tower, which is full of little holes and crannies perfect for roaches to get inside. I live in New York City, in an apartment above a bar; I wouldn’t say I have ever actively had a roach <em>problem</em>, but I definitely see those horrible giant ones from time to time, and I have occasional bursts of little roach activity when the weather changes, alongside the infrequent mouse. One of the worst realizations I had when I started living alone was that any pest in my apartment is <em>always</em> my problem, even if it goes into another room; it doesn't automatically become a roommate's problem once I can't see it anymore, because <em>I </em>own all the rooms. This makes me more anxious about pests than I was when I had roommates to come rescue me from them, so I take extra precautions, like keeping my PC on my desktop. I don’t want to deal with roaches or mice in my PC, and the easiest way to not have to deal with that horrible possibility is to keep it out of their reach.</p><p>Plus, the desk is cleaner than the floor! The floor is where all the dust and dirt goes to live, and where it could easily be sucked or swept into my PC tower. When my PC lives on my desk, I don’t have to worry about floor shit getting inside it. I also don’t have to worry about accidentally kicking or sweeping or vacuuming it when I clean, inadvertently damaging its many expensive, precariously-installed parts.</p><p>Of course, the desk isn’t the most efficient place for my PC to be. I’ll admit it takes up a lot of space. Especially now that I have a <a href="https://aftermath.site/iem-recommendation-hardware-regret" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">giant microphone</a> and its attendant gadgets, real estate is tight. I keep my tower on the same side as my mouse because it’s closest to an available outlet, so I do occasionally butt up against it when I’m playing games. But it also helps me manage space; I currently keep my ring light and my controller on top of it, and I sometimes put things I don’t want to lose up there too, like the case for my running headphones. Its top can serve as extra desk space, to offset the space it takes up.</p><p>Are you heathens keeping your PCs on the floor? Are your houses just cleaner or less pest-prone than mine? Are you better equipped to stave off the sudden burst of anxiety that something might get in there? I thought we were in agreement on this. What the hell, guys?</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/merge-maestro-addictive-roguelite-ios-puzzle-game"><h3>Oh No, Merge Maestro Is Going To Be A Problem</h3></a><p>Merge Maestro is an addictive, deck builder that's easy to pick up and surprisingly complex.

<header><section>
<p>And is that a mouse mode tease?</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure><a title="Mina the Hollower" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/78b01dc5b84de/mina-the-hollower.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Yacht Club Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yacht Club Games kicked off today's Indie World showcase strongly by announcing that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a> is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/mina-the-hollower-yacht-clubs-retro-zelda-inspired-adventure-scores-switch-2-release-date">coming to both Switch 1 and Switch 2 on 31st October 2025</a>. And you might be wondering, <em>'what does a Switch 2 version of a pixel art game entail?'</em> Well, let us — and the developer — inform you.</p>
<p>In a blog post on <a href="https://www.yachtclubgames.com/blog/mina-the-hollower-launches-on-nintendo-switch-1-2-on-oct-31-play-the-demo-now-/">Yacht Club Games' website</a>, the team confirmed that the Switch 2 version of the game supports 120fps, an extremely tasty prospect for those with the new console. You can also spy 120hz and HDR output <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/mina-the-hollower-switch-2/">at the bottom of the eShop page</a>. And hey, there's a native Switch 2 demo, so that's worth checking out.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://youtu.be/Em_IP-6snrs?si=cpGJ6X0nKTk6ngyn">our friends over at GVG have a comparison video</a> of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mina_the_hollower">Switch 1</a>'s 60fps release and the Switch 2's 120. Have a watch of it below.</p>

<p>And, since Mina the Hollower is all about a mouse, it would make sense to have <em>some</em> kind of mouse compatibility, right? Well, fear not, as Yacht Club Games seems to be teasing <em>something</em>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In Mina the Hollower, you ARE the mouse! But we heard that if you turn your Joy-Con 2 on its side while playing and move it around, <em>something</em> may happen.."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well, well, well... Yacht Club Games is the Big Cheese of the retro throwback, so we expect great things, especially given that this one's clearly inspired by the top-down Game Boy Color games of the early '90s.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Has Beaten Almost Every Call of Duty Game Ever Made on Twitch]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-beaten-almost-every-cod-game-twitch/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-has-beaten-almost-every-call-of-duty-game-ever-made-on-twitch.1264884/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Battlefield 6 beta commenced earlier today, and it has been skyrocketing all day in social and streaming circles. The game has become one of the most highly anticipated first-person shooters to emerge in several years, and it’s looking like a strong turning point for a series that has found itself on rocky ground for almost a decade.</p>



<p>As the beta unravels, scores of fans are taking to Twitch and YouTube to watch streams as they await the <strong>open portion </strong>of the beta to kick off. As I write this, almost 850,000 people are watching the beta on <strong>Twitch alone</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-huge-numbers">Huge Numbers</h2>



<p>Battlefield 6 is being played by some of the most prolific streamers in the world right now, and they’re pulling in gargantuan numbers. At the time of publishing, the Battlefield 6 beta had 830,000 live viewers, which is something of a stunning record for the series.</p>



<p>Not only is it the most-watched Battlefield game ever released (not that it’s released yet), but it’s also effortlessly beating the peak viewership count for <strong>every major Call of Duty game ever</strong>, bar Call of Duty: Warzone.</p>



<p>Only the battle royale game stands between Battlefield 6 and total dominance.</p>



<p>For reference, here’s the ranking for peak viewer counts on Twitch:</p>



<ul>
<li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III – 444,866</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 – 481,586</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War – 705,050</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II – 751,937</li>



<li><strong>Battlefield 6 – 844,723</strong></li>



<li>Call of Duty: Warzone – 1,613,626</li>
</ul>



<p>As the weekend approaches, could we see Battlefield 6 threaten Warzone’s record?</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that Battlefield 6’s highest peak has also topped Rainbow Six Siege (583,166), Overwatch (634,296), Escape from Tarkov (566,684), and PUBG (597,663).</p>



<p>This is one heck of a high-performing game, and we’re on the first day of the beta. The sky might just be the limit for Battlefield 6.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Madden 26 is out now for Deluxe Edition owners, but Xbox users are having issues getting access to the game. </p>



<p>A quick search on social media—or a visit to my DMs—shows a number of players don’t have access to the game they purchased if they got it as part of the EA Sports MVP Bundle that included both Madden 26 and College Football 26. </p>



<p>The specific issue is that the game is showing as unowned. </p>



<p><strong>“For our Xbox MVP Bundle owners, we’re aware of an issue some are experiencing where they’re unable to access the game,” </strong>the <a href="https://x.com/MaddenNFLDirect/status/1953495214695338229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Madden team posted</a>. <strong>“We’re working closely with Microsoft and plan to resolve this as soon as possible.”</strong></p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>For our Xbox MVP Bundle owners, we’re aware of an issue some are experiencing where they’re unable to access the game.</p><p>We’re working closely with Microsoft and plan to resolve this as soon as possible.</p><p>Updates will be threaded below as needed!</p></div>— MaddenNFLDirect (@MaddenNFLDirect) <a href="https://twitter.com/MaddenNFLDirect/status/1953495214695338229?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>One work around is that if you have EA Play, you can download the 10-hour trial. After that download completes, it <em>should </em>show that you own the full game and you’ll be all set. Another possible workaround is to do a hard reset of your console. Press and hold the power button down for at least 10 seconds. After it’s off, wait a few seconds before turning it back on.</p>

<p>If you don’t have EA Play or the workarounds don’t work, you’ll have to simply wait for an update from EA and Microsoft on the matter.</p>



<p>Madden 26 is also available for PlayStation 5, PC, and Nintendo Switch 2. Those who bought the Standard Edition of the game have to wait until August 14 to play.</p>



<p>Have you had any issues accessing Madden 26 on Xbox or other consoles? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has been out for over two months now, which means players have had ample time to puzzle over and tease out every morsel of its lore. But there's still one ultra-rare item in the game that most players have probably never seen before, but which some in the community believe still holds an enormous secret: the Cord End.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you play Nightreign and, like me, had no idea what this even was until just now, here's the rundown: the Cord End is a legendary consumable item that only appears in big and small churches in Nightreign from breaking boxes. Its drop percentage is ridiculously low - just 0.035% - meaning most players will likely never even run into it. Its listed use is cryptic: "Gain entry somewhere." If you don't know where that somewhere is, the item is totally useless to you.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But for those in the know (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/How_to_Use_Cord_End_in_Nightreign_for_Secret_Door">or those following our handy guide</a>), it's not too hard to find the secret door it opens. Hidden in a cliff wall in a ravine at the center of the map, there's a sealed entrance that only opens if you have the Cord End on hand. Inside is a strange statue of a girl, and three Sacrificial Twigs, talismans that allow the wielder to die exactly one time without losing runes or levels. It's an interesting reward, to be sure, but admittedly a little underwhelming given the ridiculous rarity of the Cord End required to get them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, granted, it's likely at least part of the Cord End's mystery is in adding lore details to Elden Ring Nightreign via its description and the statue of the girl in the chamber it opens. We won't cover that here, as the meaning behind it is pretty deep into endgame spoiler territory for Nightreign, but <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9FXm1IEwHY" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lore YouTuber VaatiVidya</a> has a great breakdown of what the Cord End is from a lore perspective and why it matters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that all said, the lack of real mechanical payoff for such a rare find has players speculating that there's something more to this secret door. For the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1l7j5m9/follow_up_to_my_sacrificial_twig_theory/?share_id=LXYt4Qg7gPNfE7Cg27Cpo&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">last two months</a>, the community has been testing out theories around the Cord End and the Sacrificial Twigs. With a lack of any new or recent clues, the secret hunting had largely slowed down, but a cryptic post on the Nightreign subreddit recently fired up everyone's curiosity again, inspiring people to float new theories about how to do... something... with those twigs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest barrier to finding anything is the sheer rarity of the Cord End. Some players are reporting <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1mft3jp/after_exactly_222_hours_got_my_first_cord/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seeing their first one</a> after hundreds of hours of play. So anyone who wants to test theories has to get extremely lucky in actually getting a Cord End to begin with, and then also getting the exact perfect other circumstances they're looking for (specific bosses, certain locations appearing, certain characters in the party, and so forth) to test out whatever it is they want to test. So while it's unlikely that there's anything new to discover regarding the Cord End at this stage, there's at least a whisper of possibility in the fact that so few people are in a position to make that discovery to begin with.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is it a secret? Is it merely lore? Is it something we'll be able to unlock in a future DLC, as some have theorized? Who knows! But what's genuinely cool here is that an ultra rare item is still sparking this level of curiosity and discussion and mystery in the community months after the game's release. Whether there's anything deeper to the Cord End or not, its enticing rarity is sufficient to get me, at least, fired up... if I can ever get one to drop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We gave Elden Ring Nightreign a 7/10, saying that "when Elden Ring Nightreign is played exactly as it was designed to be played, it’s one of the finest examples of a three-player co-op game around – but that's harder to do than it should be, and playing solo is poorly balanced."
