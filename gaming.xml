		<p>How do you add a new story to a sweeping RPG? That’s the tricky conundrum that faced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/31/sea-of-stars-review-a-love-letter-to-jrpgs-of-the-past/">Sea of Stars</a> developer Sabotage Studio. Some games choose to continue the story, bolting it onto the back of the game and giving you new hyper powerful abilities at the same time, or it’s joined on at the side and has to face the tricky balancing act of creating new progression that doesn’t impact too heavily on the tail end of the main story. Sea of Stars: Throes of the Watchmaker straddles this divide, coming as both a post-game adventure and branching off to explore a separate, miniaturised clockwork world.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sea of Stars: Throes of the Watchmaker DLC | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgFi2jXwzVI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That’s right, we’re getting all Honey, Shrunk the Kids for this one. Answering the call for help from the crew of The Verspertine, and with Keenathan in a particular kind of existential crisis, the one person who can help them solve Keenathan’s troubles seems to be the Watchmaker. Once you arrive at her Clockwork Castle, she agrees to help, but only if you help her first to resolve a fearful state of affairs in the miniature world of Horloge that she created.</p>


<p>You see, this charming little world, filled with clockwork denizens, has been twisted and corrupted, brought under the power of an evil twin to the Watchmaker, known as The Puppeteer, making her fearful ever to return. It’s up to Valere and Zale to shrink themselves down and head into this clockwork circus world of Horloge to free it from The Puppeteer’s rule.</p>
<p>It doesn’t take long to run into The Puppeteer and her comedic clown duo of goons, Pif &amp; Pouf, doing battle and discovering, not only that the Solstice Warrior abilities of Valere and Zale have next to no power here, but also that this power can simply be whisked away from them and transformed into evil twins of themselves. It takes the Artificer’s new beam abilities to release everyone from their imprisonment, becoming a new playable character and permanent battle companion in the process, and it takes a fellow prisoner to explain that Valere and Zale will need to lean in and play some new circus-like roles in order to succeed.</p>


<p>Valere becomes an acrobat and Zale a juggler, with Arty bringing their own spin on circus acts alongside. Zale’s juggling attacks deal fire damage with a side helping of “bonk”, which is represented by a rubber mallet symbol, while Valere’s bonk comes with a side of magic, and Arty has beam attacks. Of course, there’s also all of the special abilities and combo attacks, and it’s here that the circus flair really comes to the fore. Valere launches herself into the sky on a pole vault, Zale juggles flaming balls off enemy faces, Arty bounces cannon balls or Valere and Zale of a trampoline, and there’s all the restorative properties of a cream pie to the face if you want Zale to heal an ally… or himself, I guess.</p>
<p>There’s the same rhythm to the turn-based combat here, where timing button presses increases the damage of an attack or extends the move for successive hits. At the same time, there’s a strategic layer of attacking certain enemies that have damage type ‘locks’ that can knock them out of turn order if you hit them with the right damage types enough times.</p>
<p>As a post-game addition, this is intended to be more challenging than the base game, making the importance of timing hits, blocks and breaking enemy locks all the more important. However, you do still have the Relics system that can tweak and modify the difficulty and certain other game elements. This can give you additional health, restore HP after battle instead and/or after levelling up (which is on by default), add a timing success indicator, and more. I do, as someone that’s not played an awful lot of the main game, wish that timing indicators were more deeply ingrained, perhaps giving a measure of whether you’re early, late or on time, but I can appreciate the game not wanting to hold your hand too much.</p>

<p>The clockwork world is quite delightfully realised by Sabotage Studio, really leaning in on this being a miniaturised land. All of the denizens have a wind-up key spinning from their backs, the town of Horloge is filled with circus tents that have a handful of circus minigames in them –&nbsp;such as needing to pole vault through large hoops against the clock –&nbsp;and as you explore you now gather restorative items from little milk tubs and cobs of corn that become popcorn.</p>
<p>There’s the same style of free traversal through the maze-like environments as well, clambering up ledges and ladders, grappling and leaping across gaps, and following paths that wrap around, through and under other parts of the scenery. It makes finding secrets and solving environmental puzzles satisfying and engaging.</p>

<p>And all that care and attention paid once more to the pixel art world is complimented by a bunch of catchy bops from Sabotage’s composer Eric W. Brown and guest composer Yasunori Mitsuda, and more gorgeously animated cinematics – Sabotage say these had the same budget as the main game.</p>
<p>Honestly, all of this could easily have been paid DLC, but for the fact that this was promised as a stretch goal from Sea of Stars’ original crowdfunding campaign. That it is a free addition to the game, coming after major updates that added 3-player co-op (which is playable throughout this DLC), overhauled combat and more, just makes it all the more special.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clash-of-clans-tv-show-in-the-works-for-some-reason.1193979/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clash-of-clans-tv-show<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Netflix has announced that a&nbsp;<em>Clash of Clans</em> TV&nbsp;show is in the works, so now you have to reckon with that being a thing in the real world as much as I do. Sorry about that.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/netflix/status/1924804801616871741" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Netflix says that the "world" of&nbsp;<em>Clash of Clans&nbsp;</em>is "coming to life as an animated series on Netflix", although the streaming giant doesn't provide any kind of time frame for the series' arrival, nor does it specify what the story will be about.</p>

<p>However, if the mobile game is anything to go by, the series will probably revolve around chiefs trying to defend their village against attacks from other clans. I'd assume there will be a hefty dollop of self-referentiality and pop-culture gags, too, for such is the way these things often go.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/clash-of-clans-netflix-series-characters.jpg?itok=acCTnHEP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/clash-of-clans-netflix-series-characters.jpg?itok=Uq5lMiI4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Clash of Clans&nbsp;</em>is getting a streaming series courtesy of Netflix.</figcaption></figure><p>In the (admittedly rather amusing) trailer announcing the&nbsp;<em>Clash of Clans&nbsp;</em>series on Netflix, Supercell staffers describe how there's at least one comment asking for a&nbsp;<em>Clash of Clans&nbsp;</em>show under every video made about the game by the studio "since 2012".</p>

<p>The video's description merely promises that the&nbsp;<em>Clash of Clans&nbsp;</em>show will star "your favorite moustachioed Barbarian and his high-pitched, hog-riding friends", so I guess if you were worried the show wouldn't be true to the game, you can put those worries to rest.</p>

<p>It sounds like we're going to have to wait quite a while for more information about the&nbsp;<em>Clash of Clans&nbsp;</em>series, so for now, you can content yourself with Supercell's announcement trailer. Even I, swinging brick of a heart and all, can admit it's quite funny.</p>




<p><em>Clash of Clans&nbsp;</em>will follow in the footsteps of other video games to get animated Netflix adaptations, including the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/netflix-devil-may-cry-renewed-second-season" rel="nofollow"><em>Devil May Cry</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cyberpunk-edgerunners-is-anime-set-in-cyberpunk-universe" rel="nofollow"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a>, among others.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what kind of direction Netflix is going in with the show, as well as when we can expect it to launch. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Samsung was competing with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. to secure the Nintendo contract, and the Korean company will reportedly produce a customized Nvidia chip for the Switch 2. Samsung has worked with Nintendo in the past to supply it with memory chips and displays, and the company can reportedly ramp up production further if necessary. Sources told Bloomberg that Samsung is also pushing for OLED panels to be used for a potential Switch 2 hardware refresh in the future.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 – Official System Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Switch 2 preorders have sold out at several retailers across the globe, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-warns-switch-2-lottery-will-leave-significant-numbers-of-fans-disappointed-in-japan/1100-6531049/">Nintendo recently apologized for being unable to meet demand in Japan</a> through its official store. The company received 2.2 million applications to purchase the console, but it warned customers that a "significant" number of them will not be selected as winners of the My Nintendo Store lottery sale.</p><p>In the US, Switch 2 preorders officially opened up on April 24 after weeks of uncertainty regarding tariffs. While the price of the console hasn't gone up yet--$450 for the base model, $500 for the bundle that includes Mario Kart World--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-first-party-accessories-will-be-more-expensive-than-originally-announced/1100-6530965/">first-party accessory prices have increased</a>. The Switch 2 will feature several hardware upgrades when compared to its predecessor, and there'll be a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/">strong selection of third-party games available on launch day</a>.</p>

                <p>Former Battlefield producer David Goldfarb has reacted to a newly emerged clip of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6 </a>gameplay footage, saying it's giving off Bad Company 2 vibes. For what it's worth, the game isn't necessarily called Battlefield 6, but that's what we're using until EA gives it an official title.</p><p>"Oh the BC2 vibes this is giving me," Goldfarb <a href="https://x.com/locust9/status/1924703470713516520" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a>, adding that the footage (below) is giving him flashbacks to the first time DICE playtested Bad Company 2's much-loved <a href="https://battlefield.fandom.com/wiki/Arica_Harbor" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arica Harbor map. </a></p><p>Goldfarb added that the player movement in the leaked Battlefield 6 clip looks "a little weird," adding that the character design <a href="https://x.com/locust9/status/1924705092432785470" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"seems very generic." </a> The gameplay footage shows a player fighting through buildings and squaring off against a tank down on the ground that blows away their cover. It's trademark Battlefield stuff.</p><p>Goldfarb left DICE in 2012 after working on Mirror's Edge, Battlefield: Bad Company 1 + 2, and Battlefield 3. He then moved to Overkill to become the game director for Payday 2. He is now the studio creative director and CCO at the Funcom-owned developer The Outsiders.</p><p>The footage stems from the Battlefield Labs testing program, so what we're seeing is unfinished and was never meant to be seen publicly anyway since the Labs tests forbid people from sharing footage. Despite that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-gets-landing-roll-but-it-might-give-you-motion-sickness/1100-6531523/" data-ref-id="1100-6531523">numerous gameplay videos from the Labs program have emerged over the weeks and months.</a> You can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">sign up for Battlefield Labs</a> to give yourself a chance to get into a future test.</p><p>EA will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-be-fully-revealed-this-summer-launching-by-march-2026/1100-6531349/" data-ref-id="1100-6531349">officially unveil the new Battlefield game this summer</a>.

However, it’s clear season two will leave us with a lot of story left when it’s over. While many fans predicted a third season, which has already been greenlit, could finish the story, showrunner Craig Mazin alludes to needing a fourth season to wrap up the events of The Last of Us Part II.</p><p>In a new interview with <a href="https://collider.com/the-last-of-us-series-length-season-3-showrunner-craig-mazin/"><em>Collider</em></a>, Mazin explains, “there’s no way to complete this narrative in a third season” when asked about a theoretical fourth season.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QtmC_0dTaKk"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QtmC_0dTaKk" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p><span><strong>Spoilers For Season Two Of HBO's The Last Of Us</strong></span></p><hr><p>“I think there’s a decent chance Season 3 will be longer than Season 2, just because the manner of that narrative and the opportunities it affords us are a little different,” Mazin, who is also a director and writer on the show, told <em>Collider</em>. “The thing about Joel’s death is that it’s so impactful. It’s such a narrative nuclear bomb that it’s hard to wander away from it. We can’t really take a break and move off to the side and do a Bill and Frank story.</p><p>“I’m not sure that will be necessarily true for Season 3. I think we’ll have a little more room there. But certainly, there’s no way to complete this narrative in a third season. Hopefully, we’ll earn our keep enough to come back and finish it in a fourth. That’s the likely outcome.”</p><p>Though it seems like Mazin and the team behind the show are still waiting to see if a fourth season will be greenlit, which likely depends on the reception of season three, it’s clear he believes a fourth season is needed to finish the story of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii/the-last-of-us-part-ii-review-a-perfect-circle">The Last of Us Part II</a>. It also sounds like we can expect a Bill and Frank-style episode in season three.</p><p>Regardless, this theoretical fourth season is years away.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Arrowhead Game Studios and Sony have released another new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>update, and this one is bringing the fight straight into the heart of managed democracy, so prepare to defend your home from filthy alien invaders.</p>

<p>This update comes hot on the heels of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-update-illuminate-weapon-customization" rel="nofollow">another patch last week</a>, which introduced new Illuminate enemies for you to take on, as well as a weapon customization system to give you somewhere to spend your Requisition resource.</p>

<p>In the Heart of Democracy update, however, the Illuminate are taking the fight to Super Earth, so it's up to you to head back to your home planet and defend "the towering skyscrapers and crowded streets" of your home turf.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update-super-earth.jpg?itok=ivKOdluV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update-super-earth.jpg?itok=rv-p4q08 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s Heart of Democracy update tasks you with battling your enemies on Super Earth.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll be fighting inside the city biomes of Super Earth, battling Illuminate foes as they "rain down destruction all around you". Arrowhead says you'll be tussling with the Illuminate over control of certain areas, "gaining and losing control quickly".</p>

<p>As you fight, you'll meet squads of Super Earth troops, who can either battle Illuminate by themselves or join you to do battle against your alien foes. You can also activate Planetary Defense Cannons to "take down the Illuminate fleet in a grand show of power".</p>

<p>Civilians will also be roaming the streets of Super Earth's cities, and it's up to you to keep them safe. After all, friendly fire is very much not the Super Earth way, nor is it the way of managed democracy.</p>




<p>Elsewhere in<i>&nbsp;Helldivers 2&nbsp;</i>news, the game's new <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-masters-of-ceremony-warbond" rel="nofollow">Masters of Ceremony Warbond</a> went live last week, giving you access to new gear on which to spend your Super Credits.</p>

<p>If you'd like to take the fight away from Super Earth and onto the tabletop, you'll be pleased to know that a board game adaptation of&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/helldivers-2-board-game-fully-funded-in-12-minutes-on-gamefound" rel="nofollow">fully crowdfunded in a staggering 12 minutes</a> last month as well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/tales-of-seikyu-preview-cute-yokai-farming-fun<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the hardest things to nail in games is worldbuilding, especially in a farming sim, and <em>Tales of Seikyu</em> does it so well that the bugs that crop up are hardly noticeable. The Early Access game is full of potential, and the roughly one-month in-game content is as gorgeous and vibrant as developer ACE Entertainment promised.</p>

<p><em>Tales of Seikyu</em> begins with the main character and their sister, Kon, moving to the town of Seikyu. The siblings are fox yokai, and Seikyu was founded by their ancestors to be a haven for yokai of all kinds.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-seikyu-player-and-kon.jpg?itok=aGCgLoAA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-seikyu-player-and-kon.jpg?itok=ZwDlOWfP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The player and Kon first appear sleeping, which is honestly a vibe.</figcaption></figure><p>However, now the fox clan has almost completely disappeared, including the player and Kon’s parents. The last note they have from their parents is to travel to Seikyu, where they’ll uncover secrets and hopefully find the last of the fox clan.</p>

<p>The Early Access launch of <em>Tales of Seikyu</em> only dives into the game’s first chapter, where Kon and the player learn the very beginning of the story and mingle with the town of Seikyu.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-seikyu-harbor.jpg?itok=AoyoOmDY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-seikyu-harbor.jpg?itok=I8jlQNWz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>welcomes you on its beautiful harbor.</figcaption></figure><h2>Welcome to Seikyu, Home to All Yokai</h2>

<p>Seikyu itself somehow feels natural. Despite being filled with yokai characters, the town feels like a living, breathing town that has its own schedule regardless of the player. This is something that even the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="81cf7c96-4454-465b-950b-1d47c5873d28" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/how-stardew-valley-could-have-impacted-story-of-seasons" rel="nofollow">most popular farming/life sims</a> struggle to do, and <em>Tales of Seikyu</em> nails it from the start.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It also felt relaxing to play. Most games in the genre create a sense of urgency in terms of profit and optimizing how your time is spent, and <em>Tales of Seikyu</em> didn’t create that rushed pace. Instead, I felt no remorse for spending my time however I wanted – there was no rush, a hard thing to manufacture.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-seikyu-main-square.jpg?itok=s3UpPpwo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-seikyu-main-square.jpg?itok=eSs0Lcrm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>conveniently puts all of the shops close together.</figcaption></figure><p>There’s currently about one season’s worth of content to play through, with Spring being the only season with a festival. However, the Carp Festival is incredible, and – dare I say – one of the best festivals I’ve seen in the genre.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Carp Festival has two mini-games for players to enjoy. The first is an egg hunt, which isn’t too special (though it is incredibly well-done). The second is a game where players are flying with carp, collecting different symbols in the air that flow with the beat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The graphics and music were beautiful, matching the rest of <em>Tales of Seikyu</em>. In general, the game is gorgeous. While there are a few stutters in performance, I was able to play with Medium settings on a ROG Ally X and High settings on my PC. Considering it’s in early access, these types of stutters were expected.</p>

<p>The characters are as gorgeous as they are well-written. The character portraits are gorgeous and fun, and they capture the characters’ personalities well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Getting to know the characters was a pleasant surprise, and spending time with them was more fun than I expected. <em>Tales of Seikyu</em> has a unique system that lets players spend time with characters as they level up their skills.</p>

<p>It combined the two gameplay loops in a way that I haven’t seen in other farming sims, and it was refreshing and made the world feel even more alive.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-seikyu-yoni.jpg?itok=IIvzbKIu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-seikyu-yoni.jpg?itok=2CR3ZmVK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The characters in&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu</em>&nbsp;have adorable models and portraits.</figcaption></figure><h2>Combat in Tales of Seikyu Is Rewarding</h2>

<p>The combat was also integrated with the other systems in the game. At the Early Access release, there’s one main dungeon where players will fight. These are broken up into 40 different rooms, and players will need to either beat the enemies or solve light puzzles to get through.</p>

<p>There’s a variety of weapons that sort of play differently, though I didn’t notice much of a difference between them. The stats of the weapon determined which I used – the more damage, the better.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, getting closer to one character in particular opens up the ability to buy weapons. This feels rewarding and, again, very natural.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There are two main bosses currently in&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu</em>, and both of them were a challenge (though I did get the second boss stuck in a hole and cheesed the fight). Between them and several of the tanky enemies, combat felt pretty rewarding.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-seikyu-boar-farming.jpg?itok=tk3MtxB9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-seikyu-boar-farming.jpg?itok=jmmICWEl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Farming in&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>is more interesting when you can take on different yokai forms.</figcaption></figure><p>Players also learn about different yokai forms in the dungeon, and these yokai forms are helpful in both combat and farming. For example, who needs a boring watering can when you can transform into a slime and quickly water everything?</p>

<h2>Early Access Bugs</h2>

<p>While there are endless positives, it’s worth noting the bugs. Every time I wanted to buy something from any shop, I had to save and reload the game. This applied to every shop around town, which was frustrating until I realized the quick workaround.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other bugs included falling through the map (though I got lucky and was pulled out by events each time) and clothes not fitting the female main character correctly. Though, to be honest, the skirts that didn't fit just looked like a skirt with slits in it, so it wasn't distracting, either.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-seikyu-yui-bug.jpg?itok=trqxNDLL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-seikyu-yui-bug.jpg?itok=H3kiUzzz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A common bug in&nbsp;<em>Tales of Seikyu&nbsp;</em>is characters looking the wrong way when talking to you, like here.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Tales of Seikyu</em> is in Early Access. These bugs are expected to an extent, and nothing was so bad that it was unplayable. In fact, some of them were funny. Every time I went to bed, my player jumped at the same time (the A input being both jump and interact). And let’s be honest, who doesn’t like hopping into bed at the end of a long day?</p>

<h2><em>Tales of Seikyu</em> | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Overall, <em>Tales of Seikyu</em> is an enjoyable experience, and one that I can’t wait to explore more as content is released. While there are a few things to iron out in terms of bugs, it manages to do what even the biggest farming sim names can’t with worldbuilding and interconnected gameplay systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With games like <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b0667482-769b-4371-a186-298d48873c36" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/fields-of-mistria-review-next-best-cozy-farming-sim" rel="nofollow">Fields of Mistria</a> releasing in the genre as well, it's clear that the genre is making a return to the basics and completely polishing them.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/daggerheart-gm-tools-high-level-play-and-miniature-discussion-with-designers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the release of <em>Daggerheart</em>, many fans are opening up their core rulebooks, learning how to teach their players to roll up characters, and beginning to craft a variety of adventures in the many Campaign Frames. Ahead of the<em> Daggerheart Core Rulebook </em>release, we got to talk with Lead Designers Spenser Starke and Rowan Hall about their ethos behind designing Environments and Adversaries and how they hope to support high-level play.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you want to learn more about <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="599a4c8d-e714-4b90-8aba-04105d1db5b5" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/daggerheart-environments-seek-to-supply-gms-with-easy-to-insert-challenges-and" rel="nofollow">Environments in </a><em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="599a4c8d-e714-4b90-8aba-04105d1db5b5" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/daggerheart-environments-seek-to-supply-gms-with-easy-to-insert-challenges-and" rel="nofollow">Daggerheart</a> </em>be sure to check out our exclusive reveal of some Environments and conversation about how to implement them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Daggerheart </em>has free-flowing combat, character builds with player-created experiences, and an emphasis on the adventure and narrative while trying to make sure mechanics don't get in the way. For a game that seems to lean into roleplay, I was intrigued to learn more about the tools that DMs would be offered.</p>

<h2>How <em>Daggerheart </em>Helps You Build Adversaries And Encounters</h2>

<p>"One of my favorite sections in the book is where we go through how we build different adversary types and why we make the choices that we do," Hall explained "Hopefully, it feels like a conversation with the designers. The goal there was to make it as approachable as possible with as many examples as possible so people can refer to it almost like a recipe book."</p>

<p>While the design of an Environment or Adversary can begin with the prompts and discussions with the designers, there's also careful math behind the balance of the game. Starke walked me through the process.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-tier-1-adversary.jpg?itok=Qa1SALf9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-tier-1-adversary.jpg?itok=QtsokSSQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In this example, Starke discussed building a Brawler adversary type and the questions that would prompt "Why do we want a Brawler? What's the whole reason why we're making the Brawler? Why wouldn't I want a Minion here?" It's those kinds of questions that help solidify the idea of the creature in your mind. Then the GM can use the Battle Point system, like ordering off a menu, to pick what Adversaries should be present.</p>

<p>For those who want to make encounters easier or harder for the party, there are also rules for how you should add or remove Battle Points from your 'menu' to ensure the encounter has the level of impact you want it to.</p>

<h2>Teaching A GM High-Level Play</h2>

<p>While we had spoken about building encounters and Adversaries, I wanted to touch on what resources were included specifically for high-level play. This kind of play is what many TTRPG players greatly look forward to, but it's also quite frequently where the game starts to ask you, as the GM, to perform your own heavy lifting.</p>

<p>"There's a section in the book that charts out story structure and the way you might approach it over the course of a campaign. It's a smaller section, but we wrote it in combination with one of our designers who also has a background in novel writing, one of our game designers who has also written on many seasons of Television."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"All of these storytellers put their brains together to figure out 'what is the most basic way we can present story structure so that someone who has never tried it and never thought about it can approach it'"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hall described a table that GMs will be able to use that should take the mystery out of creating a story from level 1 to level 10 without being intimidated by it.</p>

<p>For <em>Daggerheart </em>the level cap is 10, what the game calls Tier 4 play. There's also tips for GMs to explain what a Tier 4 Adversary would look like, what power do they have, etc. Starke explained that a lot of the feedback they got on Tier 4 play was that it was slower.</p>

<p>"When that armor score goes up to 14 or 17, now I'm having to do that math every time I'm getting hit. That became really crunchy and the game slowed down. [...] Armor changed that it now lowers a threshold and doesn't rely on doing heavy math in the moment and that was really core to make a game that focuses on storytelling."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-ancestry-and-community.jpg?itok=1Hihp-hT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-ancestry-and-community.jpg?itok=L1lMQJXO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Advice For New Players Getting Used To Roleplaying</h2>

<p>It's no secret that there is a heavy emphasis on roleplay and story-telling in <em>Daggerheart</em>, this isn't just intrinsic of the format but it's something that Hall explained was at the core of designing <em>Daggerheart</em>.</p>

<p>"One of the things that we do when designing - whether we're looking at a class, an ancestry, an adversary - is to say 'what story are we trying to tell by presenting it as an offering'" Past that Hall described that their goal was also to make those options as open ended as possible.</p>

<p>If you want to play to the tropes of high-fantasy, grimdark, etc then it's easy to find those ways to play but if you're also interested in creating a character that goes against or subverts those tropes they didn't want the system to hold back that creativity.</p>

<p>Another way that <em>Daggerheart </em>welcomes new players into roleplay is with Connection Questions. "When people are making their characters in the character guide, there's a selection of background questions and a selection of connection questions. The background questions are designed to help the player create their character, but most importantly, to let the GM know what the player wants. It prompts the players to give the villain from the backstory, their hometown, and the thing that they're seeking."</p>

<p>Starke joked that it's a way for a GM to know "who do you care about the most?" while slyly miming writing down notes.</p>

<p>"For the player-to-player side, by making connections from Session Zero, saying 'I am connected to you because…', now the players also have those same tags in those notes. They can plot ways to bring it out or support the stories that each other wants to tell."</p>

<h2>Manage Your Resources</h2>

<p>In reviewing how the game had evolved as the open beta period had continued, I was interested in just how much there is for a player to keep track of. They have their health and abilities, but also armor that can degrade, stress that can build up, and Hope to earn.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-character-sheet-and-sidecar.jpg?itok=CJwA4OGI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-character-sheet-and-sidecar.jpg?itok=H6_78uSj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>At a lot of junctions in the game, you'll be presented with choices: do I take some extra damage or use my armor to protect myself? Should I risk more stress to unleash a powerful attack if it leaves me vulnerable?</p>

<p>For lack of a better term I wanted to understand what led them to decisions to include resource management that could feel so 'crunchy' and how that affected the game mechanically as well as through story.</p>

<p>"One of the big reasons why is that we wanted it to feel different when you were blocking with a shield versus dodging out of the way of an attack," Starke explained. "We wanted to create some flow from mechanics to narrative."</p>

<p>"There's a little bit more mechanically, and resources to use," referencing Hope specifically as a resource that you gain almost every roll of the dice. "All of those contribute to the genre that we're playing with here in <em>Daggerheart </em>which is the Heroic Fantasy genre"</p>

<p>Hall added "we want all of that resource management, all of that math and the dice rolling, to also feel like it's narratively aligned." Pulling from a previous session that they had been playing in Hall explained that none of their rolls were earning them Hope. "That told me the place that my character was in, I was looking more towards my abilities that require me to spend stress."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Stress is one of my favorite mechanics because, to me, it feels like how actual stress works. You can spend your own stress to do cool things, you can decide to do things that will stress you out, and the world can inflict stress upon you."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Talking about this experience Hall not only discussed how it gave them totally different gameplay options, but also how it worked to inform the narrative of their character and how they were feeling in the moment.</p>

<h2><em>Daggerheart's </em>Beta and Live Stream Success</h2>

<p><em>Daggerheart </em>may just be releasing but it's been in the publics eye for some time, in the form of a public beta as well as being featured in multiple Critical Role mini-series and live shows. I asked Starke and Hall if they remember when during this period they really felt like <em>Daggerheart </em>was going to be something big.</p>

<p>"[Matthew] Mercer was so wonderful with us, learning mechanics as we were building them" Hall began</p>

<p>"He was on it, rolled with the punches of us being like 'Ok Matt, I know you're playing a game today but these things have changes'"</p>

<p>Recalling watching the first Menagerie stream with the development team Starke recounts, "It's live, we were all sitting there with bated breath [...] I remember the magic of watching them play and seeing them have a blast. We knew they were having fun when we were doing internal playtests but to have the relief of them on-stream just having the best time we thought 'We did it!'"</p>

<p>"TTRPGs at their core are about having fun with your friends and seeing people that we care so much about having fun with the game, it meant so much to us," Hall added "seeing people who were actively playing the beta also commenting on the stream and commenting on things going on at their own table was the peak version of 'your friends having fun.'"</p>

<h2><em>Daggerheart </em>Miniatures</h2>

<p>Knowing my own table's enjoyment from seeing the game brought to life with miniatures, I did try to get some information about when we might be able to get our hands on <em>Daggerheart </em>Miniatures? Unfortunately Starke's response was "We don't know, but in success anything could happen"</p>

<p>While we didn't get to learn about any plans that didn't stop Starke from highlighting how in design he wanted a game that was narratively focused, but was also intriguing in a way that players would want to purchase or create miniatures.</p>

<p>Talking about miniature wishlists, Hall began casually by stating, "I really want to see the Oracle of Doom as a miniature, it's one of the Adversaries that I just think is so terrifying"</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-tier-4-adversary.jpg?itok=fre3MOR1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-tier-4-adversary.jpg?itok=hJYBXuD- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Starke however teased that he's looking forward to "all of the minis for Matt's Age of Umbra run that he's doing." The Campaign Frame, that Matt wrote for <em>Daggerheart</em>, will be the setting for an 8-part mini-series with the cast of Critical Role beginning on May 29th.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It's the stuff of nightmares (Affectionate)" - Rowan Hall on Age of Umbra</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Starke was able to share that the inspiration to have Age of Umbra written comes from a homegame that Starke and Mercer are in with fellow TTRPG performers, Erika Ishii, Aabria Iyengar, and Brennan Lee Mulligan, where they play Kingdom Death Monster together. When the idea of creating Campaign Frames came up Starke approached Matt to ask "Can we do a Soulsborne-inspire/Kingdom Death Monster inspired Campaign Frame for this?" and he said he was so in…</p>

The company, built on <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>Actual Plays, steps into the high-fantasy TTRPG space, and what they've come out with is a blast. Plenty of Character Options and DM tools are included, but I have a feeling I know just who this all won't click with.</p>

<h2>What Comes With <em>Daggerheart</em>?</h2>

<p>For the core set of <em>Daggerheart </em>you'll be receiving a 360+ page Core Rulebook. This includes everything you need to play the game from building a Player Character and how to interact with the world, to a list of different Adversaries a party might fight and information about the Campaign Frames to set your adventures within.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>In addition to the physical book there is also a folder of cards, these cards include information about each of the different sub-classes (two sub-classes for each of the nine classes), Ancestry information, Community information, and a deck of cards for all of the abilities for each of the Domains (think of these like spell and ability lists)</p>

<p>When building a character out you can put it all into your character sheet, or you can juggle between the abilities and weapons that you might keep on your character sheet and the physical cards for quick referencing your abilities.</p>

<p>There's a lot of TTRPG where you'll hear people say "building a character is very fast" but <em>Daggerheart </em>is one where I would agree. With the cards laid out in front of you you get to pick a sub-class (that comes with the Class and it's Class features), Ancestry (species), Community (what type of upbringing your character has), starting equipment, and input basic stats.</p>

<p>You'll know as soon as you have picked your Sorcerer sub-class that you'll want to pick a Instinct weapon, then it's just a matter of picking two abilities for your domains.</p>

<p>Stats are based on a standard array (+2, +1, +1, 0, 0, -1) and other characteristics like your starting evasion, hit points are all based on your class.</p>

<p>You'll end up with a completely filled-out character sheet and five playing cards, and you're ready to go.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-character-cards.jpg?itok=6ar31RmD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-character-cards.jpg?itok=cMmPDqQS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Quick reference cards offer a nice change from the character sheet, but more places to look</figcaption></figure><p>I loved the character creation process. While it did feel like there were less options being presented to me the walls that each of those options presented were far more spaced out. An example might be the Sorcerer's Minor Illusion.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Make a Spellcast Roll (10). On a success, you create a minor visual illusion no larger than yourself within Close range. This illusion is convincing to anyone at Close range or farther out."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It's a simple roll and then the world is your oyster. Whether you use this for flavor, to try to fool an adversary, or include it as part of a performance. There's no nitty gritty about inspections, whether it can or can't make a sound, etc. This kind of prioritization for creativity is seen in a lot of the abilities.</p>

<h2>Character Growth</h2>

<p>Leveling up in <em>Daggerheart </em>offers characters a variety of options depending on what level they've reached (where the max is 10). These are things like gaining an additional Hit Point, Stress Slot, upgrading your experiences, or more.</p>

<p>Each level up has six or more possibilities for you to choose two from, letting you prioritize what you're most interested in and begin to create further diversification with your character.</p>

<p>This is also where the Tiers come into play. A level 1 character is Tier 1, but a Level 5-7 character is in Tier 3. Each of these Tiers is a good indicator for the GM, but also the players what kinds of experiences they should be having at the table. Each time you ascend a Tier you know that you've graduated to a new level of adventuring.</p>

<p>When first opening up all of the cards and reviewing the character sheets it seemed like there would be cards for abilities, whether those abilities be tied to what kind of creature you were playing or what they specialized in, and that the player sheet would be for tracking weapons, inventory, and stats/resources.</p>

<p>I was mistaken, realizing that class features instead go on your character sheet. It felt like an arbitrary line had been drawn between what would get it's own card and what would be on the character sheet and the most basic Class features didn't make the cut.</p>

<h2>Tools For A GM</h2>

<p>When playing <em>Daggerheart </em>at no point did I not feel supported by the Core Rulebook. This thing is absolutely packed with not just all of the rules that you'll need to manage the game, but also to make it your own.</p>

<p>A large number of rule explanations, like how to craft encounters, create new adversaries, and to deal with the results of player rolls don't just tell you what to do, but extrapolate on the different ways that you can handle these events, and even how the designers would approach these situations.</p>

<p>There's a lot of effort put into reassuring the GM that there's no one 'correct' way to play the game, and that in situations that call for it you can definitely fudge or ignore certain aspects of a stat block or rule.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-dm-assistance.jpg?itok=o63JZ1Rq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-dm-assistance.jpg?itok=TEmcFOdJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Hope and Fear Always Progressing The Story</h2>

<p>The most unique aspect for me in <em>Daggerheart </em>is that all skill checks are performed with two D12, one for Hope and one for Fear, as opposed to a D20 or a group of D6. You'll always add the numbers together, but whether the higher number was Hope or Fear will have different effects.</p>

<p>Succeeding your skill check with a 5 on the Fear die and a 9 on the Hope die will give you a total of 14 and you'll earn Hope for your character, if those numbers were reversed you may still pass your skill check, but the GM obtains a fear point and while there is a success there might be a consequence.</p>

<p>It's an easy method to create varying levels of success and when Hope is capped at six per player and Fear for the DM stops at Twelve. This resource will continue to gather for the player or DM with every single check or attack allowing you to be spending and receiving them freely. Your access to this resource will also let you pull off bigger and badder abilities.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-bard-class.jpg?itok=-C1vxXxp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-bard-class.jpg?itok=kjVjWEzr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I really think <em>Daggerheart </em>has nailed something here with these resources. It's a way to promote even the most basic of gameplay and mean that even if you fail a skill check there's a chance for you to gain at least something. There's no wasted action and it also allows for the DM to prompt for more actions knowing that they too can obtain more resources from it.</p>

<h2>Combat Is Freeform</h2>

<p>Combat is where I believe players will either really enjoy it, or really not like it. Combat in <em>Daggerheart </em>is freeform, letting the players make moves in whatever order they want until the GM decides to cut in, spending one or multiple Fear to activate an Adversary dealing some damage.</p>

<p>This style of combat creates a scenario of requiring patience and planning, knowing when you'd like to jump in, but it also requires you to maintain attention on the battlefield. You'll never know if the enemy you're next to is about to take multiple swings at you, or when a party member is going to invite you to participate in a combo attack.</p>

<p>Running <em>Daggerheart,&nbsp;</em>I personally enjoyed goading players into more attacks, seeing them roll with Fear to work my way towards consecutive attacks to push back on the party. It felt like there was more of an ebb and flow between what I was doing and getting to respond to them in the moment.</p>

<p>What I saw at my table from my players was really interesting compared to our standard game of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>D&amp;D</em></a>. I have multiple players who tend to disengage when it's not their turn while playing <em>D&amp;D</em> and return to focus when they're up, for <em>Daggerheart </em>through I got mixed responses.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-tier-1-adversary_0.jpg?itok=-SwoLkeJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-tier-1-adversary_0.jpg?itok=OotmcvCm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>One of my normally disengaged players ended up being the most engaged at the table, wanting to throw additional dagger slices into the fray any chance they got (that also meant they were the one potentially feeding me the most Fear) while the other player remained disengaged, hopping in when they wanted to.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A line to take turns can allow space for disengagement, but everyone understands a line. Not everyone understands sharing the spotlight, or has the drive to take that spotlight if there are louder voices present</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There will be players who prefer an initiative, taking a turn to perform their action so everyone gets one turn per round, and there will be players that enjoy the freeform style of gameplay. This is likely something that is going to be very hard to determine for a player until they're put in the situation to try it out.</p>

<p>Without putting limitations on actions this kind of combat play style can also lead to introverted players not hopping in. The <em>Daggerheart Core Rulebook</em> does offer some suggestions to make sure that the spotlight is shared including adding a number of actions that each character can perform before everyone's actions are refreshed.</p>

<p>While there are no trial adventures for a GM to kick off with, there are a number of different Campaign Frames that are offered. While I had originally believed these to just be thematic settings, these are so much more.</p>

<p>Each Campaign Frame comes with a pitch to gauge player interest, a list of tones, themes, and inspirational touchstones, and pages of information detailing starting points for stories, Session Zero questions, Campaign Frame-specific mechanics and more.</p>

<p>Fans of <em>Princess Mononoke</em> or <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> can hop into a fantastical world at risk of corruption in the Witherwild Campaign Frame, Delicious in Dungeon fans can explore Beast Feast where the benefits of a short or long rest are replaced with mechanics for how to restore yourself by eating meals made of cooked monsters, and if you're a fan of Wild Wild West or Shadow of the Colossus you can be a cowboy scaling gargantuan beasts in Colossus of the Drylands.</p>

<p>One Campaign Frame has even included a completely made-up language that my mind went wild wondering how to slowly drip-feed that information to my players.</p>

<p>While I can't imagine some of the gimmicks of these Campaign Frames working for a multi-year campaign, I'm definitely excited to run short adventures of hungry adventurers or dungeon diving where the dungeon itself is a monster.</p>

<p>Having been a fan in the original beta period and getting to return I have been blown away by the level of polish that <em>Daggerheart </em>has received and by the amount of clear and concise information that has been provided to the players and GM alike.</p>

<p>I do still wish that there was additional Class cards for the Class abilities to create a separation between the kind of info on the Character Sheet and what's on the cards, but I suppose the easy workaround for this would be to keep the ability information on the sheets to.</p>

<p>I imagine the hardest part of deciding how to run this is the extra coordination required when reaching combat, making sure as the DM you're aware of all of the pieces on the board and how they can all act at any time, but also to make sure none of your players are getting left out of the fray. This will be the piece that is most hit or miss with players.</p>

<p>Overall, <em>Daggerheart </em>promotes strong narrative gameplay that is propped up by mechanics. It's not just schoolyard posturing, but you can have a unique experience that then lets you show off your prowess. It's supporting of the player and it's supporting of the GM which leads to a very happy table.</p>

So it’s not surprising that Hunt appears in ever<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-final-reckoning-tom-cruise-stunts-1851780902&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mission-impossible-final-reckoning-tom-cruise-stunts-1851780902"><em> Mission: Impossible</em> movie</a></span>. But you know who else appears in every one of these films, including the latest, <em>Final Reckoning</em>? Ving Rhames as Luther Stickell. And I’m so happy to see him in each film. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197567" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Price Is Set at $450 for Now, But Could Go Higher" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="104" data-playlist="197567,197565,197564" data-current="197567"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Price Is Set at $450 for Now, But Could Go Higher</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197567/197567_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23091.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Luther Stickell is first introduced in the original <em>Mission: Impossible</em> movie as a genius computer hacker and “phone phreaker” who has been “disavowed” by the IMF for his actions, and who helps Ethan with his mission to be reinstated. In the next few films he helps Ethan over and over, often acting as the agent’s “second eyes,” someone who can help guide him during missions using hacked cameras. He often unlocks doors, shuts down security systems, or gains access to secret info using his hacking skills. Without Luther, Ethan would have likely failed some of his biggest missions or even died. And during all of this hacking and helping, Luther remains a loyal friend with a cool demeanor, slick style, and a big heart. <br></p><p>It’s not a debate that in both the fictional movie universe of<em> Mission: Impossible</em> and the franchise itself, Cruise’s Hunt is the most important person around. He’s on every poster. In every movie. He saves the day over and over again and each film is mostly focused on his struggles.  His defeats. His wins. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tom-cruise-promises-underwater-sequence-unlike-any-othe-1851779244&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tom-cruise-promises-underwater-sequence-unlike-any-othe-1851779244">And of course, all those sick stunts he does during missions</a></span>. But I think Luther Stickell is the second most important person because without him, Ethan would have failed many times. Plus, he acts as a close friend and confidant, an important role when you have a life as stressful and full of secrets as Ethan’s. </p><h2 id="h1766569"><a id=""></a>Luther is always helping, even if he’s not around</h2><p>Case in point: Luther Stickell doesn’t show up until the very end of <em>Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol</em>. But he still <em>shows up </em>at a bar, after the chaotic mission, to roast Ethan’s “corny” one-liner and share a beer with his bud. Cruise, who is heavily involved with these movies, as well as director Brad Bird, could have chosen to not include Luther. But I think Cruise understands how important it is for Luther to be around in Ethan’s life. And at this point, the audience loves him and expects him to show up over and over to save the day, make us laugh, and be the coolest person on screen. </p><p>Even when Luther isn’t around, he’s important and helping Ethan Hunt. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luther_Stickell#:~:text=It%20is%20revealed%20in%20later%20film%20Fallout%20that%20after%20Ethan%20and%20Julia%20fake%20her%20death%2C%20Luther%20is%20responsible%20for%20teaching%20Julia%20how%20to%20be%20a%20%27ghost%27%3A%20to%20disappear%20and%20avoid%20being%20hunted%20by%20anyone%20looking%20to%20use%20her%20against%20Ethan.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luther_Stickell#:~:text=It%20is%20revealed%20in%20later%20film%20Fallout%20that%20after%20Ethan%20and%20Julia%20fake%20her%20death%2C%20Luther%20is%20responsible%20for%20teaching%20Julia%20how%20to%20be%20a%20%27ghost%27%3A%20to%20disappear%20and%20avoid%20being%20hunted%20by%20anyone%20looking%20to%20use%20her%20against%20Ethan." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As revealed in <em>Fallout</em></a></span>, after the events of <em>Mission: Impossible 3</em>, Hunt leaves his wife to allow her to live a happy and safe life. But Luther helps train her on how to be a spy, hide from dangerous people, and how to protect herself. Luther is truly the nicest dude in the franchise. </p><p>It’s wild to think that we almost missed out on Luther appearing in every <em>Mission</em> film. Back during production on the first movie, Ving Rhames says that the original script has his character dying very early on. He pointed this out to star and producer Tom Cruise, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://screenrant.com/mission-impossible-ving-rhames-luther-death-factoid/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://screenrant.com/mission-impossible-ving-rhames-luther-death-factoid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as he explained in a recent interview with <em>ScreenRant</em></a></span>. </p><p>  “The first one, I died in the first 10 pages and I said, ‘Why is it the black man always dies in the first 10 pages?’ Tom said, ‘Yeah. Why is that?’ So, now, I just finished number eight, so I feel pretty fortunate,” said Rhames. </p><p>I’m so happy that Tom Cruise realized that was a silly decision and advocated for Luther to survive the first film. Since then, Luther has become a key part of the franchise, just as important and expected as big stunts, lifelike masks, secret messages, and Ethan Hunt. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Another previous report said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-gta-6-delay-and-switch-2-launch-could-impact-video-games-in-2025-and-beyond/1100-6531553/" data-ref-id="1100-6531553">Sony was specifically hurt by GTA 6's delay to 2026</a>, due to an expected uptick in game and console sales. It's also been theorized that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-trailer-includes-playstation-controller-and-console-references/1100-6531330/" data-ref-id="1100-6531330">Sony has a deal with Rockstar for GTA 6. </a></p><p>GTA 6 being delayed to 2026 creates a "vacuum" for other publishers to maximize the sales potential of their games during Holiday 2025, Ampere said. The company added that Nintendo is now "better placed to capitalized" in this environment with the launch of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> and its marquee games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a>.</p><p>Like the game's release date, revenue deriving from GTA 6 is not canceled, but delayed. GTA 6 is expected to be a massive success whenever it's released. The game was delayed due in part to Rockstar's teams <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-exec-suggests-no-more-delays-says-recent-push-is-less-than-6-months/1100-6531629/" data-ref-id="1100-6531629">needing more time to polish the game and get it ready for launch. </a></p><p>Even with GTA 6's delay, Ampere's report said the total global video game industry is expected to reach $201.3 billion in 2025, which would be up from the all-time annual record of $199.4 billion in 2024. This is a growth of about 1%, but Ampere said 2026 should see an annual growth rate of 2.2% thanks in part to GTA 6.</p><p>Ampere's Piers Harding-Rolls said the video game industry's lack of a new transformative technology or updated monetization and distribution models means game companies are "looking for pockets of growth to exploit and to build content more efficiently and at lower cost."</p><p>As for the Switch 2, it's said to be the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-gta-6-delay-and-switch-2-launch-could-impact-video-games-in-2025-and-beyond/1100-6531553/" data-ref-id="1100-6531553">"most important product launch" of all time in gaming</a>, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-how-many-switch-2-consoles-it-expects-to-sell-during-its-first-year/1100-6531389/" data-ref-id="1100-6531389">Nintendo predicting it will sell millions of systems and games.</a> The system launches on June 5.</p>

			<p>Arrowhead Game Studios has released the highly anticipated Helldivers 2: Heart of Democracy update on both PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>
<p>After fighting for democracy across the galaxy, players have swiftly been recalled back to Super Earth, where they'll have to fight against the <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-galactic-emergency-announced-new-enemies-and-weapon-customizations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">invading Illuminate</a>, a faction formed by an aquatic species known as Squ'ith. Super Earth Armed Forces had nearly annihilated them, but in secret, they built a fleet called The Great Host, which is now invading Super Earth.</p>
<p>In a major change of environment from the usual planet, Helldivers will fight among towering skyscrapers and crowded streets while the Illuminate rain down destruction all around. Inside the city biomes, players must tackle operations and work to liberate cities together, having a significant impact on planetary campaigns. They must fight to control areas where the fleet is landing, in what Arrowhead has described as a game of intergalactic tug-of-war, struggling against the incoming forces, with the potential to gain and lose control quickly.</p>
<p>Helldivers will find help in the Super Earth Armed Forces troops, who fight on their own but can be ordered to follow players and provide temporary backup as they navigate toward objectives. The ultimate goal is to activate Super Earth's Planetary Defense Cannons to take down the Illuminate fleet. However, Helldivers must also be aware of the many civilians still roaming the streets, fearing for their lives. Any civilian lives lost from friendly fire will be punished.</p>

<p>Helldivers 2 was just updated with a new and powerful primary weapon customization system. Most primary weapons now have levels that can be achieved by completing missions. These levels unlock new attachments that can be obtained through Requisition. Players can also unlock weapon patterns.</p>
<p>The weapon customization system allows tweaking sights for precision, changing color patterns, adjusting magazine capacity, optimizing weapon performance characteristics with muzzle adjustments, or customizing under-barrel attachments for optimal handling.</p>

Helldivers, return to our planet and defend what is rightfully ours.</p><p><strong>Super Earth… Our Home</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Helldivers-II-Update_05-20-25_002.jpg"></a></figure><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The urban sprawl of Super Earth is the site of the conflict. Fight among the towering skyscrapers and crowded streets of our home turf as the Illuminate rain down destruction all around you.</p><p>Inside the city biomes, you will tackle operations and work to liberate cities together, having a significant impact on planetary campaigns.</p><p><strong>Repel the Invasion</strong></p><p>The Helldivers are tasked with a new objective: to repel the Illuminate invasion by gaining ground over the squids as they fight to control areas where the fleet is landing. It won’t be a walk in the park, divers. Like a game of intergalactic tug-of-war, you will struggle against the incoming forces, gaining and losing control quickly.</p><p><strong>Arm the Cannons</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Helldivers-II-Update_05-20-25_003.jpg"></a></figure><p>Even in the face of such danger, we are not helpless, and all is not lost. The might of Super Earth’s arsenal lies hidden beneath our peaceful, democratic streets.

These small squads will fight enemies on their own, or they can be ordered to follow Helldivers and provide temporary backup as you navigate toward objectives. Salute and lead them on the path to victory, divers!</p><p><strong>Protect Citizens</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Helldivers-II-Update_05-20-25_005.jpg"></a></figure><p>However, you must also be aware of the many civilians still roaming the streets, fearing for their lives. They may be panicked, Helldivers, but it is your sworn duty to keep them safe and they look to you as the ultimate protectors of liberty. Remember: any civilian lives lost from friendly fire will be punished.</p><p><strong>Prepare for the Fight</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Helldivers-II-Update_05-20-25_006.jpg"></a></figure><p>Last week, we released a powerful primary weapon customization system and expanded surplus options to fight against the Illuminate as they emerged from the singularity.

Use every available resource, divers, and decimate their forces!</p><p>Our major update, “Heart of Democracy,” is now live. Helldivers, to your hellpods immediately!

			<p>20 million Nintendo Switch 2 units could be shipped by March 2026, and production can also ramp up further if needed, although the capacity of hardware assemblers may not allow for more shipped units than predicted.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-05-20/nintendo-turns-to-samsung-to-make-chips-ramp-up-switch-2-output?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NzcxMTYxNCwiZXhwIjoxNzQ4MzE2NDE0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTV0JURURUMVVNMFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJBRDcxOUY5NDBGRTk0MzNBOERCNzI2OEJDOTY3NzY3QyJ9.otPPN3UUhc4q42s5epuIhmbzdF6WijHgG7OKH4-CY9k&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>, anonymous sources, who have also confirmed the system's SoC is being produced on Samsung's 8nm process node, revealed the production pace should be fast enough for Nintendo to ship more than 20 million units by March 2026. The Korean company is ready to ramp up production if needed, although much will depend on the capacity of the hardware assemblers like Foxconn. Interestingly enough, but not surprisingly, considering that Samsung has provided OLED panels for one of the original Nintendo Switch hardware revisions, the Korean company is also reportedly pushing for its OLED panels to be used in future hardware revisions.</p>
<p>With the Nintendo Switch 2 now being around two weeks away, more information on the system is being shared. <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-final-system-specifications-cpu-gpu-dlss/">Last week</a>, we learned more about its final system specifications, which mostly align with those that leaked online earlier this year, limitations that developers will have to work around, such as CPU cores and RAM not available for games. Additional details have also come in about <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-gamechat-supports-live-subtitles-and-text-to-speech/">GameChat</a>, which may be demanding to run, so much so that the system's SDK allows developers to test it without an active session, and VRR support, which won't be available in <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-not-support-vrr-in-docked-mode-nintendo-finally-confirms/">docked mode.</a></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th worldwide, with some exceptions like <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-indefinitely-delayed-the-launch-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-china/">China</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-wont-launch-in-central-america-or-the-caribbean-this-year/">Central America</a>.</p>

            <p>Video game voice-actor union <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sag-aftra">SAG-AFTRA</a> are launching a legal case against the presence of generated AI voice-acting for Darth Vader in Epic's battle royale <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>. They're accusing the company's subsidiary Llama Productions of using AI to "replace the work of human performers" - or at least, of replacing human performers without first haggling out terms with the union.</p><!--more-->
<p>The AI-voiced Vader character was added to Fortnite last week, in collaboration with the family of James Earl Jones, the original voice of Darth. Track down and recruit him and you'll be able to take turns generatively bantering with Fauxnakin. Needless to say, the addition has proven a hit among the furiously masticating hamsters of social media. Also needless to say, players have swiftly worked out how to bait DAIrth VAIder into <a href="https://x.com/ImCordial/status/1923354018375491805">dropping F-bombs 
and slurs</a>, though at the time of publication, Epic appear to have addressed this in a patch.</p>
<p>Now, the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists have filed <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sites/default/files/2025-05/Llama%20Productions%20ULP%20Charge.pdf">an unfair labour practice charge</a> against SkAIwalker Senior with the US National Labor Relations Board.</p>
<p>"We celebrate the right of our members and their estates to control the use of their digital replicas and welcome the use of new technologies to allow new generations to share in the enjoyment of those legacies and renowned roles," the union wrote in a statement. "However, we must protect our right to bargain terms and conditions around uses of voice that replace the work of our members, including those who previously did the work of matching Darth Vader's iconic rhythm and tone in video games.</p>
<p>"Fortnite's signatory company, Llama Productions, chose to replace the work of human performers with A.I. technology," it continues. "Unfortunately, they did so without providing any notice of their intent to do this and without bargaining with us over appropriate terms. As such, we have filed an unfair labor practice charge with the NLRB against Llama Productions."</p>
<p>The court document itself claims that Llama Productions have "failed and refused to bargain in good faith with the union by making unilateral changes to terms and conditions of employment, without providing notice to the union or the opportunity to bargain, by utilizing AI-generated voices to replace bargaining unit work on the Interactive Program Fortnite".</p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA - who represent a spectrum of workers across the media and entertainment sphere - have often gone to bat with the video games industry over the usage of human voice-acting to "train" bots, and the potential replacing of voice-acting in games with genAI. Following a lengthy negotiation over AI protections with the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> publisher Take-Two and Call Of Duty household Activision, they called a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ai-protections-remain-the-sticking-point-for-todays-sag-aftra-game-actor-strike">strike last July</a> in the name of "fair compensation and the right of informed consent". The strike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/following-the-nightmare-footage-of-ai-loy-horizon-actor-ashly-burch-shares-her-stance-on-the-whole-debacle">continues</a>. Some video game voice and performance artists have, however, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/actors-union-sag-aftra-strike-deal-to-allow-ai-voice-replicas-and-video-game-stars-are-understandably-pissed">criticised</a> SAG-AFTRA for striking deals with individual genAI companies.</p>
<p>All this forms part of the wider, on-going debate about the ethics and legalities of generative AI - our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/electric-nightmares">Electric Nightmares</a> essay series remains a good primer. While voice actors contest the loss of work, other organisations are picking fights with the genAI biz over copyright infringement.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/this-will-be-a-day-long-remembered-speak-with-darth-vader-in-fortnite?lang=en-US">an Epic Games blog post</a>, the Darth Vader chatbot in Fortnite makes use of two AI models - Google's Gemini and ElevenLabs' Flash. Gemini was recently hit by a <a href="https://nypost.com/2024/03/20/business/google-hit-with-271m-fine-over-gemini-ai-tool-copyright-breach/">$271 million fine over copyright breach</a>, with France's competition watchdog accusing the search engine company of "training" the bot with material from publishers and news agencies without notifying them. Google have pledged not to contest these facts as part of settlement proceedings.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-game-closures-and-a-declining-audience-call-of-duty-is-in-a-rough-spot-so-whats-next<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty fans are still digesting the news that Activision is walking away from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile">Warzone Mobile</a>, the game that was meant to lead the battle royale into a new era.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the weekend, Activision pulled Warzone Mobile from iOS and Android app stores, with the scope of the game being “streamlined" and an admission it had not met expectations. While servers will remain online for now, no new content or updates will be issued to the game, and players can no longer spend real money in it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're proud of the accomplishment in bringing Call of Duty: Warzone to mobile in an authentic way, [but] it unfortunately has not met our expectations with mobile-first players like it has with PC and console audiences,” Activision said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a brutal end for a game that clearly struggled right out of the gate. Warzone Mobile launched in March 2024 on iOS and Android as a Warzone-specific Call of Duty mobile experience that offered battle royale for up to 120 players, as well as cross-progression with the PC and console Warzone, Modern Warfare 2 and 3, and, later in the year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-review"><u>Call of Duty Warzone Mobile review</u></a> returned an 8/10. We said: "Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile includes all the best elements of Warzone, while speeding up and streamlining matches and using cross-progression to make this a meaningful extension of the traditional experience."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision’s hope was that Warzone Mobile would make a splash in the competitive mobile shooter market, where the hugely successful Call of Duty Mobile, developed by Tencent-owned TiMi Studio Group, is already established. With Call of Duty Mobile, which has seen 1 billion downloads since launch, revenue is shared between Activision and Tencent. Warzone Mobile, on the other hand, was developed entirely in-house at Activision, and so the company received a bigger slice of the money pie every time a player dropped cash on a battle pass or a cosmetic.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Top 10 Call of Duty Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But Warzone Mobile, which requires more powerful mobile phones than Call of Duty Mobile to work well, failed to meet Activision’s expectations, and its development team was scaled down when, in September last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-layoffs-hit-call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-which-didnt-hit-as-big-as-hoped">Microsoft-wide layoffs hit across the games business</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Call of Duty fans, especially those who <em>did</em> play Warzone Mobile, have lamented the state of the game and indeed the franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This game simply came out too early and wanted to be too greedy,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WarzoneMobile/comments/1kqdosx/what_a_huge_waste_i_feel_sorry_for_those_who/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor Maddafragg</a>. “It could be seen on the Reddit videos, a lot of gameplay was not fluid with weird graphics, it could be seen that even if the game is playable, the device struggles to run it. The world of mobile gaming is cursed, it's not just Warzone that's dying. Dead by Daylight mobile and Star Wars hunter will also close the doors.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Turns out mobile games need to be optimized on most devices to be successful, you can't just cater to high end devices and hope your game succeed — it won't,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WarzoneMobile/comments/1kocpnv/warzone_mobile_is_officially_dead_now_what/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">added piegeamorue</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Greed is a dangerous thing. Activision was too greedy and when it leaked that they planned on killing CODM in favor of WZM they essentially turned tens of millions of people against the game. It became ‘us vs them’ and CODM is vastly more accessible than WZM — the loss was guaranteed.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What's next for Call of Duty, which appears to be in a tricky spot right now? Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/has-xboxs-call-of-duty-game-pass" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Game Business</a> reported that while Black Ops 6 launched big late last year, the Call of Duty franchise saw its users decline afterwards, and “more sharply” than in recent years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the relevant blurb:</p><blockquote>... the reality is that despite a strong start, Call of Duty has struggled to engage players to the degree it has in the past. According to Ampere, in March 2025, Call of Duty had 20.6 million players. That is still a huge number, but it’s slightly less than March 2024, which had 20.8 million players, and well down on March 2023, which saw 22.4 million players.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-has-given-call-of-duty-warzone-a-shot-in-the-arm-and-its-developers-say-its-not-going-anywhere">The return of the much-loved Verdansk to Warzone did give the battle royale a much-needed shot in the arm</a>, but with the honeymoon period over and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-call-of-duty-warzone-cheating-complaints-ramp-up-following-the-return-of-verdansk-activision-insists-its-caused-chaos-in-the-cheat-marketplace-by-disrupting-over-150-cheat-resellers">accusations of rampant cheating once again dominating the narrative</a>, all eyes are on Activision and this year’s Call of Duty game to see if the still-huge first-person shooter franchise can reinvent itself once again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Related, there are a number of apparent datamined gameplay videos doing the rounds that show wall-running and even jet packs working in Black Ops 6. This, some believe, indicates this year's Black Ops 7 will ditch Activision’s ‘boots on the ground’ mantra for gameplay reminiscent of Black Ops 3.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">They also added jetpacks lol <a href="https://t.co/ZrFxLVfQkj" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/ZrFxLVfQkj</a></p>— Bikou (@Kivikou) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kivikou/status/1924643962159030591?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">🚨‼️WALL RUNNING CONFIRMED FOR BO7‼️🚨<br>There is wall running in BO6 currently It is unclear if it's leftover from BO3 that managed to make it's way into a glitch through BO6 or if it's from BO7 and is left in the BO6 files. <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@charlieINTEL</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@ModernWarzone</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/Dexerto?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Dexerto</a> <a href="https://t.co/0FJ0guUIEH" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/0FJ0guUIEH</a></p>— peter (@viipeter_) <a href="https://twitter.com/viipeter_/status/1924313756395360577?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 19, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Activision told IGN its teams are busy and moving forward on a variety of work, so hopefully we’ll see the fruits of that soon. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-xbox-games-showcase-2025-for-june-plus-the-outer-worlds-2-direct">Microsoft’s annual June Xbox showcase is around the corner</a>. Perhaps Call of Duty will turn up there. And, meanwhile, Call of Duty: Mobile is going strong, but, as we’ve pointed out, it’s not as lucrative a business for Activision, despite being bigger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision Blizzard’s recent mobile struggles also call into question Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of the company itself, given Xbox boss Phil Spencer has made no secret that the decision was in part motivated by Xbox’s lofty mobile ambitions (Activision Blizzard owns King, the maker of phenomenally popular mobile game Candy Crush). Indeed, Microsoft plans to launch an app store of its own, taking on Apple and Google in the lucrative mobile game space.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

They are so bad, in fact, that refunds are being offered. </p><p>The D&amp;D Icons of the Realms: Baldur's Gate 3 box set by WizKids featured characters Astarion, Karlach, Gale, Shadowheart, Wyll, and Lae'zel, along with fan-favorite undead companion Withers.

"We, too, feel the same as the final product did not meet our expectations or that of our Wizards of the Coast partner."</p><p>The product listing for the BG3 minis has been pulled down for now, as WizKids seeks to "ensure these issues do not recur in future products and reprints." The company has also offered unhappy fans the option to request a replacement instead of a refund, and has promised to make sure that the replacement product "meets the standards expected."</p>

and unsatisfactory content," the post reads. "We fully acknowledge that this is our responsibility, and addressing these shortcomings remains a top priority for our team moving forward."</p><p>Infold says it will be extending the current version, effectively delaying the release of Version 1.6 to give the developers more time to address these issues. Bubble Season and the various events associated with Version 1.5 will now be extended until June 12.</p><p>The studio also offered an explanation for changes to the game's narrative, saying, "The Threads of Reunion storyline's absence in this version was never intended as a removal from Infinity Nikki's narrative--its associated outfit remain on our development roadmap." The post says that these story elements are still planned for a future update.</p><p>It's a relatively common practice to offer in-game currency as compensation for issues in the world of gacha games. Players will be able to redeem 120 Diamonds and one Energy Crystal every day from June 5-12, for a total of 960 Diamonds and eight Energy Crystals. Players will also receive 360 Starlit Crystals as compensation for the Starlit Pursuit feature being pushed back until Version 1.6.</p>

            <p>Nintendo will be present at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> 2025, having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-skipping-gamescom-2024-report">skipped the event last year</a>.</p>
<p>The company confirmed it would be returning to the annual German event, which is the highest attended gaming convention in the world, in a post on social media.</p>
<p>"Mark your calendar in red: Nintendo will be back at<a href="https://x.com/gamescom"> @gamescom</a> in 2025," Nintendo's German X account announced, adding it is "[looking] forward to welcoming you to Cologne from August 20th to 24th!"</p>

<p>Yes, Gamescom will be held in August, which - as I'm sure you're aware - is after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Nintendo Switch 2</a> releases. So, with that in mind, what can those attending the convention expect to see from the Mario maker?</p>
<p>Well, Nintendo hasn't shared specifics. However,  two of Nintendo's biggest first party games <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> will have already been released by the time Gamescom comes around, though it seems likely these will be available for players to demo while in Cologne.</p>
<p>"Yes, everyone might have been expecting Mario, but Bananza's brawny obliteration is far better suited to his one-time enemy," our former EIC Tom Phillips wrote after going <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-reveals-a-proper-generational-upgrade-though-its-biggest-new-idea-remains-unproven">hands-on with Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p> <div>

<p>Meanwhile, other games coming to the Switch successor have also been available to try out at other events including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a>, so it again seems fair to assume it will be playable at Nintendo's Gamescom booth. Maybe we will hear a firm release date around then, as well.</p>
<p>Our Ed called Metroid Prime 4 "the best example of Switch 2's varied control capabilities" when he took the upcoming release for a spin earlier this year, though for now he isn't totally convinced by the mouse (as a reminder, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-good-are-switch-2s-mouse-controls-eurogamers-verdict-from-the-big-reveal-event">Switch 2 Joy-Con will boast mouse functionality on the console's release</a>).</p>
<p>"I played Metroid Prime 4 with each Joy-Con 2 placed on my thighs. This worked surprisingly well, with the controls still responsive despite being on an uneven surface. Nintendo told me the sensitivity can be tweaked too, allowing for smaller movements," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-is-the-best-example-of-switch-2s-varied-control-capabilities-but-you-might-want-to-work-on-your-thighs">Eurogamer's Metroid Prime 4 demo preview</a>.</p>
<p>"Still, how usable this method is will likely depend on the size of your thighs: if you don't have enough real estate to move the controller around, you'll be moving based on quick adjustments rather than smooth, sweeping motions." (Personally, I have quite generous thigh real estate.)</p>
<p>We will keep you posted with any more news regarding Gamescom 2025, and of course Switch 2, as and when we hear more.

			<p>The Overwatch 2 x Street Fighter 6 collaboration is going live today, introducing new content inspired by the latest entry in the CAPCOM fighting series, such as new skins and signature special moves as emotes.</p>
<p>The collaboration event, which will run from today May 20th until June 2nd, brings eight new skins, the highest number of any Overwatch 2 collaboration, for Hanzo, Juno, Sigma, Soldier 76, Kiriko, Winston, Widowmaker, and Zenyatta. These skins change the character's appearance and introduce new animations and visual effects inspired by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/">Street Fighter 6</a> central game mechanics. All eight skins can be purchased with the Street Fighter 6 Ultra Bundle, but those who wish to get only some of the eight skins can either purchase the Mega Bundle 1, which includes Legendary Juno as Chun-Li, Hanzo as Ryu, Zenyatta as Dhalsim and Epic Sigma as M.Bison, or Mega Bundle 2, which includes Legendary Kiriko as Juri and Widowmaker as Cammy in their fiercest forms, with Winston as Blanka and Soldier: 76 as Guile. All fighters are also available individually.</p>
<p>For the duration of the Overwatch 2 x Street Fighter 6 collaboration event, players will also be able to take part in special time-limited challenges that will reward them with up to 40,000 XP, exclusive themed sprays, voice lines, and the Street Fighter player title. More information on the collaboration event can be found on the game's <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24178101/overwatch-2-x-street-fighter-6/">official website</a>. A trailer showcasing the new content can also be watched below.</p>
