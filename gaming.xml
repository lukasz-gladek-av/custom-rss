		<p>One of the mysterious features of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> Joy-Con is the C-button, and now Nintendo has revealed all about what this new button does. C stands for GameChat.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is catching up to other consoles with social features and party chat built into the system. This is all triggered and controlled by using the C-button on the right Joy-Con, while the Switch 2 has a microphone built into it with noise cancelling to isolate your voice.</p>


<p>During the demonstration, Nintendo showed this mostly with all chat participants having their games displayed on screen, shrinking your own game view to accommodate a bar of other screens at the bottom. Those views can also be enhanced with the Nintendo Switch 2 Camera, able to overlay each person onto their screen.</p>
<p>GameChat requires a Nintendo Switch Online subscription, but Nintendo is giving a welcome offer until 31st March 2026.</p>
<p>Also tied in with GameChat is GameShare. This is a new game feature that allows you to share a game with up to four players, either over local wireless or through GameChat, enabling split-screen and shared screen multiplayer games to work with multiple systems. This feature is applied on a game-by-game basis, starting with 51 Worldwide Games, and needs to be patched into older Nintendo Switch titles, and will also come to select Switch 2 games.</p>

<p>The only concern we have with all of this is that the frame rate of all the shared views were really, really quite low frame rate. Like, really bad low frame rate.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has been revealed, and alongside it, we've gotten our first real look at one of the expected launch titles, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-9-success-nintendo-switch-2/">Mario Kart World</a>. Also, it won't be available on the original Nintendo Switch. Mario Kart World is a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive game.</p>
<p>Nintendo's arcade racing series is arguably one of the biggest games in its portfolio, with Mario Kart 8 having sold more than <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html">67.35 million</a> copies at the time of writing. So it makes sense that this latest iteration is going bigger than any other in the franchise, with the ability to have races with up to 24 racers at once.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 – 4.2.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DXUmjX7DsP8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Mario Kart World opened the Direct, showing off new tracks and kart styles, along with new designs for races on water, a new style of airplane-looking wings for the flying sections, wall-driving, and the ability to drive off the tracks and go "virtually everywhere" to make it to the finish line.</p>
<p>There's also a free-roam mode, which basically makes it look like the Mario Kart equivalent of Forza Horizon. We also got a look at plenty of shots of some of the new power-ups players can use, making characters go big-mode, or take control of massive trucks that let you smash through the competition.</p>
<p>It's a bit of a surprise that Mario Kart World will be an exclusive title for the Nintendo Switch 2, as many would have expected the title to be available on the millions of Nintendo Switch consoles already in the hands of players.</p>
<p>But by the same token, having what you could say is Nintendo's biggest Mario-based series exclusive to its new console could be a huge part of driving console sales for the Nintendo Switch 2. If too many of the games are still available on the original Nintendo Switch, the 100 million+ players who already have a Nintendo Switch will be more reluctant to leave their original Switch behind.</p>
<p>There was plenty more news about the actual Nintendo Switch 2 console during today's Direct, but there will be more proper details about Mario Kart World still to come. We'll find out much more about Mario Kart World in a separate livestream event this coming April 17, 2025 at 6am PT/9am ET.</p>

<p>The function behind the mysterious “C” button on the new Nintendo Switch 2 has been revealed, adding a new built-in chat feature that should feal very familiar to Discord users. Players have been speculating on what the C button could be in the weeks leading up to today’s Nintendo Switch 2 Direct.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-switch-2-will-feature-gamechat-its-own-built-in-version-of-discord">Nintendo Switch 2 Will Feature GameChat, Its Own Built-In Version of Discord</h2>



<p>Hitting the “C” button will open the new GameChat program, which includes several features you’d see in third-party chat programs like Discord. Players will be able to chat with one another in a call, share their screens, and appear on video (with the new external Switch 2 camera). This feature was the first primary new feature shown during the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will also include a built-in microphone, that Nintendo claims will be able to pick up your voice “clearly from a distance” even if there’s noise around you. GameChat will work in both handheld mode and while in a stand. It’s clear though that the Switch 2 is limited in how well it can display shared streams from other players, as the trailer shown at the Direct showed them having a very low frame rate.</p>



<p>A Nintendo Switch Online membership will be required to use GameChat, however, it will be available without a membership for a limited “open-access” period. Any Switch 2 user will be able to use GameChat without a Nintendo Switch Online membership until March 31, 2026.</p>



<p>Is GameChat what you were hoping for out of the Ninendo Switch 2’s “C” button? Let us know which in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Nintendo has announced during the Nintendo Direct that the Switch 2 will support up to 120 FPS, HDR, and 4K.</p>



<p>The announcement also revealed that the Nintendo Switch 2 will have a 1080p screen.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that not all games on the Nintendo Switch 2 will be at 120 FPS, as a small disclaimer at the bottom of the segment specifically said, “120fps only available in compatible games”.</p>



<p>Announced at the Direct was also the first Nintendo Switch 2 game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-as-nintendo-switch-2-launch-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mario Kart World</a>, which you can learn more about here.</p>

<p>To demonstrate the Switch 2's mouse controls, Nintendo showed a new game called <em>Drag x Drive</em>, planned for Summer 2025. This dual-mouse controlled game lets you control a player in a <em>Rocket League</em>-style 3 on 3 basketball match. Sliding one mouse is used to move your character while waving the other can be used to shoot or wave to other players to call for the ball. Players were also shown rolling up halfpipes near the basket for massive dunks.</p>

<p>An optional Nintendo Switch 2 camera connected to the system dock will let you appear on screen and video chat over gameplay, or in a small circle next to your character. The GameChat feature will require Nintendo Switch Online membership, or without through March 31, 2026.</p>


<p>The Switch 2 will feature a 7.9" LCD display with "approximately double the pixels" of the original Switch, on a 1080p screen that supports up to 120 fps and "more vivid" HDR colors. When docked, the system will support resolutions up to 4K, and includes a cooling fan to "help keep performance stable."</p>

<p>The Switch 2 will include 256 GB of internal storage. Players can add additional storage only through MicroSD Express cards, which will "make high-speed data transfers possible." Regular MicroSD cards that work on Switch will not be compatible with the new console. Game Cards for the Switch 2 resemble the shape of those for the original Switch, but will be in red and feature "much faster data reading speeds," Nintendo announced.</p>
<p>As seen previously, the Joy-Cons will be bigger than on the original Switch, and feature larger shoulder buttons on the inside edges. The system itself has a larger, "more sturdy" stand that can be adjusted in multiple angles. A second USB-C outlet on the top of the system will allow for easier charging and connections.</p>
<p>Third-party publishers announced a number of ports for the Switch 2, including <em>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, Hades II, Street Fighter VI, Split Fiction, EA Sports FC, Madden NFL, Hogwarts Legacy </em>(with new Mouse Controls)<em>, Yakuza 0 Director's Cut, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, and Hitman: World of Assassination</em>.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch Online memberships will carry over to Switch 2. And Switch 2 owners who subscribe to the Expansion Pack will get access to a library of Nintendo Gamecube games including <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em>,&nbsp;<em>Soulcalibur II, F-Zero GX </em>at launch, with more to be added in the future. These games will feature "sharper graphics and higher resolution" than the original releases, Nintendo said. A replica wireless GameCube controller will also be available for purchase by Nintendo Switch Online members.</p>
<p><em>This is a developing story and will be updated as new information comes in.</em></p>

                <p>The Nintendo Switch 2's full unveiling on April 2 has confirmed one of its most exciting new features: mouse functionality. You can indeed use the console's new Joy-Con controllers like a computer mouse, opening up possibilities for point-and-click adventures and strategy games to be an even better experience on the system.</p><p>In an overview of the Switch 2 hardware, Nintendo confirmed that both the left and right Joy-Cons on the system, which are also bigger and more ergonomic than their predecessors, can be turned on their side and used like a computer mouse. The Direct didn't expand too much on the mouse functionality, other than noting that mouse controls will only be available in certain games.</p><p>Nintendo later demonstrated a wheelchair sports-inspired game called Drag x Drive designed to make the most of the unique dual mouse controls, but it will be interesting to see how many developers make use of the unique control scheme. From everything Nintendo has shown so far, the Joy-Con 2's mouse mode doesn't look as comfortable to use for long stretches of gaming as a conventional mouse, but it could have interesting uses in porting PC games to the Switch 2.</p><p>Nintendo first teased Joy-Con mouse functionality for the Switch 2 in its announcement video for the console.

Nintendo has finally revealed the release date of its forthcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-live-everything-announced-as-it-happens">Switch 2</a> console.
</p>
<p>
The Switch 2 will be released on 5th June. More details to follow.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo revealed the news at today's Switch 2 Direct, alongside a look at the launch line-up - including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-announced-as-switch-2-launch-title-complete-with-24-player-races-new-modes-and-more">brand new Mario Kart World</a>.
</p>

</figure>
<p>Showing off the new console, Nintendo finally gave us a look at the new C-button, which initiates Game Chat to communicate with others while playing. To assist, a Nintendo Switch 2 Camera is being released alongside the console.</p>
<p>Console game sharing has been included, so players can play together on separate consoles using just one copy of the game. This even works with Game Chat, though is only compatible with certain games.</p>
<p>So what's new in Switch 2?</p>
<p>The LCD screen is 7.9 inches wide, with double the pixels of the original Switch. It's 1080p and offers up to 120fps and HDR support.</p>
<p>The Joy-Con 2 attach magnetically and have larger control sticks. Mouse controls have been confirmed, usable across both controllers.</p>
<p>The console's built-in speakers have been enhanced, while the console has a built-in microphone for voice chat - complete with noise-cancelling technology to filter out other sounds. 3D audio will be possible with headphones (in supported games) and with the built-in speaker via a later update.</p>
<p>The console also has two USB-C ports at the top and bottom, used for the new camera or for charging in tabletop mode.</p>
<p>Internal storage will be 256GB - that's eight times more than the original Switch. Reading and writing data will be faster too.</p>
<p>The dock will offer 4K support and HDR support in TV mode. It also has a built-in fan to keep the console cool and performance stable.</p>
<p>The game cards look the same as Switch but are red and with faster speeds. The console will be compatible with microSD Express cards for high speed data transfer. Original Switch microSD cards will not be compatible.</p>
<p>Lastly, the new Pro Controller will include the C-button as well as new GL and GR buttons on the handles and an audio jack for headphones.</p>
<p>For those wishing to transfer data between Switch and Switch 2, this will be achievable with a Nintendo Online account to transfer save data, digital games, and more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>One of the biggest games coming to Nintendo Switch 2 is Mario Kart World, the next generation of kart racer and the first wholly new game in the series for over a decade, with huge free-roam racing at its core.</p>
<p>Mario Kart 9 will be launching exclusively for the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Kart World Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F56lyG9zbWU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Having been<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/16/mario-kart-9-teased-during-switch-2-reveal/"> teased during the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware reveal</a> back in January, Nintendo has now confirmed a lot of the rumour and speculation over the game.</p>
<p>Mario Kart 9 will now support up to 24-player races, doubling the player count from Mario Kart 8 and before. Additionally, there’s much larger and more ambitious maps and locales, bringing in new elements such as filling stations – first spotted as a Yoshi-branded motorway filling station in the January teaser. There was also DK Pass, a jungle setting, what looks like a Wario circuit, a haunted one and more. We’ll dive into this as soon as we can. Racing will span the globe, with changing time of day and weather to change the atmosphere.</p>

<p>You’ll take on sequences of 4 races in a cup, but there’s also new Knockout Tour that joins up race circuits as you race from one side of the map to the other, with elimination if you’re too low in the rankings, and a full free roam mode to just go off-piste as much as you want.</p>
<p>There’s plenty more teases in the trailer, including rail grinding and wall jumping, and some new power ups including giant mode, throwable hammers, a multi-hit coin block and more. You can even commandeer some world vehicles. Separately, you can eat food which gives some costume transformations.</p>
<p>More details will be revealed in a Mario Kart World Direct is coming on 17th April 2025.</p>
<p>Elsewhere we got a much better look at the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware. The new console builds on the familiar design and features of the Nintendo Switch, a hybrid console that can be used handheld, on TV or propped up on a tabletop, but that form has been evolved. The screen is larger, the Joy-Con have a new connection style, and there’s some new functionality as well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Direct is officially underway, and its first major announcement is&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>, a brand new game in the&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>Revealed as the first trailer during today's Direct,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>will feature many of your favorite faces from the series, as well as new playable characters like a Hammer Bro, a Moo Moo Meadows cow, and more.</p>

<p>As you'd probably expect,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>will be exclusive to the Switch 2; it won't be available for the first-gen Switch, so this is our very first confirmed first-party Switch 2 exclusive. Nintendo is promising a "vast world" with kart races taking place in regions that "span the globe".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mario-kart-world-switch-2-direct-luigi.jpg?itok=ayMu9lxd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mario-kart-world-switch-2-direct-luigi.jpg?itok=irpywLY8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>is the Switch 2's first Nintendo-developed exclusive.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will feature a classic Grand Prix system with a twist; not only will you be racing on four courses, but you'll also drive between each course "as part of the competition", according to Nintendo.</p>

<p>Races will support 24 drivers, "the most in series history", and there will be a number of gameplay modes on offer, including the non-stop world tour-style Knockout Tour mode. Racers are eliminated in this mode based on where they're placed at each checkpoint.</p>

<p>Uniquely,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>also has a Free Roam mode, which will allow you to drive around the game's world and explore off-course "wherever your heart takes you". Not only that, but the Free Roam mode supports multiplayer, so you can enjoy it alongside your friends.</p>

<p>As you'd probably expect,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>will be available as a Switch 2 launch title, and you'll be able to get more information about it on April 17th, when a&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>-focused Nintendo Direct show will be held.</p>

            <p>It is time once again to shake our fists at the sky over the untimely, messy splintering of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> as a cultural phenomenon. Yesterday, Youtuber Jamrock Hobo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dde8H1YhP-U">leaked a presentation</a> for Locust City - An Elysium Story, an abandoned project that would have expanded the original RPG's detective odd-couple premise by having you control two returning characters simultaneously, each with their own furiously personified skill tree and Thought Cabinet of percolating ideas. </p>
<p>Cancelled in February and hitherto known as Project X7, Locust City was to star Cuno and Cunoesse, a pair of foul-mouthed kids from the streets of Revachol. I spent minimal time with the pair when I reviewed Disco Elysium, because they are vicious brats, but like every character in the game, they have many facets - it's possible to get on Cuno's good side and even recruit him as an ally. As such, I'm intrigued to see how his and Cunoesse's story might have proceeded in Locust City, and sad that I will almost certainly never get to play the game.</p>
<p>Locust City was seemingly called Locust City because one of Cuno's treasured in-game possessions was to be a locust city in a cardboard box. According to the leaked presentation - which dates back to around nine months before the cancellation, and features commentary from now-departed ZA/UM writer Dora Klindžić - the box was to serve as an evolving allegory for his emotions and values. It was also something of a town management subgame: Cuno could put stuff in the locust box to create buildings and facilities, altering the chemistry of his insect world, and potentially fomenting civil wars.</p>
<p>The game outside the box is described as a "single player cooperative" experience. You'd have controlled Cuno and Cunoesse simultaneously, picking one as leader during exploration, terrain interaction and dialogue, and swapping between them to make use of their different capacities. Each character was to receive their own Thought Cabinet, with familiar unlocks such as Mazovian Socio-Economics, and set of RPG skills, including old Disco Elysium standbys like Half Light and Electro-Chemistry. As with Disco Elysium, these skills would have been presences in dialogue, and each character would have had their own voiced narrator - there's a sample of the voice-acting at the end of the video.</p>
<p>The pair would also have picked up on different aspects of their surroundings, extending into the audio design - the presentation gives the example of Cuno overhearing the turning of a book page, while Cunoesse is preoccupied with the gushing of a fountain. As for how you might use their skills in tandem, they would have shared an inventory and been able to combine skills for certain skill checks, but the more fascinating dynamic is that they would have developed their intellectual lives in response to each other. The presentation broaches the prospect of "chain thoughts" about specific topics, triggering further interactions and affecting their overall relationship.</p>
<p>I'm likely falling into the trap of having only glowing things to say of a game I'll never get to analyse, but it sounds like a terrific elaboration of Disco. It takes H.D.B's multitude of garrulous self-manifestations and stretches them precariously between two skulls. I'm also interested to experience the not-unhopeful, post-revolutionary dystopia of Revachol through the eyes of lost children, rather than a perma-hungover amnesiac.</p>
<p>It's possible some of the thinking here lives on at the three "Disco Elysium successor" studios formed in the wake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-expansion-reportedly-cancelled-with-a-quarter-of-staff-at-risk-of-redundancy">acrimonious ZA/UM firings and subsequent legal action</a> - that's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yet-another-studio-formed-of-disco-elysium-alumni-has-announced-a-cerebral-sci-fi-rpg-just-to-confuse-you">Dark Math Games</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-disco-elysium-devs-are-working-on-a-spiritual-successor-at-new-studio-longdue-though-robert-kurvitz-and-aleksander-rostov-arent-involved">Longdue</a> and especially <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sure-why-not-third-group-of-former-disco-elysium-devs-announce-revolutionary-new-rpg-studio">Summer Eternal</a>, who appear to have the most former Disco Elysium developers (including Klindžić) on their books and appear closest in their values to the original development team.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nintendo has officially announced Mario Kart World for the Nintendo Switch 2. After being teased during the console’s initial reveal, we have confirmation it’s skidding onto the Switch 2 as a debut launch title.</p>



<p>The long-awaited reveal came during the company’s Nintendo Direct Switch 2 unveiling event on April 2. Mario Kart World, AKA Mario Kart 9, is the follow-up to 2014’s Mario Kart 8 for the Wii U. The game was also rereleased on the original Nintendo Switch in 2017 as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. Since then, it has grown to receive dozens of new tracks and many new characters for players.</p>



<p>But it’s time for a pit stop as we’re ready to go full throttle in Mario Kart World.</p>

<p>Mario Kart World will support races with up to 24 players, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mario-kart-9-could-feature-new-24-player-races/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirming what many believed</a> after the original tease in January, and introduces new dynamic levels and even rail grinding!</p>



<p>We’ve only seen a handful of Mario Kart World footage, but I can already tell you we’re going to lose hundreds of hours to Mario-theme circuits all over again!</p>

                <p>After being glimpsed during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/switch-2-nintendo-direct-april-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6391/" data-ref-id="2900-6391">Switch 2 reveal</a>, Nintendo formally announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/">Mario Kart 9</a> during this week's Switch 2 Direct livestream--the game is officially called Mario Kart World. This new look at the kart-racing game showed off several of the familiar faces who'll be hitting the track, including everyone's favorite plumber Mario, several members of the Mushroom Kingdom, and other racers like Donkey Kong.</p><p>Mario Kart World is a launch title for Nintendo Switch 2. Nintendo will share more details on Mario Kart World during a special Nintendo Direct on April 17.</p><p>Mario Kart World looks like a major step up from Mario Kart 8. It features support for up 24 racers, which is the most in franchise history. There are also appear to be new vehicles, including jet skis and jets, while players can now grind on rails and flip across walls. Mario Kart World also includes time-of-day and weather conditions that change throughout races. Players are free to drive off-road "virtually everywhere," Nintendo said during the presentation.</p><p>Check out the trailer below to get a closer look at Mario Kart World. Nintendo said it is releasing exclusively on Switch 2, so it seems it won't also be playable on the original Switch via <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/" data-ref-id="1100-6527615">backwards compatibility. </a></p><p>The classic Grand Prix mode returns, along with what's called Knockout Tour. In this mode, players take part in races from one corner of the world to another with checkpoints--players are eliminated if they're last to reach certain checkpoints. There is also a Free Roam mode that allows players to basically go anywhere they want for a scenic drive and to take photos with friends on the road.</p><p>Mario Kart 9 has some big boots to fill, as it's a sequel to one of the best-selling Nintendo games of all time, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. As of December 31, 2024, Mario Kart 8 has sold 67 million units on Switch and it has a significant lead on other top-selling games like Animal Crossing: New Horizons (47.44 million units sold), Super Smash Bros. Ultimate (35.88 million units sold), and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (32.62 million units sold).</p>

                <p>2024 was a brutal year for the video game industry, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-layoffs-sadly-continue-with-more-cuts-at-ubisoft/1100-6525884/" data-ref-id="1100-6525884">thousands of jobs lost due to massive layoffs</a>. So far, that trend has continued in 2025 with recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fable-co-developer-eidos-montreal-lays-off-staff-the-latest-cuts-from-embracer/1100-6530502/" data-ref-id="1100-6530502">layoffs at Eidos Montreal</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-callisto-protocol-dev-cuts-more-jobs-in-gamings-latest-layoffs/1100-6529696/" data-ref-id="1100-6529696">Striking Distance Studios</a>. Now, Shams Jorjani--the CEO of Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios--is speaking out about the mass layoffs and calling for accountability from the CEOs who make those decisions.</p><p>"I wish that our industry hadn't shed almost… 30, 40, 50,000 jobs over the past two years," said Jorjani during an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/helldivers-2s-big-challenge-how-to" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>. "A lot of people at the top were making very unsound business decisions, and there's very little accountability on their part. Who among these executives is stepping down? Or slashing their salaries? What's happening is that regular developers are paying the cost of that. That's a terrible way to run our industry."</p><p>Jorjani went on to explain that he isn't against seeing studios expand, but he argues that growth should be responsibly paced for the long-term health of the business and the employees who work there. He added that his "first priority is to make sure that people [at Arrowhead] have jobs for many years." During the same interview, Jorjani noted that the turnaround of Helldivers 2 was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-devsceo-was-inspired-by-no-mans-sky-turnaround/1100-6530533/" data-ref-id="1100-6530533">inspired by No Man's Sky's comeback story</a>.</p><p>Helldivers 2 creative director Johan Pilestedt <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-boss-discusses-gaming-industrys-mass-layoffs-and-what-caused-them/1100-6530246/" data-ref-id="1100-6530246">recently made similar remarks</a> about layoffs and suggested that the video game industry would be in a more sustainable place if companies were making several different types of games rather than a constant cycle of new battle-royale titles.</p>

The team was tiny—with only an artist, programmer, and producer—so they were planning for the Eldritch fishing horror to be story-light.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We can't really make a narrative game," read a quote by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dredge</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> programmer Joel Mason on an early slide in the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dredge</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and Yarn Spinner: Building Narrative with Open Source talk at the Game Developers Conference. Jon Manning, narrative technologies lead at Yarn Spinner, spoke about how the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dredge</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> team used the program to develop what turned out to be one of the best narrative games of 2023.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dredge</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> made use of Yarn Spinner, an open source dialogue tool used by a number of award-winning games, including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A Short Hike</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A Night In The Woods</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Little Kitty, Big City</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

"Denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and acceptance. The characters at the islands represented these different stages of grief. The fishmonger on greater marrow represents depression."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-star-wars-outlaws-poker-style-mini-game-helped-to-define-its-tone" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Star Wars Outlaws' poker-style mini-game helped to define its tone</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While this idea was eventually abandoned midway through development, it helped solidify the structure of the story and shaped many of the characters found in the 10 hour base adventure. Black Salt Games began writing out their story in a word processor, but found that they would need to work directly within the engine once they created a massive amount of dialogue.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Now, dialogue systems are deceptively complicated. I happen to think that they are probably the second most complex system in a game, and certainly the most complicated user facing system," Manning said.

Lines would have different prompts and commands that brought up a variety of features to pair with dialogue.

It could track how long the player had gone without talking to a certain character, prompting a specific response when that character finally pops up on their screen again. It could trigger visual elements—like a lightning strike—in the background for dramatic effect at exactly the right time. It also lets the developers add and remove other elements by editing text in Yarn Spinner, making iteration a simpler process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Seeing the dialogue happen inside the overall gameplay exposed a lot of issues, because seeing it happen live just made it reveal weird connections or janky expositions in a way that you simply don't see when you're reading a linear document," Manning said.

            <p>Nintendo has shared fresh details on its next entry in the Mario Kart series.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">new Mario Kart game was first teased back in January</a>, during the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-live-everything-announced-as-it-happens">Switch 2</a> console announcement. At this time, though, Nintendo kept details pretty slim. Sure, we had some fun speculating about what was shown in that very brief clip, with fans pointing out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kongs-new-look-in-switch-2-mario-kart-approved-by-former-rare-artist">Donkey Kong had a new look</a>, there were 24 places on the starting line and what also appeared to be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-9-fan-speculation-points-to-fuel-tank-gameplay">suggestion players will need to conserve fuel while navigating the chaos that is Mario Kart racing</a>. But, actual concrete details from Nintendo itself, well, there really wasn't much.</p>
<p>That has all changed today, though, thanks to Nintendo's dedicated Switch 2 Direct. Rather than just being a little teaser to round out a different teaser, today's presentation gave us a full-fat look at what is now officially called Mario Kart World.</p>

<p>Along with returning faces such as Mario, Luigi, Toad and Peach, this upcoming game will also include chaning weather, and - rather excitingly - the ability to drive basically anywhere. There will also be grinding, and wall running (of sorts, you are still in a vehicle).
</p>
<p>As for the courses, there is a healthy dose of all new raceways, and the abilty to just roam about. As for that roaming, the trailer showed jet skis and snowmobiles for getting around on. Also, mistake me if I am wrong, but was Peach on a bike in a dress?
</p>
<p>Mario Kart will release on the same day as Nintendo Switch 2, but I guess that date will come later.</p>
<p>
A dedicated Mario Kart World Direct is also coming on 17th April, at 2pm UK.</p>

The first Switch started by selling faster in its first two days than the Wii during the same period of its life, a record. It’s also on track to beating the DS as Nintendo’s highest-selling console ever, a milestone it was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/605948/nintendo-switch-lifetime-sales-nintendo-ds">close to in February</a>.</p><p>Can the Switch 2 live up to that?</p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>It’s hard to know what Nintendo has in store.</p><p>Rumors abound, but Nintendo has a history of carving its own path and going a surprising route. My colleague Andrew Webster wrote this shortly after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock">the Alarmo clock</a> was announced:</p><div><blockquote><p>The rapid succession of announcements and reveals from the company over the last few weeks has been surprising and indicative of its idiosyncratic nature.

Nevertheless, there was still lots of speculation about what the Switch 2 could possibly do. Theories were put forth that the new Joy-Cons contained some kind of mouse functionality and that the extra button on the right Joy-Con was related to some kind of party chat feature. Hopefully, Nintendo will let us know those if theories were correct during the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct on Wednesday, April 2nd bright and early at 9 AM.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/606504/nintendo-switch-2-direct-new-time">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Here’s our video about the Nintendo Switch 2.</p><p>I <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DE44_b_xIY0/">recorded this</a> with a sleeping baby in the next room, so I apologize if my voice sounds a bit quiet.
