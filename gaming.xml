            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/1/24310181/nzxt-pc-rental-program-gamers-nexus-investigation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An hour-long video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pomC1CfpC0">published Saturday</a> by Gamers Nexus, a YouTube channel focused on PC gaming hardware, accuses NZXT’s PC rental program of “bait-and-switch” tactics, with prices and specs that are constantly changing.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/1/24211490/nzxt-flex-desktop-gaming-pc-rental-service-subscription-nvidia-gpu-games">Flex program</a> allows customers to rent prebuilt gaming PCs starting at $59 per month (not including a mouse, keyboard, or monitor). But Gamers Nexus shows that NZXT changes the specs and prices of PC models “day-to-day in some instances” and offers PCs with very different setups under similar model names depending on whether you are looking to buy or rent. The rapidly changing prices also obscure the potential value of listed “discounts” as the packages shift back and forth.</p><p>The video shows one instance of <a href="https://nzxt.com/product/player-three">NZXT’s Player: Three PC</a> listed as having an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super graphics card, along with an Intel Core i7-13700KF with the “buy” option selected. However, viewing the same PC model under the “subscribe” option showed the same processor with a less powerful Nvidia RTX 4070 Ti. </p><p>Despite the different GPUs, it said NZXT listed both models as having the same estimated frames per second in games like <em>Starfield</em> and <em>Call of Duty Modern Warfare</em>.</p><p>Gamers Nexus also highlights other elements of the Flex program, like the pricing scheme that leads customers to pay more money than simply buying a PC outright and “aggressive” terms of service. <em>The Verge</em> reached out to NZXT with a request for comment but didn’t immediately hear back, and we haven’t seen a response posted in its community areas or social media channels.</p><p>“We just think this is a scam at this point,” Steve Burke, the editor-in-chief at Gamers Nexus, says during the video. “The performance claims alone are hugely misleading, especially since the only difference in one of these that’s meaningful is the word ‘Super,’ which a lot of people — especially those who are potentially renting or buying a pre-built — won’t catch.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’m writing today with some news about <em>ANTONBLAST</em>‘s <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,370 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Nintendo Switch</a> version. </p><p>were very optimistic about launching the Nintendo Switch release day and date with the steam version on December 3 and have been working down to the wire to make sure it’s the absolute best it can be. However, it’s become apparent today that this version will not be ready on time for that date.</p><p>The reason for this is simple: We need more time to make sure that this version of the game is running at peak performance and meeting our own high standards, as well as <a title="Platforms > Nintendo [21,187 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a>‘s.</p><p>I can appreciate that this delay may be frustrating and I’d like to take this opportunity to personally apologize for the short notice.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Our partners at Nintendo have been incredible to work with, and together we are committed to giving Switch players the best experience possible. We are now in the process of sorting out the new release date on a schedule that works for all parties.</p><p>While I don’t have a specific date to announce today, we are aiming to release on Switch before end of year and will keep our fans updated every step of the way.</p><p>The Steam version of <em>ANTONBLAST</em> will launch as planned on December 3 at 12:00 p.m. ET.</p><p>For Kickstarter backers who wanted a Nintendo Switch key: You can swap to steam on your Fangamer survey at anytime, or simply hold off until the Switch version launches.</p><p>We’ll be doing a Twitch livestream that morning in anticipation of the launch, answering fan questions and showcasing the game. I hope I can see you all there!</p><p>Thank you all for your patience and support… we couldn’t do this without you.</p><p>—Tony Grayson, on behalf of Summitsphere</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Valve has removed a game from its British Steam storefront following a request from the UK's counter-terrorism unit.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1714420/Fursan_alAqsa_The_Knights_of_the_AlAqsa_Mosque/">The FPS/TPS Fursan al-Aqsa: The Knights of the Al-Aqsa Mosque</a> - which describes itself as "address[ing] the Israel x Palestine conflict from a Palestinian perspective" - was removed when Steam contacted developer Nidal Nijm to inform him it had "received a request from authorities in the UK to block the game and have applied such country restrictions".</p>
<p>In an email to the Brazilian developer, Steam allegedly said: "We've received a request from authorities in the UK to block the game and have applied such country restrictions". When the developer reportedly asked if there was "a specific reason" for the UK ban and said "my game is not too much different than any other shooter game on Steam, like Call of Duty", he was told:</p>
<p>"We were contacted by the Counter Terrorism Command of the United Kingdom, specifically the Counter Terrorism Internet Referral Unit (CTIRU). As with any authority for a region the [sic] oversees and governs what content can be made available, we have to comply with their requests."</p><p>In an email to <a href="https://www.404media.co/steam-removes-oct-7-game-at-request-of-uk-counter-terrorism-unit/">404</a>, a counter-terrorism spokesperson said: "The CTIRU works closely with a range of technology, social media and online service providers, but we do not comment on specific content or any communication we may have with specific platforms or providers."</p>
<p>"The region lock of my game in the UK was clearly due to political reasons," Nijm wrote in a statement to the same publication.</p>
<p>"I do not blame Valve nor Steam, the blame is on the UK government and authorities that are pissed off by a video game," Nijm said. "On their flawed logic, the most recent Call of Duty <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> should be banned as well. As you play as an American soldier and go to Iraq to kill Iraqi people. What I can say is that we see clearly the double standards."</p>
<p>The game - which was updated to include the 7th October attack given it released in April 2022 - calls itself "the Palestinian <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/max-payne">Max Payne</a> on steroids" and the "most BASED game of all times". It has already been banned in Germany and Australia for not going through the countries' respective classification boards.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1714420/Fursan_alAqsa_The_Knights_of_the_AlAqsa_Mosque/">The game</a> is still available to buy online outside of the UK, including the US. In the UK, however, the Steam page simply throws up an "Oops, sorry!" message, saying, "this item is currently unavailable in your region".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Personally, I’d go for the Disc Edition—it’s just $50 more, and you get the flexibility of physical games, which you can buy, sell, or trade later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you prefer the Digital Edition, the NBA 2K25 bundle is a smart pick if you can find it in stock, as it includes a game.

Long answer: While major hardware discounts are rarely a sure thing on brand-new releases, Cyber Monday might bring some unexpected deals. In the announcement for Sony's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-ps5-black-friday-sale-2024">lineup of holiday deals</a>, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-black-friday-2024-sale-predictions">PS5 Pro</a> was (unsurprisingly) nowhere to be found. However, some retailers could surprise shoppers with modest discounts or exclusive PS5 Pro bundles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-review">PS5 Slim</a>, for example, was released last year at a similar time and ended up getting a free game bundle (Spider-Man 2 or Modern Warfare 3) <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-the-ps5-slim-spider-man-2-and-call-of-duty-ps5-black-friday-bundles">at the end of November</a>. We’ll be keeping an eye out to see if any retailers step up with a Cyber Monday special.</p></div><p id="playstation-vr-2"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="PlayStation VR 2">PlayStation VR 2 is $349 for Black Friday</h2></p><div catalogid="5daeac12-bdd9-4053-b6ac-ac98bab9c7de" id="211422"><div id="211422" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>PlayStation VR 2 - Horizon Call of the Mountain Bundle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the best Cyber Monday deals is the PSVR2 Horizon: Call of the Mountain bundle, now just $349—a massive $251 discount. It’s the same price as the standalone PSVR2 during this sale, but the bundle is the clear winner, including an incredible game to showcase the headset's power.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At this price, the PSVR2 is a strong competitor to budget-friendly options like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyber-monday-meta-quest-3s-deal-2024">Meta Quest</a>, offering a premium VR experience at an accessible price. If you’ve been waiting to step into high-performance virtual reality, this deal is too good to pass up.</p></div><p id="ps5-ssd-deals"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="PS5 SSD deals">Cyber Monday Deals on PS5 SSDs</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">PS5 games continue to grow in size, and with SSD prices climbing in 2024, finding the right storage at a great price is more important than ever. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday</a> now here, there are plenty of discounts to explore. For example, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3bgo2?object_uuid=b2079bf5-f109-4861-be4c-78e53621e28a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">WD Black SN850X 2TB SSD</a> with a heatsink is currently available for $133.99, offering excellent value.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keep in mind that not all SSDs are compatible with the PS5. To ensure optimal performance, you'll need a PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 drive with a minimum read speed of 5,500MB/s to match the console's internal storage. To simplify your search, we've curated a list of SSDs that meet or exceed these requirements.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>PS Plus Cyber Monday Deal (Save 30%)</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/20/54151004493-d618819f1a-k-1732112194364.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Save up to 30% on PS Plus during Black Friday 2024.

<p>"From Tokyo 2099 to the Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda, and to Hydra Charteris Base and Klyntar, Galacta has assembled more heroes to take on the ultimate challenge," NetEase teases. "Who will you choose as your main to save the Multiverse on December 6th?"</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals is an upcoming free-to-play, team-based PVP shooter for PC with the backing of Chinese publishing giant NetEase.</p>
<p>Described as a "thrilling, fast-paced, cooperative gameplay experience", Marvel Rivals pits teams of six against each other as they fight it out over a variety of destructible environments with characters from across the Marvel universe. Head of Marvel Games Jay Ong said Marvel Rivals is one of the team's "most ambitious game development projects", and one the developer has "poured [its] heart and soul into".</p>
<p>Marvel Rivals finally releases in full on 6th December 2024.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-tos-contains-a-non-disparagement-clause-to-prevent-players-giving-negative-reviews">NetEase was forced to apologise earlier this year</a> when players and content creators hit back at Marvel Rivals for a playtest terms of service contract that prohibited players from making "statements that are detrimental to the reputation of the game".</p>

In terms of video game deals, quite a few have caught our eye that have been brought over into the retailer's Cyber Monday sale, including an excellent discount on the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aB1LZE?object_uuid=2b1cd6e2-864e-4a08-b68c-ca70a8b4fe28&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0C93LGYCN" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1 for Switch</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Switch owners can enjoy a nice 63% discount on this collection, which has brought its price down to just $18.74. According to price tracker <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0C93LGYCN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">camelcamelcamel</a>, it's the lowest price its hit so far which is a massive bonus. A lot of deals like this won't stick around long after Cyber Monday, so if you've been wanting to add this stealthy series to your game library, now's the time.</p><div catalogid="e6bf14dc-1201-4240-b1c4-1ff7a2ef1ca2" id="212612"><div id="212612" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol.1</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There's plenty in this collection to keep you busy all throughout the holidays, too. It comes with Metal Gear, Metal Gear 2, Metal Gear Solid, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, Metal Gear (NES/FC version), and Snake’s Revenge. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-the-first-preview">Metal Gear Solid Delta</a> hopefully dropping sometime soon, there's never been a better time to sneak back into this series of games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon's got even more gaming deals in its Cyber Monday sale that are worth adding to your virtual shopping cart. Some big ones that got our attention were <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-cyber-monday-deal-2024">Star Wars Outlaws, which remains on sale at $40 from Black Friday</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-cyber-monday-deal-2024">Sonic X Shadow Generations, which is down to just $30</a>. These just scratch the surface of what the retailer currently has available, though. To see more of our favorite deals outside of games, have a look at our breakdown of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-cyber-monday-best-deals-2024">Amazon's Cyber Monday sale</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Will the Deals Change for Cyber Monday?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of the same deals from Black Friday are likely to return for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/cyber-monday">Cyber Monday 2024</a>, including some that sold out or expired. Retailers often stagger their inventory, reserving stock for each major sale event. This means Cyber Monday will bring back popular deals alongside brand-new, never-before-seen offers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Traditionally, Black Friday was the in-store shopping frenzy, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-vs-cyber-monday">Cyber Monday focused on online deals</a>. While those lines have blurred, Cyber Monday remains the top event for online-focused retailers like Amazon, Newegg, Dell, HP, and Lenovo. Even traditional retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart roll out exclusive online-only offers. Amazon, in particular, has already shifted gears to highlight its Cyber Monday deals early, so expect some amazing sales ahead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Hannah Hoolihan is a freelance writer who works with the Guides and Commerce teams here at IGN.</em></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Dec 1, 2024 3:16 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The leaked materials, which have details for a dual-fan ASRock Arc B570 Challenger OC GPU, suggest that the new chip may feature 18 Xe2 cores and 10GB of GDDR6 VRAM on a 160-bit memory bus.</p><p>The leak also indicates that Intel’s Arc B570 chip could come with the 8-pin PCIe power connector and a 2.6GHz GPU clock, along with support for HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 2.1. </p><p>The rumored specs for the Arc B570’s slightly more powerful counterpart — the Arc B580 — have been floating around as well. An early Amazon listing <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/intel-arc-b570-specs-leaked-18-xe2-cores-10gb-memory-and-pcie-4-0x8">spotted by <em>VideoCardz</em></a> suggests that the Arc B580 could arrive with 20 Xe2 cores, 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM on a 192-bit memory bus, a 2.8GHz GPU clock, and an 8-pin PCIe power connector.</p><p>Judging by these specs, it seems Intel’s Battlemage chips are designed to compete with more affordable graphics cards, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/24/23734022/nvidia-rtx-4060-ti-amd-rx-7600-gpu-graphics-card-benchmark-test">like the Nvidia RTX 4060 Ti and AMD Radeon RX 7600</a>. Though we still don’t know how much Intel’s new chips will cost, a product listing shared by <a href="https://x.com/momomo_us/status/1861788237456711881?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1861788237456711881%7Ctwgr%5E0f3b2be26b93fa4b7b0634731f5fc84a40464720%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2024%2F11%2F29%2F24309086%2Fintel-battlemage-gpu-leak-arc-b580-b570">@Momomo_us</a> shows Intel’s “Limited Edition” B580 card priced at $250 — less than the $399 RTX 4060Ti and $269 Radeon RX 7600.</p><p>The reveal of Intel’s new Battlemage GPUs is just days away, as the company confirmed that it will make an Arc-related announcement on December 3rd at 9AM ET from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/intelgaming">its YouTube channel</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Since he hasn’t been in a giant franchise…yet, his box office numbers aren’t as big as some of his contemporaries. However, he’s made up for it with nine acting Oscar nominations and two wins. His new film “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theroot.com/in-gladiator-ii-denzel-washington-is-a-villain-unlike-1851704950&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theroot.com/in-gladiator-ii-denzel-washington-is-a-villain-unlike-1851704950">Gladiator II</a></span>” is already creating buzz for a tenth nomination and has become one of his most successful films with its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theroot.com/black-hollywood-excellence-two-black-led-films-wicke-1851707332&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theroot.com/black-hollywood-excellence-two-black-led-films-wicke-1851707332">huge opening weekend</a></span>.</p><p>With the legend poised to take over the Broadway stage in “Othello,” then bring the project on screen, possibly appear in “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theroot.com/five-characters-we-want-to-see-denzel-washington-portra-1851696651&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theroot.com/five-characters-we-want-to-see-denzel-washington-portra-1851696651">Black Panther 3</a></span>,” once again work with Spike Lee, collaborate with Steve McQueen and make two more “Equalizer” films, we need to take a few moments and celebrate all things Denzel Washington with his highest grossing movies worldwide, per <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1778156289/?ref_=bo_hm_rd&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl1778156289/?ref_=bo_hm_rd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Box Office Mojo</a></span>. </p><p><em>This story originally appeared on The Root, our sister site, on Friday, November 29.</em></p></div></div><div><p>The amazing thing about “American Gangster” is that it has so many quotable moments and everyone has their favorite. It’s why we keep coming back to it over and over.</p></div><div><p>In just its first week of worldwide release, the follow up to the Oscar winning epic is already one of the acting icon’s most successful films. If it continues on its current path, it won’t take long for it to jump into the No. 1 spot. We know he’s supposed to be the villain, but how can we ever truly root against our king.</p></div><div><p>Denzel Washington and Ryan Reynolds isn’t a team we were expecting, but somehow their two different styles work in this fun, good vs. evil action film.</p></div><div><p>What makes Washington so fantastic in “Philadelphia” is how you can still discover something new in his performance all these years later. He and Tom Hanks are perfection here.</p></div><div><p>If you like government conspiracy thrillers and major movie stars, this ‘90s hit is probably one of your favorites. If we’re being honest, we weren’t expecting it to be this high.</p></div><div><p>In his first outing as “The Equalizer,” Denzel entered the action hero conversation with a brutal, violent trip to a big box hardware store. We’ll never look at Home Depot or Lowe’s the same way again.</p></div><div><p>This was meant to feel like a final chapter, but we’ll watch Washington “equalize” problems forever if he keeps making these awesome movies.</p></div><div><p>Just in case you’re wondering, that’s a franchise total of $573,798,455. Half a billion dollars for an action franchise led by a Black actor is a major deal.</p></div><div><p>Every time Spike Lee and Washington team up, it’s magic. The way “Inside Man” unravels its complicated web is beautiful and even more fun on subsequent viewings. And of course, in a ridiculously star-studded cast, Denzel is a spectacular anchor.</p></div><div><p>Spoiler alert for a movie from 2006: the time travel plot is a lot. Don’t think too hard about it or you’ll get a headache.</p></div><div><p>Not only were we not expecting this runaway train epic to crack the top 10, it’s also surprising to see how evenly split the box office is between domestic and international numbers. It brought in $81.5 million domestic and $86.2 million globally.</p></div><div><p>Despite a cast that includes Chris Pratt and Ethan Hawke, we’re giving all the credit for this western’s success to Washington. </p></div><div><p>Washington delivers another classic performance in “Flight,” but we’re still not happy about his character’s fate.</p></div><div><p>Washington and Gene Hackman go toe to toe in this thriller that somehow feels relevant again.</p></div><div><p>Word on the street is we’re getting <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2024/01/the-book-of-eli-prequel-series-john-boyega-shopping-network-1235799330/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2024/01/the-book-of-eli-prequel-series-john-boyega-shopping-network-1235799330/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“Book of Eli” prequel series</a></span> starring John Boyega. He’s an amazing actor who can definitely bring the emotional weight required for the role. But that doesn’t mean we don’t want a Washington cameo if possible.</p></div><div><p>As quadriplegic forensics investigator Lincoln Rhyme, Washington brilliantly conveys his character’s emotional upheaval without venturing into pity or mockery.</p></div><div><p>We’re not claiming this is one of his instant classics, but clearly some people enjoyed it. Even amongst John Travolta’s overacting, Washington is rock solid.</p></div><div><p>If you don’t like “Remember the Titans” we have serious questions about all your life choices.</p></div><div><p>Even when you’re a legend, they won’t all be winners. We’re totally blaming Mark Wahlberg for the lower box office total.</p></div><div><p>If this were a list of Washington’s best action movies, “Man on Fire” would definitely be in the top five. It’s his unmatched ability to draw you in and make you truly feel every single one of Creasy’s emotions that makes him so great.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4639adcc7eb3d1cf2173bf8c09dc0aed" data-recommend-id="image://4639adcc7eb3d1cf2173bf8c09dc0aed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1062" data-height="697" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Film Real/YouTube</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4639adcc7eb3d1cf2173bf8c09dc0aed" data-recommend-id="image://4639adcc7eb3d1cf2173bf8c09dc0aed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1062" data-height="697" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Following the Sept. 11 attacks, this 1998 film about similar attacks in NYC leading to martial law sort of faded away, as it was a little too real in how it portrayed the United States’ response to the situation.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>There is no avoiding the (mechanical) elephant in the room so let’s get it out of the way: Boy oh boy does this game look and play like Sony’s Horizon franchise. A female protagonist with a bow and a big stick for finishers? Check. Set in the far future over multiple biomes including lush rainforests and deserts? Check. Giant mechanical beasts with weak points that glow, that look and even move the same as those in Horizon? Check. Even the music is similar.</p>
<p>There are natives, dressed exactly the same as those in Horizon, the protagonist has a glider exactly the same as Horizon, there’s red grass for stealth, the trailer has characters entering a cave and finding cave paintings a scene lifted from the original HZD Trailer. But hey, completing ripping off one franchise isn’t enough so why not take the Ghost from Destiny and add them in as well, including the exact same scanning animation. </p>
<p><iframe title="Light of Motiram - Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v0Of5Xjdwbc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>While Horizon can’t lay claim to inventing mechanical beasties, Zoids were doing that back in the 80s, the art style is so similar you could honestly think some of of this trailer was from a Horizon game. </p>
<p>However, Light of Motiram is an open world survival game rather than an action adventure so there is base building, crafting and all that sort of thing. So that’s different and absolutely, totally not the sort of thing that would be in Sony’s upcoming Horizon online multiplayer title. </p>

<p>Light of Motiram will be free to play and is coming to PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3319630/LIGHT_OF_MOTIRAM/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam </a>and the Epic Games Store, assuming Sony’s lawyers don’t get to it first. </p>

            <p>A teaser for an unreleased Lego James Bond game has leaked online.</p>
<p>Whilst there's very little information accompanying the leak - apparently, it just popped up on Iinterni Gamer's Discord server at 2 am one day - it appears that at one stage, TT Games was considering a blocktastic bonanza based on Bond.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the trailer is still live, and several mirrors have been uploaded - you can check it out below:</p>

</span></p><p>"This trailer got leaked surprisingly on my Discord server, and it's an official trailer cause literally everything that appears looks exactly as the previous trailer but with final designs. Possibly its [sic] on reddit but [I don't know] really," wrote the uploader in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkSR8L8Gjwc">YouTube description</a>.</p><p>Rather than being based on one particular Bond or movie, the teaser features a number of iconic portrayals and films, including Live and Let Die and A View to a Kill. For the full-minute-long run-time, a disclaimer states: "Confidential (TT Games Studio) - Not for distribution. R&amp;D content only - not representative of any final products".</p>

</span></p><p>"This wasn't actually for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lego-dimensions">Lego Dimensions</a> year 3 [as described in the reddit thread], it was produced as a pitch for The Lego Group to convince them to give the okay for a full game, it was made during the last year Dimensions was being worked on when TT knew Dimensions wouldn't get a third year of content," they said.</p>
<p>"Once again, TLG decided Bond wasn't suitable, and vetoed the project. I think this has been found in the data of a Dimensions build, which is where the confusion is coming from."</p>
<p>"This was around 2016, and LEGO specifically were not happy with the violence and sexual innuendo," they added in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/legogaming/comments/1h0jkr3/comment/lz97qu1/">follow-up comment</a>.</p>
<p>"Characters called Pussy Galore and Plenty O'Tool wouldn't really work in a family-friendly Lego game. Although I'm sure TT could make it work. TLG these days seems more willing to try different things in games, so it could potentially be revisited, the biggest barrier for TT would be WB forcing them to stick to owned IP."</p><p>If you want to expand your IRL Lego collection, you're in luck - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/physical-lego-horizon-adventures-set-sees-aloy-taking-on-a-bricky-shell-walker-and-sawtooth">Lego has just unveiled a new Horizon set</a>.

So, if you've been wanting to spend your holidays immersed in the world of Star Wars, pick up this game for either <a href="https://zdcs.link/ak7nL5?object_uuid=362d0379-b283-460f-bb0c-cdcd80967386&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0D187PJHJ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PS5</a> or <a href="https://zdcs.link/QrpmdE?object_uuid=362d0379-b283-460f-bb0c-cdcd80967386&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0D18PNXNL" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox Series X</a>.</p><div catalogid="8185a1a9-1142-402d-98e2-339a3b88657f" id="208147"><div id="208147" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Star Wars Outlaws (PS5)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Now's a great time to pick this one up as well, following the massive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-patch-cuts-stealth-objectives-improves-ai-and-more-in-huge-title-update-140">Title Update 1.4.0</a>.

It's worth having a look at our breakdown of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-black-friday-best-deals-2024">best Black Friday video game deals</a> to see our top picks that are still available.

Retailers often stagger their inventory, reserving stock for each major sale event.

While those lines have blurred, Cyber Monday remains the top event for online-focused retailers like Amazon, Newegg, Dell, HP, and Lenovo. Even traditional retailers like Best Buy, Target, and Walmart roll out exclusive online-only offers. Amazon, in particular, has already shifted gears to highlight its Cyber Monday deals early, so expect some amazing sales ahead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Hannah Hoolihan is a freelance writer who works with the Guides and Commerce teams here at IGN.</em></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Dec 1, 2024 11:14 am</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Xbox wireless controller in Carbon Black, Robot White, or Electric Volt is on sale for $34.99. Shock Blue, Pulse Red, and Deep Pink are on sale for $39.99. For any of these options, make sure you apply coupon code "<strong>BFCMXBOX</strong>" in your shopping cart. These controllers are compatible with Xbox Series X and S consoles as well as your PC.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Xbox Controllers Starting at $34.99</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Aesthetics aside, these Xbox wireless controllers are identical to the one that's bundled with the Xbox Series X and S console. Standard features include textured grips, hybrid D-pad, button mapping with the Xbox app, a 3.5mm audio jack that works with any wired headset, and a Share button to upload screenshots and video.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The controller supports both Xbox wireless and Bluetooth connectivity. That means you can use it for your PC or mobile device. In fact, we think this is the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pc-controller">the best PC controller</a> you can get. If your PC doesn't have Bluetooth, you can still use it in wired mode with a USB Type-C cable or go out and buy a Bluetooth or <a href="https://zdcs.link/68q2q?object_uuid=83caf33c-4b36-4b8c-aae0-5ab740d4e479&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox wireless adapter</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Want Something More Unique?</h2><div catalogid="5fb1e184-2360-4acd-b4d4-15fc3dd712a5" id="212090"><div id="212090" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Xbox Wireless Controller</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want a color scheme that's sure to grab yours and other people's attentions, check out the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QrprVG?object_uuid=83caf33c-4b36-4b8c-aae0-5ab740d4e479&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Ghost Cipher Limited Edition</a> Xbox Series X|S wireless controller. It's down to $45 with free shipping at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-target-black-friday-deals-2024">Target</a> (it's currently sold out at Amazon). The Ghost Cipher Edition is an absolutely gorgeous controller, with a translucent clear top case, rubberized ash gray grips, metallic bronze triggers and D-pad, and a solid white back. The interior components are colored silver to match the overall theme.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Will the Deals Change for Cyber Monday?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In my experience, many of the same deals we saw on Black Friday will return for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/cyber-monday">Cyber Monday 2024</a>, including deals that were sold out or expired. Retailers usually release their hottest selling items in batches so that every sale event has at least some inventory reserved. That said, I also expect plenty of new, never-before-seen deals. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Traditionally, Black Friday was known as the "retail holiday," where the best deals were found in-store, and Cyber Monday was known as the "online holiday," where the best deals were online only. Although today the lines have blurred, it is still true that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-vs-cyber-monday">many online only retailers still consider Cyber Monday the sale event of the year instead of Black Friday</a>. Expect some amazing sales to come out of online-only sites like Amazon, Newegg, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dell-alienware-black-friday-sale-2024-best-deals-on-gaming-laptops-gaming-pcs">Dell</a>, HP, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lenovo-cyber-monday-sale-2024-best-deals-on-legion-gaming-laptops-gaming-pcs">Lenovo</a> and several online-only deals from traditional retailers like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-buy-black-friday-sales-2024">Best Buy</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-target-black-friday-deals-2024">Target</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-walmart-black-friday-deals-2024">Walmart</a>. In fact, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-cyber-monday-best-deals-2024">Amazon</a> has taken the preemptive and already switched over to Cyber Monday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.
