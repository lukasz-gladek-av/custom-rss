            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-update-1-2-adds-steam-workshop-mod-integration-barbers-and-lots-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Warhorse Studios announced that Kingdom Come Deliverance II has received another major free update, version 1.2. Its highlights are the addition of native mod integration through Steam Workshop support and the new barber feature.</p>
<p>The former will allow players to more easily download and install mods into the game rather than jump through various hoops <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-mod-roundup-unlimited-saving-and-increased-convenience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as they had to do until now</a>. The caveat is, of course, that the mod has to be available on Steam Workshop. At the time of writing, there are only four mods:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3412838982" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Free Saving</a> provides the player with a Saviour Schnapps item every time they use or lose one, effectively providing infinite saving.</li>
<li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3442455418" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helmet of Henry VIII</a> adds a horned helmet for Henry to wear.</li>
<li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3442495480" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tourist</a> disables NPC reactions to trespassing, opening up several story places that would normally be inaccessible.</li>
<li><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3440052578" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pebbles the Zebra</a> visually transforms Henry's horse into a zebra.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, the modding section will undoubtedly soon be populated with many more mods. Right now, there are over a thousand Kingdom Come Deliverance II mods available on Nexus. While it is unlikely the Steam Workshop section will ever be just as big, several mods should be on both platforms soon.</p>
<p>Henry can also now go to a barber NPC in Zhelejov and Kuttenberg to get a haircut and optionally also pick a new beard style. Regardless of the actual choice, going to a barber will temporarily buff Henry's Charisma stat.</p>
<p>The 1.2 update is much bigger than just those two features, though, as you can glean from scrolling through the lengthy patch notes article <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/patch-notes-1-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the game's website</a>. Warhorse says it introduces more than a thousand between fixes and improvements to nearly every aspect of the game. A lot of that has to do with balancing, but there are also enhancements to various animations and NPC behaviors, such as the crime system, which should now be more accurate. The daily NPCs schedules have been fine-tuned, and there are improvements to horse riding, horse trading, character visuals, and performance, especially in Kuttenberg (the largest city in Kingdom Come Deliverance II) and the biggest battles.</p>
<p>Warhorse plans to discuss all of these tweaks in greater detail during a developer stream next Thursday. The studio won't stop working on the game, either, given that, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-gets-2025-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the 2025 roadmap</a>, three premium DLCs are coming in spring, summer, and winter. The excellent open world roleplaying game has <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-sold-2-million-units-in-2-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> two million units in its first two weeks and the Czech studio certainly wants to ride that success as much as possible.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/teardown">Teardown</a> is one of those games that's just fun to look at, with all of its completely destructible voxel environments. When it first got announced it kind of reminded me of those old Flash games where you had simple creatures you could shake around and chuck stuff at, the joy of it being to see how far you could push things.</p>
<p>Messing around like that is all the better with friends though, I reckon, and would you look at that, developer Tuxedo Labs have just announced today that a multiplayer update is on the way to the sandbox game.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As shared in a press release, it's not just a simple matter of being able to bust up buildings to you and your friends' hearts' content, as there'll be campaign co-op, competitive, and sandbox modes in what's described as the game's "largest update" yet. All you have to do is check the Teardown subreddit to see how highly requested a feature multiplayer is. There was even a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TeardownGame/comments/rsbf1v/teardown_multiplayer_has_been_released/">multiplayer mod released a few years back</a>, so this will be welcome news I'm sure.

<p>
The multiplayer update will launch initially through the game's Experimental Branch on Steam, and the team will be looking for feedback. Modders might be especially inclined to give it a go, as additions to Teardown's API are planned for around the same time to help people update existing mods to work in multiplayer.
</p>
<p>
There's no release date in sight for the multiplayer update, not even a release window, just a promise that it's "coming later this year." Teardown's been on my list to pick up pretty much since it came out, just one of those games that got away from me, but the opportunity to cause a little bit of destructive mischief with some friends sounds pretty appealing right now.

            <p>
I'm often put off by gimmicky horror games, but sometimes I see one and think "yeah, that'll be a laugh." This time around it's Eyes Never Wake, the debut survival horror from developer Allan Hedlund. Where some horror games in recent years have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/shout-your-dogs-name-into-your-microphone-to-find-him-in-this-horror-game">used your microphone to track how loud you're being</a>, Eyes Never Wake uses your webcam to track whether your face is present or not.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
In Eyes Never Wake, the monster that's trying to hunt you down can't see you if your face isn't visible on screen. The trailer quite cleverly shows this by smoothly cutting from gameplay to real world footage of the player ducking down to hide from the incoming threat.
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
It's quite obvious the game takes some cues from modern creepypastas like The Backrooms, and I think the monster design itself is a bit generically naff, but I do think the idea of slamming my head into my desk just to avoid being spotted is pretty funny. It's sort of like an evil but less emotionally devastating <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-new-story-game-is-controlled-by-blinking-into-your-webcam">Before Your Eyes</a>.
</p>
<p>
You might ask "can I not just turn my webcam away so the monster can never see me", to which the game answers, "no, because there are doors that require in-world facial recognition scans in order to open them" - and it <em>also</em> uses your microphone, so it might hear you anyway. 
</p>
<p>
The trailer doesn't reveal much about what Eyes Never Wake involves beyond the cam-ducking idea, so I can only hope it also has things like well-designed layouts and decent pacing. Mostly, though, I'm just excited by a dev playing with the medium while considering the real, physical presence of a player.
</p>
<p>
No word on a release date, but if you're into this game that YouTubers like Markiplier are guaranteed to play, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2526200/Eyes_Never_Wake/">wishlist it here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-winds-of-war-update/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>MADFINGER Games has revealed the Winds of War update (0.3), coming soon to Gray Zone Warfare, an open-ended tactical extraction shooter released in April 2024. It’s a massive, community-led update that is positively packed with new features and changes, and as a fan of the game, I’m here for all of it.</p>



<p>At the heart of the update are changes to the game’s PvP mechanics, which will encourage players to actively engage in fights with one another. But beyond that, there are <strong>many </strong>features that will improve the game’s realism, quality of life, and accessibility.</p>



<p>Let’s dive into what we know about Winds of War, the next update for Gray Zone Warfare.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-paradigm-shift">Paradigm Shift</h2>



<p>I’ve already covered the PvP changes coming to Gray Zone Warfare in another walkthrough, so feel free to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-gameplay-loop-pvp/">check that one out here on Insider Gaming</a>.</p>



<p>I can’t stress how much the Winds of War update is filling me with anticipation for the future of Gray Zone Warfare. I recently sat down with MADFINGER Games’ Rick Lagnese to go through everything that’s coming to this stunning open-world tactical shooter, which has sold 1.5 million units since being released in April 2024.</p>



<p>The immersion and realism in Gray Zone Warfare is being bolstered in Winds of War.</p>



<p>For instance, the dynamic weather system is being introduced and fully fleshed out, and some of the effects, such as rain, are nothing short of jaw-dropping. Having seen them first-hand before the update was revealed, I can attest to the depth these mechanics will add to the open world of Lamang.</p>



<p>This weather system includes storms, fog, wind, and sun, and every setting has an impact on the game’s world. There’s even a forecast system that’ll allow you to plan your raids more effectively. </p>



<p>The team at MADFINGER has also updated the game’s health system and changed how you’ll fight and stay alive. The new mechanic that allows you to drag downed teammates into cover is something I’m very interested in.</p>



<p>On that note, playing as a squad will now offer an enhanced experience, with dynamic, real-time tasks popping up as you explore the game’s open world. These tasks will be much more challenging and will <strong>actively require </strong>a dedicated team for them to be completed, but similar events will also be up for grabs for solo operators.</p>



<p>In terms of accessibility, localisation has been expanded, with more translated content being available. The team has made sure that <strong>eleven </strong>languages are represented in the Winds of War update. </p>



<p>The quality-of-life change I’m most looking forward to is the ability to radio back to base when you’ve completed a task, rather than needing to call in a chopper and go back just to seek confirmation of completion. That’s a game-changer, and in the massive open-world environment of Lamang, it’s a sorely needed upgrade.</p>



<p>Oh, and MADFINGER is working to eradicate LZ camping in the Winds of War update, so look forward to that!</p>



<p>What change are you most looking forward to as part of the Winds of War update? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

From punk rock to hip-hop, and a new wave of hardcore with the remasters, the series forged our music tastes, and it will continue to do so with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-remaster-revealed-everything-you-need-to-know">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 Remastered coming July 11</a> this year. In the lead up to its release, Activision is putting together <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWU4xkATYcbh7" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the official THPS 3 + 4 playlist on Spotify</a> and continually updating it as it reveals more and more of the song list.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first wave of tracks have just been revealed, and here are the songs we currently know of for the THPS 3 + 4 Remastered soundtrack:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>"Ace of Spades" by Motörhead</li><li>"Them Bones" by Alice in Chains</li><li>"Ultimate" by Denzel Curry</li><li>"Gang of Four" by Damaged Goods</li><li>"96 Quite Bitter Beings" by CKY</li><li>"Yankee and the Brave (Ep. 4)" by Run the Jewels</li><li>"King of the Beach" by Wavves</li><li>"Real Thing" by Turnstile</li><li>"Not the Same" by Bodyjar</li><li>"New Wage Salary" by End It</li><li>"Head" by Jeff Rosenstock</li><li>"Collard Greens" by Schoolboy Q and Kendrick Lamar</li><li>"Outta Here" by KRS-One</li><li>"Result" by TCMF</li><li>"Dog Years" by Urethane</li><li>"Charlotte" by Kittie</li><li>"Mass Appeal" by Gang Starr</li><li>"Faster than the World" by H20</li><li>"Roadkill" by Starcrawler</li><li>"Amoeba" by Adolescents</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, those who get the deluxe edition of the game, or access it through Xbox Game Pass, will also get a full band version of the Doom E1M1 theme song as a playable track (along with the Doom Slayer and Revenant skater skins).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally, I'd love to hear Guttermouth's "I'm Destroying the World" and AFI's "The Boy Who Destroyed the World" from THPS 3 make comebacks, as well as Bad Religion's "Big Bang" and Flogging Molly's "Drunken Lullabies" from THPS 4. That's mostly because I'm a washed up old punk kid. However, it's an opportunity to discover new music and celebrate the scene as it is today, bridging the gap between the new and old <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-12-remake-review">as was the case with THPS 1 + 2 Remastered</a> from 2021.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">preorder THPS 3 + 4 Remastered's deluxe or collector's edition</a> can access the playable demo right now which includes two parks, two skaters, and a limited soundtrack. An exclusive physical Birdhouse skate deck also comes with the collector's edition. You'll also be able to access the full game early on July 8, three days ahead of its official release date.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

One player set out to show just that, with a long journey from a starting zone to the peaks of its later areas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1ja5g5x/did_you_know_theres_only_1_loading_screen_between/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Monster Hunter subreddit</a>, user -BrotherPig- posted a video, below, chronicling their journey across the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Monster_Hunter_Wilds_Locations">zones of Monster Hunter Wilds</a>. They start out in the Windward Plains, running across the sand and dunes, all the way to the later game zones and, eventually, some of the last game areas and locales. Spoilers await, if you haven't rolled credits on the campaign just yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an impressively long trip, and emphasizes just how linked all the zones are. There's only one loading screen that happens, around halfway into the trip, as the traveler heads from the Oilwell Basin into the Iceshard Cliffs. Otherwise, it's one big run for this presumably exhausted Seikret.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds isn't entirely without loading screens, of course. Aside from the one we see in the trip above, there's also the loading screen to enter the training grounds, and those you would get from fast traveling or departing for a friend's quest. But the connectivity is certainly fascinating to see in action, and gave me a new appreciation for all the little corridors and passages that connect the Forbidden Lands.</p><div id="monster-hunter-wilds-weapons-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3><h3>Monster Hunter Wilds Weapons Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-popularity-is-thanks-to-story-emphasis-immersion-and-cross-play-series-producer-says">secret sauce for Monster Hunter Wilds</a> though, according to a series producer, is apparently in its story, immersion, and cross-play.

The update also adds more country-specific localization, including traditional and simplified Chinese and new French voiceover.</p><p>One of the big additions in the update is the arrival of a barber shop where players can change Henry's bear and hair styles. Players who give Henry a new look will find a bonus in the form of a buff to Henry's charisma.</p><p>As for the official modding support, Kingdom Come 2 now connects with Steam Workshop so players can create and install mods to the game in an officially sanctioned capacity. Warhorse said more than 300 elements of the game can be modded, including UI and combat mechanics, as well as AI behavior. As with any mods, the only real limit is a person's imagination.</p><p>The full patch notes are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-2-goes-drm-free-soon-massive-1-2-patch-release-date-confirmed/1100-6529970/" data-ref-id="1100-6529970">dozens of pages long</a>, and <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can see them on the game's official website</a>.</p><p>In addition to free updates, Warhorse will release new story expansions for Kingdom Come 2 through the game's paid expansion pass.

			<p>Almost 400,000 Nintendo Switch 2 units have reportedly been shipped already to North America, making the rumored early summer release window quite likely.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jabapg/about_383000_switch_2_units_have_reportedly_been/">Gaming Leaks subreddit</a>,<a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-4137#post-1656320"> Famiiboards</a> forums member LiC recently discovered by tracking shipments of cartons and instruction manuals that Vietnamese manufacturer HVBG was contracted by Nintendo and has already shipped 383,000 Nintendo Switch 2 units to North America in late January for distribution in the United States and Canada, which is a significant number of units, considering they are only part of the initial shipment number which is sure to be bigger by the time the console launches later this year. With so many units already being shipped by January, it definitely feels like the console will indeed launch in early summer, as has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> for a while.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the day we will learn when the Nintendo Switch 2 will launch worldwide and what exactly it will be capable of is not too far away. On April 2nd, Nintendo will host a Nintendo Direct focused on the system, finally lifting the lid on a system that has been in the works and reportedly ready for launch for a very long time, so much so that even <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-node-4-5-teraflops/">people at NVIDIA were surprised</a> it was taking this long to release.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-mobile-version-tiktok-user</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/disco-elysium-mobile-version-announced-to-captivate-the-tiktok-user.1133646/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disco-elysium-mobile-version-tiktok-user<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>ZA/UM has announced a mobile version of cult hit RPG&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>, and the studio's head Denis Havel says the intent behind the game's reimagined mobile adaptation is to "captivate the TikTok user".</p>

<p>As revealed by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/official-disco-elysium-mobile-version-announced-zaum-calls-it-a-fun-on-the-go-alternative-aimed-at-tiktok-users" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>, ZA/UM wants to both attract new players to&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>and provide a "fun, on-the-go alternative" for those who've already experienced the game in its current PC and console form. The mobile version will, however, be exclusive to Android devices. Sorry, iOS users.</p>

<p>The first two chapters of&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>on Android will be released for free, ZA/UM says, and you'll be able to experience the rest of the game for a single one-off payment, so at least you won't have to buy each chapter one by one.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disco-elysium-mobile-revealed-measurehead.jpg?itok=gWC6eiaH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disco-elysium-mobile-revealed-measurehead.jpg?itok=gVMCjqoJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Have you ever wanted to play&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>on your phone? Well, now you can.</figcaption></figure><p>Perhaps a little defensively, ZA/UM says its current staff comprises "both creators and custodians of the&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>IP", and that this will be "evident in the&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>mobile experience" the studio is creating.</p>

<p>Worryingly, however, studio head Denis Havel then says the goal is to "captivate the TikTok user with quick hits of compelling story, art, and audio". He says he believes this will create an "all-new, deeply engaging form of entertainment".</p>

<p>I can't honestly say I think the&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>experience will be significantly improved by playing the game on your tiny smartphone screen, nor do I think the train or a long car journey are the best places to experience Harry DuBois' descent into (or ascent out of) madness. Still, that's corporations for you, I guess.</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>on Android devices right here.</p>




<p>This is the second major announcement ZA/UM has made this week. Just a couple of days ago, the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zaum-project-c4-disco-elysium" rel="nofollow">revealed a new "genre-defining" RPG</a> it's currently calling&nbsp;<em>Project C4</em>, although details on that project are scant right now.</p>

<p>It is also worth bearing in mind that although ZA/UM makes noises about being "custodians" of&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>, many of the game's original creators are no longer at the studio due to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-wild-story-behind-disco-elysiums-spiritual-successors-allegations-legal-threats-and-a-usb-stick" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a huge falling-out</a> that carried both cultural and legal ramifications for all concerned.</p>

<p>Several of the original folks behind&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>have, however, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors" rel="nofollow">announced their own projects</a>, and if I were you, I'd be keeping my eye on those over the mobile version of&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>. Still, who knows? Maybe it'll be great. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-san-francisco-store-to-open-in-may.1133643/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-san-francisco-store-may<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that its planned San Francisco store will be opening on May 15th, thus becoming the company's second major US outlet alongside the flagship store in New York.</p>

<p>Revealing the store's opening date in a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-san-francisco-celebrates-grand-opening-may-15/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, Nintendo says its new store will offer "game systems and games" as well as "accessories, apparel, home goods and souvenirs" that you'll only be able to buy from the San Francisco store.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/retail-locations/san-francisco/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">FAQ</a> for its new store, Nintendo says "reservations will be required for entry", although it's likely the company is specifically referring to the San Francisco location's grand opening; you probably won't need to reserve a spot just to visit the shop itself once it's open.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-san-francisco-store-new-york.jpg?itok=Kbfov85a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-san-francisco-store-new-york.jpg?itok=wKskSoSy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo's San Francisco store is due to open in May, and it'll probably resemble the New York store in terms of layout.</figcaption></figure><p>The store will be located on Powell Street in Union Square, and Nintendo says you'll be able to reach it easily via bus or cable car.</p>

<p>If you do want to attend the Nintendo San Francisco store's grand opening, you will need a reservation, but you can't get one just yet; Nintendo says more details will be available "soon", so keep an eye out if you'll be in the area in May and you want to go.</p>

<p>Additionally, Nintendo says that the SF store won't be offering online or phone sales, so if you want some of the exclusive stuff from that store, you'll have to visit physically to get it. Hey, that'll hopefully make the trip feel more special!</p>

<p>As with the New York store, Nintendo says it won't be offering spare parts for your consoles, nor can you go to the San Francisco store to have your Nintendo stuff repaired. Bear that in mind if you're looking to have your Switch screen replaced.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-san-francisco-store-new-york-display.jpg?itok=nvcYEttU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-san-francisco-store-new-york-display.jpg?itok=pDmfWVSZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hopefully, the Nintendo San Francisco store will have some cool displays like this one.</figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo is holding a sweepstakes right now to give you and "up to two guests" the chance to attend the San Francisco store's grand opening. You can see how to enter that <a href="https://my.nintendo.com/rewards/0347dfdfd78e4195?_gl=1*16k8vxz*_gcl_au*MTM3OTk4MDk2NC4xNzM4MjQzNDgy*_ga*MTM3MjQzMjg0OS4xNzMwMjExNzQ3*_ga_F6ERC4HMNZ*MTc0MTg4MDM1NC4xNy4xLjE3NDE4ODE4MjkuMC4wLjA." rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

<p>In other Nintendo news, the gaming giant is currently gearing up to release the Switch's hotly-anticipated successor sometime this year. The console will be revealed in full during a Nintendo Direct presentation <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">next month</a>, so stay tuned for more.</p>

The change could significantly boost the number of games on the platform, as previously, developers had to opt in.</p><p>Google Play Games on PC was originally launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891046/google-play-games-android-games-windows-pc-beta-launch">in beta</a> in 2022 as a way for people to play Android games on their PC, and Google has been slowly expanding its availability and building on the program since then.</p><p>As part of its announcements on Thursday, Google is also introducing a new “playability badge” for mobile games that are available on PC to highlight how well they run. An “optimized” badge means a game “meets all of our quality standards for a great gaming experience” and a “playable” badge means a game “meets the minimum requirements to play well on a PC,” writes Aurash Mahbod, VP and GM of Games on Google Play. (The system sounds a bit like Steam’s badges for Steam Deck compatibility.)</p><p>However, if a game has an “untested” badge, that means a user will only see it if they specifically search for it, Google’s Nia Carter tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p>Google is investing more in bringing PC games to Google Play Games on PC as well. There are already more than 50 native PC titles on the platform, Carter says, and later this year, Google plans to open up its native PC program to all native PC developers so they can bring over their games, according to Mahbod.</p><p>Google is making Google Play Games on PC more widely available, too; the company has offered a limited catalog of games on AMD laptops and desktops, but Google will now offer the full catalog on AMD laptops and desktops. In addition, Google is “partnering with PC OEMs to make Google Play Games accessible right from the start menu on new devices starting this year,” Mahbod says. Google is also rolling out multi-account and multi-instance support for Google Play Games on PC this month.</p><p>Google will make Google Play Games on PC generally available this year, according to Mahbod.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There are now more than 1,000 games that support the feature, which lets people buy the title once and play it across Xbox platforms, Windows 10/11 PCs, and some PC gaming handhelds.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-play-anywhere-feature-goes-live-in-september/1100-6441463/">Xbox Play Anywhere went live in September 2016</a>, originally working between Xbox One and PCs. The feature also includes cross-save functionality and only works with digital copies of games. As a fun bit of trivia, the first Xbox Play Anywhere-supported game was ReCore, with Forza Horizon 3, Gears of War 4, and Halo Wars 2 following behind it. While sounding similar, it's important to note that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-adds-a-nice-new-feature-but-only-for-testers-right-now/1100-6528390/">cloud gaming with Xbox Game Pass</a> is different from Xbox Play Anywhere.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4458937-xpa-static_final-b10d9266427a1064eef7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458937" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2400" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4458937-xpa-static_final-b10d9266427a1064eef7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458937"></a><figcaption>Microsoft has unveiled that there are more than 1,000 Xbox Play Anywhere-supported games. That means you can buy them on Xbox and then play them on PC or a PC gaming handheld for no extra cost.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4458937-xpa-static_final-b10d9266427a1064eef7.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"When we look at data for titles that are Xbox Play Anywhere enabled, these titles get 20% more gameplay because it's more flexible, because I can play on the go," said Xbox vice president of next generation Jason Ronald. Mentioning "on the go" is eyebrow-raising, especially after a report earlier this week pointing to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-branded-handheld-planned-for-later-this-year-report/1100-6530020/">a possible Xbox-branded handheld launching later this year</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">All of this feeds into Xbox's latest ad campaign that reminds people <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/">Xbox is more than just a traditional home console</a>. However, that doesn't necessarily mean Microsoft is getting out of the hardware business. Earlier this week, an insider <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-xbox-might-not-be-a-traditional-console-may-launch-in-2027-per-insider/1100-6529996/">claimed that an Xbox Series X successor is currently planned for 2027</a>. It might also launch alongside an internally developed Xbox handheld.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-2m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/split-fiction-sales-reach-2m-in-just-one-week.1133595/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-2m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA and Hazelight Studios have announced that sales of their genre-hopping co-op platformer&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>have hit another big milestone just a single week after the game's initial launch.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hazelightgames.bsky.social/post/3lkbeztsqbs2b" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform Bluesky,&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>has managed to break the two million sales barrier, a feat the studio describes as "simply amazing". Hazelight also thanks "all of [its] new and old fans", describing itself as "blown away" by the milestone.</p>

<p>As a quick reminder,&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-1m-48-hours" rel="nofollow">hit one million</a> within the game's first 48 hours on sale, which means the game has picked up another million sales for itself in the interim. This one looks like it's going to run and run.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-sales-2m-combat.jpg?itok=xMxZU07h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-sales-2m-combat.jpg?itok=qFZjcNvj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>sales have hit another milestone, which will be good news for EA and Hazelight.</figcaption></figure><p>It took&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>'s predecessor&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em><a href="https://x.com/HazelightGames/status/1405499693438808064" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">almost four months</a> to reach the same milestone, so it's clear&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>is continuing to strike a chord with players, perhaps because of&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two</em>'s positive reputation.</p>

<p>Again, as a reminder,&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>went on to sell <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hazelight-josef-fares-new-ip-it-takes-two-sales" rel="nofollow">over 20 million copies at last count</a>, so it's not unrealistic to imagine that&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>might do even better than that over the next couple of years.</p>

<p><em>Split Fiction</em>'s performance also throws into sharp relief EA's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-the-veilguard-shared-world-elements" rel="nofollow">apparent suggestion</a> that recent flop&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>didn't do well because it lacked "shared world elements"; after all, Hazelight's latest isn't a live-service game, but it's already sold <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">more than&nbsp;<em>Veilguard&nbsp;</em>did</a> within its first three months on sale.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, it's a co-op action-adventure game from&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>A Way Out&nbsp;</em>developer Hazelight Studios, headed up by industry personality Josef Fares.</p>




<p>The game revolves around Mio and Zoe, two writers who must work together in order to escape a nefarious machine that wants to drain them of their ideas. Like the aforementioned games, it's co-op only, so grab a friend or partner for this one.</p>

<p><em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>is available to buy right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2001120/Split_Fiction/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/split-fiction/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/split-fiction/9N1WXXD1RL8D" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-2-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/powerwash-simulator-2-announced-coming-later-this-year.1133592/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-2-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher FuturLab has announced&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>, a followup to the popular 2022 work sim. It's coming to PC and current-gen consoles sometime later this year.</p>

<p>Unlike the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/powerwash-simulator" rel="nofollow">original game</a>,&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will be a self-published affair; it is, after all, the studio's first new game since being snapped up by mobile and browser game giant Miniclip <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/miniclip-futurlab-acquisition" rel="nofollow">back in April last year</a>.</p>

<p>As you'd probably expect from a&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator&nbsp;</em>sequel,&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will task you with cleaning a whole new set of environments. You'll be able to explore more of Muckingham, and a number of new locations will also be available to you in a brand new campaign.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-cleaning.jpg?itok=NbY_6b1l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-cleaning.jpg?itok=KrNJ1b7w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>is coming sometime this year.</figcaption></figure><p>When you're not cleaning, you can kick back and relax at your home base, which you can also fill with "furniture and trinkets" to make it a more homely place.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to share your campaign progress with another player online, but if you don't fancy playing together at a distance, you can also team up in split-screen co-op. It's not yet clear whether&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will support crossplay.</p>

<p>Of course, some improvements have also been made to gameplay mechanics; FuturLab says you can expect "enhanced soap that clings to stubborn stains and annihilates dirt", making cleaning feel "even better" than in the game's predecessor.</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>, which gives a sense of what the game will look and play like, right here. Of course, if you've played&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em>, you'll probably already know what to expect on that score.</p>




<p><em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2968420/PowerWash_Simulator_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S later this year. If you want to refresh your memory, you can check out our very own Blair's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/powerwash-simulator-review" rel="nofollow">review of the original game right here</a>.</p>

Developer FuturLab says the new game features an entirely new campaign  with new Muckingham mysteries to uncover, as well as new locations to clean off including Sponge Valley, Power Falls and Lubri City. There will also be a home base where players can hang out, decorate, and gaze upon the trophies and trinkets from their cleansing adventures. </p><p>Here’s the new teaser trailer which hints at <em>PowerWash Sim</em>’s garden gnomes playing a bigger role in the sequel:</p><p>At first glance,<em> PowerWash Simulator 2</em> doesn’t look super different from the first game, which launched in 2022 and quickly grew into a major hit thanks to its meditative and therapeutic gameplay loop, as well as its more daunting challenge-based activities. However, the sequel will boast some notable upgrades like “enhanced soap that clings to stubborn stains and annihilates dirt” as well as two-player split-screen. <br></p><p>In the meantime, <em>PowerWash Simulator 1</em> is still getting new content. Following popular cross-over DLC packs like <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>’s Midgar and and <em>SpongeBob</em>’s Bikini Bottom, this year’s roadmap includes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26oE8hq6jnc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=26oE8hq6jnc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a <em>Wallace &amp; Gromit</em> collaboration</a></span> and other updates. <em>PowerWash Sim 2</em> is coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC later this year, and who knows, maybe we’ll still get a Switch 2 version announced in the months ahead. The first game was a free PS Plus download back in 2023 and is currently on Xbox Game Pass.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Microsoft has unveiled Xbox Copilot for Gaming, a new tool aimed towards being a the “ultimate gaming sidekick” for players. </p>



<p>In an appearance on the official Xbox Podcast, Xbox Corporate Vice President of Gaming AI Fatima Kardar unveiled the AI-powered tool to the world. The announcement also included a detailed post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/13/new-copilot-for-gaming-save-time-help-get-good/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a>.</p>



<p>“This AI-driven sidekick is designed to be your personalized gaming companion, helping you get to your favorite games faster, coaching you to improve your skills, and connecting you better with your friends and communities,” Jeff Rubenstein, director of Xbox editorial, said. “Copilot for Gaming will be there when you need it but out of the way if you don’t.”</p>



<p>During the podcast, an concept example of how the new tool could work was shown using Minecraft.  In the game a player picked up wood and entered a prompt asking “Okay, I’ve got some wood. What do I do with that?” Copilot for Gaming answered by explaining how to turn the gathered oak logs into wooden planks.</p>



<p>Another example shown involved Overwatch. A player asks the tool for help on who to pick after the hero they wanted, Echo, was already selected.</p>

<p>“Echo’s taken, but Cassidy would be a solid pick with this team,” Copilot says. “His mid-range hit scan and Mercy’s damage boost will work great on Ilios Ruins. Plus you’ve done great with him on this map before.” </p>



<p>After the player dies during the game, Copilot explains that it happened because they stayed in the fight for too long and suggested to regroup with their team the next time they are in a similar situation.</p>



<p>The tool will even let you pull up situation-specific advice for the game and moment you are in, according to Microsoft.</p>



<p>Everything shown during the podcast were proof of concepts and not actual gameplay uses. As far as a release date, Copilot for Gaming will start in a slow rollout on mobile devices for members of the Xbox Insider Program “soon”. A release on other devices and then to the general public will happen “gradually”.</p>
