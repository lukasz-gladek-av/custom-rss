<p>With PUBG holding its ground within the realm of Battle Royales, many players have been choosing to explore the Ranked system within the game. Here is a list of all the PUBG: Battlegrounds ranks and how you can hit the final rank, Master.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-pubg-battlegrounds-ranks">All PUBG: Battlegrounds Ranks</h2>



<p>Below is a list of all PUBG ranks:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold</strong></li>



<li><strong>Platinum</strong></li>



<li><strong>Diamond</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Each rank is split into five tiers, starting with V and ending with I. However, each season marks a new rank for players, meaning everyone starts out as Unranked.</p>



<p>PUBG ranks differ from PUBG Mobile, however, as the mobile Battle Royale has extra ranks and a bit different point system.</p>



<p>So, how do players rank up in PUBG?</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-rank-up-in-pubg-and-hit-master">How to Rank Up in PUBG and Hit Master</h2>



<p>The goal of all competitive PUBG players is to hit Master, the final rank in the game. To complete this challenge, however, players will have to spend quite a bit of time in the game. </p>



<p>To rank up in PUBG, players will have to place in Ranked matches. Placement points and kills are the two best ways to climb the ladder when playing the Battle Royale, so attempting to get first in each match is the best way to move up in the ranks.</p>



<p>There is also a rank higher than Master called Grandmaster, which is given to the top 500 players on the Ranked leaderboard.</p>



<p>PUBG’s Ranked system also has Ranked Decay, which is a feature that slowly deteriorates one’s rank if they begin to not play the game. Rank Decay starts taking action after seven days of someone not playing Ranked.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-points-needed-for-each-rank">Points Needed for Each Rank</h2>



<p>Below is a list of all the points needed to progress through the ranks in PUBG:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze:</strong> 0 – 1500</li>



<li><strong>Silver:</strong> 1500 – 1900</li>



<li><strong>Gold:</strong> 2000 – 2500</li>



<li><strong>Platinum:</strong> 2500 – 2999</li>



<li><strong>Diamond:</strong> 3000 – 3499</li>



<li><strong>Master:</strong> 3500+</li>
</ul>



<p>Will you be trying to hit Master in PUBG? </p>

Created by Fantasy Flight Games, this stellar adaptation of Star Wars released in 2023 with a $38 MSRP. It often sells for around $30, so Amazon's current deal is <em>very </em>good.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BLT6F5VY?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game</a> adapts the Galactic Civil War of the original Star Wars trilogy into a two-player card game with one player controlling the Galactic Empire and the other the Rebel Alliance. Players create custom decks with cards that feature iconic Star Wars characters, vehicles, and locations, and face off in head-to-head matches (lasting roughly 30 minutes) to decide the fate of the galaxy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4398787-starwarsthedeckbuilding.png" data-ref-id="1300-4398787" data-ratio="0.56059421422987" data-width="1279" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4398787-starwarsthedeckbuilding.png" data-ref-id="1300-4398787"></a><figcaption>Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4398787-starwarsthedeckbuilding.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Everything you need to play comes in the box, including 140 cards players use to create their own decks, a rulebook, damage counters, resource counters, and a gameboard for tracking each player's progress as they either save or conquer the Star Wars galaxy.</p><p dir="ltr">Star Wars: The Deckbuilding Game would make for a great gift for Star Wars fans this holiday.

If there's a TV deal that isn't mentioned here, chances are I think you should wait and see if a better deal will pop up. After all, Black Friday is only a few weeks away. If you're just window shopping and want to hold off on your purchases no matter what, at least keep these deals bookmarked in case they do happen to be the best deals, even on Black Friday proper.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">65" Samsung S90C 4K OLED Smart TV for $999.99</h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>The Best Black Friday</strong> <strong>High-End TV Deal</strong></h3><div catalogid="fbf0cb98-59c9-47d2-99dc-d304ac293783" id="203712"><div id="203712" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>65" Samsung S90C 4K OLED Smart TV</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Bonus $50 Best Buy gift card if purchased from Samsung.com</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Potentially the best Black Friday deal on a high-end OLED gaming TV is already available.

That's the best price we've seen for a 50" TV with native 4K resolution and a built-in Roku smart TV interface. The Hisense 50R6030N is a new 2024 model. This TV offers pretty much everything you really need at an unbeatable price. There will absolutely be plenty more TVs on sale during <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday,</a> and if you're looking for a different screen size or a specific feature, then you should wait. However, if you want a 50" TV for the lowest price possible, you won't find anything much better than this deal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Note that this TV was extremely popular yesterday when the deal went live and sold out in a matter of hours. Unless you're located in an obscure zip code, chances are it's out of stock and unavailable at the moment. We have it listed here because there's always a chance it will return prior to or on Black Friday. If not, at least you have a good baseline price point that you can use when checking the prices of other affordable 50" TV deals.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">75" TCL S4 4K Roku TV for $378</h2><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>The Best Black Friday </strong><u><strong>Big Screen</strong></u><strong> Budget TV Deal</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="546c9b06-752a-49ad-abc9-cc16460998d3" id="210664"><div id="210664" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>75" TCL S4 4K Roku TV</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Walmart's other best budget TV deal is on this 75" TCL S4 4K Roku TV for only $378. The S4 is TCL's least expensive 4K TV lineup and even at its everyday retail price of $498 it represents a pretty strong value. At $120 off, it's practically a steal. Aside from the much larger screen size, the TCL S4 is quite similar to the Hisense R6 mentioned above. It features a native 4K resolution, built-in smart TV interface, Motion Rate 120, and auto low latency mode for gaming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This TV is also going out of stock quickly, but there are still plenty of zip codes where this TV is in stock for free shipping or in-store pickup.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> might be looming on the horizon, but it's not the only new place you'll be able to get your fix of creature-bopping action; Capcom and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>'s TiMI Studio Group have announced <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a> Outlanders, a new "fully featured" open-world survival game that's coming to mobile at some currently unspecified future point.
</p>
<p>
Monster Hunter Outlanders details are, unfortunately, extremely limited at present, but Tencent does say players will be able to partake in the series' "traditional hunting experience", crafting and building "individualised gear and tools" as they "explore and survive unique regions of an open-world map featuring natural environments, ecosystems and monsters."
</p>
<p>
There's also talk of "social features" and "regular world events and activities, creating immense opportunities for the community to have fun together". The assumption, of course - given TiMi's specialty and Outlanders' mobile focus - is the whole thing will be free-to-play, although that's not explicitly stated in Tencent's announcement.

<p>
Monster Hunter Outlanders doesn't have a release date yet, but when it does show up, it'll be available via Apple's App Store and Google Play. Tencent has also confirmed it plans to conduct "several play tests" ahead of its official launch, with more details set to be shared on social media and Outlanders' Discord server at a later date.
</p><p>
As for Capcom's next flagship monster hunting game, that'll be Monster Hunter Wilds, which launches for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Steam on 28th February. And if Wilds' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-numbers-are-well-wild">recent Steam open beta numbers</a> are anything to go by - and assuming Capcom can get those <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-beta-has-graphical-problems-but-capcom-promises-final-game-in-a-better-state">lingering technical issues</a> fixed - the publisher could well have another big hit on its hands.

Capcom has announced that it’s teaming up with TiMi — the studio behind games like <em>Call of Duty: Mobile</em> and <em>Pokémon Unite</em> — for a spinoff <a href="https://x.com/MHO_English/status/1856502243018846583">called <em>Monster Hunter Outlanders</em></a>. It’s described as an “open-world survival game” that’s playable either solo or co-op with up to four players. It sounds like <em>Outlanders</em> will feature the core aspects of a <em>MonHun</em> experience (namely, the exploring, hunting, and crafting) but with live service and social elements typical of a mobile game.</p><p>That recent success, combined with TiMi’s history and <em>MonHun</em>’s pedigree as a portable experience, are positive signs this could be more than a mobile cash grab. It might be some time before we get to check out the game for ourselves, however, as it doesn’t currently have a release date. Capcom says there will be “several play tests in advance” of the eventual launch.</p></div><div><p>Most Popular</p><p>Most Popular</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294921/mkbhd-controversy-dji-sponsored-video-speeding"><h2>MKBHD got himself in trouble again</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24293920/bluesky-700000-new-users-week-x-threads"><h2>Bluesky adds 700,000 new users in a week</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24295129/amazon-shutting-down-freevee-prime-video"><h2>Amazon is shutting down Freevee</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24294106/valve-white-steam-deck"><h2>Valve finally made a white Steam Deck that you can actually buy</h2></a><hr></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/16/24265587/analogue-3d-nintendo-64-price-preorder-date"><h2>Analogue’s 4K Nintendo 64 launches next year for $249</h2></a><hr></li></ol></div></div></article></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>When it comes to finding the right camera for streaming on Twitch, YouTube and other platforms, people often find themselves with more options than less. The truth is, there are quite a few options out there to choose from. What would be considered the best camera for streaming, though?</p>



<h2 id="h-streaming-cameras-which-one-is-the-best">Streaming Cameras: Which one is the best?</h2>



<p>When searching for a camera to go live with, you must first figure out a budget. Unfortunately, there are not any cameras that will give you HD-studio quality imagery for under $150. However, if you do not mind the quality being a little lower than normal, then there are plenty of options for you.</p>



<p>But if you want to get a high-end camera that really makes you pop while streaming, then this article will provide the correct resources for you.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-best-streaming-camera">The Best Streaming Camera</h2>



<ul>
<li>Sony Alpha a6400 Mirrorless Camera</li>
</ul>



<p>The Sony Alpha a6400 Mirrorless Camera is by far the best camera for streaming. With an infinite battery inside the body, the Sony Alpa a6400 will run for as long as you want it to.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The camera can shoot up to 4k and has 24.2 megapixels. However, all of the look is not in the camera, but also in the lens. </p>



<p>The Sony Alpha a6400 Mirrorless Camera is currently $749.99 USD on <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-alpha-a6400-mirrorless-camera-body-only-black/6324856.p?skuId=6324856&amp;extStoreId=211&amp;utm_source=feed&amp;ref=212&amp;loc=18182031001&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAlsy5BhDeARIsABRc6Zvat_zqkIfLUjsyKkENIqv8J1cxmDr1U7JgSYPQ_v0cA4sBfog9bpoaAhlMEALw_wcB&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds">Best Buy.</a></p>







<h2 id="h-best-camera-lens-for-streaming">Best Camera Lens for Streaming</h2>



<p>Camera lenses do not come cheap, but if you are willing to spend a buck or two, the Sony E 15mm F1.4 G APS-C lens is by far one of the best lenses to use when live streaming.</p>



<p>With an F1.4, this lens will give you the best depth of field compared to any other lens. Its auto-focus is pristine and will stay focused on you for the entirety of your stream.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>To top it off, the lens is also a 15mm lens, meaning it will be able to capture a large amount of your streaming room, showcasing your setup.</p>



<p>The Sony E 15mm F1.4 G APS-C lens is currently $649.99 USD at <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-e-15mm-f1-4-g-aps-c-large-aperture-wide-angle-g-lens-black/6509497.p?skuId=6509497">Best Buy.</a></p>

<h2 id="h-best-budget-friendly-streaming-camera">Best Budget-Friendly Streaming Camera</h2>



<p>Want a good camera, but are on a bit tighter budget? Luckily, Logitech has quite a few options for you.</p>



<p>The Logitech StreamCam has dominated the streaming world as one of the best Webcams for live streaming. With 1080p resolution at 60fps, this camera is perfect for those wanting to make their stream look great but do not want to spend upwards of $1,000 to do so.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Logitech StreamCam is currently only $129.99 USD on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Streamcam-Streaming-Webcam-YouTube/dp/B07TYWPM67/ref=asc_df_B07TYWPM67?mcid=4659779bd56a3e6e8e430dad7edb682f&amp;hvocijid=11117331681224633862-B07TYWPM67-&amp;hvexpln=73&amp;tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=692875362841&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=11117331681224633862&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9028715&amp;hvtargid=pla-2281435180498&amp;th=1">Amazon</a>.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/botany-manor">Botany Manor</a> - the beautiful, bucolic country house puzzler from developer Balloon Studios - is finally PlayStation-bound, and will be planting itself on PS4 and PS5 from 17th December.
</p>
<p>
Botany Manor, which released for Xbox and PC earlier, whisks players to Somerset, England on an almost impossibly Mediterranean summer's day in 1890. Here, they'll embark on a wonderfully serene journey through the life of retired botanist Arabella Greene, which unfolds as they explore her sprawling, memorabilia-strewn home - the Botany Manor of the title - doing a sport of genteel first-person puzzling as they go.
</p>
<p>
Central to Botany Manor's puzzles is the Herbarium – a book of pressed plants for scientific study - which players gradually fill in by combining and cross-referencing clues found around Arabella's home, slowly uncovering how the fantastical flowers detailed within will bloom out in the wild. Its conundrums can only be fully completed, however, once freshly procured seeds have been teased to life by replicating the process in the book using artificial means.

<p>
It's soothing, quietly brilliant stuff, Botany Manor's puzzles gradually increasingly in complexity in a way that really encourages players to explore their beautiful surroundings and immerse themselves in Arabella's world. "Perhaps an afternoon in Botany Manor's company will inflame your own curiosity for nature," I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/botany-manor-review">wrote in my four star review</a> earlier this year, "or perhaps you'll simply be content to explore its sun-dabbled corners, solve its few clever puzzles, and enjoy the timeless pleasures of an enchanting summer's day stroll."
</p><p>
Botany Manor is a genuinely lovely thing, and - I imagine - a perfect summery escape for PlayStation owners who'll be firing it up as the icy embrace of winter draws near. And if that appeals, it'll cost £20.99/$24.99 USD when it launches for PS5 and PS4 on 17th December.

            <link>https://aftermath.site/freelance-video-game-journalism-rates</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/freelance-video-game-journalists-are-propping-up-the-industry-and-many-are-being-paid-dogshit-in-return.1034223/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/freelance-video-game-journalism-rates<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You don't need me to summarise the state of video games media in 2024:<a href="https://aftermath.site/games-media-journalism-layoffs-gamurs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Things are bad</a>. But they've become bad in a myriad of ways, and one of the more depressing is that as the biggest sites have slashed budgets and laid off permanent staff writers, leaning instead on underpaid, overworked freelancers.</p><p>From IGN to GameSpot to Kotaku, from reviews to reporting to service posts to SEO-friendly fare, over the last few years nearly every video game outlet still in existence has increasingly moved away from paying full-time writers (and their associated costs, like health care) towards paying a few hundred bucks for hungry freelancers to file a bunch of content instead. This is especially the case when it comes to stories like previews, reviews, guides and tips, which might not need the kind of context or follow-up work reporting or opinion pieces require.&nbsp;</p><p>Many of these assignments are paying $150-300. This might sound fair, but consider that a guide or extensive tips post can take <em>dozens of hours </em>of gameplay to test and pull together, followed by the time and work required to actually get the words on the website. Which is why even the games sites paying "well" these days aren't exactly paying <em>well</em>.</p><p>I spoke to freelance games writers to find out what they're being paid and how much is expected of them. The results are, with some exceptions, pretty grim. Below you'll find a big rundown of what various freelancers tell us they've been paid by various sites; we've reached out to each site or network to confirm them, and will note this if they get back to us.</p><p>(Please note that while some are a set, concrete rate, others can be more flexible based on factors like experience or word count, which is why they're presented as more of a ballpark.)</p><p>First up are the ones I'd describe as being "actually pretty OK". <strong>Rolling Stone</strong> reportedly pay $500 for a non-reported games or entertainment feature, with reporting pushing that higher. The <strong>New York Times</strong> runs gaming stories and pays $1 per word, which makes it comfortably the best-paying outlet in this roundup. The <strong>Epic Games Store</strong> pays between $350 and $1000 depending on wordcount. (Before you ask why we're listing a games store here, Epic pays freelance writers to provide copy for the platform, ranging from small blogs to big interview features.)</p><p>At generalist tech outlets that also dabble in video games, <strong>The Verge</strong> reportedly pays $500 for a non-reported feature (reporting can push that higher), while writers tell us <strong>Wired </strong>is quoting them between $500-750 for a freelance piece, depending on the workload and wordcount. When it comes to dedicated video game outlets like <strong>Polygon</strong>, most pieces pay between $250-500 depending on length/workload; some freelancers told me they've gotten $250 for a basic feature on a TV show, with bigger reviews coming closer to $500. At <strong>IGN</strong>, given the site's size, rates are all over the place depending on the style of work and the scope of it, but in a rare and welcome piece of transparency<a href="https://corp.ign.com/freelance-opportunities-and-guidelines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> everything is fully disclosed on this page</a>. Generally, freelancers can expect anything from $30 (for a 20-minute news item) to $1000 and over for larger features.</p><hr><p>Now let's look at another group of sites, where prices start dropping a little lower. Writers tell us <strong>GameSpot </strong>pays $200 for most articles (including listicles) and $300 for reviews. Unlike most outlets, we're told that it doesn't matter if it's 1500 words or 4000 words; those are a flat rate. Freelancers who have filed for <strong>Kotaku </strong>recently say they're paid $300 for most pieces, ranging from service posts to freelance contributions like interviews.</p><p>On the business front, <strong>Game Developer</strong> tell us they pay $250-300 for an 800-word story, and $350 for a larger 1600-word piece, which usually require multiple sources. <strong>Gamesindustry.biz</strong> pays between £200 (USD$260) and £250 (USD$325) per piece, depending on wordcount and workload.</p><p>At <strong>Eurogamer</strong>, some freelancers are paid £175 (USD$225) for an occasional shorter piece, but the site tells us most pieces commissioned are longer ones that pay £350 (USD$455). <strong>PCGamesN</strong> tell us a quick news post pays £25 (USD$32) while a 2000-word feature will pay £200 (USD$260). Prestigious magazine <strong>Edge </strong>is apparently paying freelance writers £140 (USD$180) for a review of approximately 1000 words. Meanwhile at <strong>Games Radar </strong>freelancers tell us they've been paid £140 (USD$180) for a feature or review [<strong>Update</strong>: those were on the small side, other writers say Games Radar's rates actually slide up to $300 for a bigger feature or review].</p><p>You might have noticed a few of those sites toward the end pay less than the mostly-American outlets we'd already covered. They're all British, where writers (across all media, not just games) are usually paid pretty poorly across the board, whether they're freelance or not.</p><figure><figcaption>Pictured: a freelance video games journalist in 2024 | Photo: Tara Winstead</figcaption></figure><p>Most sites above are major publications that still have a number of permanent writers on staff, or are generalist outlets with limited opportunities for games stories. Given that, the number of freelance writers they can hire at a time is relatively tiny compared to the pool of available talent.</p><p>There are, however, entire networks out there that are<em> </em>powered in large part by freelancers, and which across their many sites seem to always have <em>plenty </em>of work, whether it be news, reviews or SEO-baiting content like specific tips and guides. The catch: they pay absolute dogshit, and whaddya know,<a href="https://aftermath.site/gamurs-group-layoffs-destructoid-pc-invasion-dot-esports" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> our old friends at Gamurs feature heavily</a>.</p><p>Freelancers who have written for <strong>Pro Game Guides</strong>, a Gamurs site dedicated almost entirely to service posts, say they're paid on the basis of what are called "tiers". The lowest of these, described as everything from "Can you save in [Game]?" to "All Trophies and Achievements in [Game]", pays its writers...$11 per article. The second tier, which includes "Full guide rewrites" and "Lore explainers", pays $21 per post.</p><p>And so it goes through the tiers, with a "complete walkthrough" of a video game, something that would take hours upon hours to play and then involve writing <em>7000 </em>words, paying just $150. If it's 10,000 words or more you get $250. Meanwhile we're told <strong>Destructoid's </strong>rates are $16 for a short news article, ranging through to just $65 for larger features. <strong>Gamepur </strong>reportedly pays its freelancers $16 per news piece and $26 per guide (though that rate comes with an absurd required quota of 25 articles in a month).</p><p>At Valnet, a network of similar scale to Gamurs, things are just as bad. Features writers for <strong>Game Rant</strong> tell us they're paid $19 for 1000 words, while writers tell us "flash news" posts pay $5 for 250 words or $10 for 500. A "long guide" of over 1200 words pays $25, while an interview of 1500-2500 words also pays just $25. <strong>Hardcore Gamer</strong>, another Valnet site, reportedly pays similarly: $10 for news post (around 400 words), $20 for guides (500-1500 words), $30 for longer guides (1500+ words) and $30 for reviews, previews and interviews.</p><p>(We contacted both Gamurs and Valnet for confirmation of these rates, but at time of publishing have yet to hear back from them).</p><hr><p>As someone now running a video games media website,<a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-business-lessons-learned-tips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> I know as well as anyone that times are tough</a>! Between payroll and an ever-dwindling ad market it's hard finding the budget for stuff like freelance. You can see this reflected in many of these rates; at many sites, even the biggest ones, they're actually paying less than they would have ten years ago. In cases like Gamurs' and Valnet's news rates, they're roughly what I was being paid at Kotaku in...2006.</p><p>For anyone who has never done this kind of work--and I'm assuming that's most of you!--in the majority of cases here once you add up all the time spent playing a game, taking notes, researching a story, interviewing and then transcribing an interview, drafting a story, polishing it and then submitting it for publication, many freelancers are being paid less than the minimum wage.</p><p>Nobody here is wilfully setting out to cause misery or to insult the skills and labour of their workers. And yet, intention or not, that's exactly what's happening in many of these cases. By pivoting so hard towards service posts, and then outsourcing so much of that work to freelancers, video games media has created an ever-growing aspect of the industry that in many cases is little more than sweatshop labour.</p><p>And we are all poorer for it! Freelance writers aren't afforded the security and continuity that comes with a staff position, and opportunities in the field are now so few and far between (and usually pay so poorly) that it's almost impossible for freelancers to make a living, even if they're doing enough work to justify one.</p><p>The sites employing them, meanwhile, are increasingly without an identity or consistency of their own. By bringing in a constantly rotating cast of outsiders, it's almost impossible for them to provide the kind of authoritative voice you grow to expect (and sometimes love) from staff writers.</p><p>And readers, finally, are often getting what's been paid for. While every freelancer is busting their ass to file their copy, and many are doing excellent work, the fact is that when you're paying so many people so little, and in many cases forcing them to rush their work in order to try to make the transaction even remotely worth it for them, that work isn't always going to be of the highest standard.</p><p>It's a lose-lose-lose situation that is no one person or outlet's fault,<a href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-an-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> and yet like so many other structural issues plaguing games media in 2024, here we are</a>. Layoffs and site closures are often the most obvious examples of the impending disintegration of the online media ecosystem, but the shift away from hiring large teams of in-house writers and employing an army of freelancers in their stead hasn't been great either.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He later stated that he’s felt even more stress while making the second season. Part of that stress stems from real-life problems plaguing society, which the show is based around.</p><p>Centered on the destitute yet determined Seong Gi-Hun (Lee Jung-jae) entering a mysterious competition to change his fortune, <em>Squid Game</em> examines the deleterious effects of economic disparities is Korean societies. In the first season, the game is paused after most of the players ask to leave  following the horrific “Red Light, Green Light” game that was their introduction to the life-or-death stakes of the competition. After the players return to the financial ruins of their reality, the vast majority decide to return to the game, underscoring how hopelessness in one’s current life that could inspire them to put their life on the line for a chance at something better. Channeling that dread into a television show would definitely be enough to drive me mad.</p><p>Now, however, he’s making the second season and, if anything, he’s finding it even more stressful. Even though he admits that his lack of adequate compensation for the first season, which reportedly <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vulture.com/article/squid-game-season-1-episode-2-hell.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vulture.com/article/squid-game-season-1-episode-2-hell.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">made Netflix $900 million</a></span>, was the central catalyst for him making the second season, he does point to how it all was a gift and a curse. “I have about two nightmares a week, usually about something going wrong during shooting or people saying that it’s not good,” Dong-hyuk <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/squid-game-season-two-creator-lee-jung-jae-interview-1236058780/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/squid-game-season-two-creator-lee-jung-jae-interview-1236058780/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tells <em>The Hollywood Reporter</em></a></span>. “Will the games be as entertaining as in season one? Are the characters as charming?”</p><p>Hopefully, after the new season of <em>Squid Game</em> releases on Netflix on December 26, Dong-hyuk gets some peaceful sleep and a lot of money, along with keeping the rest of his teeth intact. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A train station schedule appears with the numbers 03 12 20:24 as the inbound column turns into PlayStation symbols. Some fans wonder if it’s meant to hint at a potential December 3, 2024 event. Perhaps one last State of Play or bigger livestream event pointing to what’s ahead for the PS5?</p><p>It’s a reach, but there are a couple of things that make it feel within the realm of possibility. First, commenters have noted that there is precedent for Sony holding December events. Once upon a time during the PS4 generation, it hosted <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/there-won-t-be-a-playstation-experience-event-this-year-1829398961&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/there-won-t-be-a-playstation-experience-event-this-year-1829398961">fan-oriented PlayStation Experience events</a></span>. And while those were retired many years ago at this point, Sony did hold a special <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgzV3MFs2ok&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HgzV3MFs2ok" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December State of Play in 2019</a></span> to mark the 25th anniversary of PlayStation. It included announcements for <em>Resident Evil 3 </em>remake, <em>Kingdom Hearts 3</em> DLC, and a <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> tease. This December, meanwhile, marks the 30th anniversary. </p><p>It’s also felt like a a weird year for PS5 announcements overall. Sony’s standard 2024 summer showcase was downgraded to a State of Play, and despite plenty of exclusives hitting the console this year, players still don’t have a ton of insight into what’s shaping up for 2025. A December showcase would be a perfect time to tease more of Sucker Punch’s <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>, Hideo Kojima’s <em>Death Stranding 2</em>, and potentially a release date for Insomniac’s <em>Wolverine</em>. The company recently promised at least one big new first-party single-player exclusive every year. </p><p>There’s another big event happening next month as well: Geoff Keighley’s Game Awards. Scheduled for December 12, we could very well see a big reveal from Sony at that show, which continues to draw bigger and bigger crowds each year. Or, maybe the company wants to set the stage with its own State of Play at the beginning of the month before using Keighley’s show for a second, deeper dive into something already revealed. </p><p>Or maybe a couple of still frames from a random PlayStation ad aren’t actually meant to signal anything. Either way, we’ll find out soon enough. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Twitter user BeskInfinity has done a fantastic job documenting many of the new updates, big and small, to the classic games. </p><p>The most noticeable change, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/BeskInfinity/status/1856364966082711898&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/BeskInfinity/status/1856364966082711898" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as documented by BeskInfinity</a></span>, is a new “Classic Lighting” option that was first included in the mobile ports from Netflix.

Fog has also been applied to all of the games, making the worlds feel bigger as you can’t see all the way across the map. </p><p>Beyond improved lighting and visual changes, like better-looking high altitude clouds in<em> San Andrea</em>s and bloom being added to streetlights in cities, the new update also fixes some animation bugs.

I checked and it’s not there anymore. Grove Street was responsible for the original remasters and some older mobile ports of <em>GTA</em> games, and was heavily criticized by the community for how they handled these projects. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/18qidqb/netflix_gta_trilogy_is_done_by_video_games_deluxe/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/18qidqb/netflix_gta_trilogy_is_done_by_video_games_deluxe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Netflix versions of the games were developed by Video Games Deluxe</a></span>, who previously ported <em>L.A. Noire </em>to VR. </p><p>So are the remastered <em>GTA </em>games worth playing in 2024? I mean, that depends on what you want out of them. If you want an easy way to play the old games on modern hardware with some quality-of-life improvements, like autosave and a weapon wheel, then the <em>Trilogy </em>is better than ever and a solid option. If you want perfect emulation of those old games, then the <em>Trilogy </em>is still not close to offering that. </p><p>Sadly, if you play on PS4, Xbox One, or Switch, you don’t have access to the update yet and are still stuck with the older versions. Ultimately, the <em>Trilogy </em>is still a bit of a mess, but it’s a lot better now than it was in 2021. And that’s nice! </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The enduring card game was one of a group of finalists announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/pokemon-trading-card-game-among-12-finalists-to-be-inducted-into-national-toy-hall-of" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in September</a>, beating out Choose Your Own Adventure books and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pokemon-trading-card-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pokemon Trading Card Game</em></a><em>.</em></p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/press-release/2024-toy-hall-inductees-revealed/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, the Strong National Museum of Play announced the three lucky winners being inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame.</p>

The final choices are made on the advice of historians, educators, and others who exemplify learning, creativity, and discovery.</p>

<p>The National Toy Hall of Fame was established in 1998. The ones behind it are dedicated to enshrining toys and games that have inspired creative play and experienced sustained popularity over a long period. They honor both toys timeless and contemporary.</p>

<p><em>Phase 10</em> was created in 1982 by Black game inventor and entrepreneur Ken Johnson. The card game is a variation of rummy. Players need to collect different groups of card and create complete sequential phases of 10 before their opponents.</p>

<p>In the forty-two years since its release, <em>Phase 10</em> has become one of the bestselling cards games in the world; second only to <em>Uno</em>. The Strong Musuem's own curator of board games and puzzles, Mirek Stolee, states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today Mattel reportedly sells four million <em>Phase 10</em> decks annually in 60 countries and in more than 20 languages. Whether played in its original form or in one of its variations, <em>Phase 10</em> has become an iconic game title that continues to encourage multigenerational social and competitive play.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for the other two inductees, they are two major staples in the world of toys: Hasbro's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/transformers-roleplaying-game-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Transformers</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-review-changeling-mischief" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>My Little Pony</em></a>. Both started as popular toylines that eventually evolved into major multimedia properties. Their works spanning animated series, comic books, videogames, and tabletop board games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-coming-to-pc-in-2025-sales-expected-to-exceed-console-release<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a>, the well-received sci-fi action-adventure from developer Shift Up, is targeting a 2025 release on PC, and the studio says it expects sales to exceed those seen on console.
</p>
<p>
Stellar Blade, which tells the story of sword-wielding soldier Eve as she attempts to liberate Earth from a monstrous alien threat known as the Naytibas, released exclusively for PlayStation 5 back in April, going on to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-totals-61m-units-sold-as-hardware-sales-continue-to-fall">sell 1m copies by the end of June</a>.
</p>
<p>
And now Shift Up has announced plans to follow that success with a PC version at some point next year. The news was shared in the developer's <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=203&amp;page=1&amp;code=ir_eng">Q3 2024 earnings report</a>, where it said a Stellar Blade PC release was "being considered within 2025". It then added that due to "Steam's expanding market share in the AAA game sector and the global success of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, we expect the performance on PC to exceed that on consoles."

<p>
Black Myth: Wukong, for context, was a barnstorming success when it released in August, managing to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-continues-its-dominance-with-new-milestone">sell 10m copies across PC and PS5 in just three days</a> and quickly becoming the most-viewed game on Chinese livestreaming platforms. And while Shift Up's targets for Stellar Blade on PC are likely to be considerably more modest, the developer still has positive expectations for the game's ongoing popularity.
</p><p>
"To enhance the IP value and maintain momentum, we have been consistently releasing content patches and updates, which has helped sustain the game's popularity," it noted of the PS5 version, adding that, "With the addition of the Nier: Automata DLC and ongoing marketing activities, we plan to maintain the IP's popularity until the platform expansion."
</p>
<p>
Stellar Blade's Nier: Automata DLC <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-nier-automata-dlc-drops-later-this-month">launches for PS5 on 20th November</a>, and there's also a "no ponytail" hair option for Eve, plus a new photo mode, on the way.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's  Jessica Orr awarded Stellar Blade four stars when she <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-review">reviewed it earlier this year</a>. "[There's] a fair bit of weirdness," she wrote, "but its killer tunes and vibey, flow-state combat - plus a transformative hard mode - are enough to leave you entranced."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294829/dragon-age-the-veilguard-hair-technology-frostbite-bioware<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>EA has shared <a href="https://www.ea.com/technology/news/strand-hair-dragon-age-the-veilguard">a lengthy blog</a> detailing all the technical work that went into rendering hair in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24281631/dragon-age-the-veilguard-early-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a>. </p></div><p>While it used to be, and in some cases still is, a struggle to find a game with a character creator that included a diverse range of hairstyles, newer games are getting better at providing styles to represent folks on the kinky / curly hair spectrum where a lot of people of color reside. However, the new struggle is getting those hairstyles to look and act natural. I remember looking at all the hairstyles in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22929852/horizon-forbidden-west-ps5-review"><em>Horizon Forbidden West</em></a><em> </em>and being bemused that the dreadlocks on Varl <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/horizon/comments/wdde3q/our_boy_with_the_beard/#lightbox">looked like they were made out of foam</a>, while his beard was simply straight hair without an ounce of kink a Black man like him typically has. So it was refreshing to see that BioWare put so much effort into not only including diverse hairstyles but also ensuring that hair behaved authentically.</p><p>EA’s blog talked about how its Strand Hair technology, “combines physics with real-time rendering to simulate believable modeling of human hair.” According to the blog, Strand Hair technology was already in use for EA’s sports titles where rendering human hair correctly is important in order to accurately portray the real people represented in those games. But because <em>Veilguard</em> features characters running through waterfalls or surrounded by magic particles — activities you won’t see in <em>Madden ‘25</em> — the Strand Hair tech needed further refinement.</p><p>“A major difference between <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>and existing Frostbite [EA’s in-house game engine] titles that have shipped with Strand Hair is the sheer variety and quantity of visual effects and transparent objects,” EA’s blog reads. “From magical spells to smoke, fire, and fog, the technology needed to blend seamlessly into the environment and magic of Thedas.” You can see Strand Hair in action in a video <a href="https://youtu.be/oZKFm-G6U9w?si=obNdHMIDsuhrNwAt">here</a>.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</p><div><figcaption>My Rook and her two hairstyles</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: BioWare</cite></p></div></div><p>The result is beautiful, luxurious-looking hair the likes of which I haven’t seen in any game I’ve played. I’m notoriously picky about hair in video games and I was suitably impressed by <em>Veilguard</em>’s offerings. I initially choose a cornrows / ponytail style for my Rook and was impressed that the choice came with styled baby hairs  — a common component of Black and Latinx hairstyles that get frequently overlooked by all but the most dedicated of hairstyle modders. These developers really did their homework. But while the technology and variety was a refreshing change of pace, I do think the tech works a little <em>too</em> well.</p><p>Black hair moves, but not as much as it does in <em>Veilguard</em>. About midway through my playthrough, I decided to change up my hairstyle (which you can do at any time, so don’t worry if you have character regrets after starting the game). I went from cornrows to a  short, slightly curly style kinda like Zoë Kravitz’s hair in <em>The Batman</em>.</p><p>In real life, short, close-cropped hair like that usually stays in place, but this style moved with literally every slight motion my character made. It was too goofy, like jiggle physics but with hair. I deeply respect and appreciate the amount of technical work that went rendering something as simple but deeply culturally significant as hair. It’s one of those little things that makes <em>Veilguard </em>a big improvement over previous <em>Dragon Age</em> games.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has been confirmed that Black Ops 6 will appear at the Esports World Cup in 2025. This is the first game to be locked in for the multi-million-dollar event, which is set to run between July and August 2025. This year’s Esports World Cup was the first iteration of the event, and it was a roaring success, by all account ts.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-locked-in">Locked In</h2>



<p>This year’s Esports World Cup saw everything represented, from League of Legends to Counter-Strike 2, and from Rainbow Six Siege to Rocket League. While Call of Duty (multiplayer, not battle royale) was a late addition to the monumental tournament, Activision has more than made up for that delay this year by making Black Ops 6 <strong>the first confirmed game </strong>for the Esports World Cup 2025.</p>



<p>In August, Atlanta FaZe stormed the stage and secured the $600,000 prize pool, beating an unlikely 100 Thieves team in an intense grand final in Riyadh. The tournament didn’t pull in as strong a viewership as the Call of Duty League, but it made for a nice change of pace in the off-season, and it allowed for a much more diverse roster of teams to compete</p>



<p>It’ll likely be the same format this year, with Challengers-grade teams mixing up with CDL squads in a Pro-Am setting. </p>



<p>As the months move by, we’ll see many more games surface in the line-up for the 2025 Esports World Cup. If the inaugural event was a showstopper, the event’s organisers will be pulling out all the stops to make sure that the second year is even bigger.</p>

<p>HBO has confirmed a release window for season 2 of The Last Of Us. According to the network itself, the current target is Spring 2025 for second season of the popular show.</p>



<p>In addition to the confirmation of a release window, a new short teaser was released for the show. You can watch that at the end of the story.</p>



<p>The Last of Us Season 2 will follow the events of the second game in the franchise. That said, there will be some additions to the show in the form of backstory. In September, series creator and head of Naughty Dog Neil Druckmann said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-season-two-backstory-important/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that the show will dive further</a> into areas that they couldn’t do for the game.</p>



<p>“And there’s stuff in this season that I’m really excited about — stuff that we hinted at — one scene in particular comes to mind that I think fans of the game will eat up, because it really kind of tells you a lot of backstory of this important character that there wasn’t really a way for us to even do that in the game,” he said. </p>



<p>It was also has been said that the story of the second game will likely be told over multiple seasons meaning that the show should at least get a third season.</p>



<p>“We don’t think that we’re going to be able to tell the story even within two [more] seasons because we’re taking our time and [going] down interesting pathways which we did a little bit in season one too,” Showrunner Crag Mazin told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/the-last-of-us-showrunner-season-two-casting-abby-1235560553/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. </p>



<p>“We feel like it’s almost assuredly going to be the case that – as long as people keep watching and we can keep making more television – season three will be significantly larger. And indeed, the story may require season four.”</p>

          <p>Spotify has lost all enthusiasm for the little music devices it sold for just half a year. Firmware hackers, as usually happens, have a lot more interest and have stepped in to save, and upgrade, a potentially useful gadget.</p>
<p>Spotify's idea a couple years ago was a car-focused device for those who lacked Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, or built-in Spotify support in their vehicles, or just wanted a dedicated Spotify screen. The <a href="https://carthing.spotify.com/">Car Thing</a> was a $100 doodad with a 4-inch touchscreen and knob that attached to the dashboard (or into a CD slot drive). All it could do was play Spotify, and only if you were a paying member, but that could be an upgrade for owners of older cars, or people who wanted a little desktop music controller.</p>
<p>But less than half a year after it fully released its first hardware device, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/pleas-for-open-sourcing-refunds-as-spotify-plans-to-brick-car-thing-devices/">Spotify gave up on the Car Thing</a>&nbsp;due to "several factors, including product demand and supply chain issues." A Spotify rep told Ars that the Car Thing was meant "to learn more about how people listen in the car," and now it was "time to say goodbye to the devices entirely." Spotify indicated&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/spotify-wont-open-source-car-thing-but-starts-refund-process/">it would offer refunds</a>, though not guaranteed, and moved forward with plans to brick the device in December 2024.</p>
<h2>It was always open source, just not publicly</h2>
<p>Enter Dammit Jeff, a YouTuber who dove into his device and shows off some alternative software ideas for it (as we first saw <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/11/12/what-to-do-with-the-spotify-car-thing/">on Adafruit's blog</a>). He even likes the little thing, noting that its wheel feels great, and that the four buttons on the top—originally meant for favorite playlists—present a lot of possibilities.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> is getting a "Welcome Back" booster for all players in the near future, one that will automatically level a chosen character to 50, let players choose between three different builds per class, and equip them with a new set of gear. It will also automatically unlock all of the Altars of Lilith for those who hadn't yet scoured the game's world to collect them all.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard announced the news as part of its most recent Diablo 4 Campfire Chat, where it covered balance changes coming as part of the mid-Season 6 update and answered fan questions.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfgP8oclT24" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IfgP8oclT24" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The boost will only be for characters on the game's Eternal (non-seasonal) realms, and is being done in part because of how the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-massive-loot-reborn-update-is-live-now-read-the-full-season-4-patch-notes/1100-6523441/" data-ref-id="1100-6523441">Season 4 Loot Reborn update</a> and its more recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-completely-changing-how-it-handles-difficulty-taking-a-page-from-diablo-3/1100-6526194/" data-ref-id="1100-6526194">Vessel of Hatred update</a> dramatically rebuilt the game in terms of loot, difficulty, leveling, and progression. Those updates in the process broke gear and builds for those who hadn't played in a while. Those who own the base game will receive one free character boost, while those who own the Vessel of Hatred expansion will receive two.</p><p dir="ltr">"A lot of players with Season 6 jumping back in, a lot of the gear went to 'Legacy' gear and this kind of gives them a way of being able to recover some of that and immediately get back into it," Diablo community manager Adam Fletcher said during the livestream.</p><p dir="ltr">Leveling to 50 and getting a new set of gear doesn't take too long in the current form of Diablo 4, but for those who have been putting off collecting all the Altars of Lilith since launch, the boost is a big win. When Diablo 4 first released, players spent hours finding each one (160 total) to gain all the Renown and, more importantly, small stat boosts each altar granted. Blizzard shortly after launch made finding Altars of Lilith account-wide, so players only ever needed to find them all once.</p><p dir="ltr">There will additionally be a free trial coming in the near future, one that will include the ability to take the expansion's new Spiritborn class for a spin. Blizzard said more details about the boost and free trial will be coming in an official blog later in the week.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of the Spiritborn, Blizzard confirmed during the livestream that the class is more than a little overpowered and overplayed at the moment (over 60% of players are playing the new class), but that it won't be nerfing it until Season 7 in January. In the meantime, Blizzard is buffing the game's original five classes in various ways to make up the difference.</p><p dir="ltr">In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-review-piercing-the-veil/1900-6418298/" data-ref-id="1900-6418298">Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred review</a>, we called the first expansion for Blizzard's hit-ARPG "a great entry point for lapsed Diablo 4 players" that delivers on making the entire experience "feel fresh again."</p>

Then again, maybe you have some groomsmen or bridesmaids you need to get gifts for. Can I recommend three Men’s Museum Classic Dress Watches at $700 each? Or a few Moda Ladies’ Watches in Gold-Tone and White Ceramic, currently on sale for just $600 each? Then you’ll be helldiving instead of scuba diving during that Bahamas honeymoon. </p><p>Remember, eternal love is priceless, but the PS5 console generation will only last another four years. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Arc Raiders, the upcoming extraction shooter from Embark Studios, has just revealed its gameplay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new Arc Raiders gameplay trailer features early tech test gameplay recorded in October 2024. The footage shown in this trailer is still a work in progress and “does not represent the final quality” of the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Arc Raiders gameplay reveal shows us what it feels like to be a part of the game’s universe, which is set in a distant future on Earth. In the gameplay trailer, we follow the mission of three raiders who are trying to complete a quest in the Buried City. Players begin in Speranza Piazza, a haven in the rust belt that protects civilisations from the Arc machines on the surface.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, this haven always needs resources, and Raiders venture out to bring these vital materials from the surface. The journey is treacherous, as the Raiders have to deal with the deadly Arc Machines that occupy the surface and be vigilant of rival Raiders who might be looking to steal their loot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Arc Raiders gameplay trailer reveals that players can access multiple surface regions through a network of tunnels from the Piazza. This mission takes players to Calabretta, Buried City. Here, players glimpse the post-apocalyptic universe created for the title while the Raiders explore the deeper city to retrieve a seed vault from a research facility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During this mission, the Raiders loot different types of resources while plotting a course for medical supplies at the pharmacy. While exploring, they see a red flare in the wild, which signifies a Raider being knocked down. However, there’s no way of knowing what happened without scoping out the location.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The players in the Arc Raiders gameplay trailer then proceed to the research facility, where they are greeted with bullets from the drone-like Arc machines. During this segment, we see the shooter mechanics as the Raiders shoot down several machines and fight other rival Raiders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The end of the Arc Raiders trailer explains that sometimes an aggressive approach might be the only way; however, there will be many other times when stealth might be the way to go. The Rust Belt is a land of opportunities and secrets to uncover, and players get to shape the Raiders they want to be in this world.&nbsp;</p>
