  <p id="704a0a"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24094572/lego-super-mario-kart-king-boo-bowser-peachs-castle-sets-pre-order-buy-details">Nintendo</a> and Lego’s Great Deku Tree set is a two-in-one homage to two incredible Zelda games: <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>. The $300 kit includes 2,500 pieces that allow you to build a Great Deku Tree scene from either of the iconic games.</p>
<p id="AcOxhB">“In addition to the Great Deku Tree, the set comprises iconic sceneries from the video games including the Master Sword pedestal from<em> Breath of the Wild</em>, as well as Link’s House from <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, allowing enthusiasts freedom to customise their display,” Lego said in a news release. “The build is elegantly mounted on stands, providing an effortless showcase of the set.”</p>
<p id="WXnI0O">Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma said Nintendo wanted the Deku Tree as the first Zelda set represented in Lego. Here’s how Lego and Nintendo describe the duality of the set:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="L0xaFt">Notably, both builds offer interactive features. In the <em>Breath of the Wild</em> rendition, the Great Deku Tree’s face can be animated with the simple press of a lever, while the <em>Ocarina of Time</em> Great Deku Tree version boasts a captivating mechanism: when activated, its mouth opens, revealing a cleverly designed Skulltula (a spider-like enemy from the games) that descends into its depths.</p>
<p id="Ojwk9U">In the <em>Breath of the Wild</em> version, enthusiasts will marvel at the Great Deku Tree adorned in vibrant pink blossoms, accompanied by the iconic Master Sword pedestal. Notably, this rendition boasts an engaging feature: the ability to animate the tree’s expressive eyebrows and mouth, adding depth to the build.</p>
<p id="8QFHE6">Meanwhile, in the <em>Ocarina of Time</em> version, builders will encounter a lush green foliage-adorned Great Deku Tree. This version includes Link’s House, a pivotal element tied to the <em>Ocarina of Time</em> narrative, adding an extra layer of nostalgia and authenticity to the set. It’s worth mentioning that regardless of which version you choose to build, you will have the ability to construct both the Master Sword pedestal and Link’s House as smaller models.</p>

  <p id="c1wQae">Making a Hollywood prequel is often seen as a studio grasping for profits or audience recognition, years after an initially successful project. There have been plenty of maligned examples over the years, like the three<em> </em>Star Wars prequel films — which are now being reconsidered as <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/2019/5/18/18629598/phantom-menace-star-wars-prequels-expanded-universe-best-books-tv-series-comics">enjoyable parts of a larger-than-ever galaxy</a> — or Ridley Scott’s return to the Alien universe in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/26/15442036/alien-covenant-prometheus-dr-shaw-david"><em>Prometheus</em></a> and<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/5/6/15569458/review-alien-covenant"><em>Alien: Covenant</em></a>.</p>
<p id="x79w4H">The newest player in the ever-ongoing prequel IP landscape is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24157385/furiosa-review-no-spoilers-george-miller-anya-taylor-joy"><em>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</em></a>, which transports viewers back to George Miller’s Wasteland for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24163561/furiosa-mad-max-original-1979-george-miller-movie">the origin story of the titular young warrior</a>, and her journey to becoming the fierce, fearsome Imperator we saw in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/5/14/8607723/mad-max-fury-road-review"><em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em></a>. The movie is a strange, successful journey through the Wasteland that earns its place as a necessary addition to the series — and to the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23969917/best-movie-prequels-indiana-jones-alien-planet-of-the-apes">small canon of Hollywood prequels that are worth your while</a>. Let’s talk about why this prequel is valuable to fans, among so many that add little to nothing to a franchise. </p>

<p id="Le8Zty">Something that immediately marks <em>Furiosa</em> out from its fellow prequels is the fact that the story and screenplay were written before <em>Fury Road</em> even came out. “This movie was written when we were preparing <em>Fury Road</em>,” Miller explained at <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24152155/furiosa-anime-vs-movie-george-miller-explains">an early screening of the film in Los Angeles</a>. “We realized that because that’s a story that basically happens over three days and two nights, all the content, all the subtext, all the exposition has to be done on the run. So in order to tell it cohesively, we had to know everything that happened before, so we wrote the story of Furiosa.” </p>
<p id="f2UMt3">The screenplay that became the final film was shared with all the creative team who worked on <em>Fury Road</em>, setting up a continuity that most prequels lack, as well as an origin story that was decisively connected to the film that came before it. That’s a far cry from most modern prequels, which are usually late-stage cash grabs. <em>Furiosa</em> was always part of the <em>Fury Road</em> world, and we see that in the way the world seamlessly continues from one film to the next, and the way <em>Furiosa </em>is filled with characters and locations from <em>Fury Road</em>, like the Citadel and Immortan Joe (Lachy Hulme). </p>

<p id="abTh90">Furiosa’s origin didn’t move directly from behind the scenes of <em>Fury Road</em> to the new film we’re receiving this year. It was developed as a potential anime series, and the live-action movie <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24152155/furiosa-anime-vs-movie-george-miller-explains">still carries some detail from that version</a>. It’s a great example of how the film has grown and shifted over the years, and how Miller is willing to <a href="https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Mad_Max:_Fury_Road_(Collected)">envision his stories in different mediums</a>.</p>
<p id="oaFZmC">It’s worth noting that alongside that original <em>Furiosa</em> screenplay, Miller also wrote one about Max’s life leading into the film. While that story might seem like the obvious one to turn into a prequel, at the LA screening he revealed it instead became a novella called <em>The Wasteland</em>, whereas his origin about Furiosa became a full screenplay with concept art. That creative journey’s current final result is highly efficient about what Miller and co-writer Nico Lathouris choose to show us, focusing on major emotional turning points in Furiosa’s life without dwelling too long on any one moment. </p>

<p id="aQoAQE">Charlize Theron’s performance as Furiosa was so game-changing that it reframed a decades-old franchise, revitalizing it and putting a story about a heroic woman and her quest for vengeance and justice at its center. Because we only got to spend three days with her rampaging across the Wasteland in <em>Fury Road</em>, plenty of viewers wanted more. While we’d already met Max in his three previous films, there were no other tales of Furiosa to revisit, which singles out the film as something different from, say, <em>Solo: A Star Wars Story</em>, a prequel where we already knew a lot about the main character when he was young, thanks to the original<em> </em>Star Wars trilogy. </p>
<p id="TO53in"><em>Furiosa</em> also doesn’t sweeten the character or soften her edges — unlike, for instance, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23998867/wonka-movie-review-timothee-chalamet">Paul King’s prequel <em>Wonka</em></a>, which erases all the danger and strangeness that are part and parcel with a character who’s willing to torture children to teach them moral lessons. That film recast <em>Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory</em>’s infinitely creepy chocolatier as a sweet, charming, whimsical fellow who would be lost in the original text of Roald Dahl’s often horrifying kids’ books.</p>
<p id="8in5CP"><em>Furiosa</em>, on the other hand, isn’t aimed at kids. Its R rating and its brutal approach puts its lead through the paces, allowing her to be full of rage, fury, and violence in a way women in action cinema often aren’t afforded. </p>

</p>
<p id="AinSoC">With Hollywood’s increased reliance on VFX to alter actors’ appearances, it’s surprisingly refreshing to see Miller rely on great casting to depict Furiosa’s early years. Like River Phoenix in <em>Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade</em>, Alyla Browne remakes an iconic role in a convincing, memorable way, delivering fantastic scenes full of emotion.</p>
<p id="vrF63r">It’s even more impressive considering Furiosa’s notoriously sparse dialogue, with growls, grunts, and expressions telling more of Furiosa’s story than her words do. Miller pays strong attention to continuity here, with Browne as child Furiosa and Anya Taylor-Joy as young adult Furiosa clearly on the same page when it comes to how to depict the title character. The result is a seamless transition for the character from stage to stage of life, keeping the suspension of disbelief fully intact as Miller immerses us in Mad Max’s wild world.</p>
<p id="gcWIZQ">Miller has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/furiosa-director-why-he-decided-against-de-aging-charlize-theron-mad-max-prequel?utm_source=facebook%2Cthreads%2Ctwitter">referenced films</a> like <em>The Irishman and</em> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/10/2/20893933/gemini-man-review-will-smith"><em>Gemini Man</em></a> as the reasons he chose not to cast Theron in the role and use VFX on her face. Both of those films’ use of de-aging arguably distract from the story at hand, and the choice to cast Taylor-Joy keeps Furiosa from falling into the same trap. There are no surface distractions from the central story, which is lucky, as it’s stuffed with action set-pieces, unusual characters, and an emotional engine it’s not afraid to rev. </p>

<p id="HaEQCZ">Lackluster prequels often leave fans wondering, <em>Did these new details really add anything worthwhile to this world?</em> — cough, midi-chlorians, cough. But Furiosa’s brutal backstory doesn’t suffer from this predicament. Instead of defanging or overexploring Mad Max’s Wasteland, <em>Furiosa</em> expands on the long-running lore that provides intriguing new insights into different corners of the world.</p>
<p id="2SHrkO">Miller’s 1979 series launcher <em>Mad Max</em> was a tight slice of the lore and world he was introducing, and each film that came after it slightly widened that slice of the post-apocalyptic pie. In <em>Fury Road</em>,<em> </em>he expanded the world with a new set of characters and a new villain, Immortan Joe, but still kept the efficient scope of just a single wild journey over three days. With <em>Furiosa</em>,<em> </em>Miller widens the lens on the entire world over multiple years, showcasing the fragmented origins of the Wasteland and teasing just how the world ended up like this. We’re also introduced to multiple new characters and factions without any overexplanation, and they all feel like they could be ripe to explore further. </p>
<p id="CBXRIm">There’s an added contextual weight here, too, with future viewings of<em> Fury Road</em> permanently changed by the events of <em>Furiosa</em>. Glimpsing the idyllic utopia of Furiosa’s youth provides a bright spot of hope in an otherwise bleak landscape. And better understanding the Citadel’s high-stakes “guzzolene” runs gives us a unique look at both the culture and business of the terrifying desert community. <em>Furiosa</em> leaves us with a more holistic impression of life in the Wasteland and of Mad Max’s reality. </p>
<p id="zGa7b8">As Hollywood battles to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24144727/2024-movie-release-schedule-blockbusters-2025-box-office">understand and predict</a> what its audience wants in 2024, perhaps it can learn something from <em>Furiosa</em>. While it could be hard for some IP-based adaptations to go as wildly off-road as Miller does with the fifth entry in his Road Warrior franchise, they’d benefit from at least adopting some of his courage. If other prequel-makers dared to step out of the boxes they’re often squashed into — maybe introduce new characters, new eras, even a new tone to their movies, anything to make those movies matter — then “prequel” would stop being such a dispiriting word for fans of unique, innovative movies. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24166198/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="UnnzfD"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, the next major entry in Activision’s enduring military shooter franchise, will be available as part of Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/best-games/22372750/best-game-pass-games-xbox">Game Pass subscription service</a> from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/23911151/call-of-duty-game-pass-release">day one</a>, a new trailer for the game confirms. While said trailer does not appear to include any actual gameplay from this year’s Call of Duty, it does offer the promise of much more info, which is coming on June 9.</p>
<p id="uiYlfY">That’s the Sunday when <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23915545/microsoft-activision-blizzard-deal-close">Activision’s new owner Microsoft</a> will hold its 2024 Xbox Games Showcase — which will be followed by another presentation, the <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> Direct. Activision promises an “in-depth look at gameplay in this dark new chapter of the Black Ops series” as part of that Call of Duty livestream.</p>
<p id="GDhleA">For now, Call of Duty fans will have to settle for uncanny lookalikes and soundalikes of former U.S. Presidents Bill Clinton and George Bush, former secretary of state Colin Powell,  former U.K. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, and former president of Iraq Saddam Hussein. Those political figures will play an important role in the setting of <em>Black Ops 6</em>, which takes place during the Gulf War.</p>
<p id="U79V8v">Previous Black Ops games have featured real-world U.S. presidents, including <a href="https://www.polygon.com/videos/23769879/jfk-assassination-video-games">John F. Kennedy</a> and Richard Nixon in the original <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops</em>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/call-of-duty/2020/8/27/21404151/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-footage-ronald-reagan-trailer">Ronald Reagan</a> in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/11/17/21570340/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war-campaign-review"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</em></a>. How players will interact with those early ’90s politicians remains to be seen, but we’ll find out more about the next Call of Duty soon enough.</p>
<p id="hk3vF4">Activision and Black Ops developer Treyarch have been teasing their new Call of Duty in recent days, primarily with ’90s nostalgia-laden videos that set the stage for the Gulf War-era setting of <em>Black Ops 6</em>. </p>

It’s become something of a cult classic but hasn’t seen a release since the remastered version in 2011 for PS3 and Xbox 360. <em>Resident Evil Zero, </em>a prequel to the original <em>Resident Evil</em>, follows STARS member Rebecca Chambers; its story beats lead directly into the events that take place in the Spencer Mansion during <em>RE1</em>.

A <em>CODE: Veronica </em>remake would have especially felt apt after either the <em>RE2</em> or <em>RE3</em> remakes were released.

<p>If you’ve been sitting and hoping for an announcement on Resident Evil 9 to happen soon, you may want to sit down for this. According to known insider Dusk Golem, the game is pretty far out.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1795075373727613065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thread on Twitter</a> over the weekend, Dusk Golem say that people should “wipe the expectations of [Resident Evil 9] being announced this summer period.” He then went on to say that the game’s announcement is further away with a full release not likely until 2025 or 2026.</p>



<p>Originally, he claimed that the game was being targeted for a January 2025 release with a reveal coming “soon”. That seems to no longer be the case, and it’s something he apologized for.</p>



<p>“Sorry for the back-and-forth on that, that’s my fault,” he said. </p>



<p>As far as other games in the franchise, Dusk Golem says there’s no truth to rumors of a Resident Evil 1 or Resident Evil 5 remake being in development. The only remakes in development, he said, are <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-zero-are-next-two-remakes-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Code Veronica and Zero</a>.</p>



<p>“[Resident Evil 5] is not actively in dev now either,” he said. “It’s been funny seeing this.”</p>



<p>Despite the game’s announcement and release not coming soon, there are some things that he’s claimed about the game, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-9-location-to-be-set-on-an-island-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that it’ll be set on an island</a> in Southeast Asia.</p>



<p>As always with rumors like these, until they are either confirmed by the studio or independently verified by Insider Gaming, please take them with a grain of salt.</p>

<p>Insider Gaming has learned that XDefiant has hit just shy of 8 million unique players in its first week of release.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, XDefiant has approximately 7.6 million unique players, and multiple sources expect that number to reach 8 million by the end of today.</p>



<p>Late last week, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming reported</a> that XDefiant had seen 1 million unique players in its first 2.5 hours, making it Ubisoft’s fastest title to reach the milestone. 48 hours after launch, the game had 3 million unique players.</p>



<p>It’s understood that a ‘unique player’ means that the player has downloaded the game and opened it for the first time. The internal goal was to hit 5 million unique players within the game’s first month – a goal that has quickly been surpassed.</p>



<p>As many from our original report pointed out, unique player numbers don’t mean much in the grand scheme of things. Speaking with sources, several developers working on the project have also expressed the same sentiment, but they [developers] have said that it’s being actively addressed, with netcode being the main priority. </p>



<p>Concurrent player data, arguably the most critical metric, has reached a high of around 700,000 players, achieved on Monday, May 27th, a holiday day for many countries. But whether or not XDefiant can maintain such high player numbers remains to be seen—one thing is for certain, though: It’s an impressive statistic. </p>



<p>XDefiant is available on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>

<p>The next game coming from Capcom in the Resident Evil franchise won’t be Resident Evil 9. Instead, the studio is working on remakes of Resident Evil Code Veronica and Resident Evil Zero.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1795075373727613065" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">notable leaker Dusk Golem</a>, both titles have been in development and will be the next games to release.</p>



<p>“I’ve talked to many others behind the scenes about this at this point, it’s something I heard over a year ago, think it was going to get out whether I was the one to say it or not, &amp; that’s about it,” they said.</p>



<p>Released originally for the Sega Dreamcast in 2000, Code Veronica was the first game in the series to release on a different platform before coming to PlayStation. Zero also released on a different platform first, launching in 2002 for the Nintendo GameCube as an exclusive. It eventually made it’s way to Xbox, PlayStation, and PC in 2016.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Capcom on the reports, and will update this story should a response be received.</p>

There it will share more details on the game, with a first in-depth look at gameplay “in this dark new chapter” of the Black Ops series.</p><p>Microsoft made the announcement alongside the release of a live-action reveal trailer called 'The Truth Lies'. In it we see world leaders including Bill Clinton, Margaret Thatcher, George H. W. Bush, and Saddam Hussein, delivering cryptic speeches. Black Ops 6 is reported to be set during the events of the Gulf War during the early '90s.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Live Action Reveal Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>News of Black Ops 6's release into Game Pass doesn't come as much of a surprise. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-exec-suggests-call-of-duty-2024-will-launch-straight-into-game-pass">Xbox president Sarah Bond</a> recently indicated all Microsoft games, including those developed by the recently acquired Activision, would launch straight into Game Pass.</p><p>Microsoft has faced tough questions around the potential cannibalization effect of Game Pass, particularly on games that launch on the service day-one. While Xbox executives have insisted sales can be boosted by a game’s presence on Game Pass, some publishers remain unconvinced. Former Activision boss Bobby Kotick, for example, was always against putting Call of Duty into subscription services. Unlike Microsoft, console rival Sony does not release its new exclusives straight into its subscription service.</p><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-on-potentially-bringing-call-of-duty-and-other-activision-blizzard-games-to-game-pass">an interview with IGN</a> last year, Xbox boss Phil Spencer was asked how he’d handle his and Kotick’s different ideologies after the deal to buy Activision Blizzard closed. "Well, there's a different person making the decisions," Spencer laughed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>New Call of Duty games sell for $70 and usually shift around 25 million copies, amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue. By releasing this year’s Call of Duty straight into Game Pass, Microsoft potentially risks cannibalizing those sales. Of course, Activision will also launch Call of Duty across Xbox, PlayStation, and PC as a game that can be bought outright. But with Game Pass subscriber numbers failing to grow meaningfully Microsoft is under pressure to attract new customers. Adding a mainline Call of Duty game at launch will no doubt help with that. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/17/24158934/microsoft-call-of-duty-xbox-game-pass-plans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Verge</a> has reported Microsoft is considering raising the price of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate again.</p><p>Microsoft is in the process of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">cutting 1,900 staff from its gaming business</a>. Earlier this month, the company shocked the video game world by announcing <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">the closure of Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin</a>. There are fears more cuts are to come.</p><p>Microsoft is yet to announce a release date, pricing, or platforms for Black Ops 6, but it will reportedly launch across PC, last-gen and current-gen consoles.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

You can preorder it at the <a href="https://zdcs.link/NMKGY" target="_blank">LEGO Store</a> now.</p><div id="201337"><p><h3>LEGO Great Deku Tree 2-in-1</h3></p><div><p>With this 2-in-1 set, you can build the Great Deku Tree in the style of Ocarina of Time or Breath of the Wild with the same pieces. Out September 1.</p></div></div><p>This 2,500 piece set lets owners build the Great Deku Tree from either the N64's Ocarina of Time or the Nintendo Switch's Breath of the Wild. Here are the dimensions:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Breath of the Wild:</strong><br>W. 33 cm<br>H. 31cm</li><li><strong>Ocarina of Time:</strong><br>W. 21 cm<br>H. 33 cm</li></ul><p>The box includes four LEGO minifigures, with Breath of the Wild Princess Zelda and Link dressed in their recognisable blue attire, and Ocarina of Time including both Young Link and Link. There are also buildable characters and creatures such as Hestu the Korok (complete with his maracas), several smaller Koroks, Deku Babas, Navi the Fairy, the Deku Sprout, and a Skulltula. Check out images and photos of the set in the slideshow below:</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>The Legend of Zelda Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 LEGO Set Images</h3></div></output><p>Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>This 2,500-piece set encapsulates the essence of adventure and nostalgia whilst featuring meticulous details. Fans can build a selection of their fondest moments from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time or from The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild through building and exploring the depths of the Great Deku Tree. In addition to the Great Deku Tree, the set comprises iconic sceneries from the video games including the Master Sword pedestal from Breath of the Wild, as well as Link’s House from Ocarina of Time, allowing enthusiasts freedom to customize their display. The build is elegantly mounted on stands, providing an effortless showcase of the set.</blockquote><blockquote>Notably, both builds offer interactive features. In the Breath of the Wild rendition, the Great Deku Tree’s face can be animated with the simple press of a lever, while the Ocarina of Time Great Deku Tree version boasts a captivating mechanism: when activated, its mouth opens, revealing a cleverly designed Skulltula (a spider-like enemy from the games) that descends into its depths.</blockquote><blockquote>In the Breath of the Wild version, enthusiasts will marvel at the Great Deku Tree adorned in vibrant pink blossoms, accompanied by the iconic Master Sword pedestal. Notably, this rendition boasts an engaging feature: the ability to animate the tree’s expressive eyebrows and mouth, adding depth to the build. </blockquote><blockquote>Meanwhile, in the Ocarina of Time version, builders will encounter a lush green foliage-adorned Great Deku Tree. This version includes Link’s House, a pivotal element tied to the Ocarina of Time narrative, adding an extra layer of nostalgia and authenticity to the set. It’s worth mentioning that regardless of which version you choose to build, you will have the ability to construct both the Master Sword pedestal and Link’s House as smaller models.</blockquote><p>Eiji Aonuma, producer of The Legend of Zelda series at Nintendo, commented: “I’m really thrilled that The Legend of Zelda is joining the world of LEGO bricks, which has spurred the creative impulses of so many people of all ages.</p><p>“The Deku Tree was the first element from The Legend of Zelda we wanted to represent using LEGO bricks. This set allows you to build two different versions of the Deku Tree from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time and The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild with unique features that are a great fit for the nature of the series. I can’t wait for everyone to get the chance to build this part of The Legend of Zelda world with their own hands.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p>The latest GamesIndustry.biz Microcast is now available in both podcast and video form, and can be watched below.</p>

<p>This week, we discuss (to the extent that we can, given how early into the transition period we are) our change of ownership with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ign-entertainment-acquires-eurogamer-gi-vg247-rock-paper-shotgun-and-more">IGN parent Ziff Davis acquiring Gamer Network Ltd</a> and its brands, which includes <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> and our sister sites Eurogamer, VG247, Rock Paper Shotgun and more.</p>
<p>We also talk about the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/helldivers-2-developer-arrowhead-names-shams-jorjani-as-its-new-ceo">new leadership at Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Games</a> as well as the studio's ambitions for the future, which you can <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/arrowhead-games-we-want-to-be-the-next-from-software-or-blizzard">read more about in Chris' interview on the site</a>. </p>
<p>Finally, we reflect on the impact of the other acquisitions announced last week; namely, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-acquires-switch-port-specialist-shiver-entertainment-from-embracer">Nintendo taking Shiver Entertainment</a> off Embracer Group's hands, and Atari ending the first console war by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/atari-acquires-intellivision-brand-and-over-200-games">snapping up the Intellivision brand</a>.</p>

        <p>Money raised will fund development of its forthcoming VR combat title</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Toronto-based Sinn Studio has raised $2.5 million in a funding round led by Hartmann Capital.</p>
<p>The funds will go towards building technology to support its next real-time PvP VR combat game, which is currently in development.</p>
<p>The studio also received contributions from Boost VC, Republic, Alumni Ventures, Mana Ventures, MetaVision, and other angel investors including Uken Games CEO Chris Ye.</p>
<p>"We spent seven years surviving the ups and downs of VR as a bootstrapped company, waiting for that industry-defining moment, and the right partners to commit to our first fundraiser," said Sinn Studio co-founder and CEO Alek Sinn.</p>
<p>"We're incredibly grateful to Hartmann Capital and everyone else who joined our seed round for their belief in our mission to redefine the future of combat in this exciting new era of spatial computing."</p>
<p>Sinn Studio was co-founded in 2017 by Alek Sinn and Almir Brljak, and has since grown to become a team of 30 employees.</p>
<p>It launched its first title Swordsman in 2020 on Steam, which was later released on Quest, Pico, and PSVR 2.</p>

This would make it the perfect candidate to launch on Xbox Game Pass, Microsoft's gaming subscription service, in order to bring new subscribers in. Black Ops 6 was officially revealed last week, and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/09/xbox-reportedly-debating-putting-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-alongside-price-hike">while it was reported to be in consideration for a Game Pass launch</a>, today, the news was confirmed from Xbox itself. <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/28/play-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-game-pass/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will launch on Game Pass day one</a>.</p>

<p>We don't know much about the game yet, but <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/23/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-be-featured-at-xboxs-summer-showcase">two live-action teasers</a> have been released so far. The first features a group of people covering the faces of Mount Rushmore with blindfolds that say,&nbsp;"The truth lies." The second, released today, can be seen below.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TGnCArMHE58" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>It features world leaders' black and white camera footage speaking in hushed tones about a grand conspiracy about manufactured wars and the elusive nature of the truth. The trailer ends with the game's full title, along with a reminder that <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/04/30/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-followed-by-a-secret-direct-for-a-beloved">the full reveal will come on June 9, after Xbox's summer showcase</a>.</p>

The 2-in-1 aims to satisfy both old-school and new-school fans and is set to go on sale in January.</p>

<p>The 2,500-piece set lets owners build two scenes modeled after the Great Deku Tree from Ocarina of Time and Breath of the Wild. In terms of characters, it includes both versions of Link, BOTW Zelda, and the maraca-shaking Hestu. Smaller details include the cooking pot, a Skulltula, treasure chests, and a Korok tucked away on the treetop.</p>



<p>The Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 costs $299.99 and can be pre-ordered now on Lego's <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/great-deku-tree-2-in-1-77092">website</a>.

PDT. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/10/19/konami-announces-silent-hill-2-remake-silent-hill-f-a-new-movie-and-more">The last Silent Hill Transmission</a> happened in 2022 and revealed a surprising amount of Silent Hill news including the reveal of the remake of Silent Hill 2, Silent Hill f, a new Silent Hill movie, and more.</p>

<p>The post announcing the event reads, "Consider this your invitation letter to Silent Hill. ✉️ Tune in May 30 at 4 p.m. PDT to our SILENT HILL YouTube channel for the second installment of the #SILENTHILL Transmission where we'll share game updates, a deeper look at the film, and new merch."</p>

<p>The safe bet is a teaser trailer for the movie and hopefully new details about the Silent Hill 2 remake and Silent Hill f, the latter of which seems like the franchise's next big original entry. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2023/10/31/ascension-takes-place-before-the-originals-but-isnt-quite-a-prequel">Silent Hill Ascension</a>, the online mobile narrative game where players dictated the story choices, also finished up its first season (though the developer may have a different term for it), so it's possible we may learn what's next for that game.</p>

<p data-characters="325" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Following a short but effective delivery of targeted democracy where it counts the most, <em>Helldivers 2</em> players have successfully unlocked <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-getting-new-dual-autocannon-exosuit-but-gotta-earn-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Emancipator mech</a>. With a quad-autocannon weapons platform in tow, you’d expect the Emancipator to be the most popular <em>Helldivers 2</em> item ever, but there are some issues with that.</p> <p data-characters="603" data-current-count="603" data-injectable="true">Certainly, <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s exciting new mech (it’s yellow!) is the talk of the town, but not in the way anyone expected it to be. Notably, the community appears to be unsure what to make of the Emancipator, generally speaking, as the mech has inherited all the issues <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2s-patch-fixes-the-paper-mache-mechs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its oft-forgotten predecessor</a> has had since day one. The biggest concern, generally, is that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-players-mock-the-games-fragile-mechs-and-manufacturer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s mechs are made of plywood and glue</a>, but the vehicle’s autocannons aren’t all they’re made out to be, either, which has resulted in some players being fairly disappointed with the whole ordeal.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-the-helldivers-2-emancipator-mech-has-a-troubled-road-ahead" data-injectable="false">The Helldivers 2 Emancipator mech has a troubled road ahead</h2> <p data-characters="528" data-current-count="828" data-injectable="true">Even though the Emancipator comes with <em>four</em> full-sized autocannons by default, it would seem that this variant of the weapon is a fair bit weaker than the one Helldivers can lug around on their backs. Specifically, its munitions deal a great deal less durability damage (60, as opposed to the support autocannon’s 260), which leads to situations where it takes 25 perfect Bile Titan headshots to take it down using the Emancipator. The mech autocannons are, in other words, far less useful when dealing with large targets.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="730" data-current-count="1030" data-injectable="true">It’s not all grim, mind. The Emancipator is, from the looks of it, purpose-built to deal with <em>medium</em>-sized enemies. When properly supported by a full squad of Helldivers (<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-may-not-be-a-solo-game-but-its-how-i-like-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">don’t be like me, folks</a>) that will deal with the more exotic threats, such as the aforementioned Bile Titan bugs, the Emancipator will make <em>very</em> short work of Chargers and the like. It’s particularly useful on the bot front, in fact, where engaging the clankers from afar with quad-explosive rounds will inevitably lead to efficient territory gains. As suggested before, though, as soon as the bots can engage your Emancipator without interference, it folds like a stack of cards, which is a problem with <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s mechs at large.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="378" data-current-count="678" data-injectable="true">As long as you can stay on top of <em>all</em> of the bot reinforcements before they get to shoot at your mech, then, you do have the opportunity to do some serious damage with the Emancipator. Sadly, its 10-minute cooldown with a two-unit cap per mission mean that it’s hardly the type of force multiplier that it could be, if it was either more accessible or slightly more tanky.</p>
 <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false">It’s not hard to see why the community might be confused as to what to make of this new mech, then. Some are having lots of fun with the Emancipator in its current configuration, whereas others see the sheer potential of the mech vehicles in <em>Helldivers 2</em> and wish that Arrowhead would choose to deliver upon this fantasy.</p> <figure data-current-count="627" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="406" data-current-count="406" data-injectable="false">For what it’s worth, the former Arrowhead Games CEO does agree that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/former-helldivers-2-ceo-says-time-to-kill-too-high-promises-balance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s time-to-kill is a fair bit too high</a>, which suggests some big changes are ahead for the game’s meta. Making <em>some</em> enemies less tanky would certainly help elevate the Emancipator’s usefulness in the long run, but at least it’s being used a lot now that it serves as a free fifth Stratagem, right?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-like-the-way-lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-thinks.882873/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/lorelei-laser-eyes-puzzles-logic<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After writing about<a href="https://aftermath.site/lorelei-laser-eyes-tips-steam-nintendo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em> Lorelei and the Laser Eyes </em></a>last week, a friend and I have been playing it obsessively, cramming in the hours until the phrase “<a href="https://x.com/A_i/status/1792999471418318918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It’s locked</a>” appears in our dreams. As I predicted, the game is a lot more fun with a buddy–one who can bring a new perspective but doesn’t have to bring new knowledge, because of the excellent design choice to put everything you need to solve the game’s puzzles in the game itself.</p><p><em>Lorelei</em> is crammed with books, notes, posters, and signs, all of which get saved in your character’s memory. This stashed stuff, as far as I can tell, contains all the information you need to solve the puzzles the game throws at you. There’s a document about Roman numerals, and one explaining <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strobogrammatic_number" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strobogrammatic numbers</a>, and one explaining astrological signs, and one explaining the Greek alphabet, all concepts you’ll need to know. If you need to know a name or a date, you’ll find something inside the hotel with the answer or a clue to it.&nbsp;</p><p>I appreciate this for a couple reasons. For one, it means that when my friend and I felt like a puzzle was referencing something we didn’t understand, we knew we’d find it somewhere along the line, instead of assuming it was some gap in our own knowledge. We knew not to rush to Google like many other puzzle games assume you will or require you to. <em>Lorelei</em> drives this idea home in a couple of pivotal puzzles I won’t spoil for you, both of which require knowledge about the game and its environments. It subtly tells you how to think about and pay attention to the game, while also making <em>Lorelei</em>’s strange hotel feel like its own unique, contained world.&nbsp;</p><p>This design also gave us some guardrails when trying to figure out what a puzzle wanted. The other night, we were attempting to solve a puzzle with a list of numbers and some blanked-out spaces, and we weren’t sure what it was asking us to do. My friend thought she’d seen a similar type of puzzle before in her own life, but I’d never heard of that kind of thing; it seemed like an obscure, specialized kind of math, or at least not one commonly encountered. Because of this, we figured that it was probably not what the game wanted us to do; we tried it anyway (or, my friend did some wild thing with numbers in our notebook while I watched), and sure enough, it wasn’t the solution.</p><p>In a similar vein, from what I’ve seen so far, puzzles follow a certain consistent internal logic that I also appreciate. Puzzles seem to fall into certain categories: all the movie posters near locked doors require referring to a certain piece of information; all these [spoilers] fit into [spoilers]; all these safes are opened with clues from nearby documents. (What do I do with the things in the safes? No idea!) This has helped my friend and I know where <em>not</em> to look when trying to solve something, or kept us on track when we’d start spinning wild connections between disparate pieces of information. This can be maddening–there’s one puzzle we’ve been staring at for hours, having no idea how to translate its clue into action, but we <em>know </em>it’s in there–but it’s also comforting–from what I’ve seen so far, the game isn’t going to throw a curveball at us by changing up the logic of a category of puzzle. Puzzles seem like they stay in their lanes, as it were; despite how overwhelming all these puzzles felt when I first encountered them, now that I understand the basics of what they want, they feel far less stressful. (Again, this doesn’t mean I have any idea how to <em>solve</em> many of them!)&nbsp;</p><p>The more my friend and I have played, the more I’ve come to see and appreciate how <em>Lorelei </em>thinks, to see how fair and reasonable it is even when it drops something in my lap that makes me yell “what the fuck?!” and throw my pen across the room. Don’t get me wrong, the game is positively maddening, but I know when I’m stumped that it’s a question of how I’m thinking about a puzzle, not because I’m not so great at math or because there’s some trick. Many solutions have been surprising, but they haven’t felt illogical or like they came out of nowhere.&nbsp;</p><p>We haven’t finished the game yet, though it feels like we’re heading toward the end of its narrative. There’s still a host of puzzles that we have no clue how to solve or if we even <em>need</em> to solve them to finish, so it’s possible there’s something I haven’t seen yet that will throw this blog out the window. (If you’ve finished it and I’m wrong about all this, let me know!) But <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> has gone from a game that intimidated and frustrated me at first glance to one whose world and logic I can’t get enough of, whose puzzles I take pictures of on my phone to stare at when I’m not at my desk. I’m both excited to solve its biggest puzzles and find out how it ends, and one of those games I feel like I never want to be done with.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/28/the-ps-plus-monthly-games-for-june-2024-have-been-revealed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The June 2024 <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> monthly games have been confirmed, with Sony offering up a trio of games for all PS Plus subscribers – Essentials, Extra and Premium. Headlining this month’s selection is Streets of Rage 4, the retro revival of the classic beat ’em up series.</p>
<p>The announcement has come with the big Days of Play 2024 promotion launch, which will bring big discounts to subscriptions, hardware, and across the PS Store. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/28/day-of-play-2024-adds-psvr-2-games-to-ps-plus-premium-kicks-off-huge-ps-store-sale/">Head here for more details</a>.</p>



<p>The following three&nbsp;games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, 4th June.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SpongeBob Squarepants: The Cosmic Shake</strong></li>
<li><strong>AEW Fight Forever</strong></li>
<li><strong>Streets of Rage 4</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Streets of Rage 4 is a modern classic, for side-scrolling beat ’em up fans. Published by DotEmu, whose reputation for retro revivals was already well established, it was another big success story. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/29/streets-of-rage-4-review/">9/10 Streets of Rage 4 review</a>, Aran said, “The fighting is great, the visuals are great, and the soundtrack is great. Lizardcube and Guard Crush have managed to capture the essence of those classic games and upgrade it for the modern age.</p>


<p>The same can’t really be said of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/07/aew-fight-forever-review/">AEW Fight Forever</a>, which thoroughly disappointed our resident wrestling head, Ade. So let’s move right along.</p>
<p>Rounding things out, SpongeBob Squarepants: The Cosmic Shake was a solid if unremarkable new platformer based on the incredibly popular cartoon series. “SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake is a decent 3D platformer filled with all the SpongeBob humour you’d expect, but it feels like a step back when compared to the far more imaginative Battle for Bikini Bottom: Reheydrated,” Steve said <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/30/spongebob-squarepants-the-cosmic-shake-review/">in our review</a>.</p>

<p>What do you think of this month’s games?</p>
<h2>Can you still get the May 2024 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>You can still grab May’s titles up until the new set of game’s arrives on 6th June, but with the Euros just about to get going, you’ll be able to get EA Sports FC 24 through 18th June. What a nice surprise for inattentive football likers?</p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>EA Sports FC 24</strong> (PS4 | PS5)</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Ghostrunner 2</strong> (PS5)</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Tunic</strong> (PS4 | PS5)</span></li>
<li><span><strong>Destiny 2: Lightfall</strong> (PS4 | PS5)</span></li>
</ul>

The Great Deku Tree 2-in-1 includes 2,500 pieces, <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=13923&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fgreat-deku-tree-2-in-1-77092">is available for preorder</a> now for $299.99, and will start shipping out in September.</p><p>The set covers two different <em>Zelda</em> games: <em>Ocarina of Time </em>and <em>Breath of the Wild, </em>letting you build the Great Deku Tree in green summer foliage or pink spring cherry blossoms. It features several versions of Link, including Link as a child and an adult in <em>Ocarina of Time</em>’s green Hero of Time tunic and Link in <em>Breath of the Wild</em>’s blue Champion’s tunic.</p><p>According to Lego, the Great Deku Tree set will have interactive features including the ability to animate the tree’s facial expressions. The set also includes a skulltula, koroks, Hestu waving his signature maracas, fairies, and Princess Zelda herself.</p><p>Several Nintendo properties including <em>Animal Crossing</em>, <em>Mario</em>, and <em>Donkey Kong </em>have gotten the Lego treatment in recent years. There’s been pent-up demand: Lego has rejected fan-submitted ideas for a <em>Zelda</em>-themed set for years, going so far as to outright ban <em>Zelda </em>submissions back in 2022 due to “license conflict.” However, rumors regarding an official <em>Zelda</em> Lego set <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/1/23581768/legend-of-zelda-lego-leak-jean-grey-forever-promobricks">started popping up</a> in February of last year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But it’s still a truly special game that sparked what I’d argue is one of PlayStation’s most underrated series. It would be nice if this led to Sony supporting the series further with a fifth entry to resolve 2013’s <em>Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time</em>’s devastating cliffhanger, but PlayStation will never give me that relief.</p><figure id="" data-id="7ecac186cca97bdae00f54b1638ed1e8" data-recommend-id="image://7ecac186cca97bdae00f54b1638ed1e8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1800" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sly jumping from a roof." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sly jumping from a roof." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sucker Punch Productions</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7ecac186cca97bdae00f54b1638ed1e8" data-recommend-id="image://7ecac186cca97bdae00f54b1638ed1e8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1800" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sly jumping from a roof." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>All of these games are being added to the PS2 section of the Classics catalog as part of Sony’s Days of Play sale.

It’s up to you to figure out the secret to attracting new and adorable frogs. You can complete your collection by unlocking all the rare colors through a special breeding mini-game. When new ones join your refuge, use the in-game camera to take photos of them and collect them for your frogedex!</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Restore the Wetlands</strong></p><p>In order to succeed in your quest for frog preservation, you will need to restore the nearby wetlands to their former glory. This will allow you to continually support and cultivate the area through a process known as paludiculture!</p><p>Dig ponds to let water roam the land again and plant native wetlands species to harvest precious crops. From there, you can transform your pickings into manufactured goods that can be sold to improve your froggy habitat further!</p><p><strong>Customize Your Frog Refuge</strong></p><p>New furniture will bring new frogs with it! As you personalize your habitat, new breeds of frogs will be attracted to specific kinds of furniture. Plus, it’ll attract attention to the area–and with it, new visitors!

<p data-characters="250" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Oh, look. It’s been a picosecond since the last Steam sales event. No doubt many of you took advantage of the last one – the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/balatro-stellaris-and-more-are-in-steams-endless-replayability-fest/">Endless Replayability Fest</a>. Well, don’t put your money away just yet, as we’re already onto the next one.</p> <p data-characters="321" data-current-count="321" data-injectable="false">Beginning yesterday, the Steam Open World Survival Crafting Fest (and breathe) offers discounts on a series of well-known and slightly less well-known games from, well, Open World Survival Crafting games. You’ve got until Monday, June 3 at 10 a.m. PT to choose from what I would say is a pretty good list of titles.</p> <figure data-current-count="621" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Steam Open World Survival Crafting Fest 2024: Official Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Q-LiQqpPww?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">Take a quick look on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/open_world_survival_craft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sales page</a> to see for yourself. Want 30% off <em>Sons of the Forest</em>? Of course you do. How about 33% off <em>Project Zomboid</em>? An odd number, but sure! Or maybe you want to get <em>Stranded Deep</em>, <em>Valheim</em>, or <em>Subnautica</em> for 50% off each. Even <em>Palworld</em> is there, at 10% off the regular asking price.</p> <h2 id="h-summer-lovin" data-injectable="false">Summer lovin’</h2> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="577" data-injectable="true">These events seem to come around more often these days. However, we’re not quite at the big <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-does-the-steam-summer-sale-2024-begin/">Steam Summer Sale</a> just yet. That begins in a few weeks. You can keep an eye on the <a href="https://steamdb.info/sales/history/?event=160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SteamDB</a> countdown if you really want to see exactly when it’s scheduled to begin.</p>
 <p data-characters="242" data-current-count="242" data-injectable="false">Crafting and survival games feel like they shouldn’t be as popular as they are. But as we can see here, there are still so many offerings, largely from more independent studios. A lot of them are pretty decent as well, in my experience.</p> <p data-characters="196" data-current-count="438" data-injectable="false">There are definitely more than a few in the sale that I’m keen to try out; <em>Sons of the Forest</em>, <em>Project Zomboid</em>, maybe even <em>Enshrouded</em>. Can I afford all these games? Check back with me later.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-is-now-out-in-early-access-from-the-makers-of-dead-cells/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-rogue-prince-of-persia-is-now-out-in-early-access-from-the-makers-of-dead-cells<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="272" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It hasn’t taken long for the <em>Dead Cells</em> developer, Evil Empire, to settle on an exciting new project. Its title? <em>Prince of Persia</em>! But not any regular old <em>Prince of Persia</em>; <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-is-real-and-coming-to-early-access-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This is <em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em></a>, and it’s pretty easy to tell what makes it special.</p> <p data-characters="558" data-current-count="558" data-injectable="true">Notably, Evil Empire and Ubisoft have launched the first <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2717880/The_Rogue_Prince_of_Persia/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Early Access build</a> of the <em>Rogue Prince of Persia</em>, and though it is still early to say whether it’s a slam dunk, it sure is a whole lot of fun. There are some really interesting tidbits about this game, mind: firstly, even though it is being published by Ubisoft, <em>Rogue Prince </em>does not necessitate a Ubisoft Connect login. Secondly, the game both is, and is not, reminiscent of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/dead-cells-is-about-to-get-its-final-major-content-update-after-many-many-years-of-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the classic <em>Dead Cells</em></a>, which results in a fresh and exciting gameplay loop, even this early in its development.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Evil Empire</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-evil-empire-s-rogue-prince-of-persia-is-off-to-a-good-start" data-injectable="false">Evil Empire’s Rogue Prince of Persia is off to a good start</h2> <p data-characters="302" data-current-count="602" data-injectable="true">With just under 200 reviews written at the time of writing, and a “Mostly Positive” review rating, <em>Rogue Prince of Persia</em> already enjoys some amount of acclaim. The game itself is a relatively straightforward acrobatic platformer that doesn’t even try to hide its <em>Dead Cells</em> pedigree.</p>
 <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="361" data-injectable="false">On top of delightfully rotoscoped animations and character models, albeit delivered in a slightly different style than what we saw with <em>Dead Cells</em>, <em>Rogue Prince</em>‘s core gameplay loop consists of basically the same elements. A few tweaks here and there, granted, but anyone who’s spent any amount of time with <em>Dead Cells</em> will feel right at home here. </p> <p data-characters="456" data-current-count="817" data-injectable="true">Once again, players need to collect resources dropped by enemies to research new gear and gadgets. The Prince does so by repeatedly attempting to wall-run his way through hordes of magic-infused Huns, with the familiar choice of levels coming up every so often. The current build of the game has two boss encounters in tow and about half a dozen unique levels, which all comes together into a lovely proof-of-concept for what’s to come in the future.</p>
 <p data-characters="458" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="true">“We plan to be in Early Access for around a year, probably a little bit longer,” says Evil Empire on the game’s Steam page. “We plan to add all the good stuff – more levels, weapons, features, enemies, bosses, story acts and meta progression. Along the way we want to find out if there’s anything we can add to the core gameplay too. In fact, our plan is to double the amount of content from Early Access launch to 1.0.”</p>
 <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">A solid plan, then. Given Evil Twin’s track record and what’s already on show with the <em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em>, I can say I’m very much looking forward to what comes next. And don’t forget: if you’re not a fan of Early Access, there’s that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other, equally delightful version of <em>Prince of Persia</em></a> that launched earlier this year.</p>

<p data-characters="276" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Are you thrilled about the possibility of a new <em>Doom</em> game? If you’ve clicked on this article, chances are good you’re pretty pumped. There have been <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/rumors-are-swirling-around-a-possible-new-doom-reveal/">rumors about a new reveal</a> for a bit now, and we’ll find out whether it was worth getting excited soon enough.</p> <p data-characters="484" data-current-count="484" data-injectable="true">According to an exclusive report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming</a>, not only is there a chance that id Software could unveil a new <em>Doom</em> entry at this year’s Xbox Games Showcase, the game’s final title is said to be finalized. At one point, it was going to be called “<em>Year Zero</em>,” but it seems as though it’s going with “<em>The Dark Ages</em>.” It’s also said to have been in development for the past four years, so pretty much as soon as <em>Eternal</em> was complete.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="EXCLUSIVE: DOOM: The Dark Ages to be Revealed at Xbox Games Showcase" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oLPkVRw3uMQ?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="617" data-injectable="true">The Xbox Games Showcase will be taking place on June 9, and will be a chance for Microsoft to discuss some exclusive games in its upcoming roster, though it’s difficult to know exactly what’s going to be on the schedule. The show will be immediately followed by a deep dive into <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>.</p>
 <h2 id="h-a-look-at-the-slayer-s-past" data-injectable="false">A look at the Slayer’s past?</h2> <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">While details about the new <em>Doom</em> are pretty scarce, the report and video above say there’s a chance we could be going back in time, perhaps to Medieval times. The title <em>The Dark Ages</em> does suggest it could take place in that time period, giving us a glimpse into the Doom Slayer’s life back in days of yore.</p> <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="575" data-injectable="true">Of course, all expectations must be tempered at this point. As solid as these rumors sound, we’re best off waiting until June 9 to see what’s going to be confirmed. We’re also hoping we’ll get to see more <em>Avowed</em> during the showcase.</p>
 <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">Playing my first <em>Doom</em> game as a young whippersnapper, I never thought the series would endure as much as it has. Although the team has changed over the decades, id Software’s legendary FPS is not just trying to keep its head above the water; it’s thriving in an increasingly competitive market. Here’s to more demon slaying with whatever’s on the horizon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-be-on-game-pass-day-1<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After accidentally spoiling their own announcement earlier this morning, Microsoft officially revealed that <strong><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></strong> will be available Day One on Xbox Game Pass, albeit with a caveat.</p>

<p>Questions about whether, or how, <em>Call of Duty</em> would be on Game Pass have been bouncing around since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-buys-activision-blizzard-bobby-kotick-staying-as-ceo" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Microsoft Buys Activision Blizzard, Bobby Kotick Staying As CEO">Microsoft acquired Activision Blizzard</a>. While Microsoft took action to assure regulators, and players, that the game wouldn't be exclusive to Xbox with deals with various platform holders, and services, there haven't been any type of promises about what would happen with <em>Call of Duty </em>in regards to Microsoft's signature Game Pass service. While it's easy to point to things like Microsoft saying they put all their games on Game Pass day 1, it's easy to see why there'd be doubt with <em>Call of Duty </em>being one of the biggest gaming imps, and that Microsoft has been busy tripping over its own past statements lately, like around the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Microsoft Shuts Down Redfall and Hi-Fi Rush Creators">Tango Gameworks closure</a>.</p>



<p>On Xbox Wire today, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/28/play-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-game-pass/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Play Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on Day One with Xbox Game Pass">Microsoft formally announced </a>that they were going to be releasing <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> on Game Pass on Day 1, although it lacked other details. Speculation has abounded about an Xbox Game Pass price hike or a special <em>Call of Duty</em> tier of sorts for Game Pass, but as of today none of that has been revealed. Instead, the reveal was kept short, and to the point, while tying in a new trailer that was released today. The full reveal is set to happen on June 9th, right after the main Xbox showcase.</p>

<p><em>Call of Duty Black Ops 6</em> is the 5th numbered entry in the <em>Black Ops</em> subline (<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops: </em><em>Cold War</em></a> is being counted as 5 it appears), and takes place during the Gulf War of the 1990s. A less talked about war nowadays, it lacks some of the controversy of other recent American wars like Vietnam or Iraq, while still providing a more contemporary setting and providing a major face people will know: Saddam Hussein. While these days best known for being targetted by the George W Bush administration for the nonexistent weapons of mass destruction, just over a decade earlier Bush's father, George H. W. Bush was part of a coalition of nations that fought against Hussein after he had invaded Kuwait.</p>

<p>This won't be the first time that the Gulf War has been depicted in video games either. There have been around 20 or so games that are set in, or have scenarios that take place in the Gulf War, with several of them even taking their name from the war-ending Operation Desert Storm. Developers from companies like Bungie (<em>Operation: Desert Storm</em>, their first commercial game), and Ubisoft (<em>Splinter Cell Conviction</em>) have produced games or levels that take place during the war, though most games that focused on it were released before the Iraq War of 2000s, which was much more controversial.</p>

            <p>After what has felt like forever for this Legend of Zelda-loving-Lego-nerd, the long-rumoured set based on The Great Deku Tree has been officially revealed by Nintendo.</p>
<p>The upcoming Lego set will be a two-in-one number, with the option to recreate Ocarina of Time's Great Deku Tree or Breath of the Wild's. The Breath of the Wild version comes with a buildable Hestu figure, as you can see in the header image above, and a little cooking pot inside the tree himself and a Korok at the top. Also, check out the Deku Tree's blossom brows!</p>
<p>When it is in its Ocarina of Time form, meanwhile, users will also be able to build Link's treehouse from Kokiri Forest, which has a little Navi perched on the balcony.</p>

<p>On the minifigure side of things, there are four of them included: Classic Link, Classic Young Link, Breath of the Wild Link and Breath of the Wild Princess Zelda. Zelda has her Shiekah slate, while Link has the Master Sword and shields. There is also an ocarina, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-zelda-set-to-feature-two-great-deku-tree-designs-rumours-suggest">as previously rumoured</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166053/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft is confirming today that <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, the next installment in the popular franchise, will be available day one on Xbox Game Pass. After a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166060/microsoft-just-accidentally-made-a-big-call-of-duty-announcement">premature notification</a> earlier today, an official <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/28/play-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-game-pass/">Xbox Wire blog post</a> has now revealed that <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 </em>will be available on Microsoft’s game subscription service later this year.</p><p>“We’re excited to confirm that Game Pass members will be able to jump into <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> on day one with Game Pass,” says Megan Spurr, senior community lead of Xbox Game Pass. In a separate trailer from Xbox, Microsoft confirms <em>Black Ops 6 </em>will be available on both Xbox Game Pass for consoles and PC Game Pass.</p><p>The confirmation of a Game Pass release for the next <em>Call of Duty</em> installment comes after questions about <em>Call of Duty</em>’s availability on Xbox Game Pass. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151814/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-strategy-changes-arkane-tango">I reported earlier this month</a>&nbsp;that Microsoft had been debating whether to put new releases of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>into Game Pass, with concerns from some at the company that the revenue generated from typical&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>&nbsp;sales would be undermined by Game Pass. Activision traditionally sells more than 20 million copies of <em>Call of Duty</em> on average, at around $70 each.</p><p>It’s still not clear whether Microsoft plans to raise the prices of its Game Pass Ultimate subscription, and the company hasn’t announced a release date for <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops</em> 6, so there are still many months to go until its eventual release on Game Pass. I understand Activision is currently targeting a late October release for <em>Black Ops 6</em>, which is set during the ’90s Gulf War.</p><p>Microsoft plans to provide further details about <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 </em>during a special stream after the main Xbox summer showcase on June 9th. The main Xbox showcase will feature a new <em>Gears of War</em> announcement, alongside the next <em>Doom</em> game. The showcase will also include a number of release dates for upcoming Xbox games like&nbsp;<em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em>,&nbsp;<em>Avowed</em>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</em></p><p><em><strong>Update, May 28th: </strong>Article updated to confirm both Xbox Game Pass console and PC Game Pass availability.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="fpiAKY">PlayStation Plus subscribers’ free Essential games for the month of June are <em>SpongeBob Squarepants: The Cosmic Shake</em>, <em>AEW Fight Forever</em>, and <em>Streets of Rage 4</em>, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/28/get-ready-days-of-play-celebration-kicks-off-on-may-29">Sony Interactive Entertainment announced Tuesday</a>.

<p id="W8lgzb"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/4/29/21240091/streets-of-rage-4-review-switch-pc-ps4-xbox-one"><em>Streets of Rage 4</em></a> is the must-play side-scrolling belt-action beat-’em-up from Sega and developers LizardCube, Guard Crush, and DotEmu. <em>Streets of Rage 4</em> revitalized the Genesis-era franchise with the return of fan-favorite characters, great music, and combo-focused gameplay. As Polygon editor in chief Chris Plante said in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/4/29/21240091/streets-of-rage-4-review-switch-pc-ps4-xbox-one">his review of the 2020 game</a>, “<em>Streets of Rage 4</em> is everything I could have wanted from a true Streets of Rage sequel. I’m satiated.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/2024/5/28/24159038/best-korean-dramas-netflix-watch-summer-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="J8mg7W"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/23964539/k-drama-history-american-korean-popularity-success-hallyu">Korean dramas</a> continue to be some of the most popular (and best!) pop culture in the world. And, now that Netflix is in the K-drama game, the streamer is investing lots of money in producing and distributing some of the most beloved East Asian dramas globally. The age of Peak TV means not only sorting through an immense amount of domestic, English-language TV options, but also a consistent flurry of foreign-language drama, including from Korea.</p>
<p id="SWRpAe">We’ve worked hard to find a variety of K-dramas to highlight below. While this means a diversity of genre — including a superhero family series, a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22692220/squid-game-review-netflix"><em>Squid Game</em></a>-esque dark comedy, and a teen revenge drama poised to follow in the Netflix tradition of <em>Élite</em> — it also means a diversity of release format. Some of the dramas listed below have already premiered but are releasing new episodes weekly, while others are yet to come but will release all of their episodes in one go. Whether you’re looking for a marathon watch or the weekly release experience of yesteryear, we have something for you…</p>
<hr id="51y14R">
<h2 id="Tn5mlE"><strong>The Atypical Family</strong></h2>
<div id="pJdNH6"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CotipI30Bx8?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="1bRZuF"><strong>Release date:</strong> May 4th-June 9th <br><strong>Episode count:</strong> 8<br><strong>Recommended for fans of: </strong><em>Moving, My Roommate is a Gumiho</em></p>
<p id="zvK2gL">Last year, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23860210/hulu-moving-season-1-review-mcu-about-review">Hulu K-drama <em>Moving</em></a> proved that some of the best superhero storytelling is happening outside of the United States. This year, Netflix is getting in on the action, offering up a story about a family of superpowered individuals who are struggling to stay superpowered in a modern world that triggers conditions like depression, insomnia, bulimia, and smartphone addiction. </p>
<p id="GpWFo0">Jang Ki-yong (<em>My Roommate is a Gumiho</em>) stars as single father Bok Gwi-ju, a time traveler. When Gwi-ju begins to experience depression after the loss of his wife, he loses his power to travel through time. Meanwhile, the rest of his family are also struggling to hold onto their superpowers. When the mysterious Do Da-hee (<em>The 8 Show</em>’s Chun Woo-hee) enters Gwi-ju’s life, things begin to change in unexpected ways. Note: <em>The Atypical Family </em>has rightly been called out for its fatphobic handling of one character’s journey. If this is a deal breaker for you, then steer clear!</p>
<p id="gWdJuH"><em>The Atypical Family</em> began airing on May 4th, but is still in the middle of its season, with two episodes dropped on the streamer every weekend. The final episode is set to be released on June 9th.</p>
<h2 id="l9XEUZ"><strong>The 8 Show</strong></h2>
<div id="S1PDSz"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zvowLTLYJN0?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="X3p18t"><strong>Release date: </strong>May 17th <br><strong>Episode count: </strong>8<br><strong>Recommended for fans of: </strong><em>Squid Game, Alice in the Borderland, </em>that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Game">one episode of <em>Doctor Who</em></a></p>
<p id="udVbH9">If you’ve caught the trailer or first episode of <em>The 8 Show</em>, you might think it is a complete rip-off of <em>Squid Game</em>. While the new Netflix K-drama has some direct visual echoes of the cultural phenomenon, such as the Escher-style stairs or the numbered uniforms, the series is actually adapted from an existing <a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/thriller/money-game/list?title_no=3254">webtoon story called <em>Money Game</em></a>. (But you better believe it was the unprecedented success of <em>Squid Game</em>, which remains Netflix’s most-watched show of all time, that got this adaptation greenlit.)</p>
<p id="g583V7">While there may be some similarities between<em> Squid Game</em> and <em>The 8 Show</em>, there are also some fundamental differences. For one, the cast of <em>The 8 Show </em>is much smaller, which makes the interpersonal dynamics much more concentrated. In the series, eight people are invited to appear on a reality variety TV show called <em>Money Game</em>. If the eight people can stand to live in an eight-story concrete fortress for 100 days, they get to split the winnings equally, which starts at 44.8 billion won (or around $33.6 million). To survive in the game, the group can decide to spend money on necessities such as food, water, and electricity—but it comes out of the winnings, and the cost is 1,000 times their normal price. </p>
<p id="i3UUx3">Another fundamental difference is in the respective tones of the shows. While <em>Squid Game</em> has its moments of comedy, for the most part it is played as a straight drama. From the looks of <em>The 8 Show</em>’s trailer, the series is much more of a black comedy, with the visual style playing up some of the absurdity of the situation in hyperbolic ways.</p>
<h2 id="8sXdsD"><strong>Hierarchy</strong></h2>
<div id="9aBXPu"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ntczSnSogQ8?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="9M8YBI"><strong>Release date: </strong>June 7th<br><strong>Episode count:</strong> 7<br><strong>Recommended for fans of:</strong> <em>Elite</em>, <em>Gossip Girl, SKY Castle, The Heirs, The Glory</em></p>
<p id="f7oaEG">In the grand tradition of <em>Elite</em> — and <em>Gossip Girl</em> before it — comes the next era of rich kid teen drama. <em>Hierarchy</em> is a revenge romance following a group of students at Jooshin High, a Korean private school for the 1%. The series stars Lee Chae-min (<em>Crash Course in Romance</em>) as Kang Ha, a mysterious transfer student who doesn’t seem to come from the same uber-privileged background as the rest of the student body... but who may have an agenda of his own. Roh Jeong-eui (<em>Badland Hunters</em>) also stars as Jung Jae-yi, the first daughter of a powerful chaebol. Directed by Bae Hyun-jin (also director for my beloved <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23649168/alchemy-of-souls-best-netflix-fantasy-tv-show-series"><em>Alchemy of Souls: Light and Shadow</em></a>) and written by Chu Hye-mi (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4LjT9nX9fo&amp;ab_channel=Cereal"><em>About Time</em></a>), <em>Hierarchy</em> has the makings to be one of the biggest K-drama hits of the summer.</p>

<p id="dIhohJ"><strong>Release date: </strong>TBA<br><strong>Episode count:</strong> 8<br><strong>Recommended for fans of: </strong><em>The Bequeathed, The World of the Married</em></p>
<p id="3SwYgM">Originally known as <em>Alone in the Woods</em>, <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/81654427"><em>The Frog</em></a> is a dark, psychological drama set in two time periods in the same rural area of South Korea. Kim Yoon-seok (<em>The Chaser, Another Child</em>) stars as Jeon Young-ha, a man who is running a motel in the year 2000. Yoon Kye-sang (K-pop boy band g.o.d., <em>Road Number One</em>) stars as Koo Sang-joon, a man who is running a pension in the same region in 2021. When both men are faced with the same scenario, two decades apart, they make different choices. <em>Sweet Home</em>’s Go Min-so will also star as Yoo Seong-ha.</p>
<p id="KZQmwe">The story will unfold over the course of eight episodes, and seems poised to play up the suspense. <em>The World of the Married</em> director Mo Wan II is behind the camera for this one. <em>The World of the Married</em> is one of the most successful cable K-dramas of all time, and also relies on effectively maintaining complex psychological tension across a series run. In other words, this is probably going to be scary in the best ways.</p>

<p id="U3YzNi"><strong>Release date:</strong> TBA<br><strong>Episode count:</strong> TBA<br><strong>Recommended for fans of:</strong> <em>Parasyte: The Grey, Hellbound</em></p>
<p id="tvH75k">When <em>Sweet Home</em>, an adaptation of the webtoon of the same name, was released in December 2020, it became the first K-drama to make it into the Netflix Top Ten. This led to back-to-back filming of Season 2 and 3, and a noticeable increase in budget for this horror about a monster apocalypse and the humans, monsters, and hybrids fighting to survive within it. </p>
<p id="qyd5lr">Song Kang stars as Cha Hyun-su, a teen orphan who has lost the will to live when the apocalypse breaks out. As he evolves into something new, he finds new purpose in protecting the found family he makes at Green Home Apartments.</p>
<p id="oTjltl">Season 2 dropped in December 2023 and was not quite as popular as the first, early pandemic season, but with the ambitious story set to conclude in Season 3, more Song Kang (who is currently away performing mandatory military service), and the return of fan favorite Lee Do-hyun to the action, this conclusion has the opportunity to pull viewers back in. Let’s hope this beloved K-drama sticks the landing! </p>

Given the lack of updates around Dragon Quest 12, many fans grew concerned it was affected by the reshuffle.</p><p>Dragon Quest 12 was announced as part of the series' 35th anniversary celebration and will be the first mainline entry since 2017's Dragon Quest 11: Echoes of an Elusive Age. No release window, platforms, or gameplay was shared, just the game's logo.</p><p>Also this week, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-draws-near-as-square-enix-confirms-platforms">Square Enix said Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake</a>, which will recreate the classic role-playing game in the graphical style of Square Enix's Octopath Traveller series, now "draws near" as it's confirmed to be a multiplatform title.</p><p>A post on <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/1794987069531476347" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a> teasing the game, which was announced in May 2021 but has gone practically unheard of since, confirmed it will come to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, Nintendo Switch, and PC via Steam and the Windows Store.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
