            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="ee271c23347b8"><a title="My Mario Marketing" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ee271c23347b8/my-mario-marketing.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yesterday, Nintendo announced that it would be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-is-bringing-the-my-mario-line-to-the-west-in-february">bringing its 'My Mario' collection to the West</a> next month. It launched a cute new marketing campaign showing happy parents and young children putting the products to the test, but the images quickly set AI alarm bells ringing for many on social media (thanks for the heads up, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/nintendo-my-mario-generative-ai/">The Gamer</a>).</p>
<p>You see, in a lot of the promotional images, commenters online thought that the fingers just don't add up. One model's thumb appears bent back to an impossible angle, while another hand holding up a toddler has been criticised for its finger length and placement.</p>
<p>Hands and fingers have been used as something of a Gen-AI litmus test in recent years, with the software's difficulties in accurately portraying their position (or quantity) becoming a telltale sign of whether an image is the real deal. Such an approach seems to have been applied to Nintendo's new campaign, with the big reveal on <a href="https://x.com/NintendoStoreUS/status/2009280600608268620">Twitter</a> being met with a tidal wave of replies accusing the company of resorting to "AI slop" in its marketing.</p>

<p>But things aren't as clean-cut this time around. While that thumb is undoubtedly looking a little funky, there's every chance that we're looking at nothing more than a post-shoot editing mix-up — and, to our eyes, the other hands look perfectly reasonable.</p>
<p>In fact, several users have come to Nintendo's <em>defence</em> following the AI accusations. "I know the hands may look weird but that's what hands do lol," one user wrote on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/eternazrael.bsky.social/post/3mbwkyxp3os2r">Bluesky</a>, "I [swear to god] we've gotten to the point where if you bend your hand in a weird way it's automatically ai".</p>

<p>We ran all four of the images used in the <a href="https://x.com/NintendoStoreUS" tabindex="-1">@NintendoStoreUS</a> reveal tweet through both the <a href="https://notegpt.io/ai-image-detector">NoteGBT</a> and <a href="https://decopy.ai/ai-image-detector/">Decopy</a> AI image detectors (which may use the same analysis software) with differing results. The much-discussed 'weird thumb' picture was said to have a 63.84% to 82% chance that it used some form of AI generation, while the other three came in at &gt;1%. Another detector, <a href="https://www.zerogpt.com/ai-image-detector">ZeroGBT</a>, concluded that the thumb picture had a 3% chance of being AI-generated, while the others had a 97% chance of being digitally edited. So big pinches of salt all round.</p>
<p>Of course, digital editing with Photoshop and the like is a completely standard practice for basically any marketing image these days. Almost every Nintendo promo will likely undergo <em>some kind of</em> post-shoot editing, and there's every chance that these wonky digits are just a byproduct of that.</p>
<p>We have reached out to Nintendo of America for a comment, and we will update this post as soon as we hear anything back.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-says-ai-generated-images-were-not-used-in-mario-kart-world">Nintendo has been accused of using AI-generated images</a> in its products. Back in May, a company spokesperson told Eurogamer that "AI-generated images were not used in the development of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>", after an online theory suspected the Switch 2 launch title of relying on AI placeholders for many of its billboards and signs.</p>
<p>Miyamoto has previously <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/nintendo-to-go-in-different-direction-to-current-ai-trends-says-miyamoto">stated</a> that Nintendo would "rather go in a different direction" than the rest of the industry when it comes to the use of AI in game development.</p>

			<p>Valve's reveal of its Steam Machine, Steam Frame, and Steam Controller last year <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/">was one of 2025's biggest announcements</a>, and while players are excited about the potential of the new GabeCube, one question has hovered above the new hardware like a dark cloud (<a href="https://wccftech.com/no-one-can-escape-memory-shortages-says-samsungs-co-ceo/">that grows even darker with memory shortage complications</a>): <strong>how much will the Steam Machine cost?</strong></p>



<p>Well, we don't yet have official pricing, but a leak from a Czech retailer may have just provided our first indication as to what the latest gaming box will cost. Shared to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Gamingnewsandleaks/comments/1q88b1u/grain_of_salt_steam_machine_price_leaked_1000_for/">Reddit's GamingLeaksandRumors page by user chusskaptaan</a>, a third-party Czech retailer known as <a href="https://www.smarty.cz/Valve-Steam-Machine-512GB-4p249960">Smarty.cz has a live listing for the Steam Machine</a>, featuring two different models.</p>



<p>The first is a <strong>512GB</strong> model, which, according to the website's source code, seems to cost <strong>19,826 CZK</strong>, or approximately <strong>$950 USD</strong>. The other model is a <strong>2TB</strong> version, and it seems to be listed at <strong></strong><strong>22,305 CZK</strong>, or <strong>$1,070 USD.</strong></p>



<p>It should be noted that these prices are estimates based on a conversion from Czech Koruna, and as the post itself notes, third-party retailers could have their own markups, which means the actual retail price of the machine from Valve could very well be lower.</p>



<p>That said, while Valve hasn't made any official announcements about the price, it's been made <a href="https://wccftech.com/talking-with-asus-ahead-of-ces-2026-everybodys-going-to-have-to-increase-prices-interview/">clear from multiple sides of the tech industry that prices on hardware will increase</a> due to the current memory crisis, and when Valve was asked <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-isnt-going-to-be-subsidized-valve-confirms-prepare-for-high-price/">if the company would be subsidizing the price of its new box</a>, the answer was a flat no.</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>No, it's more in line with what you might expect from the current PC market</em>," began software engineer at Valve, Pierre-Loup Griffais. "<em></em><em>Obviously, our goal is for it to be a good deal at that level of performance. And then you have features that are actually really hard to build if you are making your own gaming PC from parts. Things like the small form factor, the noise level that we achieved, or lack thereof, is really impressive and we are excited that people are going to find out how quiet this thing is."</em></p>



<p>So while we've seen pricing estimates from <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-steam-machine-console-price-not-much-higher/">creators like LinusTechTips who've tried to guess at what the cost of the new box would be</a> and found that it might not be too expensive, the reality might not be as kind. Still, for what the Steam Machine could be capable of, paying a little more than $1k for it is arguably still a good deal, when you consider the freedom of choice you get with a Steam Machine versus a traditional console or the cost of building your own PC.</p>



<p>As for when we could hear official words from Valve on the price, the<a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-is-a-steam-machine-launch-game-valve-is-targeting-spring-2026/"> latest reports point to a <strong>Spring 2026</strong> release</a>, and if that's true, then we'll know sooner than later what the actual price will be. </p>

<p>Vincke says Larian won't use what he calls "creative assets" without "being 100% sure about the origins of the training data and the consent of those who created the data". He says if generative AI is used to create assets, it will be "trained on data [Larian owns]".</p><p>There is, however, a question mark (as <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/twilightvulpine.bsky.social/post/3mbypouyzb22c" target="_blank" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">pointed out by one Bluesky user</a>) around whether such a thing is possible; it's likely that any gen AI model used by Larian will be based on pre-existing models, which have often been trained on data of questionable origin.</p><p>The generative AI debate continues to rage in the gaming sphere. Some companies, like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-partners-with-generative-ai-company-to-enable-dynamically-generated-stories-quests" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="19d43f27-7ba5-4ecd-92ba-6d04beac862a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Xbox</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-hopes-to-use-generative-ai-to-drive-more-monetization-and-make-development-30-more" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="746600ea-ef36-4d95-b141-ab37281d9e3e" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">EA</a>, have wholeheartedly embraced it, while others, including the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hooded-horse-no-gen-ai-contracts" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4bf049e2-a4f8-41a0-b834-8030bfbcc977" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Manor Lords </em>publisher Hooded Horse</a>, have denounced the tech in no uncertain terms.</p><p>Generative AI isn't going anywhere anytime soon, though, it seems; our very own Don's research has revealed that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/almost-20-of-top-new-sellers-on-steam-in-2025-used-generative-ai" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="16d0c419-db96-434f-99c7-9e50c881e987" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">almost 20% of Steam's top sellers in 2025</a> used generative AI in some way, shape, or form.</p><figure role="group">

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Computer components are getting pretty pricey. So if you’re looking to buy any or a whole computer, you’re going to have to be pretty selective. And when you spot a deal, it’s a good idea to grab it while you can. The AMD Ryzen 7 7700X 8-Core, 16-Thread Unlocked Desktop Processor was designed specifically for people who want a fast and responsive computer. If that’s you, you can snag a serious deal on it right now, because we’ve found one you won’t want to miss out on.</p>
<p>You can currently purchase the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6712/">AMD Ryzen 7 7700X 8-Core, 16-Thread Unlocked Desktop Processor on Amazon.com for $252 (down from $399) which represents a savings of $147 and 37% off of the original retail price.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6712/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A powerful processor with a significant discount</h2>
<p>The processor features eight performance cores and sixteen threads so that it can process high refresh rate gaming, streaming, and content creation without your entire computer slowing down. If you’re building a new PC or updating your existing computer with a new processor, then the Ryzen 7 7700X would be a solid option to ensure that your computer stays as fast as possible as it can while components continue to evolve and improve over the years.</p>
<p>You can enter high-end games, have voice chat and/or a browser active, and even begin recording/streaming your gameplay without losing FPS. These additional threads prove to be valuable when your system is operating the logic of a game, as well as background applications and capture software all at one time. This processor provides you with the room needed to perform these tasks without constantly adjusting settings.</p>



<p>In addition to gaming, if you use various creative applications, then the number of cores and speeds found within the Ryzen 7 7700X will greatly benefit those applications. For example, tasks such as video editing, converting video files, batch photo processing, and working in 3D applications, all function much quicker than processors with fewer cores. Your exports will complete faster, your timeline will scrub faster, and you will not be forced to stare at the “progress bar” when you would rather be creating your next project. This type of upgrade will pay for itself daily if you spend time in creative applications.</p>
<p>You can couple this processor with current graphics cards, high-speed storage, and multiple monitors without your CPU becoming the bottleneck before you know it. This processor is an excellent option for a system that you intend to keep and possibly expand upon over the course of several years.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6712/">Overall, the AMD Ryzen 7 7700X 8-Core, 16-Thread Unlocked Desktop Processor is an easy recommendation if you want a fast, versatile PC</a>. At this lowest price, you really can’t go wrong with grabbing this deal while it’s still available. Be sure you don’t miss it, and get ready for enjoying all your favorite games as the year kicks off.</p>

<p><strong>The Event Pass is not the only way to obtain Fallout cosmetics in Black Ops 7, and a Lucy MacLean Operator Skin will be added at a later date.</strong></p>



<p>However, Lucy MacLean will require an additional purchase, as the skin is being introduced in a shop bundle, though the exact price and release date were not revealed in the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/blog/2026/01/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-warzone-season-01-reloaded#Store" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty blog</a>.</p>



<p>Purchasing the Bundle provides two Operator Skins for Lucy MacLean, including the Vault Lucy look, along with three Weapon Blueprints, a HUD Theme, a Companion Finishing Move, the Not-So-Pippy Gun Screen, an animated calling card, and an animated emblem.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Ubisoft and Massive Entertainment seem to be feeling pretty good about the development of Tom Clancy's The Division 3. Julian Gerighty, who oversees the franchise as executive producer, says the game is "shaping up to be a monster."</p><p dir="ltr">In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE_C1ueUnss">interview at the New Game+ Showcase</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-division-3-will-have-as-big-an-impact-as-the-division-1-says-producer/" rel="nofollow ">VGC</a>), Gerighty opened up just a bit about the next major installment in the online action-RPG series. "The Division 3 is in production, right? This is not a secret; it's been announced," Gerighty said. "It’s shaping up to be a monster."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE_C1ueUnss" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GE_C1ueUnss" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">In 2023, Ubisoft officially <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-3-is-officially-in-the-works-announced-with-little-fanfare/1100-6517899/">announced that The Division 3 was in development</a>, so of course Gerighty is correct that it's not a confidential matter at this point. "Within these walls at Massive, we are working extremely hard on something that I think will have as big an impact as Division 1 was," Gerighty added.</p><p dir="ltr">A few months ago, Massive Entertainment <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-boss-hasnt-left-ubisoft-and-more-updates-are-coming-soon/1100-6535549/">dispelled rumors that Gerighty had left Ubisoft altogether</a>. Not only is Gerighty working on The Division 3, but he's also helping with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-2-survivors-announced-ubisoft-says-its-your-baby/1100-6534215/">The Division 2: Survivors and The Division: Resurgence for mobile platforms</a>. This year marks the 10th anniversary of The Division franchise, too.</p><p dir="ltr">There is no release window for The Division 3 at this time. It wasn't the only big-name game discussed at the New Game+ Showcase, either, as Microsoft and developer Obsidian Entertainment revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-exclusive-rpg-avowed-is-coming-to-ps5-with-new-features/1100-6537287/">Avowed will arrive on PS5 on February 17</a> at the event.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developer Larian has changed its stance on generative AI following backlash faced at the end of last year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/">In a Reddit Ask Me Anything</a> hosted by the studio this afternoon, founder Swen Vincke said, "to ensure there is no room for doubt, we've decided to refrain from using gen-AI tools during concept art development". "That way there can be no discussion about the origin of the art."</p>
<p>It was the use of gen-AI in relation to concept art that people had been especially concerned about. Vincke, in an interview in December, which coincided with the studio's Divinity game reveal, seemed to suggest Larian was using gen-AI to develop concept art. Controversy erupted, prompting Vincke to clarify that information had been "lost in translation", and that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lost-in-translation-larian-boss-swen-vincke-generative-ai-backlash-divinity-ama">the studio was only using gen-AI to explore references for concept art</a>, not generate the images themselves.</p>
<p>Evidently, in the few weeks since, a decision has been made to remove all sources of ambiguity entirely. As if to reinforce this, Vincke's Reddit post led with: "there is not going to be any gen-AI art in Divinity". But the ambiguity hasn't been entirely dispersed.</p><p>Vincke said Larian is still exploring gen-AI use in other applications at the studio. "We continuously try to improve the speed with which we can try things out," he wrote. "The more iterations we can do, the better in general the gameplay is. We think gen-AI can help with this and so we're trying things out across departments. Our hope is that it can aid us to refine ideas faster, leading to a more focused development cycle, less waste, and ultimately, a higher-quality game.</p>
<p>"The important bit to note," he added, "is that we will not generate 'creative assets' that end up in a game without being 100 percent sure about the origins of the training data and the consent of those who created the data. If we use a gen-AI model to create in-game assets, then it'll be trained on data we own."</p>
<p>Larian lead writer Adam Smith joined the thread to clarify that the 'no gen-AI' approach to art would also be true for writing in Divinity. "The stance applies to writing as well," he wrote. "We don't have any text generation touching our dialogues, journal entries or other writing in Divinity."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/divinity-will-be-a-turn-based-rpg-and-see-larian-unleashed-declares-ceo-swen-vincke-replacing-the-dd-system-with-one-made-for-a-video-game">Divinity was announced at The Game Awards 2025</a> with a dark and gory cinematic trailer showing a festival - centred around burning someone at the stake - going horribly, irrevocably wrong. It shares the same series name as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/divinity-original-sin">Divinity: Original Sin</a> 1 and 2, of course, but it's a completely new, detached game, and Larian is cooking up a new turn-based RPG system for it.</p>

            <guid>1401673</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> version of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Rogue Trader</a> is not the best version of the game. We might as well make that the starting point for a review that puts me in a very difficult position. How do you rate a game that’s as good as Rogue Trader, but which runs here, somewhat inexplicably, like a bag of spanners? You could just skip right down to the bottom of the page, but here’s the thing, Rogue Trader on Nintendo Switch 2 defies whatever score I finally settle on, because even when it’s running badly, it’s one of the best tactical RPG experiences you’ll find anywhere.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Rogue Trader Nintendo Switch 2 Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OWBf_Nk9TfE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Load times are not good. That starts with the tone-setting creep of a loading bar that laughably shoots to 41% before taking a loooonnnng rest, searching around for the energy to make it to the end. Any movement from major area to the next brings about another lengthy wait, but the central sections themselves don’t incur any loading at all, so there is that. Travelling in your Voidship across the map also causes various stops and starts as different narrative moments are played out, a fresh load cycle happening every time despite those moments taking place in the same bridge section, and it serves to sap a lot of the game’s momentum.</p>


<p>You’ll be slowed down further when the game autosaves, pausing the action for at least ten seconds while it sorts itself out, and if you run quickly back and forth through a new area, the game will hang as it loads the required assets in. It’s then absolutely fine once it’s finished doing so, so it’s almost worth having a run around for a few moments to settle things down. All of this doesn’t sound very good, and… it’s not, requiring players to have rather more patience than most games should given that we now have SSD speeds for storage on Switch 2.</p>


<p>However, Rogue Trader is the kind of game to attract the patient. This is a role-playing game in the purest sense. From the first moments spent creating your character, where you’re choosing their background and backstory as well as selecting their visual design, you’re then drawn ever deeper into the world of Warhammer 40,000 thanks to some of the best writing and storytelling you’ll find in gaming.</p>
<p>If you’ve been a fan of the Warhammer 40K universe, and perhaps read some of the many novelisations, Rogue Trader feels utterly authentic, perfectly capturing the language, lore and feel of Games Workshop’s sci-fi series. It’s intensely literary, with a great deal of excellent writing, and the size of the text has thankfully been enlarged for the Switch 2 edition, so it’s still enjoyable whether you’re playing in docked or handheld mode. There should definitely be a toggle or a slider for this, mind you, but I can live with it as it is.</p>
<p>That writing is enhanced by the excellent voice acting that’s prevalent across the entirety of the cast. Each character feels unique and fully formed, and as your crew expands, you’ll find yourself coming to know each of them in exceptional detail. It’s at a level that you’ll consistently marvel at, and despite the many performance issues in this version of the game, you can definitely look past them thanks to the quality of the actual game itself.</p>

<p>That will depend on how sensitive you are to frame rate issues, though. While things have improved following the first major patch, Rogue Trader on Switch 2 still chugs along when you’re moving around each area, and it’s incredibly inconsistent. Frankly, it looks and feels pretty horrible, and that’s with an obviously reduced resolution across the board as well, which makes the character models and level design look considerably uglier than you’ll find on other platforms.</p>
<p>You might be disappointed to find that following the most recent patch, they’ve also broken the menus. You can access the main options, but none of the graphical or visual options currently work, which feels as though it’s a deliberate choice while they try to improve things. There were previously two different anti-aliasing options, as well as a film grain toggle, but right now, none of it works. I do expect Owlcat to continue working on this, but in its current form, Rogue Trader on Switch 2 looks and feels more like it’s running on the original Switch.</p>

<p>The shame of all this is that Switch 2 owners are going to experience the game in a way that they may find utterly off-putting. They will check out from one of the best sci-fi RPGs of recent years, and that is tantamount to being a crime. The storytelling, the character building and the tactical combat are some of the best in the genre, but right now, this version of the game is a mess. It is broadly playable – I’m still persevering as the game has got its hooks back in me – but currently, if you can play Rogue Trader anywhere else, you should.</p>

			<p>The emulator just got even more simplified, which will make it convenient to run games directly from the ISO files. </p>



<h2 id="h-iso-based-disc-loading-comes-to-rpcs3-emulator-but-only-decrypted-isos-are-supported">ISO-Based Disc Loading Comes to RPCS3 Emulator, But Only Decrypted ISOs Are Supported</h2>



<p>The popular PlayStation 3 emulator, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rpcs3-removes-amd-rx-400-500-and-nvidia-gtx-900-1000-series-from-recommended-gpu-requirements/">RPCS3</a>, just got a big update. Usually, one would need to extract the contents of the game ISO files to allow RPCS3 to run the game, but the new update just eliminated this step. Contributor <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Functionable </em>submitted the code, which removes a long-standing inconvenience for users who had to extract the disc images into folders to run the game. </p>



<p>This might look small on paper, but it is pretty meaningful and has several benefits. While the existing method of extracting the ISO files is reliable, it requires nearly double the storage, assuming the user doesn't delete the original ISO file. The new update allows loading the disc games directly from the ISO file and no longer needs manual extraction. So, not just one step less, but also no additional storage required.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>RPCS3 now supports loading disc games from ISO files, thanks to code submitted by Functionable! Note that only decrypted ISO loading is supported for now, encrypted ISO loading is not yet supported. Loading disc games from folders continues to be supported without any changes.</p>



<p>- RPCS3</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Keep in mind that the developers have announced that this will only apply to <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">"decrypted" </strong>ISOs, and any encrypted ISO images that are directly dumped from retail PS3 discs won't run. PlayStation 3 already possesses the hardware and firmware-based encryption pipeline to decrypt discs, but RPCS3 does not. Also, the older method of extracting the ISO will still work like before, and those who have already maintained an organized folder-based library shouldn't worry. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-goes-all-in-on-odyssey-gaming-monitors-32-g50d-series-hits-an-all-time-low-at-42-off-2000658292</link>
            <guid>1401655</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A monitor can make or break your gaming experience. It’s where your favorite characters come to life, and if your screen is lagging or just failing to deliver the visuals your games deserve, it’s time to look for a better option.</p>
<p>Thankfully, this upgrade doesn’t have to blow your budget today. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6710/">You can currently grab the 32-inch Samsung Odyssey G50D gaming monitor for $250 at Amazon, after the retailer took a whopping 42% off its usual (and not-so-friendly) $430 price.</a> This is the lowest we have seen this display drop to, ever. Just note that offers this good tend to wrap up fast. It’s best to place your orders before it’s too late!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6710/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Smooth Gameplay</h2>
<p>The screen features QHD resolution that packs in roughly 1.7 times the pixel density of Full HD for an exceptional picture quality. The IPS panel keeps the visuals bright and vibrant, while the wide 178-degree viewing angle ensures clarity from any viewpoint. It’s especially helpful when you’re playing with friends, since not everyone needs to sit directly in front of the screen to see what’s happening. Additionally, VESA DisplayHDR 400 focuses on delivering better contrast with deeper blacks and prominent whites. You will be able to spot bad guys hiding in the shadows, plus explore cool in-game environments more clearly in daylight scenes. This level of depth also helps titles feel closer to reality for an immersive experience that makes you feel a part of the game.</p>
<p>The visuals are nicely paired with an impressive 180Hz refresh rate that eliminates lag for smoother action. A 1ms response time also reduces motion blur, helping you jump into action without waiting.</p>



<p>The gaming monitor is G-Sync compatible, which means it is designed to work well with NVIDIA GPUs by matching its refresh rate to the frame output of the GPU. Even better, it supports AMD FreeSync to keep complex scenes stable. What does this mean for you? Low input lag and smoother gameplay that gives you a competitive edge.</p>
<p>Those planning to game for long hours will appreciate the Eye Saver Mode, which minimizes blue light to keep your eyes comfortable throughout your sessions. As for the build, the monitor flaunts an ergonomic stand that comfortably swivels, tilts, and adjusts to help you find the right viewing position. You can even rotate it vertically when you need to read or take quick video calls!</p>
<p>To wrap it up, if you’ve been looking to upgrade your current monitor to enjoy better visuals and smoother gameplay, now is the time to make the move. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6710/">This 32-inch Samsung gaming monitor offers all that and more, and the current 42% discount makes the display far more affordable.</a> If the 32-inch size feels like too much, there’s a 27-inch version of the same model available for $230, down from $350.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a> is an open-world action-adventure game set on the continent of Pywel. But how big is the open world, exactly? It’s “absolutely massive,” its developer has said, bigger even than that of Bethesda’s Skyrim and Rockstar’s Red Dead Redemption 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking on <a href="https://youtu.be/aEX6hjTSlOk?si=Ei_PQfEUiBEH5A6F" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Gaming Interviews YouTube channel</a>, Pear Abyss’ Will Powers said that describing the size of Crimson Desert’s world in terms of numbers doesn’t do it justice, because doing so fails to capture the scope and scale of the game. But he did go as far as to compare it to two of the biggest open world games around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't think numbers really do it justice because, how big is that in terms of scope and scale?” he said. “But what we can say is that the world's at least twice as big as the open world, the playable area, of Skyrim. It's larger than the map of Red Dead Redemption 2."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Powers went on to insist that the size of Crimson Desert’s open world won’t determine its quality. Rather, what you actually do in it is the key factor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The continent of Pywel is absolutely massive, but size doesn't really matter if there's nothing to do,” he said. “Open-world games are about doing things, having activities, having distractions. So we wanted to create a world that's not only massive, but is also incredibly interactive."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unlike Skyrim and Red Dead Redemption 2, in Crimson Desert you can fly around on a dragon, so despite the size of its world, you’ll be able to get about quickly. And don’t expect RPG elements in terms of decision-making and choice and consequence as it relates to your character, either. The sheer amount of things to do in the world will facilitate the role-playing part of Crimson Desert, which players will form through “head canon.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Crimson Desert IGN First - Combat and Mounts Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“You choose the type of character you want to play as in terms of your progression within the systems in the game,” Powers explained. “And then through head canon you’re having this very different experience than other players because of the scope and scale of the game. You’ll be distracted by something, you’ll go on this quest line, you’ll have an experience that’ll be radically different than someone else, even though they’re playing the same game and the same canonical storyline that you both are going through.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, the part of Crimson Desert shown off to the media in previews is just "a tiny corner of the map," Powers added. Crimson Desert is due out March 19, 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/as-biowares-failed-live-service-anthem-gets-ready-to-die-players-rush-to-unlock-platinums-and-say-their-goodbyes-while-others-work-on-custom-servers</link>
            <guid>1401643</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are saying farewell to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/anthem">Anthem</a>, BioWare's failed live-service blockbuster, as its servers are switched off and the game disappears forever — officially, at least. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anthem publisher EA announced last year that the jetpack-fuelled shooter had just months to live, and cautioned that the server shutdown would render the game completely unplayable, with its world, characters and lore no longer available once the plug was pulled. Now, as this day has neared, new and returning players have loaded up the game for one last flight, and to push for the game's platinum trophy while they still can. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others, meanwhile, have begun a small push to keep Anthem alive via custom private servers — though the effort has been hampered somewhat by the game's lack of reach.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I missed the server closure announcement last year, and just learned about it a couple days ago," wrote one belated fan, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1q7zzeq/just_started_playing_yesterday_and_im_having_fun/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CyberpwnPiper</a>. "I had never played it so I decided to take the game for a spin before it's too late, and the game is quite good. I'm just playing casually and I'm still a noob after about 4 hours in, but there's a solid foundation here. There are good bones. The visuals are fantastic, the combat and action are fun, and the javelin flight is phenomenal (and unique)."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon release, after a lengthy and troubled development, BioWare received praise for Anthem's Javelin mechsuit combat and particularly its flight mechanic, which let you zoom around the game's open world like Iron Man alongside a team of friends. But players and critics alike were less sold on Anthem's threadbare attempt at storytelling, especially when compared to the studio's beloved Dragon Age and Mass Effect games. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, Anthem never convinced players of BioWare's decision to pivot towards an online-only live-service, in an apparent attempt to recapture the crowd that had flocked to Bungie's Destiny. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, players are continuing to find reasons to enjoy a dip into Anthem's world, even if it is just to satisfy their curiosity before the game goes for good. "I truly wish I played it when it was released," wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1q7hm6q/i_wish_i_played_it_sooner/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BRB1993</a>. "I knew the end was coming and I wanted to get the chance to say, 'I was there'. I can honestly say that it scratched that same itch that Destiny does. The gunplay, the different Javelins (Colossus FTW!), the differing choice of abilities, the flying, the story (still can't believe Owen did what he did!), the differing style of enemies, there's too much to list!" Added CyberpwnPiper: "I wish I had started playing sooner to at least finish most of the story quests and experience different Javelin suits."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some returning players have meanwhile set themselves the challenge of unlocking Anthem's full list of achievements/trophies, which will become unobtainable forever when the game's servers go offline. It has been a race against time — though many have completed the feat over the past week as EA's clock runs down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's a bittersweet feeling getting this platinum," <u>said</u> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1q7dsk7/its_a_bittersweet_feeling_getting_this_platinum/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AbsolutelyNotAClone</a>. "I didn't think I'd push away all other games and throw another work week's worth of hours into it. But damn, I missed this game, and will miss it even more. I feel ashamed, I feel sad, but I feel so much better that I pushed for this platinum." Fellow fan <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1q7ocvf/in_the_last_4_days_wanted_to_finish_it/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rymus</a>, meanwhile, said they'd just hit Anthem's full Gamerscore on Xbox. "From the VIP weekend to the end this game will always be one of my faves despite the flaws," they wrote. "Learning the game was shutting down I wanted to give it the honor it deserved. My ranger with the VIP decal [has] been my main from the beginning."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I wasn’t sure if I’d make it," wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1q74jmo/platinum_achieved/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seeby4</a>, who also unlocked Anthem's platinum trophy. "Sooo many collectibles. I was getting burned out there following a YouTube guide but I locked in over the last four days and got it done! I didn’t have nearly as many hours as I know a lot of others did, but man, I’m gonna miss this game so much."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I finally got it done on time!" wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1q4qsi6/praying_anthem_not_to_get_shutdown/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KingExile96</a>. "I wish they wouldn't shut down. I wish they would just sell or give the game to another company, I want it to get another chance! It's got its potential. It was stressful getting the trophies but it was so fun at the same, roaming around, fighting bosses doing elements combo, man... I'm gonna miss this game so much. Anthem will be in my heart 🫶🤘"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there's little chance Anthem will ever be officially revived or handed off to another developer, some fans still hope the game will become playable once again via custom PC servers. Several Discord groups have been set up to explore the possibility of making Anthem playable in future, the largest of which is The Fort's Forge — a community that has been asking players to capture records of the game's communications with EA servers, so these can then be backwards engineered. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This process has been slow, with just a handful of players helping out last year, but progress has now reached a point where a good amount of data has been obtained. Still, there's no suggestion the game will be revived at any point in the near future, and it remains to be seen whether EA itself steps in to block the project's progress. IGN has contacted the team behind the effort for more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But while a handful of fans work on one potential future for the game, many others are now simply taking the chance to say goodbye. Dozens have recorded screenshots of their characters via one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1q41wbm/can_we_have_a_thread_where_we_all_share_our/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reddit</u></a> thread for posterity, while others are simply reminiscing and sharing their thanks to BioWare and to their fellow players who served as the game's Freelancers. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I enjoyed it till the end and I have a lot of good memories," wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1q5j2ee/one_last_flight_around_bastion/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RobRagiel</a>, who posted a video of their final flight around Anthem's world. "It was an honor, Freelancers. For the Legion of Dawn!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I had played the game since launch and I loved it," concluded <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1q62at6/my_fashion_to_the_grave/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Remarkable-Set-3340</a>. "I wish this game had more time. See ya’ll in the sky’s till the sun sets one last time."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

		<p>If you like the future Western aesthetic then Paradark Studios’ ExeKiller is one to keep an eye on. Described as a retro future Western, ExeKiller is set in a dystopian future where a catastrophic event has turned Earth into a scorched desert planet. But an apocalyptic event won’t get in the way of the darker side of human nature, meaning a bounty hunter is needed to find some criminals.</p>
<p><iframe title="ExeKiller - Gameplay Overview" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dEeUzd4nAmQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the new gameplay overview, Paradark Studios shows different aspects of the world which you inhabit as Denzel Fenix, aka the bounty hunter known as ExeKiller. He works for the Helion company and as the story progresses revelations about the world and himself make Denzel a target for different factions. That means players have to be on the lookout for danger everywhere.</p>
<p>ExeKiller is set in a semi open world with one of the central locations being The Tower. Here Denzel can upgrade and purchase gear, gather information, and pick up some bounties to hunt. It is a generally safe area, a stark difference to the world outside. Denzel travels across the world in a car that has been designed to withstand things like severe weather and radiation, but you cannot avoid such dangers all of the time. Out of the car, Denzel has to be aware of both enemies and the environment which could turn to make things difficult. Players have full autonomy on how missions are resolved with no set linear paths. You can choose to go in all guns blazing, sneak around, talk your way through situations, or a mixture of all of these approaches. Whatever approach is chosen will impact how NPCs and factions react to Denzel, and the game’s ending. There is no XP to earn in the game with Denzel’s skills reliant on player skill and the mods and augments that are installed in Denzel.</p>

<p>A release date for ExeKiller has yet to be confirmed and so far it has only been confirmed for PC.</p>

            <guid>1401619</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>When <strong>Larian Studios</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-announces-divinity-the-game-awards-2025/">announced <strong>Divinity</strong></a> at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards 2025</a>, it likely did not think what would follow would be swarms of backlash targeted at the studio and its chief executive officer, <strong>Swen Vincke</strong>. Not because it had announced a new Divinity game, but because Vincke had made it clear that Larian had <a href="https://wccftech.com/divinity-is-a-turn-based-rpg-will-be-way-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-says-larian/">been experimenting with using GenAI tools in its development process</a>.</p>



<p>Those comments came with considerable backlash, <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-responds-backlash-over-genai-use-divinity-baldurs-gate-3/">to which Vincke responded fairly bluntly</a> before trying a more measured statement, but that did not stop players and other game developers in the industry who are entirely against the use of GenAI tools from hurling more vitriol towards Larian Studios. Game writers and some former Larian developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-writers-call-out-larian-studios-for-poor-hiring-practices-amidst-genai-backlash/">even took the opportunity to pile on Larian more with the airing of grievances</a> around the studio's poor hiring practices and how it introduced GenAI in the first place.</p>



<p>Other members of the industry, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-said-they-were-doing-something-absolutely-everyone-is-doing-ai-hysteria/">Warhorse Studios founder and creative director Daniel Vávra stood up to defend Larian</a>, but it seemed that Larian's critics would not be satisfied with anything short of Vincke entirely denouncing the use of GenAI tools and admitting he and the team were wrong to even try using them. To cap off his comments on the topic in 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-says-a-lot-has-become-lost-in-translation-over-genai-backlash/">Vincke said "<em>a lot has been lost in translation</em>"</a> on the topic, and promised that he and the team would do a Reddit AMA to let players ask whatever questions they want to provide a clear and final word on the topic.</p>



<p>Well, that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/">Reddit AMA has been happening today</a>, and it should be no surprise that t<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nyl9tdz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">he first question was all about GenAI tools</a> and their role in Divinity's development, and within Larian Studios overall.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Vincke was the one to answer it, and while he did not provide the answer that would satisfy the biggest GenAI critics, he did clear up one element of the studio's generative AI use.</p>



<p>"<em>So first off - there is not going to be any GenAI art in Divinity</em>," Vincke began. "<em>I know there’s been a lot of discussion about us using AI tools as part of concept art exploration. We already said this doesn’t mean the actual concept art is generated by AI but we understand it created confusion.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>So, to ensure there is no room for doubt, we’ve decided to refrain from using genAI tools during concept art development.</em> <em>That way there can be no discussion about the origin of the art.</em>"</p>



<p>But Vincke didn't stop there. While the studio will "<em>refrain from using genAI</em>" for concept art, other areas are still on the table, as a means of trying to speed up development where possible.</p>



<p>"<em>Having said that, we continuously try to improve the speed with which we can try things out. The more iterations we can do, the better in general the gameplay is.</em> <em>We think GenAI can help with this and so we’re trying things out across departments. Our hope is that it can aid us to refine ideas faster, leading to a more focused development cycle, less waste, and ultimately, a higher-quality game.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>The important bit to note is that we will not generate “creative assets” that end up in a game without being 100% sure about the origins of the training data and the consent of those who created the data. If we use a GenAI model to create in-game assets, then it’ll be trained on data we own</em>."</p>



<p>In a follow-up question, Larian Studios' writing director <strong>Adam Smith</strong> confirmed that the approach to GenAI tools in concept art applies to writing as well, even when it comes to just using generative text as a placeholder. "<em>The stance applies to writing as well. We don't have any text generation touching our dialogues, journal entries or other writing in Divinity</em>," Smith wrote.</p>



<p>"<em>To answer your second question, 'how does generated placeholder text benefit development over simple stub text'"- it doesn't. We had a limited group experimenting with tools to generate text, but the results hit a 3/10 at best and those tools are for research purposes, not for use in Divinity. Even my worst first drafts - and there are a LOT of them - are at least a 4/10 (although Swen might disagree), and the amount of iteration required to get even individual lines to the quality we want is enormous. From the initial stub to the line we record and ship, there are a great many eyes and hands involved in getting a dialogue right.</em>"</p>



<p>So it's not the answer that the studio's biggest critics would like, but it's clear that the needle has moved on Larian Studios' use of GenAI. For now, the use of generative AI tools in game development will continue to be a controversial topic, whichever side of the aisle you're on.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>This is proving to be one of the worst weeks of my life, for various reasons (no, not because Jason Schreier is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-may-not-yet-be-content-complete-and-another-release-delay-is-possible-claims-jason-schreier">mad at me</a>). In my time of need, I open the magic portal of escapism and find <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic-3">Pathologic 3</a> looking back at me like a poison toad.</p><!--more-->
<p>Hello, Pathologic 3! You are that game about saving a town of butchers from the grandfather of all plagues. You are the Stoppardian fantasy about interrogating the bodies and souls of tricksters, oligarchs and killers. You are the inner wobble between mania and apathy. You are the doomed mayoral enterprise in which players impose quarantines and roadblocks, while trying to maintain the trust of some powerful factions. You are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3199650/Pathologic_3/">out now-ish on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>You’ve got a time-rewinding feature these days, so that players can reverse their foolish decisions without starting afresh? You're giving players the ability to clear away miasma using some kind of refillable doohickey? Generous of you, Pathologic 3, but I can see the rusty meat cleaver in your other hand.</p>
<p>RPS has an ancient, fraught relationship with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic">Pathologic</a> series. We are beloved among the elder Pathologgers for Quintin Smith’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/butchering-pathologic-part-1-the-body">three-part essay on the original 2005 game</a>, and we are also... disliked, to put it gently, for being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-2s-easy-mode-lets-you-soak-in-the-dread-of-an-unwell-town">somewhat ambivalent about Pathologic 2</a> – the sequel-turned-remake dedicated to just one of the original game’s three playable protagonists. I’m likely going to be reviewing Pathologic 3, and I’m already dreading the fallout if I conclude that I am Not Keen. Still, duty calls. Something's calling, anyway. I hear it in the basement. It sounds like it has a voicebox made entirely of teeth.</p><p>Where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pathologic-2">Pathologic 2</a> concerned the doings of the Haruspex, a returning local son who fights the plague using a mixture of surgery and steppe lore, Pathologic 3 focuses on the Bachelor, an academic doctor who is pursuing a rumoured immortal man. While it has similar rancid geography, and the same atmosphere of phantasmagorical confusion and despair, it’s a very different and perhaps an easier game in many respects, as Brendy found when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-3-quarantine-drops-the-hunger-meters-so-you-can-play-doctor">playing the demo last year</a>. </p>
<p>The often-exhausting open world format is gone. You don’t have to worry as much about the bare necessities of survival, either, and the time-jumping feature allows for some trial and error, though this isn’t exactly routine savescumming – as Brendy summarised, “you earn time travel gunge by playing a euthanasia minigame where you ease the passing of dying people in the street by administering morphine or other drugs”. A Tardis powered by human souls? How very pathological of you, Pathologic 3.</p>
<p>Developers Ice-Pick Lodge appear to be in a difficult place at the moment. Last year, founder Nikolay Dybowski left the studio after players <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ice-pick-lodge-founder-nikolay-dybowski-departs-pathologic-dev">discovered allegations of abuse and kidnapping</a>. The remaining staff have yet to really comment on these reports. It’s not clear they ever will. I can imagine the painful legalities that may be involved.</p>
<p>Ice Pick are Russian-founded, and you may wish to avoid their games if you’re concerned about indirectly funding Russia’s vicious, zealous and cynical attack on Ukraine. They are currently based in Kazakhstan, however, who appear cautiously supportive of Ukraine’s independence and are calling for peace (I am no expert on the geopolitics here). The developers have also spoken out against Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, commenting back in 2022 that "a crime is being committed in our name”. </p><p>If Pathologic 3 is a success, Ice-Pick <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pathologic-3-devs-keen-to-avoid-premature-promises-about-bringing-back-the-changeling-in-pathologic-4">will hopefully make Pathologic 4</a>. This will star the Changeling, a young girl who can restore life or take it away through touch. Pathologic aside, Ice Pick are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-pathologic-devs-are-making-darkwood-2-with-acid-wizards-blessing-in-a-frankly-outrageous-piece-of-horror-synergy">partnering with Hooded Horse and Acid Wizard to make Darkwood 2</a>.  </p>

            <p>Larian CEO Swen Vincke has provided an update as to how the studio are planning to go about handling the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-want-to-release-divinity-in-three-to-four-years-and-theyre-making-limited-use-of-generative-ai">use of generative AI</a> in the making of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/divinity-larian">Divinity</a>. In an effort to alleviate concerns, the newly decided plan is to avoid using it in any capacity as part of the concept art development process. In general, Larian are aiming to ensure any in-game generated assets in their games come from models "trained" on data Larian already own, rather than risking the charge of creative theft or actual copyright breach.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Vincke revealed these plans in an answer to a question about the studio's Generative AI use submitted to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/">public AMA session</a> the studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-announce-plans-to-let-folks-ask-anything-about-their-generative-ai-use-asserting-a-lot-has-become-lost-in-translation">have hosted today</a>, January 9th. The exec kicked off by stating that "there is not going to be any GenAI art in Divinity", though he seemingly isn't ruling it out for future games.</p>
<p>"I know there’s been a lot of discussion about us using AI tools as part of concept art exploration," he continued. "We already said this doesn’t mean the actual concept art is generated by AI but we understand it created confusion. So, to ensure there is no room for doubt, we’ve decided to refrain from using genAI tools during concept art development. That way there can be no discussion about the origin of the art."</p>
<p>Further on in his response, he outlined the studio's current plan when it comes to using generative AI to make art in games at large. "We will not generate 'creative assets' that end up in a game without being 100% sure about the origins of the training data and the consent of those who created the data," Vincke wrote. "If we use a GenAI model to create in-game assets, then it’ll be trained on data we own."</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="652"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nyl9tdz/">Comment</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Wombat_Medic/">u/Wombat_Medic</a> from discussion<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/"></a><br> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/">Games</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>In between those two points, the CEO made clear that Larian still plan to experiment with generative AI in other areas. "We continuously try to improve the speed with which we can try things out. The more iterations we can do, the better in general the gameplay is," he wrote. "We think GenAI can help with this and so we’re trying things out across departments. Our hope is that it can aid us to refine ideas faster, leading to a more focused development cycle, less waste, and ultimately, a higher-quality game."</p><p>Elsewhere <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nyliprj/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">in the thread</a>, Larian's machine learning director Gabriel Bosque offered an explanation of an area in which the studio are making use of this sort of tech. "There is currently one example of machine learning generated assets that end up in the game and that is within our cinematics and animation pipeline," he wrote. "In this pipeline we try to capture the actor's performances as best as we can, so we use machine learning models to clean, retarget and even add motion when it's not motion captured. These models are trained exclusively with Larian data."</p>
<p>In my eyes, the changes outlined by Vincke are generally positive, though the matter of controlling and knowing definitively where every bit of data a model has pulled from originates feels like something which could be tough to pull off in practice. I'm no expert, though - perhaps the solution is as simple as locking your herd of generative AI models in an isolated room that only contains internal data. In the long run, there's also the question of whether 'acceptable' usage of generative AI like this might lead to more wholesale and unregulated adoption down the road.</p>
<p>For now, at least there'll be no weird AI portraits in whichever dungeons Divinity sends you to investigate.</p>

At least, that’s what people think after looking at the photos of parents playing with their kids and the </span><i><span>Mario </span></i><span>toys.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I admit, the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-season-7-gen-ai-tim-sweeney-latata-2000649103"><span>AI witch hunt</span></a><span> has gotten out of hand, so when I looked at the supposed AI images, I had several moments of doubt. Maybe some people’s hands and fingers just look like that, and the growing fear that AI art is infecting everything around me has completely distorted my idea of what hands look like? Maybe it’s possible for a thumb to twist like that, or for a child’s hand to squish into their mother’s like we see here.&nbsp;</span></p>

I’ve got tiny hands, so maybe I’m not the best judge.</span></p>

 <p><span>Whatever the case, fans have already run with the assumption that these images are AI-generated in the replies to Nintendo’s social media posts on </span><a href="https://www.facebook.com/NintendoAmerica/posts/pfbid02fPQ2Jr4GHpvW19uvHJgrWejxt3XMRWWF3yAjMtvi18VQsL8HjMiCgiTtp3rfQpVJl"><span>Facebook</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://x.com/NintendoStoreUS/status/2009280600608268620"><span>X</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Introducing My Mario, a collection of products, games, and experiences inspired by Mario and his Mushroom Kingdom friends, designed for young children and their parents.

<p>Larain has revealed that they will refrain from using GenAI tools for concept art or dialogue text generation for Divinity following recent community blowback.</p>



<p>For those unaware, Larian Studios was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-larian-employees-fire-back-at-bosss-ai-comments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">under fire</a> from the community recently after the CEO stated that “everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we’re using it” regarding AI. The CEO later confirmed that the dev team will hold an AMA to clear up confusion about AI usage and address other aspects of the game, and that day has finally arrived. </p>







<h2 id="h-divinity-will-not-feature-any-genai-art-or-text-generation">Divinity Will Not Feature Any GenAI Art or Text Generation</h2>



<p>Revealed through Larian’s Divinity AMA on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games</a>, Larian CEO Swen Vincke has confirmed that “there is not going to be any GenAI art in Divinity.” Vincke then addressed the discussion around “AI tools as part of concept art exploration”, explaining that it didn’t mean the concept art was generated through AI; however, to avoid any confusion in the community, they have decided to “refrain from using genAI tools during concept art development.” </p>



<p>At the same time, the development team has been constantly working on speeding up the development process and feels that GenAI can help with this process. GenAI can help in refining ideas faster, “leading to a more focused development cycle, less waste, and ultimately, a higher-quality game.” </p>



<p>However, the CEO has confirmed that Larian “will not generate ‘creative assets’ that end up in a game without being 100% sure about the origins of the training data and the consent of those who created the data.” If GenAI ends up being used to create in-game assets, it will be trained on the data Larian owns. The Writing Director for Divinity confirmed that the same stance applies for the writing as well, and they “don’t have any text generation touching our dialogues, journal entries or other writing in Divinity.” </p>







<p>In other news, Larian has confirmed that players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/larian-says-players-dont-need-to-play-older-divinity-games-for-the-new-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">don’t need to play older games</a> before the upcoming Divinity title. Additionally, the game will follow the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-plans-to-follow-the-same-early-access-format-as-other-larian-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">same early access format</a> as the previous titles.

            <title><![CDATA[There’s A 4th Game Coming During The Xbox Developer Direct]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/4th-game-during-xbox-developer-direct/</link>
            <guid>1401604</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>On Thursday, Microsoft confirmed three games would be appearing at the upcoming Xbox Developer Direct later this month. When the three games were announced, many fans were left wondering if that would be it for the event. Well, according to a new report, there’s at least one more game.</p>



<p>First mentioned by Shinobi on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot36-oops-all-obsidian.1310962/page-215#post-149812867" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reset Era forums</a>, Xbox is planning to show a “secret fourth game” during the Developer Direct. Shortly there after, another outlet corroborated those claims.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-this-fourth-game-at-xbox-developer-direct">What Is This Fourth Game At Xbox Developer Direct?</h2>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-xbox-developer-direct-will-feature-a-secret-unannounced-fourth-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a>, the fourth game not only exists, but it’s reportedly a <strong>“promising indie title from a third-party publisher”. </strong></p>



<p>No other details on what this game could be was mentioned by either Shinobi or VGC. </p>



<p><strong>UPDATE 10:45am EST:</strong> VGC <a href="https://x.com/andy_vgc/status/2009650782778626367"><strong>has issued a correction</strong></a>. The game is not, in fact, an indie game from a third party. Rather, they now claim it to be a “smaller original game from a first-party studio”</p>



<p>Despite the reliability of both sources, it’s important to note that plans can change and that everything should be taken with a grain of salt until either the show airs, or it can be confirmed by Insider Gaming.</p>







<p>As far as what is guaranteed to be there, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-games-confirmed-for-xbox-developer-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox confirmed</a> that Forza Horizon 6, Fable, and Game Freak’s Beast of Reincarnation will be shown. Forza Horizon 6 will get its first gameplay reveal, Beast of Reincarnation will see details of the game’s protagonist Emma’s plan manipulation abilities, and Fable will get its first extended look. </p>



<p>Last year’s show featured games like Doom: The Dark Ages, Ninja Gaiden 4, and Clair Obscur: Expedition 3. There was even a surprise Ninja Gaiden 2 Black shadow drop announced.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo GameCube Classics – Official Reveal Trailer | Nintendo Switch 2</p>
      </div>
<p>Like previous Fire Emblem games, Path of Radiance is a turn-based tactical RPG that features permadeath: Any character who falls in battle is permanently lost for the rest of the game. A sequel--Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn--was released for the Nintendo Wii in 2007.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-gamecube-game-coming-to-switch-2s-switch-online-library/2900-6400/">GameCube Classics library has </a><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-gamecube-game-coming-to-switch-2s-switch-online-library/2900-6400/">slowly grown</a> since its launch last year and now includes games like Super Mario Strikers, The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker, and F-Zero GX. Each game benefits from a higher resolution than the original releases, and for an extra touch of authenticity, Nintendo sells a wireless controller designed after the original GameCube controller.</p><p>While it doesn't have a concrete release date yet, Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave is expected to arrive later this year. The game was revealed in September 2025, and the debut trailer hinted that it could be set in the same continuity as 2019's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fire-emblem-three-houses/">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a>.</p>

                <p>The extraction shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> has proven to be one of the top hits of 2025, which has in turn attracted some unscrupulous players who aren't above cheating to win. After the rule-abiding Arc Raiders players became vocal about their displeasure, Embark Studios has announced that new anti-cheat measures are on their way to the game.</p><p>"We've seen the discussion around the topic of cheaters in Arc Raiders," reads the message shared on Arc Raiders' Discord server via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-has-a-cheater-problem-but-embarks-says-significant-changes-are-coming-to-detection-and-ban-systems/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>. "Please know that we are taking this issue very seriously and are listening to, and acting on your feedback. Over the next few weeks, we are implementing significant changes to our rulesets and deploying new detection mechanisms to identify and remove cheaters. This includes updating our Anti-Cheat systems for improved detection and bans, as well as applying client-side fixes specifically addressing the 'out of map glitch.' Furthermore, we are introducing tools for streamers to help mitigate stream sniping."</p><p>A firm timetable for the anti-cheat measures wasn't disclosed. However, Embark Studios CEO Patrick Söderlund recently revealed that Arc Raiders has quietly introduced "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-now-features-aggression-based-matchmaking-dev-confirms/1100-6537178/" data-ref-id="1100-6537178">aggression-based matchmaking</a>." Söderlund went on to clarify that matchmaking is still skill-based, but it will also match players "based on how likely you are to engage in fights with fellow players."</p><p>Earlier this month, Arc Raiders hit a new peak of daily active users <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-continues-to-be-a-huge-hit-reportedly-achieving-these-new-records/1100-6537168/" data-ref-id="1100-6537168">with 3.2 million players</a>. Over the two-week holiday period, Arc Raiders also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/arc-raiders-and-more-dominated-steams-holiday-sales-chart/2900-7387/" data-ref-id="2900-7387">outperformed every other game on Steam</a>. Outside of the game, an Arc Raiders player shared that their in-game cries for help were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-player-screaming-for-help-gets-frantic-visit-from-real-life-neighbor/1100-6537173/" data-ref-id="1100-6537173">answered by a concerned neighbor</a> who tried to kick down the door to assist them.</p>

            <p>Game of Thrones author George R. R. Martin would probably be quite surprised by how the world of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> - which he helped developer FromSoftware create a backstory for - actually turned out in the end.</p>
<p>That's according to Elden Ring game director <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hidetaka-miyazaki">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a>, who has said that while Martin was part of the game's development in terms of laying foundations for its world-building and such, it was the studio's own narrative team that actually took what Martin devised and then built upon it. And, there are some cases where the team and Miyazaki built upon it so much, that Martin himself may not actually recognise it.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/12/16/the-soul-of-soulslike">Game Informer</a>, Miyazaki said "as a player walks through this world, [...] they have a very fragmented understanding of the lore, the surroundings, and the type of monsters, whereas I don't" (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/game-of-thrones-author-george-r-r-martins-starting-point-for-elden-ring-evolved-so-drastically-that-hidetaka-miyazaki-reckons-hed-be-surprised-how-the-open-world-rpg-turned-out/">Games Radar</a>).</p>
<p>As Miyazaki knew the world of Elden Ring in its entirety, the director therefore wanted to ensure that the important moments for those who did not have the same level of knowledge didn't get "lost". This saw the director bringing "the map and level design" of Elden Ring together, so it could "serve as a guide" which would "help players pick up more information and piece together what they think that world is", he explained.</p><p>But while Martin may be perhaps be surprised by how some of his lore building efforts evolved for the final release, Miyazaki doesn't have any regrets about the necessary changes which made Elden Ring an all-round experience for players. In fact, the director said Elden Ring even now remains "in a league of its own".</p>

<p>Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/george-r-r-martin-admits-he-hasnt-played-elden-ring-as-people-seem-to-want-this-winds-of-winter-book">Martin admitted he hadn't played Elden Ring</a>, despite providing backstory. Before its release, though, the author did say <a href="https://georgerrmartin.com/notablog/2021/12/18/long-long-ago/">he thought Elden Ring looked pretty incredible</a>.</p>
<p>As for expansion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, Martin didn't provide any new material for FromSoftware. "Essentially it is the same as it was with the base game," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-is-fromsoftwares-largest-expansion-ever">Miyazaki told Eurogamer ahead of the DLC's release in 2024</a>.</p>
<p>"The DLC Shadow of the Erdtree is based on one part of that original mythos that he penned for us. It's not a brand new mythos that he's written specifically for Shadow of the Erdtree, he has not created something new which informed the design of the DLC. It's simply another part of the original story that we thought fit to tell as a new expansion."</p>

<p>Gimme some skin</p>

<figure data-uuid="1165974a982f9"><a title="Switch 2 - Dbrand" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1165974a982f9/switch-2-dbrand.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>When Nintendo announced the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-reveals-first-new-joy-con-2-colours-for-switch-2">new alternative colour Joy-Con controllers for the Switch 2</a> this week, one thing became adamantly clear: it's quite possible that we'll never get any solid colour Joy-Con. Those little accents around the analogue sticks are likely all you'll see when the Joy-Con are attached to the console. And that's fine, y'know?</p>
<p>But if you're not especially pleased about this, then accessory manufacturer Dbrand might have you covered. The company has revealed that it is launching 'ColorMatched' skins that will effectively take the accented colours of the new Joy-Con and apply the same colour to the entire controllers. The result, provided to apply them properly, is pretty neat.</p>

<p>Now, we've never really been fans of Dbrand's 'edgy' humour, since it often borders on being completely unprofessional, but there's no denying its quality when it comes to controller skins. So if you're in the market and you want your Joy-Con controllers to look a bit more like the OG Switch, then it might well be something to look into. They cost <strong>$19.95</strong> directly from <a href="https://dbrand.com/shop/skins/nintendo-switch-2-skins">Dbrand's website</a>.</p>
<p>As for the new 'Light Purple / Light Green' Joy-Con, these will launch very soon on <strong>12th February 2026</strong>. They'll set you back <strong>$99.99</strong> in the US and <strong>£74.99</strong> in the UK.</p>

  </picture><h2>Fifth Place - Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2><p>Developer: Team Cherry | Release Date: September 4th, 2025</p><p>Written by Andrew Otton</p><p>Everything about <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> just feels right. The movement, the animations, the frenetic pace to combat, the wonderfully weird world to explore... It's no surprise to see this rank on our list.</p><p>Sometimes <em>Silksong </em>can feel unfairly hard, but there is a certain ethos to most of the game. There's always an advantage to be found, a pattern to be learned. It's never cheap deaths, but certainly punishing ones as you learn new enemies or boss encounters (though I could do without some of those delivery quests).</p><p>As one of the most highly anticipated games in the last few years, I think <em>Silksong </em>lived up to expectations. There's a lot to love for action platformer fans, metroidvania fans, those that love the lore of the series, and just generally gaming fans as it's just solid through and through.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Fourth Place - Ghost of Yotei</h2><p>Developer: Sucker Punch Productions | Release Date: October 2nd, 2025</p><p>Written by Austin Suther</p><p>I got around to <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> in December, a couple of months after it was initially released. Maybe it’s because I was trying to avoid spoiling myself, but I didn’t see a great deal of talk about <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>. At least, not when compared to other PlayStation exclusives.</p><p>Nonetheless, <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> deserves your attention. It took TechRaptor’s top spot for Best Visual Design of 2025, and well, go figure. Take one look at the game and you’ll see why: It’s jawdroppingly gorgeous. The world is large but densely-packed, so it’s very easy to find yourself going off course and completing various quests or side objectives, though it also doesn’t feel like a collect-a-thon, a common pitfall many open world games fall into.</p><p>Outside of visuals, though, we get to see the journey of Atsu as she sets out on a journey of revenge many years in the making. She’s out to kill the Yotei Six, a group of evildoers that killed her family and now threaten to control all of Hokkaido.</p><p>In this quest for revenge, gameplay is a standout. Combat is smooth but weighty, as Atsu delivers devastating blows with her varied arsenal, including katanas, spears, and shinobi weapons. Atsu is more in-your-face than <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>’s Jin Sakai, so while you can resort to stealth, there’s a larger focus tackling your foes up front and in their face.</p><p>For a game as long as <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is, one would think combat gets stale after a while, but that never happened. Enough new weapons and enemies are introduced to make encounters feel fresh, and man, the feedback from that DuelSense is really somethin’ else.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Third Place - Hades II</h2><p>Developer: Supergiant Games | Release Date: September 25th, 2025</p><p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p><p>Hades II builds on its predecessor in arguably every department, both in terms of quantity and quality. There are twice as many levels, even more bosses, and a nearly doubled soundtrack. All that centers around the already-impeccable gameplay loop that Supergiant built in the previous game.</p><p>It would be so easy to say<em> Hades II</em> is just its predecessor but bigger, and that captures a majority of it. It's a classic case of not breaking what worked so well while iterating to make parts of it fresh.</p><p>Playing as a witch instead of a warrior comes with some nuances, like how Melinoe has to play it safe at the start. But usually by the end of a run, you're melting entire rooms of enemies with a chaotic chain of curses and effects.</p><p><em>Hades II </em>features a satisfying combat gameplay loop peppered with narrative moments from characters in the Crossroads and out in the wild. Even the bosses all have their own stories, making the world feel that much richer.</p><p>So yes, <em>Hades II</em> is just <em>Hades </em>but better—but the first game didn't win our GOTY in 2020 for no reason, after all.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Second Place - Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2><p>Developer: Sandfall Interactive | Release Date: April 24th, 2025&nbsp;</p><p>Written by Tyler Chancey</p><p>Sandfall Interactive's <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> was a major success by all accounts for the studio. Their debut title managed to gain a spotlight in the gaming community thanks to its modern blend of stunning visuals, gripping character performances, and impressive symphonic musical score.</p><p>The biggest secret to its success is how <em>Clair Obscu</em>r manages to put a new look and feel on familiar turn-based RPG gameplay. While the individual elements aren't new to veterans of the genre, the distinct mix presented helped lower the barrier for many who were dismissive of the genre's merits.</p><p>For those accomplishments, this title deserves its spot.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Winner - Blue Prince</h2><p>Developer: Dogubomb | Release Date: April 10th, 2025</p><p>Written by Andrew Stretch</p><p>There hasn't been a game that I've thought about more this year. Stepping into Blue Prince you're met with an entertaining puzzle roguelite experience of trying to build your way through a house of ever-changing rooms. This simple plan gets bogged down as suddenly you need to learn how to unlock a door, or reach a basement, unlock a side gate or get into an orchard.</p><p>Blue Prince does a fantastic job of starting simple, with a clear goal for the player to complete, while simultaneously seeding in other mysteries and puzzles. By the time you are at the end of one thread, there are four or five other threads that have come up. Simple mechanics get iterated upon until you complete the game, and this serves as a fine point to step off the ride, but for those wanting further puzzles to complete the game doubles in length.</p><p>Blue Prince is a true indie development story of how time and a single great idea were able to capture the minds of thousands and leave us wanting just one more puzzle to complete, even after it's all over. Blue Prince joins the ranks of many other meta puzzle games that I'll be recommending to friends for years to come.</p></div><div><p><span><div>
