			<p>Today, publisher Secret Mode and independent developer Silent Games have announced the release date of Empyreal. The third-person action RPG will debut on May 8 and will be available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X for a budget price of £24.99/$29.99/€29.99. It's also the first game to be published by Secret Mode since they split from Sumo Group earlier this month to become an independent publisher.</p>
<p>The news was accompanied by an overview trailer where Silent Games Co-Founder and Creative Director Joseph Rogers explained what players can expect from Empyreal when it comes to the setting and overarching theme:</p>
<p><em>The game begins with your arrival on an unexplored planet to join an expedition that's discovered a monolith built by a lost ancient civilization. You are immediately presented with these grand questions: why is it here? Who built it? What was its original purpose, and perhaps even what power might it still contain? As you progress through the story, you'll explore themes and ideas about humanity's place in the cosmos. Some of these themes have largely fallen out of favor in the modern world, things like duty, sacrifice, a tragic view of life, a sense of civilizational impetus, the idea that humanity is on a journey through history and that there is a purpose to that.</em></p>
<p><em>As you uncover what this ancient civilization managed to achieve, the question you have to consider is whether this still has relevance to the modern world despite all of its technological advancements. Has the modern world forgotten some things that are important to humanity?</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Empyreal - Official Game Overview Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_gRQlppV4vM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Rogers also revealed that while Empyreal is strictly a single player action RPG, there are some asynchronous cooperative elements. For instance, after defeating a boss, players have the option to send an item into the Aether so that it might find its way to another player. There is no specific reward for doing this, so it's left to the goodwill of the community to help fellow adventurers.</p>
<p>Our Francesco De Meo recently went hands on with a preview build of the game and relayed positive impressions <a href="https://wccftech.com/empyreal-hands-on-preview-an-arpg-of-a-different-kind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the article</a>:</p>
<p><em>With what seems to be a deep loot system that will allow for the creation of some specialized builds, as highlighted by the three end-game builds that can be used in the demo, and a unique approach to action combat, Empyreal definitely has the chance to stand out among the competition, especially if the developer manages to iron out some issues</em></p>

With more burst maneuverability than any other Strategist (only Loki’s clone teleport offers more instant safety, but it’s on a much longer cooldown), it is common for skilled Rocket players to finish the match with very few deaths (if any) while offering a ton of healing and assists. Use his dash, glide, and wall-climbing abilities to find hard-to-reach places, then shoot healing balls down on allies. You don’t need to be close to heal them.</p><figure id="" data-id="0eddbe1fc4e502a20b138f3d88c76eca" data-recommend-id="image://0eddbe1fc4e502a20b138f3d88c76eca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rocket Racoon races towards a fight with multiple heroes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rocket Racoon races towards a fight with multiple heroes." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0eddbe1fc4e502a20b138f3d88c76eca" data-recommend-id="image://0eddbe1fc4e502a20b138f3d88c76eca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rocket Racoon races towards a fight with multiple heroes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Place buffing machines like B.R.B. out of the way, so they won’t be destroyed, but close enough to objectives to let the resurrected teammate join the battle again quickly.

<p>PlayStation has a new first-party studio under PlayStation Studios called Dark Outlaw Games. The studio is being led by former Call of Duty Zombies lead Jason Blundell.</p>



<p>The name of the studio was confirmed by Blundell in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY37_Cenui4&amp;t=4729s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview with Jeff Gerstmann</a> that was published on Monday.</p>



<p>“The studio is called Dark Outlaw,” Blundell said. “We’ve been working away in the shadows for a while, when we’ve got something to talk about we’ll step out into the light.”</p>



<p>As far as the secrecy behind the studio’s creation, Blundell says the story is about the game and not the studio. He added that doing it under the Sony umbrella is a “privilege”.</p>



<h6 id="h-podcast-meet-the-creator-behind-call-of-duty-skill-based-matchmaking-insider-gaming-weekly">PODCAST: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/meet-the-creator-of-call-of-duty-skill-based-matchmaking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Meet The Creator Behind Call of Duty Skill-Based Matchmaking—Insider Gaming Weekly</a></h6>



<p>“It’s such a privilege to be able to do it with Sony as a new first-party studio, Sony doesn’t start up first-party studios all the time, so to have that privilege is humbling,” Blundell said while adding that the studio is making new hirings for the development of its first game.</p>



<p>Those new hires could be for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-yet-to-announce-live-service-multiplayer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unannounced live service multiplayer game</a> that began making the rounds. According to the recent job postings, this new game is still early in its development—that’s even if it’s the same game at all.</p>



<p>Most details surrounding the studio, aside from its name and who’s leading it, remain…dark.</p>

And so Dark Outlaw Games have been working away in the shadows for a while, and when we’ve got something to talk about, we’ll step out into the light. But you know the story for me is about the game, not about the studio, so the reason why we’re not doing a fanfare or shout about it from the rooftops is like, ‘let’s get something,’ right?”</p><p>Blundell continued, “And it’s such a privilege to be able to do it with with Sony as a new first-party studio. You know, Sony doesn’t set up first-party studios all the time. So to have to have that privilege is humbling—it’s really nice. I’m really excited.”</p><p>As for how far along the studio’s first game is, Blundell remained tight-lipped.</p><p>“[We’re currently] staffing up, keeping it kind of lowkey—been going for a little bit of time now. Not gonna really comment about what we’re doing exactly, but it’s like we talked about—getting the team to gel, getting the ideas clicking right, let’s test those—you know, I’m a programmer at heart—so let’s test those assumptions, and you know, ‘is it working?'”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>He went on, “It’s very exciting and I love the fact still, at this point in my career, I’m given these opportunities. And it’s always that desire to want to put that one extra disc on the wall, if you will, and can we bring something to an audience and excite them and get some new IPs or [something] exciting or dangerous. That makes me jump out of bed every morning.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Developer Silent Games and publisher Secret Mode have announced that its upcoming single-player action-RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/empyreal/" data-ref-id="5000-651867">Empyreal</a> will be released on May 8 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. On a distant world where humanity has discovered a strange monolith built by a lost civilization, players will explore this location while mastering various weapons and RPG systems.</p><p>In a developer diary, creative director Joseph Rogers went into more detail on the game, describing it as a third-person game about "transcendental revelations" that players will discover as they venture deeper into the monolith. Thematically, Empyreal asks questions about the human condition, its place in the cosmos, and whether societal systems like duty and honor are still driving forces in humanity's story.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gRQlppV4vM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_gRQlppV4vM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>When it comes to gameplay, Empyreal combines action-RPG systems with elements inspired by isometric-ARPG games like Diablo. Similarly to games in this genre, you'll be free to invest in various skills, but you can only have a handful of them available to use at any given time, so you will need to mix and match the abilities to suit your playstyle.</p><p>This works with three distinct weapon types that drastically change combat, as there'll be a big emphasis on constantly fine-tuning your character throughout your journey. Silent Games added that Empyreal will also offer an endgame experience with a substantial amount of content, as well as a New Game Plus mode with features exclusive to a fresh run.</p><p>Other interesting parts of the game include cartograms that can shake up a level and help you chase after specific loot, and there's also the option to be charitable toward fellow players. Defeating certain bosses will result in a rip in the fabric of reality, and if you feel like donating some gear, you can send something through this tear to another player.</p><p>Any item sent through will significantly increase its stats, but this is purely a gesture of goodwill as you'll get nothing from it. "It's really up to the community as a whole to make it work," Rogers explained. "I'm quite curious to see how or even if players engage with this feature."</p><p>Empyreal will be the first title launched by Secret Mode as an independent publisher, following its sale from Sumo Group to Emona Capital earlier this month.</p>

                <p>Call of Duty veteran Jason Blundell's first major post-Activision project was the PlayStation-partnered Deviation Games, but it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-partnered-studio-from-ex-cod-devs-has-closed/1100-6521774/" data-ref-id="1100-6521774">opened and closed without even announcing or releasing a game</a>. Now Blundell is starting a new company with PlayStation.</p><p>Blundell said in an interview with Jeff Gerstmann that he's starting Dark Outlaw Games, which is a new studio inside of PlayStation Studios. "We've been working away in the shadows for a while. When we've got something to talk about we'll step out into the light," he said, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/playstation-has-formed-new-studio-dark-outlaw-games-with-call-of-duty-zombies-lead-jason-blundell/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as reported by VGC</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LY37_Cenui4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/LY37_Cenui4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Blundell said it's "such a privilege" to be the newest first-party PlayStation studio. "Sony doesn't start up first-party studios all the time, so to have that privilege is humbling," he said.</p><p>As mentioned, this isn't Blundell's first go-around with Sony. In 2021, Deviation Games signed a partnership with Sony to create a new IP that would exclusive to PlayStation. Another Call of Duty veteran, Dave Anthony, founded Deviation with Blundell. However, Blundell left the company in 2022, with a round of layoffs following in 2023, before the company closed its doors for good in 2024 without its first game ever even being announced.</p><p>There is no word yet on what Dark Outlaw is making for Sony. As for Blundell, he was instrumental in the creation of Call of Duty's massively popular Zombies mode during his time at Treyarch. He worked on a number of Call of Duty games over the years, and he directed 2015's Black Ops 3.</p>

            <p>What's going on in the world of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, the NetEase hero shooter that is forecast to get <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-to-get-two-new-heroes-every-three-month-season-say-netease-and-no-theyre-not-adding-role-queue">two new heroes every three month season</a>, and thus stands to double its starting roster of 33 heroes providing it stays afloat for at least four years? The word on the street is that they're adding new Team-Up skills in Season 2, beginning 11th April - and when I say "the word on the street", I mean it's been officially confirmed by game director Guangyun Chen. I apologise, I will try not to sound like a cool reporter again.</p><!--more-->
<p>"The content for Season 2 is ready and set to go," Chen observed in a new interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/marvel-rivals-growing-roster-of-heroes-scares-me-but-the-games-director-seems-sure-that-all-is-under-control-everything-is-progressing-smoothly/">Peter Parker Gamer</a>. "The designs for Seasons 3 and 4 have also been completed and are currently under intensive development! Overall, everything is progressing smoothly."</p>
<p>I'm not sure it's been progressing smoothly for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-reward-us-based-developers-of-live-service-hit-marvel-rivals-by-sacrificing-their-jobs-to-efficiency">the people they laid off last month</a>, and let's not forget about NetEase <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-plan-to-reset-ranks-mid-season-hastily-abandoned-in-the-face-of-player-revolt">suddenly junking plans to reset player ranks mid-season following an outcry</a>. But Marvel Rivals continues to attract droves of players.</p>
<p>The game's first season added the Fantastic Four to the line-up - which, the mathematicians amongst you may notice, is actually double the anticipated rollout speed for new heroes. NetEase have yet to reveal Season 2's offerings - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/conspiracy-was-briefly-afoot-in-the-marvel-rivals-community-following-netease-hero-plant-rumours">beware the rumour-mongers</a> - but the game's Gallery Cards suggest that half-vampire Blade is one of the new heroes.</p>
<p>More important, perhaps, than the introduction of new heroes is the addition of new Team-Ups. As the name suggests, these see characters merging their abilities for beaucoup superheroism. I haven't played a lot of Marvel Rivals lately but I'm intrigued by how Team-Ups seem to be serving as a pressure release valve for the balancing. Given the rate at which they're injecting new blood, and given that Marvel's archives harbour thousands of heroes with very mismatched capabilities, NetEase have their work cut out for them ensuring that nobody is either too strong or useless. Team-Ups are helpful here because a weaker hero can still contribute to a match by joining a powerful Team-Up.</p>
<p>I'm sure there are more arcane multiplayer balancing getarounds than this, but I enjoy it regardless. I will attempt to carry on enjoying it when I next sign in and am immediately shredded by a Symbiote Bond.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/zywoo-passes-s1mple-in-major-counter-strike-milestone/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Counter-Strike GOAT debate may never end, but French prodigy Mathieu “ZywOo” Herbaut has reasserted his case, passing a record held by the one and only Oleksandr “s1mple” Kostyljev. However, it could very well be CS2’s fastest rising star that eventually claims the record for himself.</p>



<h2 id="h-zywoo-sets-counter-strike-record-for-most-tournament-mvp-trophies">ZywOo Sets Counter-Strike Record for Most Tournament MVP Trophies</h2>



<p>At ESL Pro League Season 21, Vitality added their second trophy of the year to their case, after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/vitality-stuns-spirit-3-0-in-grand-finals-of-iem-katowice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claiming IEM Katowice</a> just a month prior. ZywOo was named MVP of both tournaments by HLTV, bringing his MVP career total to 22, passing s1mple’s record of 2021. </p>



<p>To put in perspective how dominant s1mple was in his prime, his most recent MVP award was from IEM Cologne 2022. He hasn’t won an MVP award in more than two years, while ZywOo has won a staggering nine since the start of 2023, and only now has the French superstar finally passed s1mple. S1mple still owns the record for most MVP awards won in a single year, after winning eight in 2021, the same year where he finally won the Major. Both s1mple and ZywOo are also tied with just a single Major win, but ZywOo is in the better position to win a second considering how dominant Vitality is looking to start 2025.</p>



<p>“I’m one ahead of s1mple,” ZywOo <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/41218/zywoo-i-wont-stop-just-because-i-am-one-in-front-of-s1mple" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told HLTV</a> after winning ESL Pro League Season 21. “I will just keep going, keep grinding, and I will never stop just because I am one in front. I will just show I can go 25, 30 MVPs.”</p>



<p>Right now s1mple’s career is at a crossroads. The 27-year-old is still officially on the NAVI bench, and hasn’t played in a professional match since November during his loan to Falcons. Either ZywOo will set a standard so high that no one will catch it, or a new contender for GOAT status will emerge. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cs2s-biggest-superstar-donk-dazzles-in-first-match-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The player many are watching out for is Danil “donk” Kryshkovets</a>, the rising star of Team Spirit, after a 2024 rookie campaign that saw him win a record-breaking Major and five MVP awards. Still, even if he maintains the pace he set last year, it will take him years to catch up to ZywOo’s record, and that’s assuming the French star stops winning. And given that he’s still only 24, I wouldn’t bet on it.</p>



<p>Will any player ever catch ZywOo’s MVP numbers? Is he the GOAT of Counter-Strike? Let us know in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

"I think there's such a rich lore to that game that could be explored in a TV or movie adaptation."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But what are the chances the Bioshock movie actually gets made? In July last year, producer Roy Lee said that, following leadership changes, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/netflixs-bioshock-film-is-still-in-the-works-but-is-being-reconfigured-sdcc-2024">the video-game-to-movie BioShock adaptation had been “reconfigured,” resulting in a “more personal” film</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lee said some of the changes came from lower budgets from Netflix. Details about the BioShock movie’s plot have not been revealed, so it’s unclear what it would have looked like before the shift. Hunger Games director Francis Lawrence is still <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/netflixs-bioshock-movie-has-its-director"><u>attached to direct</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The new regime has lowered the budgets,” Lee said at the time. “So we’re doing a much smaller version. It’s going to be a more personal point of view, as opposed to a grander, big project.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Quaid’s comments on BioShock come alongside an admission that he looks a lot like video game action star Max Payne, whose likeness is based on Remedy writer Sam Lake. Indeed, there are shots from Quaid’s new action movie <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/novocaine-2025">Novocaine</a> that have caused fans to wonder if it’s a Max Payne movie in disguise.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Live action Max Payne. Seems so real so worth it. This is Max Payne. You got me watching this now. Even the woman looks like the woman from Max Payne 2 lol. The resemblance is almost as if NovoCaine characters (basically is) by the same actor (Jack Quad looking like Sam Lake) <a href="https://t.co/kawh2C1B2n" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/kawh2C1B2n</a></p>— Adam Owns 6 (@AdamOwns6) <a href="https://twitter.com/AdamOwns6/status/1900843671651557849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">March 15, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, it seems Quaid is less familiar with Max Payne, which is currently getting the remake treatment from Remedy in a deal with original publisher and rights holder Rockstar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I've seen people say that I look like Max Payne, and when I've looked at the box art, even I did a double-take," Quaid continued. "I love Rockstar's games, but unfortunately I've never played that one - it's next on the list, for sure.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Apart from Bioshock, Quaid loves FromSoftware games. In the same Reddit AMA, Quaid said he loved the challenge presented by the likes of Bloodborne and Elden Ring.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm a huge video game nerd,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/movies/comments/1j8e1wm/comment/mhexakq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he said</a>. “And lately I've been diving headfirst into the FromSoftware library. I beat Bloodborne, then I beat Sekiro, and now I'm going full boar into Elden Ring. Actually, the thing I use Reddit the most for is tips and tricks on beating Fromsoft's bosses. I love how challenging the games are - it took me a while to get into them, but now I'm obsessed.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

This enemy is the final bout for low-rank Hunters to clear in Wilds, and it's a doozy. It also might feel a little familiar, if you've played some past Monster Hunter games, and that seems pretty intentional.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over on Reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1jc61tr/some_rather_disturbing_implications_have_emerged/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">several</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1j8gv1g/interesting_details_about_zoh_shia/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">users</a> have pointed out that Zoh Shia's eyes bear a striking resemblance to Fatalis'. Fatalis is an infamous and powerful species of dragon in Monster Hunter's universe, able to raze kingdoms and cause mass devastation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's a neat, tiny detail you might have missed in all the chaos of battling Zoh Shia, but it's also not the only signifier pointing towards a link to Fatalis. As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1jc61tr/comment/mhzo4wa/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one replier pointed out</a>, many aspects of the Zoh Shia fight share similarities with Fatalis bouts. The monster has moves from Black, White, and Crimson Fatalis, and has other small cosmetic similarities like its horns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Zoh Shia also draws on other classic, terrifying monsters — <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1jc61tr/comment/mhzr8ws/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">find some more here, in this reply</a> — Fatalis definitely seems like a core touchstone. What does it ultimately mean, though?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, keep in mind Zoh Shia is a created monster. And if Zoh Shia was made to combat something or counter a threat, what kind of threat would be countered by a Fatalis-like monster? It opens up a lot of fun theorycrafting for where Monster Hunter Wilds' assumed expansion could go.

As the forefront of cybernetic robotic technology, the M-Tech Corporation converted the derelict prison into a massive robotic research facility. Now a hotbed of experimental nanotechnology and human robot replica research pushed beyond ethical limits.</p><p>You awaken as M-07 a machine prototype with an unexplained anomaly at its core after a disastrous event awakens you. The entire complex is in lockdown and the automated defense systems have been activated. Search the facility, defeat the defense systems in place, recover your memories, and unravel the origin of your creation and the M-Tech Corporation.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>It’s cold and sterile. Power is running low. Everything is a blur of fragmented commands and half-remembered routines.

The truth lingers just out of reach but something compels you to move forward and find out who, and what you are.</p><p><strong>Puzzles and Mechanics</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Classic Controls</strong> – Navigate using fixed-camera angles and tank-style controls, evoking the feel of retro survival horror classics.</li><li><strong>Resource <a title="Genres > Management [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">Management</a></strong> – Begin defenseless with a limited power source. Scavenge for modules that upgrade your abilities—from a stronger power core and cybernetic shield to eventually arming you for combat.</li><li><strong>Strategic Encounters</strong> – Use your wits to solve intricate environmental puzzles while avoiding or outsmarting hostile defenses and lurking enemies. Every upgrade is a double-edged sword, enhancing your capabilities while depleting your finite energy reserves.</li></ul><p><strong>Aesthetics</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Visual Options</strong> – While the default experience celebrates retro visuals, customizable options let you dial back the nostalgia for a slightly modernized presentation.</li><li><strong>Inspirational Homage</strong> – Drawing artistic inspiration from the haunting ambiance of <em>Galerians</em>, the mysterious vibe of <em>BioForge</em>, the melancholic isolation of Amiga classics like <em>Citadel</em>, and the eerie aesthetics of the <em>Alien</em> films and <em>Alien Breed: Tower Assault</em>, every pixel and shadow is crafted to immerse you in an unsettling blend of futuristic decay and retro horror.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Ghost Sector - Trailer (Coming 2026)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q0QXFl0NS8s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
A fresh version of Nintendo's iconic GameCube controller looks to be in development for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a>, fans think. 
</p>
<p>
The evidence here comes from a recent FCC filing for a Switch 2 controller with an oddly-located product label - that matches the location of the product label on a GameCube controller. 
</p>
<p>
The filing, for a Switch 2 peripheral with the product code BEE-021, matches other Switch 2 components with the same BEE prefix, and does not appear to be a new Switch 2 Pro controller. 
</p>
<p>
Evidence dug up by <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/new-fcc-filing-discovered-that-looks-a-lot-like-a-gamecube-nso-controller.12879/#post-1660543">Famiboards</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/03/switch-2-gamecube-controller-rumours-resurface-following-new-nintendo-filing">Nintendo Life</a>) points to the fact this device lacks NFC support - something included in Switch 1 Pro controllers and Joy-Con - but does include wireless Bluetooth, something included in past Nintendo Switch Online pads. 
</p>
<p>
The suggestion, then, is that Nintendo is prepping a GameCube controller re-release in the same way it has done for other retro controllers, such as the N64.

Take a leap of logic further, and the supposed existence of this controller could also point to GameCube support for Nintendo Switch Online... but one thing at a time.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's brilliant GameCube controller and its wonderful Wavebird counterpart are now nearly two decades old, but are still beloved by many fans - indeed, the pads are still a preferred method of control for many hardcore Super Smash Bros players. 
</p>
<p>
Just a few weeks remain until <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-direct-confirmed-for-april-with-more-info-following-todays-brief-reveal">Nintendo properly lifts the lid on its Switch 2 plans at the start of April</a>. Could we see GameCube Switch Online support announced at the same time?

      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Atari [184 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/atari">Atari</a> and developers <a title="Companies > Mighty Yell [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mighty-yell">Mighty Yell</a> and <a title="Companies > 13AM Games [19 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/13am-games">13AM Games</a> have announced <em><a title="Games > Missile Command Delta [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/missile-command-delta">Missile Command Delta</a></em>, a reimagining of Atari’s 1980s missile defense <a title="Genres > Arcade [72 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/arcade">arcade</a> classic as a turn-based tactical game, for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,056 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,795 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,610 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2790160/Missile_Command_Delta/" target="_blank">Steam</a>). It will launch in 2025. <span id="more-950335"></span></p><p>“While <em>Missile Command Delta</em> approaches gameplay in a completely new way, it retains all the tension and suspense of the arcade original,” said Atari vice president of games Ethan Stearns in a press release. “You have to think strategically about every move you make because even one poor choice can have grave consequences.”</p><p>Stearns continued, “<em>Missile Command Delta</em> has a little something for every kind of player—whether you love strategy tactics games, are a mystery fan, a secret hunting completionist, or you just love to explore and solve puzzles. We can’t wait for players to get their hands on the game later this year.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Atari:</p><blockquote><p><em>Missile Command Delta</em> reimagines Atari’s 1980s missile defense arcade classic as a turn-based tactical game set against a mysterious narrative that leaves you questioning whether you’re trapped in a simulation or truly defending cities from attack.</p><p>As players explore an abandoned half-century old facility they will encounter locked doors, dishevelled work rooms, massive super computers and newly awakened missile command terminals. Players must defend against waves of missiles from an unknown enemy using a battery of missiles, each with its own unique type, range, and explosion size. Only by managing their arsenal carefully will they have enough firepower to clear the skies.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>As enemy attacks increase and pressure mounts, relationships will be put to the test, blurring the lines between what is real and who they can trust. If they succeed, they may even learn the truth behind this Cold War defense program.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Missile Command Delta - Official Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qj11h_CjmTc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
