Wrong. Fans in denial (and delusion) are interpreting Shakman’s statements as <em>technically </em>true but not the full truth. </p><p>Some fans are focusing on how Shakman specifically mentioned that Doom is not part of <em>his </em>film or his <em>purview</em>. That sounds, they argue, like an attempt to establish plausible deniability, given how Marvel has separated certain duties on its films. After <em>Thunderbolts* </em>director Jake Schreier revealed to <em>ComicBook.com</em> that the film’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://comicbook.com/movies/news/thunderbolts-post-credits-scene-details-jake-schreier-comments/#:~:text=In%20an%20interview%20with%20ComicBook%20to%20promote%20the,only%20about%20a%20month%20before%20Thunderbolts%2A%20hits%20theaters.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://comicbook.com/movies/news/thunderbolts-post-credits-scene-details-jake-schreier-comments/#:~:text=In%20an%20interview%20with%20ComicBook%20to%20promote%20the,only%20about%20a%20month%20before%20Thunderbolts%2A%20hits%20theaters." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post-credit scene</a></span> was filmed weeks before the theatrical release, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/p/DJOeBqnxGwC/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=8b6826e3-1af7-4964-8a1f-0d8c4abbf03d&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJOeBqnxGwC/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;ig_rid=8b6826e3-1af7-4964-8a1f-0d8c4abbf03d" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Russo Brothers confirmed</a></span> they were the ones who filmed it, rather than Schreier himself. That told Marvel fans that a film’s director doesn’t have to be involved with any post-credit reveals, which would align with Shakman’s assertion that Doom has nothing to do with his efforts on the film. </p><p>In the <em>Thunderbolts* </em>post-credit scene, the New Avengers get a notification that an unidentified aircraft had entered Earth’s atmosphere before we see the iconic “4" logo of the Fantastic Four emblazoned on the side of the ship. Doom has hijacked the Fantastic Four’s ship multiple times in the comic books, so it’s not far-fetched to believe he might do the same in the MCU. </p><p>We’ll have to wait until July 25 to see if these theories are anything more than just fanboy fantasies. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/neightreign-is-good-but-lumpy-counter-intuitive-and-experimental<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Elden Ring Neightreign </em>came out last week, and the response was thunderous “it’s OK.” For the first time in a while, FromSoftware has produced a non-<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9racin%C3%A9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VR game</a> that has been perceived as somewhat mid. And on some level, thank god; <em>Nightreign </em>is healthier and more interesting because it actively does not feel like <em>Elden Ring </em>and is instead a freakish experiment that succeeds more than it doesn’t. It is a game that I liked far more than I expected, one that is slightly confusing, and one that is surprisingly unlike <em>Elden Ring</em>.</p><p>The elevator pitch for <em>Nightreign </em>is “Battle Royale <em>Elden Ring,</em>” which is both disorienting and also sort of quaint in 2025. Aping <em>PUBG </em>or <em>Fortnite </em>was huge for a few years, in a time that seems like an eternity ago. Not only does the game feel charmingly late to the trend, it’s a bizarre fit. Who looks at <em>Elden Ring </em>and thinks “yeah, let’s turn that into <em>Apex Legends</em>?” Had something like this been pitched years ago I would have assumed it was crass, but pulling this now feels like it comes from an earnest place.</p><p>While <em>Elden Ring</em> and its DLC, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>, are primarily single player games with optional multiplayer co-op and PVP hooks, <em>Nightreign </em>is almost exclusively a three person PvE experience. The option to start as a duo does not currently exist, although <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-duo-expeditions-on-the-way-fromsoftware-confirms-as-sales-jump-to-35-million" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the developers say they’re working on it</a>, and while you can sorta play the game single player, it is clearly not optimized for this experience at all (<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-rings-first-major-patch-sees-fromsoft-belatedly-admit-singleplayer-is-all-sorts-of-unfair-adds-an-auto-resurrect-and-buffs-the-levelling-curve/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">although did tweak it</a>). <em>Nightreign </em>is a prequel that takes place in a hyper-condensed version of Limgrave known as Limveld. Three players are dropped Battle Bus style into the world on ethereal birds, although you do not have much of a choice of where you drop. Each round follows a three night structure: Your team must progress through the world as a shrinking ring of fire (known as Night’s Tide) closes in, quickly defeating hyper condensed versions of bosses and foes mostly recycled from<em> Elden Ring </em>and even the <em>Souls</em> games (although many have been retuned for this game). You do this with two rings over two nights, and on the final night you face off against a new and grandiose boss.</p><figure><figcaption>Yeah sure, just throw The Nameless King from <em>Dark Souls 3</em> in there. Credit: From Software/Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure><p>In an attempt to make this game structure coherent and expedient, <em>Nightreign </em>makes several radical changes. The pace is blisteringly fast. You do not need to get on and off of a mount in the game because you are constantly booking it. Fall damage is eliminated entirely, and you can jump up several sheer cliff faces faster than a goat. Additionally, leveling is simplified by the addition of eight distinct characters, known as Nightfarers, that live in a radically different version of the Roundtable Hold from the original <em>Elden Ring</em>. These characters not only have specific affinities based on how weapons scale, they also have three distinct abilities: a passive ability, a regular skill, and an ultimate.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>I play Ironeye, an archer, who plays entirely differently than an archer in <em>Elden Ring</em>. For starters, arrows are unlimited now and do not need crafting. Ironeye also has the ability to close distances and tag an enemy with a weak point. This completely changes the pace of a ranged character and encourages you to remain at medium distances to be able to reapply the mark. Ironeye’s ranged weapons, counterintuitively, also give him a cleric-like utility as downed allies can be revived by doing them damage, a system that radically speeds up the pace of co-op.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Ironeye, who is the best character, can mark targets or do a sick AoE move where he takes a big ass bow out. Credit: From Software/Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure><p>There are several parts of <em>Nightreign </em>that are either actively abrasive or in conflict with each other. For starters, the game (currently) works best if you are playing with two friends you know, and if you do not have two friends, who you get matched with is the luck of the draw. I have played 24 hours of this game entirely queued with randos, and the experience can be charitably described as “mixed.” Some of this is not their fault: there’s a lot to learn in <em>Nightreign </em>and, like <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em>before it, it’s not particularly good at onboarding you to the experience. For example, did you know that the weapons in your inventory often have passive abilities even when they are not directly equipped? I didn’t for longer than I care to admit.</p><figure><figcaption>The door to a nightlord. Credit: From Software/Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure><p>If you’re lucky, you get queued up with players who know exactly what they are doing and know the quirks of every zone inside and out. Other times you get a couple of people who think they’re solo gods and just go off into the woods and die (as friend and Aftermath contributor Joshua Rivera called them, “<a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/elden-ring-nightreign-review.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a bunch of Yahoos</a>”). Thankfully, I have found the general skill floor of players increased quite a bit after defeating the first boss. But even in ideal conditions, the complexity of what you need to accomplish with randos in the game is limited by the communication the game gives you. Pinging points and items on the map <em>Apex Legends</em> style can never match being on voice chat with all your friends.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Another point of tension is that while the game pace itself is very fast, the rounds themselves are not short. The combo can feel both exhausting and exhilarating, although that also means that, when you get to the end, if you eat shit at any of the bosses of the three days, you have to start from scratch. This is not entirely a bad thing, because when you do finally take a boss out, the rush is fantastic.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Fort....night... Credit: From Software/Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure><p>There are a lot of things that don’t work all the time in <em>Nightreign</em>. It is a confusing game, in part because it goes against much of the original appeal of <em>Elden Ring</em>. <em>Elden Ring</em> was thoughtful and sprawling, a game about exploration and discovery. <em>Nightreign </em>feels like five mods stacked on top of each other. “I would describe the <em>Elden Ring</em> experience as more of a journey, while <em>Nightreign</em>'s experience is more of that on the battlefield," <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/elden-ring-nightreign-director-interview-if-he-can-solo-every-boss-so-can-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">director Junya Ishizaki</a> stated in an interview with CNET. Though it uses the same essential combat and enemies, the experience is paced so differently and the moment to moment goals are so alien that it’s hard to call it the same game. It feels less like <em>Elden Ring </em>and more like a game that is wearing <em>Elden Ring</em> like a skin suit.&nbsp;</p><p>It is fair to ask, “who is <em>Nightreign </em>for?,” and I’m shocked to report that it’s a game for me. I’m happy that <em>Nightreign </em>is a lumpy but interesting game, because FromSoftware was built on those. The FromSoft that existed before Miyazaki started hitting it out of the park was a lot of fun; that’s a history that’s often invisible to a lot of people who got on board around <em>Demon’s Souls </em>or <em>Dark Souls</em>. I am old enough to remember these games outside of the context of a YouTube video essay. Games like <em>Chromehounds, </em>both <em>Otogi</em> games and <em>Metal Wolf Chaos</em> were all genuinely fun<em>.</em> Some obviously did not hit, like <em>Ninja Blade </em>and <em>Eternal Ring</em>. One of my fondest memories of Kotaku was trying to get the Kinect-only <em>Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor </em>to work with Evan Narcisse, and that remains one of the most interesting games that sucks that I’ve ever played.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>We did it lads. Credit: From Software/Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure><p>For all its faults, <em>Nightreign </em>feels like FromSoft is having fun. Its lukewarm reception lets the air out of the room just a tiny bit. Like <em>Dark Souls II, </em>it feels like an excuse to let someone else take the reins on a proven franchise and try to do something new with it; in this case, first-time director Junya Ishizaki. And though the result is a little mixed, the experiments conducted here feel like a wonderful training ground for building talent that will inevitably bear fruit (like how <em>Dark Souls II</em> co-director Yui Tanimura would go on to co-direct <em>Elden Ring</em>). <em>Nightreign </em>is a little lopsided, a tiny bit confusing, alienating to much of its player base, and far more interesting than I expected it to be. In it, you can see the seeds of something beautiful germinating.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dropkickd-etterboxd-wrestling"><h3>Finally, A Letterboxd For Wrestling</h3></a><p>Dropkickd puts criticism and community back in the hands of fans at whatever point of their wrestling journey

The game's Switch 2 Edition has an improved framerate, 4K texture support and a crisper UI, in addition to supporting Switch 2's touchscreen and gyro controls. No Man's Sky will also have multiplayer functionality on Switch 2.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> No Man's Sky Switch 2 Edition Deep Dive Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>"With the original Switch, we were pushing right at the edge of what was possible," explains Hello Games co-founder Sean Murray in the video. "No Man's Sky on Switch 2 is just a huge leap forward. The extra horsepower, it allows us to add full multiplayer for the first time on Switch 2. Cross save and cross play are there from day one, allowing players a seamless experience across devices."</p><p>The Switch 2 Edition is launching at the same time as No Man's Sky's latest free update, Beacon. One of the new additions in Beacon is the creation of robot cities, which Murray notes would have been impossible with the original Switch. He also noted that the Switch 2 version is launching with nine years of No Man's Sky updates and support.</p><p>Players who already have No Man's Sky for Switch can get the Switch 2 upgrade for free. That's unusual because every other Switch 2 Edition has been a paid upgrade. However, some games are getting <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-the-switch-games-and-updates-from-todays-nintendo-direct-available-now/1100-6524364/" data-ref-id="1100-6524364">free Switch 2 updates</a>.</p><p>No Man's Sky Switch 2 Edition will be released on June 5 as one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">launch titles for Nintendo's new system</a>. The previous No Man's Sky update, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-mans-sky-relics-update-lets-you-build-skeletons-from-ancient-bones-however-you-wish/1100-6530383/" data-ref-id="1100-6530383">Relics</a>, allows players to reconstruct skeletons and create unique species from archeological fossil beds. Hello Games added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-mans-sky-finally-has-a-cross-save-feature-with-latest-patch/1100-6527633/" data-ref-id="1100-6527633">cross-save functionality</a> to the game late last year.</p>

                <p>The original Nintendo Switch has long been a popular way to play Fortnite, but the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2's beefier specs</a> will bring the battle royale experience more in line with how it looks and feels on other platforms, with a frame rate and resolution boost at launch, and the promise of mouse controls coming in a later update.</p><p>Epic Games shared details about the Switch 2 version on the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-comes-to-nintendo-switch-2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official Fortnite blog</a>, detailing the major improvements that players will experience after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-free-nintendo-switch-2-game-updates-changes/2900-6591/" data-ref-id="2900-6591">upgrading to the new console</a>. Unsurprisingly, the most significant enhancement is to the game's frame rate--Fortnite will run at 60fps on Switch 2, whereas the game was stuck at 30fps on the original Switch.</p><p>Resolution will also get a major boost, going to 2176x1224 docked and 1600x900 undocked. The Switch 1 version of Fortnite ran at 1560x880 docked and 1170x660 in handheld mode after a 2021 update. Additionally, the Switch 2 iteration of the game will sport "greater view distances," along with higher-quality textures, shadows, and water rendering.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4506873-fortnite-reload-nintendo-switch-2-1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4506873" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4506873-fortnite-reload-nintendo-switch-2-1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4506873"></a><figcaption>Fortnite on Nintendo Switch 2 boasts 60fps gameplay, better draw distance, and increased resolution.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18504982/4506873-fortnite-reload-nintendo-switch-2-1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p>Unlike the Switch 1 version, this release supports the game's Replay system and the console's Capture button. Like many multiplayer titles that will be on Switch 2, Fortnite will support the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-gamechat-feels-better-than-it-looks/1100-6532016/" data-ref-id="1100-6532016">GameChat feature</a>, allowing players to stream their gameplay to three other friends.</p><p>After a patch drops on June 7, players can use one or both of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-that-supports-joy-con-mouse-controls/2900-6517/" data-ref-id="2900-6517">Joy-Con 2 controllers as a mouse</a> in menus and battle royale gameplay--Epic did not list Lego Fortnite, Fortnite Festival, or other non-BR game modes as supporting mouse controls. The only glaring omission on Switch 2 is the Save the World game mode, which was also not purchasable on the original Switch version of Fortnite.</p><p>If Switch 1 owners transfer their data to a Switch 2, they'll have to delete the original "Fortnite for Nintendo Switch" from their console and download the Switch 2 version on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-eshop-looks-so-much-smoother-at-least-so-far/1100-6532069/" data-ref-id="1100-6532069">the reportedly more responsive Nintendo eShop</a>. And as a login bonus, Switch 2 owners will receive a free Wishing Star emote--it's available for free until March 26, 2026.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 hits retailers on June 5--check GameSpot's guide on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-restock-launch-week-buying-guide-major-retailers-walmart-target-best-buy/1100-6531967/" data-ref-id="1100-6531967">Switch 2 restock info</a> if you couldn't snag a preorder.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> might still be lacking an early access release date beyond a vague "2025" window, but that hasn't stopped Unknown Worlds from cranking the hype handling a little harder, with the studio having now shared a few additional details as part of a new video Q&amp;A.
</p>
<p>
Last time around, Unknown Worlds offered a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-shows-off-first-in-game-footage-as-developer-charts-road-to-early-access">first, fleeting look at Subnautica 2 gameplay</a>, but for its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbvNYN76ArQ">latest video update</a>, creative producer Scott MacDonald and community manager Donya Abramo tackled a couple of burning fan questions. Admittedly, most of them ended with 'not yet', 'maybe at some point', and 'no', but there were still a couple of facts to glean.

Perhaps the most notable tidbit came in form of confirmation that Subnautica 2 will ditch the controversially chatty protagonist of 2021's standalone expansion Below Zero and return to the silent protagonist approach of the first game, although that doesn't mean other characters won't be voiced. The decision accompanies the introduction of customisable characters, with players able to select from a handful of pre-designed protagonists before diving in. Unknown Worlds notes there'll potentially be some further "freedom to express yourself as your character", but whatever that means, it won't be util after early access launch.

<p>
As for the world of Subnautica 2, it's set on a brand-new ocean planet promising "all-new mysteries, creatures, and experiences", and Unknown Worlds says it's aiming for the game to be the "biggest and most exciting" series entry "ever" when it hits 1.0 in a few years time. It isn't, however, exactly sure "how big and how deep [players will] be able to go over the course of early access", but says the initial early access launch map will be more sizeable than those of the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> and Below Zero at a comparative time.
</p>
<p>
And a vast new underwater world to explore means vehicles. Unfortunately for fans of the Cyclops, Seamoth, and even the Sea Truck seen in earlier games, none of those are returning for the sequel. However, Unknown Worlds says new vehicles are coming - including a big sub scheduled to arrive later in early access - that'll be "designed in the same spirit [as their predecessors], just more suited to the brand-new environment they need to navigate". Additionally, "some of your favourite tools [will return], but improved", and base building is set to offer "more customisation than ever before".
</p>
<p>
What else? The studio stresses that, despite supporting co-op for up to four players, Subnautica 2 is being designed as a solo experience first. That means it should retain the sense of "isolation and terror" that made the original such a winner, although the studio readily admits it "won't really be able to protect" that atmosphere if players opt to bring friends along for the ride. Sadly, there's no local split-screen option for those wanting to cuddlefish up on the couch, but cross-play is supported between Xbox and PC platforms, and as for proximity chat, that's currently being 'investigated'. VR support isn't on the cards at present, however.
</p>
<p>
And all of that brings us back to the big question of a release date, but Unknown Words says it's "not quite ready to share one just yet". Nor is it talking platforms beyond PC and Xbox, only teasing Subnautica 2 will hit other machines "when the time is right". It is, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-gets-first-trailer-and-its-launching-into-early-access-next-year">still scheduled for a 2025 release</a>, and will be available as part of Game Pass on day one.

			<p>Another video game to film adaptation has been announced, and this time it's horror movie powerhouse production company Blumhouse announcing that it is collaborating with Kinetic Games to make a Phasmophobia movie.</p>
<p>The news was announced with a<a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-film-adaptation-blumhouse"> blog post from Kinetic Games</a>, with the studio's director Daniel Knight saying he is "<em>thrilled</em>" for Kinetic Games to be working with Blumhouse and James Wan's production company, Atomic Monster, on this project.</p>
<p>"<em>We're thrilled to officially announce that a Phasomphobia film adaptation is in development - it's a big moment for the whole Kinetic team, and the start of something really exciting</em>," said Knight.</p>
<p>"<em>We never could've imagined the incredible heights this game would reach when it launched five years ago, and we're so thankful to our amazing community for the lasting impact Phasmophobia has had in the gaming space and beyond. Working with Blumhouse and Atomic Monster marks an incredible new chapter for the game, and we can't wait to share more as the project develops</em>."</p>
<p>No directors, writers, or cast members have been attached to the film so far, but in the same way that <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-announces-project-007-officially-called-007-first-light-full-game-reveal-coming-this-week/">IO Interactive making a James Bond game is a match made in heaven</a>, so is Blumhouse and Atomic Monster taking on any film adaptation of a horror video game, including Phasmophobia. Hopefully, we'll hear more about the film soon.</p>

Before The Verge, he wrote about comic books, labor, race, and more at io9 and Gizmodo for almost five years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/fortnite/679077/epic-games-fortnite-creators-ai-npcs-darth-vader"><em>Fortnite</em></a> is coming to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/676901/nintendo-switch-2-launch-here">the Switch 2</a> with some massive visual improvements and new features that are going to make it feel like a new game for the Nintendo crowd.</p><p>While we knew that <em>Fortnite </em>would be playable on the Switch 2 at launch, today <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-comes-to-nintendo-switch-2">Epic announced</a> all of the new features that are being incorporated into the game via an update. After years of maxing out at 30 fps on the original Switch, <em>Fortnite </em>will now run at 60fps on the Switch 2. The game is also getting a resolution bump to 2176x1224 when docked and 1600x900 when undocked (up from 1560x880 docked / 1170x660 undocked). Draw distance, textures, shadows, and water rendering are also getting an overall quality boost that will make the game more crisp.</p><p>And on the newer side of things, <em>Fortnite </em>is also launching support for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">the Switch 2’s GameChat feature</a> as well as support for the console’s Joy-Con 2 mouse controls. While Epic has already pushed the <em>Fortnite </em>update for folks who have gotten their hands on the Switch, support for mouse controls — which work in Battle Royale, Zero Build, Team Rumble, Reload, and Fortnite OG — isn’t set to launch until June 7th. June 7th also just so happens to be the day when <em>Fortnite</em>’s ongoing <em>Star Wars</em>-themed season comes to an end with the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/death-star-sabotage-on-june-7-the-fortnite-live-event-concluding-galactic-battle">Death Star Sabotage live</a> event, which is probably going to look at lot better on the Switch 2 compared to its predecessor.</p><p>All of this might not seem too special to people who have been playing <em>Fortnite </em>on other consoles, but it truly cannot be stressed enough how <em>not great </em>the game has looked on the Switch in the past. Mouse controls aside, these updates might not change gameplay all that much, but they’re going to make squadding up a much, much more enjoyable experience.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That download turned out to be the first chapter of a new game, Deltarune, the name of which is an anagram for Undertale. After a cryptic introduction, the player controls a teenager named Kris who, with their school bully Susie, is dropped into a mysterious Dark World and tasked with saving its citizens by a goat-child named Ralsei.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Deltarune's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-chapter-2-release-date-this-week-pc-mac">second chapter manifested in 2021</a>, revealing something like an adventure-of-the-week format where Kris and Susie repeatedly visit the Dark World in each chapter, meet a new villain, defeat them alongside Ralsei, and return home. In total, the game is expected to have at least seven total chapters, and we've known three and four were coming today <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-are-launching-alongside-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-june">since Fox announced it in April.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deltarune, like Undertale, is a turn-based RPG with bullet hell mechanics, and features a cast of both new and returning characters from its predecessor. However, its connection to Undertale itself is mysterious — the characters themselves have key differences from their Undertale versions, no one seems aware of the events of Undertale, and yet the game frequently winks and nods to Undertale's events in a way that players of both will recognize, even if its in-universe cast doesn't.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the game itself is beloved for its zany humor, lovable characters, unique combat, and fantastic soundtrack, much of what fuels the nearly-rabid online interest is related to the mystery of what, precisely, Deltarune <em>is</em>, and how it will ultimately connect with or solve some of the latent mysteries of Undertale.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of this writing, Deltarune already has over 100,000 players on Steam and is the 10th most-played game on Valve's platform. It's already surpassed the peak Steam player count of the free Deltarune Chapter 1 and 2 demo, despite costing $25. It's the top-selling game on Steam right now by revenue, ahead of the likes of Counter-Strike 2, Elden Ring: Nightreign, and Dune: Awakening. But its true popularity will be much bigger, given Deltarune is also out on PlayStation 4 and 5, and Xbox Series consoles now, and its Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 versions launch tonight at midnight when the Switch 2 officially releases.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <p>The not-E3 week is about to begin as Sony readies a PlayStation State of Play broadcast for 10pm UK time (11pm CEST / 2pm PT / 5pm ET) tonight. We'll cover the broadcast live right here, reporting the major talking points in case you're out walking the dog or stuck somewhere else, and you can also - hi regulars! - assemble in the comments to watch along and chat with us.</p>
<p>What do we expect to see? Sony hasn't said much. We know the broadcast will be an enigmatic "40+" minutes long, but Sony hasn't mentioned anything about content beyond "the show highlights a selection of great games from creators across the globe", which isn't very helpful. But it does leave us free to speculate.</p>
<p>Fairly safe bets include seeing gameplay for the October-bound samurai sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a>, as well as something from Kojima's baby-powered walking game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, although note that there will be a separate Death Stranding 2 showcase this Sunday, 8th June.</p>
<p>We're hopeful of seeing more of the Wolverine game made by Spider-Man dev Insomniac, we've seen some rumours swirling about a possible 2.5D God of War game, and there are the perennial calls for a remake of Bloodborne. Will our dreams finally come true?</p>
<p>Also, Donlan would like a new Ape Escape game. Thanks.</p>
<p>Summer Games Fest gets into full swing as we approach the weekend. The opening broadcast will happen on Friday night and there's a busy weekend of shows to follow. Our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams">Summer Games Fest 2025 hub</a> has all the times and dates you'll need.</p><figure>

			<p>Ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-mmorpg-to-hold-limited-time-steam-cbt-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first PC Closed Beta Test</a> for the upcoming fantasy MMORPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-dev-diary-provides-the-first-in-depth-look-at-its-features-and-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chrono Odyssey</a>, we were able to send a few questions to Chrono Studio to learn a bit more about the game's features. You can read the entirety of the interview below. As a reminder, the CBT will take place later this month, and you can still sign up for it directly <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2873440/Chrono_Odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the game's Steam page</a>.</p>
<p>The game does not have a full release date yet, but we know it will be available on PC and consoles.</p>

<p><strong>As far as we can see, the game's main twist is the Chronotector. What can you tell us about its concept and usage in the game? Will it be available in PvP, too?</strong></p>
<p>The Chronotector allows players to manipulate time and space—slowing down enemies or reverting parts of the environment to a previous state. While its use is partially restricted in PvP to maintain fairness, it still plays a key role in strategic map control and as a tactical tool for escape or repositioning.</p>
<p><strong>Can you discuss character progression in Chrono Odyssey? Will there be skill trees, respeccing? What about multi-classing?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we offer a detailed skill tree along with the ability to respec skills. While Chrono Odyssey does not feature a full multiclass system, players can freely switch between various weapon types, each supporting distinct playstyles. This allows for a high degree of flexibility and personalization in how players approach combat.</p>
<p><strong>How many weapons will be available in the beta? And what about the final game? Are there any class restrictions?</strong></p>
<p>In the beta, three classes will be available, and each class can wield three different weapon types. Weapons are designed to be freely chosen by the player, allowing for the development of hybrid playstyles that suit individual preferences and strategies.</p>
<p><strong>What can you tell us about Chrono Odyssey's open world? Are there any dynamic events that will freshen up the experience?</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. The world of Setera features dynamic weather, time-based events, and region-specific bosses that appear depending on player activity and the in-game time cycle. Even when exploring the same area, players will encounter different experiences depending on the circumstances, ensuring that the world always feels alive and ever-changing.</p>
<p><strong>Can you share how group dungeons and PvE raids will work in the game? Are these staples of your PvE endgame plan?</strong></p>
<p>Dungeons and raids are core components of Chrono Odyssey’s PvE content. Designed as endgame challenges, they feature intense boss battles and offer some of the most rewarding progression-based loot. These encounters demand strategic cooperation, making them a central part of the game's long-term experience.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of PvP content can players expect to see in Chrono Odyssey?</strong></p>
<p>In this CBT, the available PvP content will be limited to 1v1 duels initiated by player choice and open-field PvP between characters who have enabled PvP mode. However, we are actively developing additional PvP-focused features, including open conflict zones and PvPvE battlefield content where players will compete over specific objectives while also contending with environmental threats. We look forward to introducing these features through our official channels in the near future.</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to have several Closed Beta Tests before the full launch? If so, will there be a long wait between CBTs?</strong></p>
<p>We plan to conduct multiple closed beta tests, with each CBT followed by meaningful improvements and content updates. Our goal is to gather valuable feedback at every stage and steadily refine the game to deliver the best possible experience at launch.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <p>A game that sees you forcibly kidnapped, smuggled aboard a mega yacht dubbed The Avarice, and made to play demon billionaires at lethal dice poker just got a new trailer, and it looks as funky as you’d expect. Dead Finger Dice: A Billionaire Killing Game is its uber-snappy name, and it’s coming to Steam this summer.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/spooky-cyberpunk-mystery-psychroma-looks-like-detention-meets-observer">Psychroma</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/raptor-boyfriend-is-a-rare-coming-of-age-story-that-actually-respects-teenagers">Raptor Boyfriend</a> developers Rocket Adrift Games released a trailer for this roguelike dice builder as part of yesterday’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hyRhu8kWv2E">The Mix showcase</a>, and as soon as I clapped my eyes on it, I was intrigued.</p>

<p>The big boat of these bad money creatures is rendered in a “grungy 1-bit aesthetic”. Aboard, you’ll be treated to an experience that looks quite <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a>-ish except with dice instead of cards, and a lot more severing of fingers. Yep, you bet one of your digits each round, and if your five dice don’t boast the highest poker hand after three re-rolls, the demon billionaire you’re playing against gets to chuckle as you lose an appendage.</p>
<p>The first of you to be separated from all of your feelers loses the game and suffers a lethal punishment. In your case, being lobbed overboard in what’s a rather wet end to that particular run. Every failed run adds to the game’s “body count”, and you play as a new character every time, though with an option to pass useful items between runs via the “hidden compartment of your cell”.</p>
<p>You’ll need to craft custom dice with “demonically sealed special abilities” using your poker winnings as you strive to beat the game’s five bosses, as well as making use of charms and curses you unlock.</p>
<p>Also, Dead Finger Dice’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3512300/Dead_Finger_Dice_A_Billionaire_Killing_Game/">Steam page</a> notes that it features “class consciousness”, a “revolutionary body count”, and is “completely human-made” via its developers’ own fingers. Cool, the Che Guevara of deck builders that use dice. It’s got me convinced, even if I’ve spent about 6 million less hours with Balatro than most other people seem to have.</p>
<p>Hey, I’ve had fun with what I have played of it, don’t come for me joker mafia. Dead Finger Dice is set to drop on on Steam in Summer 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Epic also confirmed that <em>Fortnite</em> on Switch 2 will boast a higher resolution in both docked and undocked play, as well as a significantly improved draw distance, allowing players to see more detail from further away. And clothing will now have physics, something seen in the other versions of <em>Fortnite </em>on Xbox, PS5, and PC.</p><figure id="" data-id="042c57312168ce7f0b3d934a535bf03f" data-recommend-id="image://042c57312168ce7f0b3d934a535bf03f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Fortnite running on a Switch 2.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Players will need to download the Switch 2 port of <em>Fortnite</em>. Epic says if you do a console transfer from Switch to Switch 2, you’ll need to delete the old port of <em>Fortnite</em>, download the new version, and log in. Then all your skins and goodies should be waiting for you. </p><p>Epic also says that <em>Fortnite </em>will support mouse controls on Switch 2 via the console’s advanced Joy-Cons. All modes in <em>Fortnite</em>, including Battle Royale, will support mouse controls on Switch 2. The new port works with the Switch 2's capture button and GameChat system, letting you stream your game while chatting with friends.</p><p>And for you super nerds out there, like myself, Epic shared a few more techy details about the new port: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>For the hardcore tech folks: full “desktop” renderer, high-detail geometry, distance field ambient occlusion in docked mode, shadow casting point lights, high-quality effects.</p></blockquote><p>All in all, it seems like the Switch 2 port of <em>Fortnite </em>will be a comparable experience to playing on PS4 Pro or Xbox Series S, though it won’t be as graphically advanced as the PS5, PS5 Pro, PC, or Xbox Series X ports of the popular game. Still, it’s nice that Nintendo players will have a better way to play <em>Fortnite </em>in the near future, assuming they can get their hands on a Switch 2 when it launches on June 5. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
