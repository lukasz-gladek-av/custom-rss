<p>Black Myth: Wukong has been on the market for a couple of weeks and remains popular enough, even if it’s taking a while to succeed in countries <strong>other than </strong>China. In recent data published by VG Insights, it was estimated that 76% of all players hail from China, while just 6% are in the United States.</p>



<p>That hasn’t stopped the game from succeeding financially, though. The same data aggregate platform has estimated that Black Myth: Wukong has exceeded $880 million in gross revenue on Steam, having sold more than 18 million copies since being released on August 20.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-numbers">Big Numbers</h2>



<p>It’s very easy to get data from Steam, and that’s why it’s commonly used as a representative platform to gauge the interest or performance of any given game. For Black Myth: Wukong, the data taken from Steam speaks volumes, <a href="https://vginsights.com/game/black-myth-wukong" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with VG Insights claiming</a> the game has made almost $1 billion in gross revenue since being released.</p>



<p>In further statistics, it was estimated that the average playtime is floating around 31.9 hours. On the leaderboard, Black Myth: Wukong continues to perform remarkably well, sitting at around 645,000 concurrent players at the time of writing, a stunning number for a single-player title two weeks after launch.</p>



<p>It’ll be quite some time before Black Myth: Wukong starts fading, especially at Game Science, the game’s developer, seems intent on releasing DLC and perhaps even a sequel.</p>



<p>Have you played Black Myth: Wukong yet?</p>

Space Marines 2 supports cross-play, with some limitations, and cross-save options for those who opt in. Here's how it works.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Cross-Play</h2><p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/68-august-community-update" rel="nofollow ">community update</a> by Focus Entertainment details how cross-play works. In a nutshell, full cross-play will be supported on day one for all platforms. Both PC and console players will be able to join one another in a lobby whenever they want to play the campaign or PvE missions. There are some limits to PvP, which should help keep things competitive. Those playing on PC will only be able to play against other PC players, while those on console will only be able to play against other console players. If players want to game with people only on the same platform as them, they can also turn off cross-play at any given moment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/sniper-elite-resistance-preview-stealth-action-comfort-food/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>For once, Karl Fairburne has given up the spotlight for the Sniper Elite series, passing the baton over to his long-time shadow and understudy, Harry Hawker. You might be wondering who on Earth this Harry fellow is, especially if I told you that he’d actually featured in Sniper Elite <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/06/26/sniper-elite-3-review/">3</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/02/13/sniper-elite-4-review/">4</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/25/sniper-elite-5-review/">5</a>. Didn’t spot him there? Well, you might have been playing solo, as Harry has been the co-op player’s silent avatar for all those games. Now he’s found his voice though –&nbsp;which happens to be a talking bucket of gravel –&nbsp;and has gone behind enemy lines to fight alongside the French Resistance in Nazi Occupied France.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sniper Elite: Resistance - Reveal Trailer | Xbox Game Pass, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, PS5 &amp; PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_HiIzU5yWGg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s yet another German Wunderwaffe in development, and Harry has to team up with the French Resistance to sniff out the clues that lead to the weapon and destroy it. Our hands on with the game took us to the walled city of St. Raymond, the HQ of German military intelligence, and where the Resistance informant known as ‘Vertigo’ has seemingly gone into hiding after Gestapo flood the city. Throw in a few bonus objectives, like taking down targets on a kill list, and there’s a good bit to do while you’re in town.</p>


<p>What’s immediately clear is that Sniper Elite: Resistance is sticking to and subtly evolving the formula that’s been so successful through Sniper Elite 4 and 5. This is a large open sandbox that’s crawling with enemies on patrol cars and bike travelling back and forth, and snipers watching from the rooftops.</p>
<p>You have to sneak your way through this vipers’ nest, avoiding the attention of patrolling guards, timing your takedowns, and gradually working your way through to objective points on the map. In this case, it was investigating the dead drop site in the city’s cathedral, trying to get into Vertigo’s flat to search for clues the Gestapo might have missed, and hopefully manage to find their hiding spot to help them get out. It’s a pleasingly dense level with plenty of buildings to duck into, a secret tunnel network that cuts between the cellars of several locations, and plenty of vantage points to camp out on.</p>


<p>Most players will certainly try to be as quiet as possible, relying on takedowns of isolated soldiers, and falling back on the trusty Welrod, before using the noise cover of tampered-with engines or the church bells to get off some choice sniper shots without being located.</p>
<p>But it’s oh so tempting sometimes to just go loud and try to blast your way through. That can be firing down from a vantage point, having placed traps behind to cover your back, or frantic squirts of SMG fire and timing the active reloads as enemies congregate on your location, and you then try to evade and get somewhere to hide until things calm the heck down. Enemy awareness is clearly marked on the minimap in the standard difficulty, and you’ve got a lot of flexibility to mark and track soldiers and Gestapo that you spot ambling around.</p>
<p>The sniping mechanics are still on point, with varying effects to factor in, depending on the difficulty level you’ve set. You can set a scope to different ranges, to help with targeting at long distance, and there’s always the crutch of the held breath focus mode to slow time and display the bullet drop for you. It’s as satisfying as ever to hit a target from halfway across the map, triggering the series’ iconic X-ray kill cam in the process. This is as broad as it’s ever been, now with the ability for bullets to deflect off bones, and the kill cam able to be triggered with SMG and pistol shots.</p>

<p>There’s plenty of other features that we didn’t really manage to explore during our time with the game, such as the returning rifle customisation –&nbsp;you can find workbenches around the map if you want a mid-mission switch up –&nbsp;and there will be the returning Axis Invasion mode, which lets another player step into the role of an Axis sniper to try and hunt you down through the mission. You’ll also be able to play the full campaign in co-op, and I really hope Rebellion is using Karl’s character model to be the buddy backup.</p>
<p>There’s also further adventures to find with propaganda posters that will trigger new scenarios, putting you in the shoes of French Resistance fighters in a time-sensitive objective.</p>
<p>Sniper Elite has become a bit like stealth action comfort food over the past decade, having really settled into the sandbox levels and mission structure in the last few games. Sniper Elite: Resistance isn’t looking to revolutionise the series, but give a new campaign, a few new twists and tweaks to the formula, and just let you settle in with a nice glass of red – to go with all the red you spill in-game.</p>

			<p>Black Myth: Wukong is quickly becoming one of the most successful video game launches of recent times. In just two weeks, the action role-playing game by Game Science has sold almost 20 million copies.</p>
<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-05/investor-who-risked-it-all-on-wukong-scores-another-sales-win?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a> confirmed the game sold 18 million copies in just two weeks of availability, making it one of the fastest selling games ever released, quickly outselling in its initial spurt more popular games from established studios and franchises released in recent times. Daniel Wu from Hero Games, the biggest external shareholder in creator Game Science who stuck with it through the years, also confirmed that it won't take long to see what's next for the series, as an expansion is in development, something we already heard some whispers about <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-dlc-expansions/">earlier this week</a>. Augmented by the release of the expansion, the game should have no trouble hitting 30 million sales over its lifetime, according to Wu.</p>
<p>Considering Black Myth: Wukong has only been released on PC and PlayStation 5 so far, sales should see an increase with the launch of the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S version if it is launched before the expansion. Unfortunately, it is not yet known when this version of the game will be released. <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-xbox-memory-leak/">Last month</a>, we heard the game was delayed indefinitely on the consoles due to some technical issues, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-delay-has-nothing-to-do-with-xbox-limitations-says-microsoft/">a recent statement from Microsoft</a> suggests there could be some sort of PlayStation 5 exclusivity agreement in the way.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the game by checking out my review.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/romancing-saga-2-revenge-of-the-seven-gamescom-hands-on-preview/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The SaGa series is far from being the most popular JRPG series ever, but it has managed, over the years, to garner a cult following thanks to its unique features that set it apart from the vast majority of JRPGs, such as unique progression mechanics, and open-ended scenarios closer to traditional role-playing games developed in the West. Despite the lack of widespread recognition and success, the series has continued, and Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven could be the breakthrough the series by Akitoshi Kawazu has been seeking since its inception in 1989, thanks to some choice improvements to the formula.</p>
<p>Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven is the remake of the second entry in the Romancing subseries series originally released back in 1993 on the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. Developed by Xeen Inc., the same studio behind Trials of Mana, the game shares a lot of its visual identity with the remake of the third entry in the Mana series, with a distinct anime feel that breathes new life into the game's world. As such, the game clicked almost instantly with me when I tried it during Gamescom 2024, being a long-time fan of the series who kinda drifted away from it when the franchise started experimenting with different types of visual styles with games such as Unlimited SaGa.</p>
<p>The Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven Gamescom demo, while short, definitely rekindled my interest in the franchise. Controlling Prince Gerard, the second in line to the throne of Varennes, I defended the city of Avalon from a monster invasion together with other companions and moved the first step towards an epic confrontation between the Imperial line of Varennes and the Seven Heroes of ancient myth. With the gorgeous 3D recreation of all of the original game's characters and location and full voice acting for all characters, this epic confrontation will only become even more epic.</p>

<p>The pleasing visuals are not the only reason I feel the release of Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven could be a pivotal moment for the series. At its heart, the game is still a SaGa game featuring its unique progression system that enhances characters depending on what they do in battle, but some of the aspects that made it feel unrewarding, and even a little bit random in past entries in the series have been considerably improved. After each battle, each character's earned Technique Points for HP, BP, and combat schools are shown in the results screen, providing players with solid information on their characters' progression. The Glimmer system, another staple of the series, received similar improvements, as now the combat menu shows which skill can be used to learn new ones and how close a character is to learning a new skill.</p>
<p>As if these improvements weren't enough, Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven goes deeper in the combat mechanics, with a huge number of classes with different weapon and elemental aptitudes, a Formations system that provides benefits depending on the party composition, and Unite Attacks which allow multiple characters to attack an enemy in quick succession for increased damage. Those who achieve mastery of all the combat mechanics will also be able to put their skills to the test with the multiple difficulty settings available from the very beginning of the adventure. Combined together, all of these mechanics make for an extremely enjoyable combat experience that doesn't stray too far from what the series has offered so far but go a long way to improve it considerably.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven Gamescom 2024 demo was too short to delve deeper into the game's free-form scenario, but if everything I have experienced is of any indication, the game has the chance of becoming one of the best JRPGs released in recent years. Thankfully, it won't take much longer to see if Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven will be able to deliver a truly compelling experience, as the game launches on October 24th on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/romancing-saga-2-revenge-of-seven-preview-next-generation</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/romancing-saga-2-revenge-of-the-seven-preview-the-next-generation.972672/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/romancing-saga-2-revenge-of-seven-preview-next-generation<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'll be the first to admit I know next to nothing about<em> </em>the series, but that mystery is what makes <em>Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven </em>all the more interesting to me. Why? Well, it might be the best RPG we're getting all year, based on my playtime with it during an off-site PAX West 2024 event.</p>
<p>That's high praise, considering I've devoured most of the other big-name JRPGs of 2024. That includes the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-review-id-explain-but-i-dont-think-i-can"><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></a>, <em>Persona 3 Reload</em>, and <em>Unicorn Overlord</em>. <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> isn't messing around this this one, folks.</p>

<h2><em>Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven</em>'s Generational Knowledge</h2>
<p>There's one main concept in <em>Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven </em>I am absolutely enamored about. I want to learn more about it, and I only got a small taste of it in this demo. That is the idea that the knowledge and abilities from your characters are passed down to the next generation, all in effort to vanquish a great enemy.</p>
<p>Just as <em>Romancing SaGa 2</em>'s Steam page says, this fight will last for thousands of years. Your aim is to destroy the Seven Heroes -- rest assured, they are now quite evil and deserve what's coming to them. But to deliver them their just deserts, it will be a long and arduous conflict, indeed.</p>

<p>You play as a ruler, and you will head the conflict to vanquish your foes. My demo begins near what is presumably the start of this journey, with the empire's capital falling under attack by a bunch of goblins. These goblins are no match for your party of heroes -- heroes that will pave the way to victory, no matter how many years it may take.</p>
<p>I'm getting a little carried away with my descriptions here, but that's just because I'm so excited to see how passing along generation to generation plays out. I loved this very concept in various <em>Fire Emblem </em>games, and <em>Romancing SaGa 2 </em>seems to take this a step further. Though, let's not forget, this is a remake of a very old title!</p>

<h2>Some Good ol' Fashioned Turn-based Combat in <em>Romancing SaGa 2: Revenge of the Seven</em></h2>
<p>Of course, you'll only gain the knowledge to defeat the Seven Heroes by engaging in various conflicts, so these goblins serve as a good start. While <em>Romancing SaGa 2</em>'s combat is relatively straightforward to begin with, you soon get a feeling that this it's building to something greater.</p>
<p>Early on, this "building to something greater" element is most prevalent in the Glimmer system. This is a way in which units learn new abilities. A lightbulb icon is noted next to certain abilities, and if you keep using them, you might "Glimmer" and learn a brand new ability. It's a nice little dose of dopamine to learn a new, more powerful attack in the middle of combat.</p>

<p>We dispatch the goblins in the capital easily enough, but the next part of the demo takes us to a cave full of goblins and other creatures. Dungeon-crawling is one aspect to <em>Romancing SaGa 2</em>, and it plays out like <em>Persona 3 Reload </em>or <em>Persona 5</em>, for example. Enemies are in the overworld, you can sneak attack them for an advantage, and turn-based battle ensues.</p>
<p>Combat flows smooth and fast, meaning no conflict should last too long. Your characters have various weapon types and elemental spells, which exploit the weaknesses of enemies. Again, it's standard JRPG mechanics with turn orders, the ability to defend and more, but it's all very polished.</p>

<p>It's worth a mention, the ability to build your characters seem pretty versatile, as were my choices of companions. Building your party is going to be a lot of fun, especially considering the various formations you can use. These pre-made formations put party members in a certain position in order to gain the upper hand.</p>
<p>Some formations give you a strong frontline and protect a weaker party member in the back, while others put one strong member at the front. You'll get stat increases or decreases to stats like speed, depending on your formation. Use what's proper for the situation at hand. As a tactics nerd, I can't wait to see how these play out.</p>
<p>We eventually conquer the dungeon, but not without a bit of struggle. Again, exploiting the weakness of enemies is key, and that's something that will most definitely be important later on if the later dungeon I played is any indication.</p>


<p>The second dungeon skips a generation. The main character of the first part of the demo is now a young woman, rather than a man. I have a party full of unfamiliar heroes, and all of them are much more powerful than the last party. Generational knowledge truly is powerful!</p>
<p>This second dungeon takes place within an underwater, sunken area. There's a shipwreck, various sea creatures, and waiting at the end of it all is one of the Seven Heroes. By this point in the demo, one of the Heroes has been vanquished, but six more remain.</p>
<p>Fighting past skeletons and other creatures in a gorgeous and colorful underwater environment, I reach the boss at the end. I was clearly in over my head, as this tentacled monstrosity of a man named Subier emerges from the depths. This is one of the Seven Heroes!</p>

<p>And he gives my party a right proper thrashing. Either I wasn't exploiting his weaknesses well enough, or this was the end of the road for one generation of characters. After all, <em>Romancing SaGa 2</em> will span many year and battles, and not all of it will be successful.</p>
<p>I'm itching to get back into the fight. I want to put an end to Subier, but more than anything else, I want to see just how far this generation system can go. The tight turn-based gameplay and excellent visuals are also nice to have. Like me, this will likely be the first <em>SaGa </em>game for many players, and what an impression it's made so far.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s third enemy faction is maybe definitely possibly probably almost certainly about to be released, as players report sightings of the mysterious menace on the game's Galactic War map. Development studio Arrowhead, aka the glorious government of Super Earth, are downplaying the rumours as usual. They're claiming (via in-game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/s">broadcast</a>) that the fleeting appearance of a weird purple blob on the map screen is actually the result of fluids leaking from the corpse of a long-dead comms technician, stranded on a server farm somewhere. Who to believe? Ah, if only we had some means of shedding light on the reports. Some way of Illuminating the situation.</p><!--more-->
<p>In case you didn't play the original Helldivers and therefore didn't get that reference, Helldivers 2's third faction are pretty much guaranteed to be the Illuminate, a returning armada of evil squidlikes with Tesla beams and cloaking devices and tripod mechas. The trail of evidence for this begins with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-updates-could-bring-back-the-first-games-sneaky-teleporting-illuminate-faction">an in-game broadcast about Illuminate sightings back in February</a>, which Arrowhead/Super Earth described as the "work of dissidents". Arrowhead have also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-cutting-edge-warbond-is-out-sparking-fresh-debate-about-the-illuminates-faction">added weapons to the game</a>  which seem designed with Illuminate biology in mind. And then there was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-major-order-turns-planet-into-black-hole-as-rumours-of-returning-illuminate-faction-intensify">that Major Order</a> which resulted in the creation of what lore-divers speculate may be a wormhole to whichever dire dimension the Illuminate currently hail from. </p>
<p>To all this, add a brace of "leaked" character models and in-game sightings of uncertain provenance. The purple blob on the Galactic War map (which is adorned with the Illuminate iconography of a circle within a circle) seems like it'd be easier to fabricate than actual enemy models - I've just had a look and it's not showing up in my game. But then again, Arrowhead <em>have</em> officially acknowledged it, with Arrowhead's CEO Shams Jorjani describing it on <a href="https://x.com/ShamsJorjani/status/1831310588238037302">Xitter</a> as "fake news".</p>
<p>I haven't played Helldivers 2 for a while, mostly for the usual reason that like certain species of shark, my journalist brain has to keep swimming forward or suffocate, but also because I tend to play solo, and there's a point after which that ceases to be much fun due to the difficulty. I'm also getting a bit weary of the Illuminate teasing, which is why we haven't covered certain other recent hints and rumours - it's not quite Winds-of-Winter-level delayed gratification but it's getting a bit old.</p>
<p>In other news, Arrowhead recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arrowhead-emerge-with-a-bullet-pointed-peace-offering-to-pacify-mutinous-helldivers-2-players">announced a new approach to balancing Helldivers 2</a> after one particular update upset players so much they started letting the Automatons win. Are you playing much at the minute?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>PlayStation maker Sony doesn't have enough original franchises which it has "fostered from the beginning".</p>
<p>That's according to Sony chief financial officer Hiroki Totoki, who in the same week PlayStation announced it was pulling Concord from sale told the <a href="https://www.removepaywall.com/search?url=https://www.ft.com/content/307f7a2e-a755-4f6e-badc-9bc119f185df">Financial Times</a>: "We're lacking the early phase (of IP) and that's an issue for us."</p>

<p>"One thing that you need is IP, that is step one," Jefferies analyst Atul Goyal added in the same article. "And if you don't start creating or buying in those that do, then the risk is someone else will do it. So the risk is not doing anything."</p>
<p>Totoki was referring to Sony generally, with films and anime also a consideration along with the company's gaming sector. The exec went on to say Sony is typically better at finding an audience for content that's already become popular in its home market.</p>
<p>However, his words do draw attention to that aforementioned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">Concord shut down</a>. The game was available for less than two weeks, before the company decided it needed to reevaluate its new franchise's place on the market.</p>
<p>In a post earlier this week, Sony and developer Firewalk said Concord would be taken offline indefinitely, so the team could "determine the best path ahead" and "explore options, including those that will better reach our players".</p>
<p>At the same time, PlayStation is about to release one of its most anticipated games of the year: Astro Bot.</p>
<p>This game itself is an homage to the company's franchise history, and laced with nostalgia. Bots from Sony's games such as The Last of Us' Ellie and Joel, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-will-feature-over-150-iconic-playstation-inspired-cameos">Uncharted's Nathan Drake, Horizon's Aloy</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-cameos-with-more-cartoony-appearances-will-wear-masks-as-sometimes-led-eyes-just-didnt-work">Crash Bandicoot</a> are all confirmed to be included in the forthcoming platformer.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Over the years, Path of Exile has become a solid action role-playing game, as developer Grinding Gear Games has done everything it could to listen to players' feedback and improve their game as much as possible. Its sequel, Path of Exile 2, seems to be going in a similar direction, addressing the remaining issues that couldn't be addressed in the now-dated original to provide players with a hardcore action role-playing game experience that could potentially rival that of the more popular Diablo series.</p>
<p>During Gamescom 2024, I had the chance to try out the first 30 minutes or so of Path of Exile 2, as well as attend a presentation that showcased some more advanced mechanics and new features, such as a new crossbow weapon type, complete with multiple ammo types that almost turns the experience in a top-down shooter. The mechanical complexity seen in the original was in full show during the presentation, including the extensive skill customization options the series is known for, which, for someone with only passing knowledge of the original, felt almost overwhelming. Still, I definitely appreciated how much control players are given over their characters, and I can't wait to delve deeper into these complex systems.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Path-of-Exile-2-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Things went considerably better with the Path of Exile 2 hands-on demo, which, as mentioned above, starts right from the beginning of the game. After picking the Warrior as my class, I made my way through a creepy location featuring a lot of different enemies, with contextual tutorials popping out every time a new mechanic was introduced, which I found to be a very welcome addition that should help newcomers understand the basics of the game and the genre as a whole. Before long, I learned the first few skills of the class, which provided a better look at what the Warrior is good at doing: smashing, breaking, and stunning enemies. Eventually, I fought a powerful boss called The Devourer, a worm-like enemy with a varied moveset that forced me to stay on my toes to avoid getting poisoned. Even with a limited skillset available, it was clear how skills synergize well with one another, and with the massive customization options granted by the game, I can see it featuring tons of viable combos and builds. After a lot of dodging and a lot of smashing, I was able to defeat The Devourer and his minions, feeling rather satisfied and hungering to experience more.</p>
<p>30 minutes or so is a very short time for a game like Path of Exile 2, but my hands-on session definitely left a very good impression. Thankfully, fans of the series won't have to wait much longer to get their first taste of this epic experience, as the game will launch in Early Access on November 15th, featuring 30 hours of content that will be expanded over time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-is-wb-games-biggest-priority-but-itll-take-a-couple-of-years/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Warner Bros Discovery CFO Gunnar Wiedenfels briefly discussed Hogwarts Legacy 2 during Bank of America's 2024 Media, Communications &amp; Entertainment Conference. Wiedenfels highlighted the importance of this sequel for the gaming division and provided a loose timeframe of a couple of years. Here's the exact quote as reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/harry-potter-hogwarts-legacy-sequel-game-warner-bros-1236130719/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Variety</a>:</p>
<p><em>Obviously, a successor to ‘Hogwarts Legacy’ is one of the biggest priorities in a couple of years down the road. So there is certainly a significant growth contribution from that games business in our strategic outlook here.</em></p>
<p>That Hogwarts Legacy 2 would be a priority for WB Games comes as no surprise at all, given that it was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-sold-22-million-units-is-the-best-selling-game-of-2023-says-wb-more-hp-things-on-the-way/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">best-selling game</a> last year, beating even Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III as well as heavyweights like Marvel's Spider-Man 2, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Diablo IV, Starfield, and Resident Evil 4.</p>
<p>The timeframe is interesting, though. A couple of years probably means three rather than two, as it seems unlikely that Avalanche Studios could have a full-fledged sequel ready for 2026. Hogwarts Legacy 2 could, therefore, launch not too far away from the advent of the next console generation, especially since Microsoft is rumored to be planning a headstart for its next Xbox console in a bid to repeat the Xbox 360's success. It's not far-fetched to imagine WB Games playing around that and possibly scheduling a 'Game of the Year' edition with DLCs to be ready once the PlayStation 6 becomes available.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, JB Perrette (CEO and President of Global Streaming and Games at Warner Bros. Discovery) also <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-is-probably-going-to-be-live-service-wb-says-aaa-console-market-isnt-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hinted</a> that the sequel might feature live service elements. If that's the case, Hogwarts Legacy 2 (which will be powered by Unreal Engine 5, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> by job ads) could be supported for a long time post-launch.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, WB Games is also reportedly working on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Director's Cut</a> for the first installment in preparation with the help of Rocksteady.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/state-of-decay-2-is-getting-a-final-update-soon-developer-will-then-focus-on-state-of-decay-3.972609/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/state-of-decay-2-is-getting-a-final-update-soon-developer-will-then-focus-on-state-of-decay-3/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Undead Labs announced that State of Decay 2 is set to receive a final free update soon, its 38th since the game's launch. After that update, the Seattle-based developer will focus solely on the development of State of Decay 3. Update 38 will fix some long-standing bugs, add a few quality-of-life improvements, and, more importantly, it will permanently unlock all seasonal content.</p>
<p>Here's an excerpt from the official FAQ posted on the game's website:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Q: Is this the end of&nbsp;</strong><strong><em>State of Decay 2</em></strong><strong>? What’s changing?</strong><br>
A: The next update, Update 38, will be the final content update for&nbsp;<em>State of Decay 2</em>, but it is not the end!&nbsp; Whether you’re an owner or you play on GamePass, the game will continue to be available. We just won’t be creating new content or supporting the game after Update 38.</li>
<li><strong>Q: Why is now the time to stop updating&nbsp;</strong><strong><em>State of Decay 2</em></strong><strong>?</strong><br>
A: After careful consideration, we have decided to focus on making&nbsp;<em>State of Decay 3</em> the best it can be for all of you.</li>
<li><strong>Q: Will my [insert preferred feature or bug here] be fixed/implemented?</strong><br>
A: We listen to your feedback on support tickets and the Wishlist, but we can’t get to every suggestion. Rather, our goal is to implement those changes and fixes that help the&nbsp; most players, in an effort to make the game stable and fun for years to come.</li>
<li><strong>Q: Will this affect my saved game(s) or saved communities?</strong><br>
A: No, your saved games and/or communities will not be affected. You will be able to keep playing normally for the foreseeable future.</li>
<li><strong>Q: Are you sunsetting&nbsp;</strong><strong><em>State of Decay 2</em></strong><strong>?</strong><br>
A: No. We are stopping content development and developer support for the title. The game will remain available on all existing platforms and for all owners, and included with GamePass subscriptions.</li>
<li><strong>Q: Will bounties continue to cycle?</strong><br>
A: Yes, the bounty packs from the Bounty Broker will continue to cycle automatically. You can see that schedule&nbsp;<a href="https://support.stateofdecay.com/hc/en-us/articles/4413643285261-Bounty-Pack-Cycling-Schedule">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>State of Decay 2 was originally launched in May 2018. Back then, the game was fun but quite buggy and unpolished, as I noted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/state-of-decay-2-rough-yet-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>. However, the extensive post-launch support of over six years slowly made it into a much better game, so it's a great time to start if you've been on the fence. As a reminder, the game is available on Game Pass (Undead Labs was acquired by Microsoft in June 2018).</p>
<p>As for State of Decay 3, the sequel was <a href="https://wccftech.com/state-of-decay-3-announced-to-be-early-in-pre-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in July 2020. Back then, the game was in early pre-production. We just got a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/state-of-decay-3-gets-brand-new-trailer-showcasing-gameplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trailer</a> from Summer Game Fest, but it's fair to guess it might be a 2026 title rather than 2025.</p>

Up to four players can cooperate online to try to escape from an enclosed area where terrifying Yokai roam.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong><a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> the Japanese Horror With Your Friends</strong> – Players must attempt to escape from the cursed domain where terrifying Yokai roam. By cooperating with up to three other players online, you’ll need to work together to hide from the Yokai, survive, and find your way out.</li><li><strong>Unique Art Style That Conveys Japanese Horror</strong> – The game offers a terrifying experience with the atmosphere of Japanese horror. To enhance the horror experience, the game features a distinctive art style characterized by strong contrasts of light and shadow, inspired by the works of Shigeru Mizuki, the creator of <em>GeGeGe no Kitaro</em>. The lurking Yokai emerging from the dark greatly heightens the sense of dread.</li><li><strong>Dealing With the Curse That Undermines Players</strong> – Players must contend not only with the Yokai but also with an agonizing curse. As the curse gradually consumes you, players may transform into terrifying half-Yokai creatures. Close cooperation between players is essential in overcoming this curse which is not only frightening but also a hindrance to your escape.</li><li><strong>Dynamic Gameplay With Ever-changing Item and Device Locations</strong> – In order to escape, you must perform a ritual to break the seal. However, the items necessary for the ritual are hidden in different locations each time you play. Additionally, you’ll need to search for items that can stall the Yokai or revive fallen teammates, leading to a new experience with every playthrough.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->

Once inside, go behind the counter and go through the door at the back of the shop. This will start a cutscene where Willy explains that the ship used to take people to nearby islands, but it needs some repairs before it can run again.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>To repair the ship you need 200 hardwood, 5 iridium bars, and 5 battery packs. </strong><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-hardwood-in-stardew-valley/1100-6525034/" data-ref-id="1100-6525034">Hardwood</a> can be found in the Secret Woods, where 12 pieces spawn every day.

Golden Walnuts can be found around the island, sometimes buried, in trees, or dropped by enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">To befriend Leo, you must go to the Volcano Dungeon and reach the top. There are 10 floors and at the top is the forge, which you can use to enchant weapons and tools. Once you reach the top, you can head back to Leo to befriend him and gain access to more parrots around the island. You can repair the resort, a bridge to a dig site, and more, but the first thing you should repair is the island farm, which can be found in the western part of the island. Once the island farm is restored, even more parrots are unlocked around Ginger Island.</p><p dir="ltr">There are many places to explore and unlock on Ginger Island, but once you befriend Leo and repair the island farm, you can explore and repair the island in whatever order you prefer. All unlocks and repairs are done using Golden Walnuts, so watch for them while you explore.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/does-space-marine-2-have-denuvo/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you regularly play video games on PC, you know there’s one word we all hate to hear: “Denuvo.” When a studio announces Denuvo in its game, it instantly kills any hype, and countless people worldwide cancel their pre-orders. With so much hype surrounding Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, Denuvo is on everyone’s mind. Is it part of the package?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-denuvo-in-space-marine-2">Is Denuvo in Space Marine 2?</h2>



<p>You’ll be happy to know that developer Saber Interactive omitted Denuvo in Space Marine 2. When asked whether they would use the popular anti-piracy software, which many claim reduces game performance, they simply said, “No.” They didn’t elaborate any further, but do they really need to? Now, anyone excited about the third-person action game who was previously worried about performance issues stemming from anti-piracy measures may rest easy and enjoy the experience on day one.</p>



<p>It’s becoming all too common for developers to include Denuvo, and it doesn’t take long for crackers to break through and release copies worldwide.</p>



<p>Alongside a satisfying lack of Denuvo, Saber confirmed they’re not using any DRM whatsoever!</p>







<h2 id="h-does-space-marine-2-have-anti-cheat">Does Space Marine 2 Have Anti-Cheat?</h2>



<p>On the topic of software packaged with the game, how about anti-cheat? As Space Marine 2 includes multiplayer components such as a co-op campaign, PvE missions, and a PvP game mode, anti-cheat is a must-have. Saber opted for Easy Anti Cheat, one of the most common pieces of software for multiplayer games worldwide.</p>



<p>How do you feel about Easy Anti Cheat?</p>

<p>Does the lack of Denuvo change your mind about the game? If you’re hopping in on day one, here’s what you should know about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-campaign-difficulty-modes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">campaign difficulty modes in Space Marine 2</a>!</p>
