                <p>One of the most intriguing developments with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is that the Joy-Con 2 controllers have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-that-supports-joy-con-mouse-controls/2900-6517/" data-ref-id="2900-6517">mouse-like functionality for certain games</a>. That's been a long-requested feature, but players who love using mice appear to have that option on Switch 2 as well.</p><p>During a demonstration for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nobunagas-ambition-awakening-announced-for-pc-ps4-and-switch/1100-6512819/" data-ref-id="1100-6512819">Nobunaga's Ambition: Awakening CE</a> on Switch 2 (via <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-supports-standard-usb-mice/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>), producer Michi Ryu plugged a wired mouse into the console and began playing with it. He also noted that when the mouse is plugged in, it takes priority control away from the Joy-Con 2 controllers. Ryu used the mouse around the 10:53 mark in the video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CstlgmcDgy0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CstlgmcDgy0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>This doesn't necessarily mean that all Switch 2 games will be compatible with a standard mouse. It's also unclear if wireless mice are also usable on Switch 2. XCOM creator Julian Gollop recently suggested that Switch 2's mouse options <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/original-xcom-creator-thinks-switch-2-mouse-controls-have-big-strategy-game-potential/1100-6531445/" data-ref-id="1100-6531445">may lead to more strategy games on the system</a>.</p><p>Nintendo's upcoming 3v3 sports title, Drag x Drive, will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-announces-drag-x-drive-a-switch-2-game-that-relies-on-mouse-controls/1100-6530555/" data-ref-id="1100-6530555">extensively feature the Joy-Con 2's mouse capabilities</a>. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will also incorporate the ability to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-on-switch-2-will-let-you-swap-to-mouse-controls-on-the-fly/1100-6530602/" data-ref-id="1100-6530602">switch between Joy-Con 2's controller and mouse-like capabilities on the fly</a>. That may make aiming a lot easier in the upcoming sequel. Nintendo also recently shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-offers-a-first-glimpse-at-how-mouse-controls-work-on-switch-2s-home-menu/1100-6531454/" data-ref-id="1100-6531454">a better look at how the Joy-Con 2's mouse capabilities</a> will work.</p>

                <p>Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann has further discussed the company's upcoming new IP, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-trailer-story-setting-and-everything-else-we-know/2900-6082/" data-ref-id="2900-6082">Intergalatic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, saying it offers the "deepest" gameplay for any game the studio has made so far. Druckmann also briefly discussed the backlash from some people to the game's unveiling.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8tOTQhepAI&amp;t=3886s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last Stand Media</a> (<a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/just-stick-to-your-guns-neil-druckmann-isnt-phased-by-all-the-hate-intergalactic-got-theres-stuff-happening-with-media-right-now-that-you-just-have-to-ignore/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via PC Gamer</a>), Druckmann said he's "very, very excited" for Intergalactic, adding that "it's the deepest gameplay we've ever done." It's not exactly clear what he means by that, but we should find out in time. "I can't wait to show it off," Druckmann said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4499918-hereticlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4499918" data-ratio="0.55225311601151" data-width="1043" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4499918-hereticlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4499918"></a><figcaption>A scene from Intergalactic.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4499918-hereticlarge.jpeg"></figure><p>The reveal trailer for Intergalactic showed main character Jordan A. Mun in a spaceship before she descended down onto a planet to fight a giant robot enemy with a red sword. The trailer cut out <em>just </em>as the action was set to begin, so we can only guess as to what happens next.</p><p>Also in the interview, Druckmann reacted to some of the controversy surrounding Intergalactic, and specifically the misogynistic and racist comments directed at Tati Gabrielle, who plays Mun.</p><p>"I don't know if there's much I could add to that conversation, to be honest," Druckmann said. "There's stuff happening with media right now that you just have to ignore for the most part, just stick to your guns, and do what you believe in.

It's not the only game that Naughty Dog is currently building, as it's also making at least one other single-player game, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-director-neil-druckmann-is-working-on-a-second-unannounced-game-at-naughty-dog/1100-6531656/" data-ref-id="1100-6531656">Druckmann is also involved with.</a> It's unknown what this game is, but some are theorizing that it could be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531075/" data-ref-id="1100-6531075">The Last of Us 3.</a></p><p>Meanwhile, HBO's The Last of Us TV series--which Druckmann is involved with--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-finales-intense-trailer-sets-up-a-dramatic-conclusion/1100-6531633/" data-ref-id="1100-6531633">wraps up its second season on Sunday, May 25</a>.

			<p>FromSoftware's Elden Ring Nightreign launches next week. Ahead of the much-hyped debut, IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-time-director-learned-from-miyazaki-ign-first?utm_source=threads,twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> Game Director Junya Ishizaki to dive deeper into the multiplayer spin-off game.</p>
<p>One of the main criticisms levied at Elden Ring Nightreign so far is that, according to FromSoftware, it is tailored either for playing solo or with a party of three players. Ishizaki-san admitted that duo groups have been overlooked during the development phase, but added that it is being looked and proper support may be added after launch.</p>
<p><em>The simple answer is that this is simply something that was overlooked during development as just a two-player option, so we're very sorry about that. As we said before, we set out to make this a multiplayer co-op game for three players, balanced for three players, so that was the main focus and it's at the core of Nightreign. Of course, I myself as a player understand that and often want times where I'm just playing myself, so this is something that we considered from the start. And so we did put a lot of effort into creating this experience that was playable for solo players in as much as the rules and new systems allowed. So in putting all our efforts into that aspect, we kind of overlooked and neglected the duos aspect, but this is something that we are looking at and considering for post-launch support as well.</em></p>
<p>There's also no PvP whatsoever in Elden Ring Nightreign, unlike Elden Ring itself. Ishizaki said that it was never even considered:</p>
<p><em>From the start, PVP was not something that we very actively considered for Nightreign. We wanted it to be a co-op multiplayer experience at its core and we found that as we developed these character actions and these unique abilities for each character, balancing them and tweaking them around PVP as well proved to be very… Not only very difficult, but took away from those ideas and that scope that we'd established for each of these characters. So we really wanted the focus to be on PVE and on co-op, and so we knew where our priorities were. So no, we didn't consider PVP in Nightreign.</em></p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign is launching on May 30 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Check out our latest preview <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview-looking-forward-to-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

Like many other adventure games of its era, <em>Onimusha 2</em> doesn’t take that long to beat, but its branching story paths make it worth revisiting over and over again. </p><h2 id="h659960"><a id=""></a>How long does it take to beat <em>Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny</em>?</h2><p><strong>A standard playthrough of <em>Onimusha 2: Samurai’s Destiny</em> can take about 10 to 15 hours to beat if you’re just focusing on the story and if it’s your first time</strong>. It’s quite similar to Capcom’s most notable franchise, <em>Resident Evil</em>, where repeated playthroughs will increase your familiarity, allowing you to beat it quicker on subsequent runs. Speedrunners have completed this game in under than five hours. In fact, the remaster has an achievement for finishing the game within that time.</p><p>If you want to earn all the Achievements and/or Trophies, you’ll also have to beat the game on Ultimate mode, as well as finish a complete playthrough without enhancing any of your weapons or using any jewels.<strong> All of these additional playthroughs can add up to 20 more hours of playtime to the total count</strong>. You’ll also need to collect all files and maps for their respective completion achievements/trophies, which can take multiple playthroughs if you somehow miss any of them.</p><figure id="" data-id="027f14dc6984ce80bd6aa2cbcc0d6956" data-recommend-id="image://027f14dc6984ce80bd6aa2cbcc0d6956" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character in Onimusha 2 glows with energy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character in Onimusha 2 glows with energy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="027f14dc6984ce80bd6aa2cbcc0d6956" data-recommend-id="image://027f14dc6984ce80bd6aa2cbcc0d6956" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character in Onimusha 2 glows with energy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are also multiple endings depending on your friendship with various characters like Ekei, Kotaro, and Magoichi.

I also asked them if the console will support USB keyboards. If so, that would make the Switch 2, which launches on June 5, even more of a direct competitor to the Steam Deck. Either way, I’m excited that the console will support more control options, as that allows more people to play in whatever way works best for them. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Is it weird to have nostalgia for an operating system? I don't mean missing a particular feature that's been removed from modern versions or a specific productivity setting that's no longer supported. I mean a sense of longing for the vibes of the computer interface you grew up with, an ache for the aesthetics of user interfaces past.</p>
<p>I would have thought I was immune to this particular brand of nostalgia. Then I happened upon <em>Desktop Survivors 98</em>, a new <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/vampire-survivors-a-cheap-minimalistic-indie-game-is-my-game-of-the-year/"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a>-style "bullet heaven" autoshooter that leans hard into the aesthetics of the late '90s Windows machines I grew up with. And while that low-res, 256-color presentation is what drew me in, it was the intriguing mouse-controlled gameplay underneath that has kept me coming back for more retro-styled action all week.</p>
<h2>Start me up</h2>
<p>When it comes to capturing the feel of the '90s computer environment, <em>Desktop Survivors 98</em> gets everything just right. This is in large part due to rampant theft of familiar old-school icons; items like My Computer, Calculator, <em>Minesweeper</em>, Search, and more look like they were taken directly from a classic Microsoft tile set. The game's low-res desktop backgrounds and Windows also look like they came out of a years-old Microsoft style book.</p>
<p>But much of the nostalgic appeal of <em>Desktop Survivors</em> is in the little nods to how computers used to work.&nbsp;<span>It's in the faux Start menu in the corner to access various menus and the Settings window that uses&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_Basic_(classic)" target="_blank" rel="noopener">old Visual Basic-style sliders and buttons</a>.</span>&nbsp;It's in the way the item shop looks like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2009/04/geocities-to-close-after-15-years-of-aesthetic-awesomeness/">a teenager's first Geocities page</a>&nbsp;and the "boss mode" icon that can hide the game in an instant. It's even in how the game jumps into <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=queN9r3Leis">the old Mystify screensaver</a> if you leave it idle for too long. This is a game that was obviously made with a lot of love for the old-school versions of Windows that inspired it.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<figure>
    <div>
            <p>
              That blue bar sure does take me back...
                          </p>
          </div>

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>If that kind of nostalgia were all there was to <em>Desktop Survivors 98,</em> it would probably not be worth much more than a 15-minute demo. But the underlying game actually takes the developing Survivors-like genre in some interesting directions.</p>
<p>As usual for the genre, the gameplay here centers around navigating through throngs of encroaching enemies (and their projectiles), all while herding those enemies together so your auto-firing weapons can take them out. Defeated enemies drop gems that are crucial to gaining new weapons and powers that also lean heavily on nostalgic computing gags—I particularly liked one weapon based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SnT54Dcy86w">the "flower box" screensaver</a>&nbsp;and another based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbQ5OveB6TY">the "bouncing cards" at the end of a successful <em>Solitaire</em> game</a>.</p>
<p>Theming aside, the main element that sets <em>Desktop Survivors</em> apart from its predecessors in the genre is the mouse-based controls. Your old-school mouse pointer is your character here, meaning you get to precisely dodge and dart around the screen with all the speed and accuracy you'd expect from such a flexible input device.</p>

<figure>
    <div>
            <p>
              Once you move through these dungeons with a mouse, you won't want to go back to a joystick.

      </figure>

<p>While there is a serviceable Steam Deck mode designed for analog stick-based movements, it's a hard control paradigm to return to after experiencing the freedom and speed of mouse movements. Decades of mouse use have likely been preparing you for just this moment, training you to weave your pointer through the tight, quickly closing spaces between enemies without really having to think about it.</p>
<h2>More of the same?</h2>
<p><em>Desktop Survivors</em> also sets itself apart by taking place on a series of single-screen battlefields rather than smoothly scrolling maps. These rooms don't feature any significant obstacles or walls to block your movements, either, making each enemy room play kind of similarly to the ones you've seen before it. This also makes it a little easier to avoid many enemies simply by scrubbing your mouse pointer in a wide circle, causing the enemy horde to bunch up in comical blobs.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>This complaint falls away when you stumble on optional boss rooms. There, talkative and inventive retro references (appearing in all their low-color-depth, pre-rendered "3D" glory) bounce around the screen while firing all kinds of difficult projectile patterns that require careful and quick movement to avoid. It's a nerve-rattling test of precise mouse movement that really stresses the "survivors" part of the game's name.</p>
<figure>
    <div>
            <p>
              Just one of the many zany, pre-rendered bosses you'll discover in <em>Desktop Survivors 98.</em>

<p>Unfortunately, it can be hard to work your way up to the weapon and item levels needed to effectively take on these bosses. That's because each room effectively kicks you out after the expiration of a tight timer, setting a strict limit on how much you can farm enemies for those all-important gems you need to increase your levels.</p>
<p>This makes it crucially important to kill a lot of enemies quickly in early rooms so you can snowball into more powerful weapons that will kill enemies more efficiently, for even more power-ups to come. Some weapons are much better suited to this efficient killing than others, which makes it tough to recommend some otherwise interesting attack options.</p>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_XVHLj12Pik?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p>None of these balance and variety nitpicks are enough to outweigh the simple fun of <em>Desktop Survivors 98</em>, though. Wiggling your mouse around rooms full of pixelated enemies and watching the screen explode into a cacophony of low-res explosions scratches a twitch-gaming itch that's about a lot more than nostalgia. And the sheer depth of unlockable weapons and powerful pointers will keep completionists coming back for quite a while.</p>
<p>Just be sure to click that boss button before you get caught goofing off.</p>

Don’t expect any complicated mechanics like ones found in modern games like <em>Sekiro </em>or anything like that. However, there’s still plenty of fun to have with Jubei as he sets out to defeat Nobunaga. Let’s go over a few tips </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196411" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="378" data-playlist="196411,196646,196215" data-current="196411"><div><p>A Typical Day On Persona 3 Reload’s Tatsumi Port Island</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196411/196411_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21958.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h685909"><a id="1"></a>Impale your enemies</h2><figure id="" data-id="88b3e9eda6a3723880d63059b35a71b9" data-recommend-id="image://88b3e9eda6a3723880d63059b35a71b9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A protagonist of Onimusha 2 braces for an attack from two enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A protagonist of Onimusha 2 braces for an attack from two enemies." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="88b3e9eda6a3723880d63059b35a71b9" data-recommend-id="image://88b3e9eda6a3723880d63059b35a71b9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A protagonist of Onimusha 2 braces for an attack from two enemies." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Whenever Jubei downs his enemies, you have the opportunity to walk over to their bodies and impale them with a downward stab simply by pressing the attack button while standing on top. This move is an automatic OHKO (one-hit-knock-out) and prevents enemies from getting back up. Enemies don’t have any health bars so it’s impossible to know how much more health they have until they disappear. But with the downward stab, you’ll know they’re gone for good.</p><p>Just be careful, though, as <strong>you can still be hit by other enemies in the middle of the animation</strong>. Sometimes you won’t get the chance to impale them. But either way, if you have the opportunity to do so, definitely take it as it’s one less enemy to deal with.</p><h2 id="h685910"><a id="2"></a>Absorb every soul</h2><p>Early on in the game, Jubei will get the ability to absorb souls from enemies that he’s defeated. Red souls can be spent upgrading Jubei’s weapons and capabilities, while the yellow and blue ones replenish Jubei’s health and magic, respectively. Jubei can also transform into a powerful and invincible demon for a short time if he collects five purple souls.</p><p><strong>In this remaster, players can now control when Jubei enters this powerful mode</strong> whereas in the original, it automatically activated once the fifth soul was collected. So definitely take advantage of it to unleash hell at opportune times.</p><p>Also, souls disappear after a while if they aren’t absorbed, so make sure to not leave them hanging or you’ll regret it.</p><h2 id="h685911"><a id="3"></a>Regularly switch up your weapons</h2><figure id="" data-id="be6c2bf09a4216473f472bacbeacb568" data-recommend-id="image://be6c2bf09a4216473f472bacbeacb568" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A protagonist in Onimusha 2 impales an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A protagonist in Onimusha 2 impales an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="be6c2bf09a4216473f472bacbeacb568" data-recommend-id="image://be6c2bf09a4216473f472bacbeacb568" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A protagonist in Onimusha 2 impales an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In <em>Onimusha 2</em>, there are plenty of weapons to collect, each with their own unique effects. The Buraitou is a lightning sword that’s both fast and powerful, making it a fantastic all-rounder. The Hyojin-Yari is an ice lance and it has the longest reach out of all the weapons. Use it if you want to keep a safe distance.</p><p>The general idea is to <strong>switch between weapons so that you can maintain an advantage over your enemies</strong>.

Usually, in games featuring the famous turtle crimefighters, you punch and kick a ton of goons in real-time, either alone or with some buddies. That’s not the case in <em>TMNT: Tactical Takedown,</em> which is instead a turn-based tactics game. Thankfully, the shift to turn-based mostly works for the Turtles, even if the game is a bit barebones. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197562" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="197562,196394,196599" data-current="197562"><div><p>THPS 3+4 Does Away With The OG 4's Career Mode, Here's Why</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197562/197562_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23086.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In <em>TMNT: Tactical Takedown</em>, battles play out on small maps covered in grids. Each mission features one turtle fighting his way through these maps turn-by-turn, while enemies spawn throughout, also moving on their own turns across the grid. Your goal is often to clear out the baddies while reaching the end of the level. </p><p>At first, I was worried that this tactical and slower-paced turn-based gameplay wouldn’t feel <em>TMNT</em>-enough, that it would lack the kinetic excitement of most of the <em>Ninja Turtle</em> games and shows. But, developers <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/el-paso-elsewhere-strange-scaffold-black-in-gaming-1851352903&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/el-paso-elsewhere-strange-scaffold-black-in-gaming-1851352903">Strange Scaffold</a></span> (of <em>Witch Stranding</em>, <em>E</em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/el-paso-elsewhere-max-payne-control-creepy-ps1-review-1850871547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/el-paso-elsewhere-max-payne-control-creepy-ps1-review-1850871547"><em>l, Paso Elsewhere</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>and <em>Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 3</em> fame) did a great job infusing the strategic gameplay with flourishes and ideas that make it feel plenty exciting and fast-paced. </p><p>One significant way <em>TMNT: Tactical Takedown</em> makes the action feel exciting is ensuring that you don’t hang out in one area during missions. Instead, you are pushed forward every few turns as the levels grow ahead of you and fall behind you. For example, during one mission, I entered some subway trains and as the train started, the grid outside of the train turned red—a visual warning it was about to vanish—disappearing along with some goons. Then, once the train reached its station, and I had beaten up another dozen or so Foot Clan members, I exited before the carriage itself fell into the void, taking more baddies with it.</p><p> Having levels change every few turns means I had to keep moving forward, similar to an old-school beat ‘em up. And you can even take advantage of the levels changing by kicking back enemies into the red areas and watching them fall into nothing on your next turn. However, it’s even more fun to kick them off the edge of the maps, something I did a lot<em>. </em></p><p>Another design choice I appreciated is that most of the Turtles’ moves encourage you to be aggressive, and then reward it. A lot of times in <em>Tactical Takedown,</em> I was taking out multiple enemies in one turn by chaining attacks in satisfying ways, although given this also means the game is designed around you defeating tons of enemies quickly, it leads to some missions quickly filling up with Foot Clan soldiers who can too often overwhelm your Turtles if you make a mistake. I wonder if, for those hoping for a more arcade-like experience, <em>Tactical Takedown</em> might prove too tactically challenging. </p><p>Of course, any <em>TMNT </em>game is going to star the Turtles themselves, and this is easily the best part of the <em>Tactical Takedown.</em> The Turtles are separated for the entire game, mostly, and that’s a bit strange—sure, if you do enough cool shit you can pull off a team up move—but most of the time you are playing as each turtle separately. </p><figure id="" data-id="37e4cca189013898b38b002b5e4c30be" data-recommend-id="image://37e4cca189013898b38b002b5e4c30be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Strange Scaffold / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="37e4cca189013898b38b002b5e4c30be" data-recommend-id="image://37e4cca189013898b38b002b5e4c30be" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But while they don’t fight side by side throughout most of the game, they do talk to each other via cutscenes, and the writing here is excellent. I won’t spoil too much, but the conflict between the brothers is the core of the tale, and it’s shocking how invested I got in the rather simple, but well-delivered story of four mutated turtle warriors dealing with grief, loss, and trying to pick up the pieces together.</p><p>Sadly, too much of<em> TMNT: Tactical Takedown</em> feels barebones. Levels look fine, but are very simple, rarely featuring varying locations or details. The Turtles all play differently, with various moves that reflect their personality, but so many sound effects are reused. Couple that with simplistic, stiff combat animations and levels that go on for too long, and <em>Tactical Takedown</em> can often feel like a game that is trying to trick you into thinking it’s more than it is.</p><p>Still, I’m happy <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> was made, and that I played it. It’s a unique spin on the franchise, and the turn-based combat is frenetic and fun. I also love the way the Turtles are depicted in cutscenes. It’s a shame that there’s not much else here, but what is there is good and feels like a solid foundation for future DLC or sequels that could add more. </p><p> <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown </em>launched on May 22 for PC. It is available now on Steam and runs great on Steam Deck. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For the duos out there though, it sounds like you'll need to be open to a third.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-elden-ring-nightreigns-first-time-director-learned-from-miyazaki-ign-first">IGN's interview with Elden Ring Nightreign director Junya Ishizaki</a>, the Nightreign lead discussed the choice to lean on solos and trios as the core experience options. When asked why there's no option for a pair of players to drop in together without a matchmade third player, Ishizaki said it was overlooked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The simple answer is that this is simply something that was overlooked during development as just a two-player option, so we're very sorry about that," said Ishizaki. "As we said before, we set out to make this a multiplayer co-op game for three players, balanced for three players, so that was the main focus and it's at the core of Nightreign. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of course, I myself as a player understand that and often want times where I'm just playing myself, so this is something that we considered from the start," Ishizaki continued. "And so we did put a lot of effort into creating this experience that was playable for solo players in as much as the rules and new systems allowed. So in putting all our efforts into that aspect, we kind of overlooked and neglected the duos aspect, but this is something that we are looking at and considering for post-launch support as well."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So if you're playing with just your favorite duos partner, be ready to accept a random third into your lives. Who knows? <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/let-me-solo-her-elden-ring-community-hero">You might match up with someone pretty good at the game</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're playing solo, it does sound like Elden Ring Nightreign takes that into account. Ishizaki said the parameters of Elden Ring Nightreign "adjust dynamically depending on the number of players in that session," so lone wolves shouldn't be too overwhelmed in single-player.</p><div id="top-25-fromsoftware-bosses" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Top 25 FromSoftware Bosses</h3><h3>Top 25 FromSoftware Bosses</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You'll have to find and locate some self-revive options, which are incorporated for those opting for single-player. And if you're playing trios, well, that's apparently what Elden Ring Nightreign is built around. Whether duos support shows up or not, having an extra hand around can't hurt against some of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-features-bosses-from-dark-souls">the fearsome bosses</a> waiting in Nightreign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring Nightreign is out on May 30, 2025 for PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, and Xbox One and Series X and S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Hitman developer IO Interactive is keeping busy. In addition to a fantasy new IP, the studio is developing Project 007, which is the working title for its new James Bond game.</p><p>Announced in November 2020, Project 007 tells an origin story for James Bond. We haven't seen any footage yet, but we've still learned a fair amount about the upcoming game. Read on to learn everything we know so far about Project 007, including plans for it to potentially kick off a new trilogy.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#When_will_Project_007_be_released_">When will Project 007 be released?</a></li><li><a href="#Preorder_Project_007">Preorder Project 007</a></li><li><a href="#Project_007_trailer_information">Project 007 trailer information</a></li><li><a href="#Project_007_platforms">Project 007 platforms</a></li><li><a href="#Project_007_story__setting__and_characters">Project 007 story, setting, and characters</a></li><li><a href="#Project_007_game_engine">Project 007 game engine</a></li><li><a href="#Who_s_developing_Project_007_">Who's developing Project 007?</a></li><li><a href="#A_James_Bond_shakeup">A James Bond shakeup</a></li><li><a href="#History_of_James_Bond_games">History of James Bond games</a></li><li><a href="#The_next_James_Bond_movie">The next James Bond movie</a></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="When_will_Project_007_be_released_">When will Project 007 be released?</h2><p dir="ltr">There is no word yet on when Project 007 will be released. It was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-007-game-in-the-works-at-io-interactive/1100-6484609/" data-ref-id="1100-6484609">announced in November 2020</a>, and many took the reveal to be a specific strategy to encourage people to come work at IO on the IP. Announcing games early in development for the purpose of attracting talent is a comment practice in video games.</p><p dir="ltr">One of the big new hires for Project 007 is Rodrigo Santoro, a former Ubisoft veteran who joined IO in 2024 to become <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hitman-dev-hires-ubisoft-veteran-for-new-james-bond-game-and-hes-excited-to-work-on-a-non-sequel/1100-6522538/" data-ref-id="1100-6522538">missions director for the James Bond game.</a> Santoro said he was happy to join IO to work on the James Bond game, saying most companies are making sequels, so he's excited for a new challenge.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Preorder_Project_007">Preorder Project 007</h2><p dir="ltr">Preorders for Project 007 are not available yet, but whenever that happens, we'll report back with a preorder guide.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Project_007_trailer_information">Project 007 trailer information</h2><p>So far, the only video for Project 007 was the announcement sizzle clip that was released when the game was announced in 2020.

href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. However, it's assumed the game will also come to PlayStation and Xbox consoles. IO said the game is being developed for "modern systems and platforms."</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Project_007_story__setting__and_characters">Project 007 story, setting, and characters</h2><p>The Project 007 teaser video doesn't show Bond himself, so it's unclear if the character's likeness will be based on any of the actors who have played him over the years.</p><p>What is confirmed is that Project 007 tells an origin story for James Bond--the first time ever for any form of James Bond entertainment--and it will be a "wholly original Bond story." Players will "earn their 00 status" in the course of the game's story.</p><p dir="ltr">However, that's all we know so far about the plot. James Bond movies are known to be globe-trotting affairs, as Bond hunts down villains across the world. The series is also known for its action, and it's expected Project 007 will include some of this. Bond also sometimes needs to be stealthy, and IO's experience with the Hitman series would seemingly help in this department.</p><p dir="ltr">IO intends for the game to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-james-bond-game-will-focus-on-a-young-bond-aims-to-launch-new-trilogy/1100-6527203/" data-ref-id="1100-6527203">kick off a new trilogy.</a> CEO Hakan Abrak told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-007-io-interactive-young-bond-for-gamers-trilogy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that Project 007 won't be based on any of the existing Bond movies. Instead, the developer is being allowed to create its own version of James Bond for the game.</p><p>"What's exciting about that project is that we actually got to do an original story," Abrak said. "So it's not a gamification of a movie. It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future. And equally important and exciting, it's a new Bond. It's a Bond we built from the ground up for gamers. It's extremely exciting with all the tradition and all the history there is there together to work on this together with the family of creating a young Bond for gamers; a Bond that the gamers can call their own and grow with."</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Project_007_game_engine">Project 007 game engine</h2><p dir="ltr">Project 007 is being developed using IO's proprietary Glacier engine. The company is <a href="https://ioi.dk/careers?panel=job%3Fid%3D5776172" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">hiring a multiplayer programmer</a>, and a previously spotted job ad called for someone with multiplayer experience to work on Project 007. This suggests, but doesn't confirm, that the new James Bond game will have multiplayer.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Who_s_developing_Project_007_">Who's developing Project 007?</h2><p>Project 007 is in "active development" at IO's offices in Copenhagen, Denmark and Malmo, Sweden.</p><p>"Creating an original Bond game is a monumental undertaking and I truly believe that IO Interactive, working closely with our creative partners at EON and MGM, can deliver something extremely special for our players and communities," Abrak said. "Our passionate team is excited to unleash their creativity into the iconic James Bond universe and craft the most ambitious game in the history of our studio."</p><p>Former MGM boss Robert Marick, meanwhile, said, "We plan to bring a new take on this legendary franchise to gamers and Bond fans around the world. IO Interactive are masters of crafting living, breathing worlds of immersive storytelling." Marick left MGM after the game was announced.</p><h2 id="A_James_Bond_shakeup"><b>A James Bond shakeup</b></h2><p>A major unanswered question about Project 007 is whether or not anything about the project changed due to James Bond stewards Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson getting bought out of their ownership, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shocking-james-bond-changes-announced-could-influence-future-games/1100-6529615/" data-ref-id="1100-6529615">Amazon MGM Studios taking over all creative decisions.</a></p><p>Broccoli and Wilson had managed the James Bond franchise for almost 60 years, following it being passed down from their father, Cubby Broccoli. The pair have been the driving force behind the entire Bond franchise during that period, including selecting the actors who would play the iconic spy. Their work has extended beyond just the movies, as Broccoli at least has been involved in decision-making for the games; it recently came to light that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/james-bond-producer-didnt-want-guns-in-goldeneye-007-wii-remake-bobby-kotick-says/1100-6529397/" data-ref-id="1100-6529397">Broccoli raised a number of concerns about the GoldenEye game for Wii.</a></p><p>What impact the new leadership at Amazon MGM Studios could have on IO's game is unknown, but GameSpot has contacted the studio in an attempt to get more details. We've also reached out to Amazon MGM Studios.</p><h2 id="History_of_James_Bond_games"><strong>History of James Bond games</strong></h2><p>A number of companies have made James Bond video games over the years. One of the most memorable and iconic James Bond games was Rare's 1997 GoldenEye 007 for Nintendo 64. Electronic Arts made James Bond games, too, including Agent Under Fire, Nightfire, and Rogue Agent. Activison took over for a period of time, publishing titles like Quantum of Solace and Blood Stone. There hasn't been a new James Bond game for console since 2012's 007 Legends, though Cypher 007 came out for mobile in 2023.</p><h2 id="The_next_James_Bond_movie"><strong>The next James Bond movie</strong></h2><p>The 26th Bond movie is now in the works, with <a href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/amazon-mgm-studios-james-bond-producers-amy-pascal-david-heyman" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Harry Potter's David Heyman and Spider-Man's Amy Pascal signed on as producers. </a> Amazon MGM Studios will produce the film, but there is no word yet on any of the key details about it, including the biggest question of all: who will play James Bond? Aaron Taylor-Johnson was said to be the front-runner at some point. Also unknown is who may direct the new Bond movie or when it could release.</p><p>A <a href="https://www.wsj.com/business/media/james-bond-movies-amazon-barbara-broccoli-0b04f0db" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wall Street Journal report from December 2024</a> said Broccoli and Wilson were sparring with Amazon executives over the future of the series, causing important developments on the project to be delayed. Now that Broccoli and Wilson are out, some are theorizing that Amazon might try to get the ball rolling quickly for Bond 26.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Summerfall Studios co-founder and former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> writer David Gaider has been reflecting, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/david-gaider-interview-romanceable-companions-and-his-cancelled-planescape-sequel">not for the first time</a>, on his career at BioWare under EA. In a brisk recap of a decade-and-change of sequels, changes of direction, and mid-project reboots, he sums up EA's difficulty with Dragon Age as basically one of having no real faith in the wide appeal of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">role-playing games</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>"In many ways, Dragon Age was, I think, not a good match for EA," Gaider explained, in a new interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard/david-gaider-interview">PCGamesN</a>. "They never really knew what to make of it, or what to do with it. The expectation was always that it wouldn't do well, and when it did do well, it took people by surprise."</p>
<p>EA were far more convinced by sci-fi stablemate <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a>, Gaider went on, despite Mass Effect sporadically falling short of expectations. "By comparison, Mass Effect was slick and it was action-driven and very much up EA's alley, so they always expected that it should do better, and every time it didn't, it got excuses like 'oh they released in the wrong timeframe, or X, Y, and Z.'</p>
<p>"The idea was that the potential for Mass Effect was more - it could get the action audience as well as the RPG audience," he said. "It wasn't until <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-3">Mass Effect 3</a> that they started to realize that 'no, there's an action RPG audience, like a crossover,' but you don't just get both audiences together." </p>
<p>Last year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-top-tips-beginners">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> certainly suggests a level of hesitancy about the value of Dragon Age as a 'pure' role-playing game. Its development was, by most accounts, hellish: originally pitched as another narrative-led RPG, The Veilguard was re-envisaged as a live service multiplayer offering, <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/so-i-tied-an-onion-to-my-belt-which-was-the-style-at-the-time">as was the style at the time</a>, then rebooted as a single player action-RPG in light of Anthem's commercial failure.</p>
<p>Gaider - who left BioWare after working on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>, my beloved - has yet to play The Veilguard, having poured so much of himself into Dragon Age that he feels uneasy about it evolving without him. He's also wary of judging its creators, many of whom have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-quietly-lay-off-key-dragon-age-team-members-while-talking-up-the-next-mass-effect">laid off</a> or relocated after EA declared The Veilguard a disappointment. But he does regard the game as symptomatic of EA's on-going mistrust toward Dragon Age and role-playing.</p>
<p>"Even though Dragon Age only catered to the RPG audience - at least initially - [EA] kept wanting it to move into the action space as well - and maybe by Veilguard it has," he went on. "I think their idea was that the 'cap' on the RPG audience was only so big. Then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> comes along and proves no, it's possible that if you lean into what a genre does really well, you can grow the audience, as it turns out."</p>
<p>Gaider would have liked EA and BioWare to similarly "double down on the choice-driven narrative, double down on the production value, like the presentation of the characters and the cinematics and dialogs, and just take it to the extent where quality is the watchword." But as he concludes, it's hard to imagine a publicly traded company like EA doing what Larian did with BG3, because the two "live on two different planets".</p>
<p>It's not clear what the future holds for Dragon Age. Or indeed BioWare, who have been stripped down to a core team currently working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mass-effect-5s-top-development-brass-includes-a-few-original-mass-effect-trilogy-veterans">Mass Effect 5</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>EA's Star Wars Battlefront II is experiencing a surge in players, potentially fueled by the recent May the 4th Star Wars holiday and the Star Wars TV series Andor. The resurgence in popularity for the 2017 game has prompted some fans--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-2-is-super-popular-again-on-steam-as-fans-petition-for-a-third-game/1100-6531753/" data-ref-id="1100-6531753">and celebrities</a>--to petition EA to make a third game. But it probably won't happen.</p><p>That's the opinion of former DICE live producer Mats Holm. He <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1ksngo8/comment/mtsa5xq/?context=3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said on Reddit</a> (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-star-wars-battlefront-3-any-time-soon-former-dice-developer-says-despite-player-surge" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via IGN</a>), "I don't expect Battlefront 3 to be announced at the end of this rally." However, Holm said he believes there are people "who are talking about it." In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1ksxy9m/comment/mtp7jn9/?context=3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">another post</a>, Holm said it would be challenging to bring back the team that made Battlefront II. "We are spread far and wide," he said of himself and others who have since left DICE.</p><p>No new Battlefront games have been announced, which may sound surprising considering the 2015 game and the 2017 sequel <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/despite-the-loot-box-controversy-eas-star-wars-bat/1100-6471006/" data-ref-id="1100-6471006">combined to sell 33 million copies</a>. A report said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-rejected-star-wars-battlefront-3-pitch-report/1100-6498250/" data-ref-id="1100-6498250">EA rejected a pitch for a third game due in part to licensing costs.</a></p><p>Holm--who now works at Paradox--went on to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/1ks4y8c/comment/mtmzvd9/?context=3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pitch his own idea for the future of Battlefront games</a>, saying EA should remaster Battlefront II for the next Xbox and PlayStation consoles in 2027-2028. After that, and if it's a success, the developers could focus on Battlefront 3, he said.</p><p>DICE is currently working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6526583/" data-ref-id="1100-6526583">Battlefield 6</a>, so no one should expect the developer to make a third Battlefront game soon, if it ever does.</p><p>The Battlefront series debuted in 2004 with a third-person shooter from the since-shuttered Pandemic Studios. A sequel, Battlefront II, came out in 2005. A third game was reportedly in the works, but it was said to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-3-was-canceled-2-yards-from-the-finish-line-dev-says/1100-6513342/" data-ref-id="1100-6513342">canceled "two yards from the finish line."</a></p><p>The two older games were packaged together in the Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/star-wars-battlefront-collection-first-update-fixes-a-long-list-of-issues/1100-6521962/" data-ref-id="1100-6521962">released in 2024 to a terrible critical reception</a> due to numerous bugs and other issues.</p><p>While Battlefront 3 may not be in the works, there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-upcoming-star-wars-game/2900-3917/" data-ref-id="2900-3917">a number of upcoming Star Wars games</a>, including Star Wars Eclipse from Quantic Dream.</p>

			<p>Capcom has been on a pretty incredible hot streak since 2017, with Monster Hunter, Resident Evil, and Street Fighter all playing huge roles in the company's growth and success since.</p>
<p>The company has grown significantly since its biggest series all started to take off in record-breaking ways, and in its latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ni0ZYaiinJ8">presentation</a> to investors regarding its recent financial results for its previous fiscal year, Capcom laid out even more plans to expand.</p>
<p>A key point in its expansion is the announcement of a new development hub that will be built near the company's headquarters in Osaka, Japan. Reported by <a href="https://gamebiz.jp/news/406072">GameBiz</a> (and spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/capcom-to-continue-upsizing-workforce-by-100-employees-each-year/">Automaton</a>), the building is scheduled to be finished in 2027 and will be a new office meant to help Capcom accelerate its development capabilities. It's described as a new environment where "<em>creators can unleash their talents fully</em>."</p>
<p>The studio also reiterated its plans to continue hiring 100 new employees every year. In an age when so many others are looking towards generative AI and other technology to boost their potential, Capcom recognizes human talent as the "<em>essential driver of growth</em>."</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is the best-selling game of 2025 so far, and after 2023's excellent remake of Resident Evil 4, fans of the long-running horror series are on the edge of their seats waiting to see what the studio has in store for<a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-9-open-world-multiplayer-game/"> Resident Evil 9</a>.</p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/steamos-3-7-brings-valves-gaming-os-to-other-handhelds-and-generic-amd-pcs/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steamos-3-7-brings-valve%E2%80%99s-gaming-os-to-other-handhelds-and-generic-amd-pcs.1197621/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/05/steamos-3-7-brings-valves-gaming-os-to-other-handhelds-and-generic-amd-pcs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>Valve's instructions will walk you through downloading a SteamOS recovery image and copying it to a USB drive using either <a href="https://rufus.ie/en/">the Rufus tool</a> (on Windows) or <a href="https://etcher.balena.io/">Balena Etcher</a> (the preferred macOS and Linux utility). After turning Secure Boot off, you should be able to boot from the USB drive and install SteamOS as you would on a regular Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Note that there's no simple, officially supported way to dual-boot SteamOS and Windows; if you decide to turn your handheld, laptop, or desktop into a new Steam Machine, the only way to make it back into a Windows PC is to re-enable Secure Boot and install a fresh copy from another USB drive.</p>
<p>The SteamOS 3.7 update (officially, version 3.7.8) also includes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/820329049655084700">a bunch of other updates to the underlying software</a>: version 6.11 of the Linux kernel (up from version 6.5 in SteamOS 3.6), "a newer Arch Linux base," version 6.2.5 of the Plasma interface in desktop mode, new Mesa graphics drivers, and various other tweaks and bug fixes.</p>
<h2>A second act for SteamOS</h2>
<p>The original version of SteamOS was designed to be&nbsp;<span>widely compatible with all kinds of PC hardware and was available both from major PC manufacturers and as a standalone OS that you could (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/12/everything-you-need-to-know-to-install-steamos-on-your-very-own-computer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">and which we did</a>) install on custom,</span>&nbsp;self-built PCs. But these computers and that version of SteamOS <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/its-time-to-declare-valves-steam-machines-doa/">mostly flopped</a>, at least in part because they only ran a small subset of games that natively supported Linux.</p>
<p>The current version of SteamOS launched with more modest aims as the first-party operating system for a single piece of hardware. But by focusing on the game compatibility problem first and leading the way with category-defining hardware, Valve has actually built a much stronger foundation for the current version of SteamOS than it did for the original.</p>
<p>That doesn't make SteamOS a drop-in replacement for Windows—without strong support for Intel or Nvidia hardware, it's not a great candidate for the majority of gaming PCs, or even Intel-powered gaming handhelds like <a href="https://www.msi.com/Handheld/Claw-A1MX">the MSI Claw A1M</a>. And Windows is set up to be a multipurpose general-use operating system in ways that SteamOS isn't; Valve still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamos">says</a> that, despite the presence of desktop mode, "users should not consider SteamOS as a replacement for their desktop operating system." But for certain kinds of systems that are primarily used as gaming PCs, SteamOS is a real contender.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-surpassed-40-million-players-tomorrows-patch-adds-nvidia-dlss-4-and-amd-anti-lag-2/">Marvel Rivals</a> developer NetEase has revealed gameplay for the next character joining the roster, Ultron, and showcased more of what's to come in Season 2.5 ahead of its launch next week on&nbsp;<strong>May 30, 2025.&nbsp;</strong>The studio also released the latest <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250520/41548_1235575.html">patch notes</a> for the game's most recent update, which includes all the balance changes and fixes made.</p>
<p>The Hellfire Gala Moments event has been extended for another week in the back-half of this season, and on top of adding Ultron to the game, NetEase is also adding a new map and making some significant changes to Team-Up abilities, like the addition of the Jeff-Nado ability.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marvel Rivals: Season 2.5 Kick Off! | Dev Vision Vol. 06" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kXtEMrHcLDA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Season 2.5 will also include a new limited-time mode to be added on June 6 called Ultron's Battle Matrix Protocol. The mode lets six players choose their own hero lineups and upgrade their abilities before going head-to-head against other players. According to a press release for the new update, the mode is "<em>an experiment for how the development team can attempt to fulfill players' fantasies of Marvel Super Heroes and Super Villains</em>."</p>

<p>Season 2 is the last season that'll have the three-month-long structure, NetEase revealed<a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-reveals-new-details-for-season-2-hellfire-gala-introduces-emma-frost/"> last month</a> ahead of the launch for Season 2. Beginning with Season 3, a full season in Marvel Rivals will last for only two months, with a new character and features added each month. Season 2 also introduced weekly missions to give players even more to do on top of the preexisting daily challenges.</p>

            <p>
Stop Killing Games are a self-described consumer movement who are aggrieved about all the games with online requirements that become partly or completely unplayable, once publishers end official server support. They’re trying to persuade larger advocacy organisations like The European Consumer Organisation to propose new laws that put a stop to such shenanigans.</p>
<p>To support their campaign, they’ve carried out a survey of games with online requirements to work out how many are "dead", dying or enduring thanks to developer or fan-implemented “end of life” plans, such as patched-in offline functionality. The resulting Google spreadsheet has 738 entries, of which a whopping 70% are apparently no longer playable or destined to become that way.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
You can view the spreadsheet <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1at1k7qIo5dgPp6K1aCrYIyAgNOjY-IhF/edit?gid=1774166863#gid=1774166863">here</a>. Beware that Google might badge it “suspicious”, because it harbours a bunch of links to publisher websites – it’s possible some of those publisher websites have naughty code, but it could also be simply that Google considers giant walls of links innately untrustworthy. One of the Stop Killing Games organisers, Youtuber Ross Scott, has also put together a video discussing the survey methodology and summarising the highlights.</p>
<figure>

<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GV2bCfm3zVM?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GV2bCfm3zVM?autoplay=1" title="70% of games that require internet get destroyed">

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GV2bCfm3zVM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>The survey sorts games into four broad categories: those that are no longer playable, those that are “at risk” for want of plans to maintain them once official support has ended, and those that have been “saved” by means of, say, the public release of the server code.
</p>
<p>
The volunteers found that of the 738 games included, 299 games were “dead”, with 313 games set to meet the same fate in the absence of publisher action. 110 of the games surveyed have been preserved by industrious players, following the cessation of official support, while just 16 had been salvaged by the developers.
</p>
<p>
The criteria for inclusion are a little blurry, admittedly. SKG have made some “judgement calls” about proof-of-concept fan emulators that launch the game in a minimally playable state, which they’re currently categorising as “dead”. The list also includes offline single player games that have online multiplayer components, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-3">Mass Effect 3</a>. Scott strenuously makes the argument that these should be counted alongside always-online games, because it’s not like you can opt out of paying for multiplayer when you buy the game. He adds that, in any case, even if you strip away the games with offline single player components, 68.77% of the games that remain are still categorisable as either gone or going under.
</p>
<p>
The video notes that publishers can be frustrating elusive and unreadable on whether a game with an online requirement will be spared from demolition. A game might be said to support private servers, for example, theoretically allowing you to play it without official server support, but actually require you to access those private servers via the publisher.</p>
<p>
There are many, many online-required live service games currently in development, despite some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-failed-for-all-the-reasons-you-could-have-guess-it-failed-report-says">high profile disasters</a> and much discontent about live service as a concept. The fact that so many games with online requirements are "dead" is hardly surprising. Large publicly traded companies are, after all, fuelled by profits rather than goodwill. They gain little from ensuring that those games remain playable, once they're no longer part of the active portfolio. Still, you do come across the odd team or community that have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-completely-missed-that-ace-wizard-battle-royale-spellbreak-had-been-brought-back-from-the-dead">successfully reconfigured a game to survive the apocalypse</a>.</p>
<p>A few members of the Stop Killing Games team are hoping to set up a wiki of online games that face extinction, based on this research. If you fancy pitching in, you can get in touch by emailing deadgamestats@pm.me.
