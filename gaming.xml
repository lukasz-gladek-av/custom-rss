            <p>We haven't written about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diplomacy-is-not-an-option">Diplomacy Is Not An Option</a> since it launched in Early Access in 2022, when it was a light and frothy strategy game about smashing thousands of peasants to bits with physics magic. It's still that, but now it's getting a 1.0 release on October 4th.

<p>The 1.0 release will include Diplomacy's full story campaign, which includes three factions, six possible endings, and more than 25 missions. The developers estimate that a single playthrough will take around 30 hours.
</p>
<p>In his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diplomacy-is-not-an-option-review">Early Access review</a>, Steve Hogarty compared Diplomacy Is Not An Option to one of those fake games you see advertised on Instagram, only real. The scale of its enemy armies, the godlike power to destroy them with divine rays and meteor strikes, and the general sense that the game is less interested in tactical city construction than giddy spectacle.
</p>
<blockquote>But what the game lacks in variation it makes up for in its finely tuned and scratchcard-like approach to compulsive play. The cartoonish low-poly visuals and punchy sound effects make building out your expanding fortress an irresistible pleasure to be repeated over and over again, like scratching an itch somewhere deep inside your own skull. Assigning a few cohorts of crossbowmen to your towers and watching them effortlessly obliterate an approach wave of angry peasants is soothing, a cool balm for the mind, like slowly pushing your hoover of an especially dirty bit of carpet and hearing the crackle of debris clattering up the tube. Mmm.</blockquote>
<p>Which honestly sounds fine to me. It's been on my to-play list ever since, and I remain to give it a try now it's got more variety and polish.

Narrated by Miranda Otto who played Éowyn in the movies, <em>War of the Rohirrim</em> takes place 183 years prior to Frodo’s journey to destroy the One Ring and tells the story of Rohan’s fight for survival against a rival nation of Dunlendings.</p><p>Here’s the trailer:</p><p>The footage shows Helm Hammerhand (Cox) meeting with a rival king to discuss the marriage of their children, but when insults are hurled and honor is tarnished, a messy brawl leaves the Dunlending king dead. His son Wulf (Luke Pasqualino) pledges revenge while Hèra (Gaia Wise), Hammerhand’s daughter and Wulf’s would-be betrothed, tries to navigate political terrain dominated by men. The resulting battle will double as an origin story for Helm’s Deep, the stronghold made famous in the climax of <em>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</em>. </p><p><em>The War of the Rohirrim</em> was originally supposed to come out earlier this year but hit delays in 2023 as a result of the SAG-AFTRA strike. It’s directed by Kenji Kamiyama, best known most recently for the animated series <em>Ultraman</em>, <em>Star Wars: Visions</em>, and<em> Blade Runner: Black Lotus</em>. Instead of going with the divisive rotoscoping method Ralph Bakshi used for his original 1978 animated <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> movie, <em>War of the Rohirrim </em>was first made in 3D, with artists then using that to translate scenes into traditional 2D animation. </p><p>The movie is only coming to theaters at the moment, with no streaming plans on Max or any other service currently announced. More details are expected in October at this year’s New York Comic Con. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Eternal Strands' new trailer debuted at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2024-show-will-be-big-xbox-insider-says-plenty-of-stuff-wasnt-shown-during-showcase/">Xbox Showcase</a> at Gamescom 2024. Yellow Brick Games revealed a brand-new gameplay trailer today, with narration from Chief Creative Officer Mike Laidlaw. This trailer gives players an insight into what they can expect from this third-person action-adventure fantasy game. This is Yellow Brick Games' first title, and it's a hugely ambitious one with a lush and vibrant world.</p>
<p><iframe title="101 Gameplay Trailer | Eternal Strands" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AHxtabO0hj8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Eternal Strands occurs in a fully interactive world where players venture into the Enclave. The world has many harsh environments and highly unpredictable weather conditions, including flash freezes and heat waves, which can be devastating to both the landscapes and the players.</p>
<p>The main challenge for the player to complete is beating all nine towering bosses that roam freely through the Enclave. Players will additionally be introduced to something called Epic, the Ark of Stricken Earth, a dangerous entity that can cause significant harm to the players. However, players can utilize this and benefit from harvesting strands from them, which will help them gain new magical powers that can help them on their journey.</p>
<p>Players can craft and reforge their gear, allowing them to tailor the experience to their liking and create a play style that fits them in Eternal Strands. The new Eternal Strands trailer at the Xbox Showcase also revealed the Weaverband, Brynn's unique skilled base camp characters.</p>
<p>In Eternal Strands, you play as Brynn and are joined by fully-voiced companions that can help you on your journey.</p>
<p>These characters are voiced by well-known actors you would have heard in other games and media. The characters are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brynn, the Point - Voiced by Mei Mac</li>
<li>Oria, the Mentor - Voiced by Pandora Colin</li>
<li>Sola, the Smith - Voiced by Luyanda Unati Lewis-Nyawo</li>
<li>Sevastyan, the Smith's Apprentice - Voiced by Kris W. Laudrum</li>
<li>Laen, the Lorekeeper - Robyn Holdaway</li>
<li>Casmyn, the Quartermaster - Rebecca Hanssen</li>
</ul>
<p>Players will get to forge bonds with members of the Weaverband, and they can help Brynn with their expedition by giving them helpful gear and guiding her in her decision-making as she uncovers the mysteries and profound secrets of the Enclave.</p>
<p>If Eternal Strands is a game that you are looking forward to, make sure to wishlist it on your chosen platform. The game will be arriving on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5, with the game due to be released in 2025. Currently, there is no set release date, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491410/Eternal_Strands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the page for the game</a> is available for intrigued people to explore.</p>

As part of the launch push, Blizzard invited Wccftech and a couple of colleagues from other publications to a roundtable Q&amp;A with Associate Art Director Tina Wang and Lead Encounter Designer Michael Nuthals, who answered a great many questions on art, raids, dungeons, and more pertaining to the tenth expansion pack for the acclaimed MMORPG (which is also about to celebrate its 20th anniversary). You can find the full transcript below.</p>

<p><strong>Heather Newman (PC Gamer/Forbes): I'll pitch a question to Tina. In terms of the art direction for The War Within, I think folks have talked a lot about Hallowfall and some of the cool things that are happening there. I would love to hear from you about Ringing Deeps and the efforts that you specifically made to make that zone feel perhaps a little bit less oppressive and cavern-like than recent underground zones that we've had.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tina Wang:</strong> Absolutely. The Ringing Deeps is a fun one because it is the first zone where we go underground, right? You start at the top and then go to the Ringing Deeps. We did want to meet that subterranean fantasy to some degree where you're creating the sense of caverns, but again, not create something that's super oppressive or claustrophobic to the player. We initially described it as a bit of a mix of Black Rock Depths plus Maraudon. These are some traditional places that maybe some vanilla World of Warcraft players would have recognized.</p>
<p>But there's this idea that there's tons of Earthen industry embedded in this space, and we're constantly looking for ways to create atmosphere and light sources. So in those spaces, we added tons of lava falls, there's these giant buildings, and also in a lot of the places of the Ringing Deeps, if you look up, you'll see that there's these layers of rock that lead to a brightness above. It's this idea that because you're in the first layer, you are close to the surface.</p>
<p>We also created these locations that feel like cenotes. There are incredible pictures of massive underground caves with greenery, mists, and moss, and we really wanted to put that out there for players to experience. So you get the lava, the nature aspect of things, and we really love how we mesh that together.</p>
<p><strong>Kazuma Hashimoto (Siliconera): This is actually an encounter-specific question. I'm a very new adopter of World of Warcraft; I started playing last year. I did a lot of Savage raiding in Final Fantasy XIV 14. I've noticed that going into the Mythic tier for World of Warcraft, things can be hard to understand without addons or some sort of visual indicator.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I'm wondering if the team has considered or designed these new raids and encounters with the consideration that you might have an overlap of new players coming in from other MMOs. What's being done to accommodate those new players, whether it be making things more accessible without addons (I don't play with addons) or better legibility in terms of raid mechanics?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael</strong> <strong>Nuthals:</strong> Yeah, this is something that we on the encounter team take really seriously. We really want our players to be able to understand the mechanics that are happening. We have some conventions, right? There's a swirl on the ground. That means, maybe, don't stand here. It might be bad real soon. Or, there's this visual that looks almost there's like a fire coming out of the middle of it, but it's pulsing away from it. That means clump up because it's going to split the damage. So we're trying to create consistent language to communicate with the players.</p>
<p>One piece of feedback we consistently hear is that they should be able to read those visuals against the background of the art itself and make sure they pop. For Nerub-ar Palace and all of the dungeons, we've actually worked with our visual effects team and our dungeon art team to identify what our color palette is going to be for this boss.</p>
<p>Is this boss going to use a lot of fire and lightning attacks? We probably shouldn't use like really matching floor textures, right? So, really, letting those things stand out and pop against it. We also talk a lot about communicating over a lot of different channels. We want to have a cool audio effect along with maybe a raid warning along with the visual so that players can see what's happening and learn that language and then be able to react to that language.</p>
<p>One of the things I love is being able to learn how a fight plays out. Understand how to pull the boss, wiping because we didn't know we ran into something we couldn't overcome, learning how to overcome that, working with my team and then progressing past that the next time. So making failure clear is really important to us.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'For The War Within, one of the things that we did in Hallowfall was something that we had never done before. Hallowfall has this giant glowing crystal placed on one side of the zone, and there's a falloff to it because it's not like sunlight, right? With sunlight, you get this very direct light. Everything that it hits casts a shadow. So something that we had to do here was make it so that it was only getting the direct light in a certain falloff around it so that we were still able to create the depth of the caverns. We also added some improvements that helped us achieve that glow from the crystal. I think that's one of those things that maybe if you aren't looking for it, you don't know that notice it's like a graphic improvement, but it really helps make Hallowfall feel as unique as it is.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>ALESSIO PALUMBO (WCCFTECH): Is there any brand new graphics effect that you have introduced with The War Within or perhaps improved specifically for this expansion that you are proud of?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tina Wang:</strong> With World of Warcraft, with every expansion we're trying to add new improvements. I know people like to comment that it's an older engine, but it's always being evolved. For The War Within specifically, one of the things that we did in Hallowfall was something that we had never done before. Hallowfall has this giant glowing crystal placed on one side of the zone, and there's a falloff to it because it's not like sunlight, right?</p>
<p>With sunlight, you get this very direct light. Everything that it hits casts a shadow. So something that we had to do here was make it so that it was only getting the direct light in a certain falloff around it so that we were still able to create the depth of the caverns, feeling like there's that darkness to it, creating that sense of being near the light is what is so important to the Arathi and where it's safe.</p>
<p>We also added some improvements that helped us achieve that glow from the crystal. I think that's one of those things that maybe if you aren't looking for it, you don't know that notice it's like a graphic improvement, but it really helps make Hallowfall feel as unique as it is.</p>
<p><strong>Heather Newman (PC Gamer/Forbes): Michael, as we're looking at the new 18-month timeline that was sketched out for us for the expansions that will make up the three-part Worldsoul Saga, one of the questions that I hear all the time is from raiders wondering, okay, does this mean that we're still getting what has become the traditional three tiers of raiding plus some kind of end of expansion kind of cycle, or does this mean that we're talking about the possibility maybe of cutting back to two or some other combination? Can you settle that for us?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael</strong> <strong>Nuthals: </strong>I can't do that today. I don't want to talk too much about the future, but I can say we have a very exciting Nerub-ar raid coming up here. Players will be able to take the fight directly to Queen Ansurek, a surrogate of Xal'atath. I don't know if you had a chance to see the 2D animation that was recently released featuring Xal'atath behind me here.</p>
<p>Being able to go and delve deep into the Nerubian kind of culture and seeing how they fight and being able to square off against the queen of their people is a very cool opportunity. I'm very excited to hear how players the reception that we're going to get from that. We're also adding an opportunity for players who aren't as comfortable venturing in with a group.</p>
<p>We're giving players the option to see the end boss through what we're calling story mode, and this is a chance for players to be able to play along with a couple of NPC buddies and really encounter Ansurek and be able to play the story and experience this end that they may have only been able to see maybe through third party websites in the past. Now, they can get in there and really play the story and be able to defeat Ansurek themselves. Maybe it gives them the courage to jump in on LFR Normal and see it with a group of friends. That's what I'm most excited about. We've got some cool stuff coming in raiding.</p>
<p><strong>Kazuma Hashimoto (Siliconera): This is an art question, actually. In that fantastic CGI trailer for The War Within, we see the Harronir and the dwarves and everything. I want to talk a little bit about what the team does to portray these cultures and really add a sense of depth to them. For example, the trolls were doing a tribal dance that you would typically see associated with tribes in South Africa. What real life inspirations has the art team taken and injected into World of Warcraft for this expansion?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tina Wang:</strong> When we work on expansions, when we work on new cultures, we have this really cool group, BlizzU, and so we get researchers or experts in their specific fields to come and chat with us about their area of expertise. For instance, for The War Within, we initially had one about exploring caves, and we recently had another about crystals. When it comes to different cultures, those are also cases where we consult experts in various spaces to hear from them as well.</p>
<p><strong>Kazuma Hashimoto(Siliconera): How deep does that go in relation to what Blizzard does to really nail the potential cultural sensitivity within portraying specific cultures? For example, how involved are these consultants? Do they look at art assets? Do they look at narrative things to help add and provide feedback?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tina Wang:</strong> Depending on what it is, there's a variety there. Certainly across Blizzard, especially in games like Overwatch, where it's very specific to a culture that they choose to represent of the real world, it gets very deep. Whereas on World of Warcraft, oftentimes we're taking bits of inspiration from places. We're never trying to represent a culture very directly, right? But we do want to make sure that when we take inspiration, we are doing that from an informed place.</p>
<p><strong>Heather Newman (PC Gamer/Forbes): I'll jump in on the crystals thing. Do you have a specific example, something you heard during the consultation, and you were like, oh, this is great. We can build this in here.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tina Wang:</strong> Oh, I think that happens all the time. For instance, another one that we did during The War Within was a virtual forge tour because there were a lot of forges in Earthen culture. With arachnophobia, this was another one where we consulted an arachnophobia expert, so we added this accessibility mode in World of Warcraft that changes spider-like beasts. We received a lot of information that informed some testing that we did, such as the angle of the legs, the number of legs, the presence of fangs, and things like that.</p>
<p>One of the examples was that the crabs, when it comes to testing the phobia, even though they seem spider-like to the casual observer, when it comes to phobias, it makes a huge difference. Then we also reinforced that message through user testing as well.</p>
<p><b>Heather Newman (PC Gamer/Forbes): Who was it, or how was it, that the idea of replacing with crabs specifically came up and not some other creature?</b></p>
<p><strong>Tina Wang:</strong> It was because of that initial consultation with the arachnophobia expert of crabs specifically. Their shape, the angle of their legs, and the way they move don't trigger it. We did some testing, and also, anecdotally, people were saying, oh, crabs would be less scary. We had so many of those models, right? We already have crabs. We already have spiders. It was very easy for us to do those tests.</p>
<p><strong>ALESSIO PALUMBO (WCCFTECH): I wanted to ask about dungeons, specifically follower dungeons. I understand there are four in The War Within, correct? Do you have plans to add more post-launch, and also, do you have any plans to expand the possibility of using NPC followers to regular dungeons at some point if the community asks for it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael</strong> <strong>Nuthals: </strong>First of all, I am very excited about follower dungeons. This is a really cool opportunity that we introduced in season four of Dragonflight of being able to do a dungeon solo and then having NPC buddies help you make your way through the dungeon. Similar to story mode, this is an opportunity for players who don't feel comfortable maybe going into a group as a way of being able to engage with all the cool storytelling we're doing in dungeons.</p>
<p>Tina's team makes awesome stuff, and we want every player to be able to see all that cool stuff, while our team makes really cool, engaging gameplay. We want players to interact with that in a fun and engaging way. I'm just really excited about being able to open that up to a broader audience.</p>
<p>As for future plans, I'm really curious to see how players engage with it. I'm excited to hear what players want, and then we can make choices based on what we hear from our players.</p>
<p><strong>Heather Newman (PC Gamer/Forbes): Quick question for you, Michael, that almost plays off of that previous question. As we look at the new structure for Mythic Plus and the idea that above level 10 folks are no longer going to be seeing those cool visual and gameplay-related affixes, are you feeling any angst there about the fact that the folks who play Mythic Plus dungeons the most are, at some point, relatively quickly, one would assume, not going to be seeing your work in those specific spaces at all?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael</strong> <strong>Nuthals: </strong>Yeah, great question. We're really targeting and reacting to player feedback. As we hit keystone level 12, Xal'atath removes the affixes, and you're left with a combination of tyrannical and fortified. The feedback we've been hearing is that players who are engaging with content at that level want that repeatability. There's a desire to be able to master the dungeon, whereas the players who are engaging between keystone levels 2 and 10 are players who we're injecting that variety for because that's what we have shown so far.</p>
<p>Those players are interested in getting that different experience week over week, and we think most players are going to be living in that world where they're getting that variety every week. As we designed the Mythic Plus system, we're catering to two different segments of the audience.</p>
<p><strong>Tina</strong> <strong>Wang:</strong> In terms of thinking about the affixes, I see them more as just a layer on top, right? They're a layer on top of what I, maybe with bias, see as the star of World of Warcraft, which is really the world, these bespoke places that we built. Then, as Mike mentioned previously, by creating follower dungeons and story modes, it allows so many different players to experience the time we invest into crafting these locations and allows us to invest more time into them, too, as we know more players are able to see them.</p>
<div>
<p><strong><span>Kazuma Hashimoto (Siliconera): T</span>his is more like a generalist question. You mentioned that World of Warcraft is adding the follower aspect to dungeons where you can run through with NPCs and everything, like a story mode. This is a hot topic in MMO communities about MMOs becoming more focused on single player experiences. Do you think that this will potentially impact the community in a negative way and prevent players from more or less cultivating the communities that they've had in MMOs by implementing this feature into dungeons?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tina</strong> <strong>Wang:</strong> With the follower dungeons, it's really more of a way to experience a story. For instance, in terms of the rewards that you can get, if you're a reward-focused player, that's not going to resolve that avenue for you. You mentioned Delves in terms of a new track of content that we've added to our reward track, where, yes, we are trying to look at all the different ways that different players like to play the game and create segments of content that work well for them.</p>

<p>With raids, we have a very large-scale, organized multi-hour content. With dungeons, it's more like a 30-minute experience, but it's an organized five-person set group, whereas Delves is much more open-ended and flexible because we already see players who play the game that way. We want to give those players a way to continue to feel like they can be part of that endgame reward track. Something I'm excited about is when it comes to heroic raiding some players do choose other avenues of gearing up for it. A lot of times, what we've heard is that players felt forced to do Mythic Plus dungeons, even though that wasn't for them. They're like, I like these 20 friends that I hang out with weekly, but I don't want to find five people and do this stressful experience. So we think Delves will benefit group content in that way as well.</p>

<figure><figcaption>'I'm incredibly excited to see players reach and defeat Queen Ansurek. That's an encounter that is, I think, really cool and different and something the players haven't seen yet because we've played our cards close to the chest. It's really exciting to me because that encounter is layered. There's kind of like different platforms and how players are going to traverse through the space is different than we've ever done before in World of Warcraft. It's a different way of progressing an encounter through this verticality, really inspired by the spiders that the Nerubians are based on.'</figcaption></figure>
</div>
<p><strong>ALESSIO PALUMBO (WCCFTECH): Let me ask about raids specifically. Is there anything specific that you're excited for raiders to, to find out about the world within and that you were able to introduce or improve or previous raids from earlier expansions?</strong></p>
<div>

<p><strong>Michael</strong> <strong>Nuthals: </strong>I'm incredibly excited to see players reach and defeat Queen Ansurek. That's an encounter that is, I think, really cool and different and something the players haven't seen yet because we've played our cards close to the chest. We're not showing that on any of our public playtests. Our internal QA team is tuning it right now. They're working on polishing it up. It's really exciting to me because that encounter is layered. There's kind of like different platforms and how players are going to traverse through the space is different than we've ever done before in World of Warcraft. It's a different way of progressing an encounter through this verticality, really inspired by the spiders that the Nerubians are based on. They can climb up walls and they can get around in ways that maybe we, as the players, can't. So it's interesting to see how we're going to be able to get around that space to keep up with Queen Ansurek. That's one encounter I'm super excited about.</p>

<p>Another encounter I'm really excited about is in one of our dungeons, the Dawnbreaker. The final boss of that is this kind of Nerubian beast, like a mutated dragonfly thing. It's really cool. Players, as they're doing that dungeon, chase it down and are able to defeat it. But they don't slay it, so the thing retreats. As players make their way through the Nerub-ar palace, as they make their way deep into the Queen's lair, they come across this unassuming bridge. Could be anything under there. That's when the flyer appears and it's back with a vengeance, ready to take out the players. So that's a really cool space for fighting on long bridge and you're traversing across the platform as the boss moves around the space. It's a really cool, engaging way, and it lets players flex their movement abilities and get around the space in interesting ways.</p>

<p><strong>ALESSIO PALUMBO (WCCFTECH): Do you believe these raids will be tougher to beat? Will hardcore players take longer to beat them, or do you expect a similar amount of time to do the World First kill?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Michael</strong> <strong>Nuthals: </strong>We have our own internal tuning targets that we're hoping to shoot for. We really want a satisfying experience for the players who are doing the race to World First. The folks who are doing Mythic should have a satisfying experience. The race to cutting-edge Heroic-level guilds, right? They should have a fun experience, right? And feel like they have a chance to get their toe into the raid and then meet challenges and overcome those challenges. We're hoping for a really well-paced, executed experience there.</p>

<p><strong>Kazuma Hashimoto (Siliconera): I saw that half-elf customization was datamined for The War Within. If that is a real thing, will we actually see more character customizations across the board for biracial characters? Given that we do have a pretty healthy amount of biracial characters in the story now, and one being featured prominently within The War Within.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tina</strong> <strong>Wang:</strong> I'm not gonna call it half-elf because we think of it more as just a touch of elven heritage. They're not half-elves, necessarily. But that is something that we've discussed, whether that's something that we do give to the player. Nothing to share today, though, about additional customizations. I do want to real quick, though, shout out one of my favorite parts of the Arathi, which is that they have lynxes, which is also that fallback to the touch of mixing and hanging out with elves in the past.</p>

<p><strong>Heather Newman (PC Gamer/Forbes): As we discuss the differences between Delves and follower dungeons, what is the dividing line between those two things? You could see a follower dungeon as this flexible solo type of content and one could easily see how you could bring in multiple friends or no friends at all and have your little NPC buddies or Bran in the case of Delves fo</strong><strong>r this season that will move along with you. But talk to them about whether there is a deep philosophical difference in where you see these two avenues of content heading, or is it kind of two sides of the same coin?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Michael</strong> <strong>Nuthals: </strong>When I think of follower dungeons, I think of them as a chance for players to experience the story of The War Within, right? The rookery dungeon has particular story beats we want to tell players that will lead them to discover some things about the Earthen and lead them to the story of the Ringing Deeps.</p>

<p>Delves are an adventure. We're gonna go on an adventure, set like the tier levels, so there's difficulty levels, and then once we enter into that space, there might be kobolds in it, there might be goblins in it, there might be rats with really big fangs. It's that type of thing where we're gonna have a different experience each time with maybe different environmental effects, and different events, and different bosses. That variety is the goal of Delves.</p>

<p><strong>Tina Wang:</strong> One of the key pieces here is having a progression track. Delve-focused players are catered towards players who want to play either solo or in a flexible-size group, and they'll be able to earn better rewards than those types of players have ever been able to. When I talk progression path, it's really about that weekly endgame where every week, you look forward to opening a Great Vault.</p>

<p><strong>Michael</strong> <strong>Nuthals:</strong> One of the features I like about it is that players can really push it. We have this Delve, which is similar to our end bosses. We don't test that on our beta or PTR. That's going to be the experience that players are going to be able to do once the game goes live. We've been inspired by previous solo challenges like the Mage Tower when imagining what this could be, a solo progression where you can crank the tier level up so high that you can end up doing this really cool boss encounter.</p>

<div dir="ltr">
<figure><figcaption>'I think the key here is with Torghast, our very power progression-focused players felt like they needed to do it, whereas for Delves... We have a group of players who loved doing Torghast and that's the type of people who we want to make sure we're allowing them an avenue for that endgame progression system. At the same, we do not say, hey, everyone, you have to do a Delve.'</figcaption></figure>
</div>
<p><strong>Heather Newman (PC Gamer/Forbes): One of the things about Delve specifically that strikes a lot of people is this feels a little bit like Torghast 2.0. There was some disappointment, I think, in the amount of effort that went into designing Torghast, only to find that players went through it once or as required and then maybe didn't return in the numbers that folks were hoping they would return to, because it feels like there's some real similarities there, certainly some of the gameplay mechanics in terms of powers and traps, </strong><strong>at least similarly structured as they did the first time through. But the reward level, Tina, as you say, has been tuned up quite a bit compared to Torghast, which was primarily cosmetics.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tina</strong> <strong>Wang</strong>: I think the key here is with Torghast, our very power progression-focused players felt like they needed to do it, whereas for Delves... We have a group of players who loved doing Torghast and that's the type of people who we want to make sure we're allowing them an avenue for that endgame progression system. At the same, we do not say, hey, everyone, you have to do a Delve.</p>

<p><strong>Michael</strong> <strong>Nuthals:</strong> We really want folks to be able to find the pieces of World of Warcraft that engage them and let them explore the world in a way that they're comfortable with. We want to have an opportunity for everyone to find their place in World of Warcraft.</p>

<p><strong>Tina Wang: </strong>It's a big piece of really listening to our players, seeing what they're doing, and meeting them where they're at. That's also another piece of why we chose to make this really major technological investment into Warbands, changing the infrastructure of how we've structured the game really, because we see that nowadays players play multiple characters. It's very common.</p>

<p><strong>Kazuma Hashimoto: I wanted to ask about the collaborative nature between the art team and the encounter team. You mentioned how those bespoke, beautiful environments for each dungeon are created and what goes into the environmental storytelling of each dungeon because that's something that I really love about World of Warcraft so far. I'm going through Wrath, I'm going through Shadowlands, and I'm just like, all of this stuff is actually story-relevant to everything I'm playing and actually has some sort of nod to something that goes as far back as Warcraft 1 or Warcraft 3.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Michael</strong> <strong>Nuthals:</strong> Ultimately, the world of Azeroth is the star of World of Warcraft. It's in the name. So making the world shine and feel like a place that makes sense and belongs and has history is really important. As we go through the process of building a dungeon, we want to pick the spaces that have significance. We want to go to the cool places of the world and delve in there and defeat the challenges within. We find those cool opportunities to tell a story through not just narrative or visuals, but through combat mechanics. What you're seeing, who's there, all these things are important to us as we ideate where we want to take the players. Where are our adventures going to lead us?</p>

<p><strong>Tina</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Wang:</strong> Yeah, when we kick off Dungeons and Raids, we start, for the most part, with the story. There's a narrative reason why we're going to this place, who we might encounter there, and we try to factor all that in, even to the degree of foreshadowing future things. You mentioned Shadowlands, for instance. In the Sanctum of Domination, there's a piece of one of those bosses in that raid. If you actually look out the window, you see that he's pulled a piece of a continent from a different location of Shadowlands and that location was actually a piece of Zereth Mortis, which is in our next patch. We're constantly adding these details to inject more of that storytelling.</p>

<div dir="ltr">
<figure><figcaption>'What I can say is that the Shadow Priest already has hints of the Void coming in from the edges. Xal'atath here started as a Shadow Priest artifact in Legion. I believe it was the Blade of the Black Empire and through the Shadow Priest and the Whispers, and through the events of Battle for Azeroth, we released Xal'atath from that blade. So there's a lot of connection there between the kind of that priest order hall that's led us to the story that now is Xal'atath as we're starting to see it unfold in World of Warcraft: The War Within.'</figcaption></figure>
</div>
<p><strong>Kazuma Hashimoto (Siliconera): I have another follow-up question. One of the talent trees for, I believe it's the priest, almost pays homage to Xal'atath in the way that it's like a void priest, right? As someone who plays a Frost Death Knight, it's really cool that I get to cast Remorseless Winter and do all the animations Arthas does because I'm still stuck in Warcraft 3. Are we going to see potentially any of her skills make it into that specific talent tree? Are we going to be able to cast some of her skills or have things that pay homage to this really interesting boss?</strong></p>

</div>
<p><strong>Michael Nuthals:</strong> Who's to say as we go deeper into this, right? But what I can say is that the Shadow Priest already has hints of the Void coming in from the edges.</p>
<p>Xal'atath here started as a Shadow Priest artifact in Legion. I believe it was the Blade of the Black Empire and through the Shadow Priest and the Whispers, and through the events of Battle for Azeroth, we released Xal'atath from that blade. So there's a lot of connection there between the kind of that priest order hall that's led us to the story that now is Xal'atath as we're starting to see it unfold in World of Warcraft: The War Within.</p>
<p><strong>Tina</strong> <strong>Wang:</strong> There's a bit of that element that the flavor of Void that she uses, cosmic Void, is reflected in some of the abilities. So in that degree, yeah, artistically, visually.</p>
<p><strong>ALESSIO PALUMBO (WCCFTECH): I wanted to ask Tina about something art related, specifically whether the team has looked into potentially adding some additional cutting edge technologies. For example, with the Shadowlands expansion, you <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-showcases-world-of-warcraft-shadowlands-ray-tracing-and-vrs-ahead-of-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> ray traced shadows to World of Warcraft, but that was a while ago. Is that something you are still looking into? Something else on that note is also support for HDR displays. Is that something you might be interested in adding in the future?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tina Wang:</strong> So, there is nothing to announce today, but we are continuously looking at ways to improve the engine and the way that we do it. We're continuing to look into those things over time for sure. Sorry for no specific details.</p>
<p><strong>Heather Newman (PC Gamer/Forbes): This is a question again about Mythic Plus and specifically about representation. If you look at the very highest levels, clearly, there is a defined meta that settles in as the season progresses, and folks tend to lean towards playing that meta. But even considering that, there are certain specs and, in some cases, certain classes that don't show up. Which seems to indicate, at least to me, that probably classes are not perfectly balanced when it comes to play in Mythic Plus even setting aside that pack mentality. </strong></p>
<p><strong>How important is it to you as you think about the mechanics you design, as you think about the difficulty attributed to each of those mechanics that there is some kind of representation that is inclusive across all classes, and how much of it is, you know what, if they're playing at the title level, they've got to be able to play whatever fits the current suite of dungeons and that's just part of the gameplay?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Nuthals:</strong> We really want to see good representation. We wanna give players opportunities. When we think about building mechanics, we're thinking about giving players a reason to hit all the cool buttons on their keyboard that the class designers have given them as an encounter designer building an encounter. That means that we should be offering challenges for everyone. The goal is that maybe one class is better at this mechanic or boss, right? Or maybe this affix encourages certain players or certain classes or specs to be better there. And that texture is what's important. It's making sure that no one class or spec is the quintessential best. But that you want to assemble a team of people who can be successful. That's ultimately the goal.</p>
<p><strong>Heather Newman (PC Gamer/Forbes): How successful do you feel like you've been?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael</strong> <strong>Nuthals:</strong> I think we've been pretty successful in tuning the bars where the damage meters lie. I think there's always room for improvement, and this is where we lean on our players. The Season 1 affix changes are a reaction to listening to player feedback and wanting to change something to help address some of the community's concerns. I think the most important thing is that we are listening and we're going to be tuning as we go in.</p>
<p>I'm just really excited for players to get in there so I can start listening. I always think of this first couple of weeks post-expansion as a chance to really listen to the players and start getting that feedback to help inform what kind of changes we want to make as we start to build the next cool stuff for our players. It's always that opportunity to just be informed and try and meet the players where they are.</p>
<p><strong>Tina</strong> <strong>Wang:</strong> Like you mentioned,&nbsp; the most important thing is that it's balanced for the vast majority of players. Then maybe there's outliers and that's something that should be discussed further, but as long as the bulk of the way that players play the game, as long as we get good representation in that front, I feel like that's most important.</p>
<p><strong>ALESSIO PALUMBO (WCCFTECH): Michael talked about community feedback. Since the pre-patch update for World of Warcraft: The War Within went live a few weeks ago, I wanted to ask what kind of feedback you got from the community about those features released as part of the pre-patch update.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tina Wang:</strong> Yeah, there was a good amount of feedback on the pre-patch event, and we're really glad that we were able to respond as quickly as we did. It can sometimes be difficult for us to balance it in our internal testing and estimations of how quickly a huge horde of players is going to eliminate every mob in the area. It's an example of us paying very close attention to when stuff like that gets put out.</p>
<p><strong>ALESSIO PALUMBO (WCCFTECH): How did the community react to Warbands and dynamic flight so far?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tina Wang:</strong> I think very positive on the Warbands. It's a huge quality of life improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Nuthals:</strong> I was gonna say I love seeing folks riding around on their Ashes of Alar because we've been able to expand the set of mounts that are able to be used with skyriding. I saw an Ashes fly by me the other day. I was like, that's awesome. I better go kill Kael'thas again for the 30th time. It's really cool to soar through the old world, too and just like zip around on my - I tend to use a Griffin myself, as I play a lot of Dwarf. So, soaring on a Griffin, I'm channeling my inner Wildhammer dwarf. It's really cool. I love skyriding.</p>
<p><strong>Kazuma Hashimoto (Siliconera): I've been looking at a lot of community reception to previous expansions, specifically with Shadowlands, and all the gear that was available then, and all the transmogs, and in general player reception to what has been available. For The War Within, will players have access to more class-specific transmogs that actually represent that class? For example, Hunters having access to things that look more Hunter-like instead of just more generic plate armor and Priests having things that look closer to Priest roes and everything, especially with the inclusion of the Arathi.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tina Wang:</strong> Oh, yeah, absolutely. Something that we did in World of Warcraft: The War Within with our tier sets is that they're all geared toward class fantasy instead of a specific raid theme. We're very excited because there are some really awesome themes out there. Like the Hunter, the tier set that we did for them, the theme of it is like a trophy hunter. They've got these awesome skulls and just like relics on the armor. Plus there's a hint of this green poison, which is a call to how Hunters have the serpent sting ability. We also have a Mage set that's like a Kirin Tor Mage. We want to lean into specific themes about the Mage.</p>
<p><strong>Heather Newman (PC Gamer/Forbes): I'll ask a follow-up question to something that you mentioned pretty early on, Michael, which is the design of visual and audio cues to help people understand what's happening in specifically raid encounters, I think. So, one of the things that has been a hot discussion topic over the past couple of tiers has been the use of private auras.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We just had a major shakeup in the API approach that's affecting both dungeons and rage just in the most recent patch push, which may be some oddity from transitioning between beta and launch, but it certainly got folks in a tizzy this morning. Talk to me about the philosophy in terms of how much you want people to have to rely on addons and is the encouragement at this point to say, hey, we want you guys to try things without them.</strong></p>
<p><b>Because it seems like the player-based response has been, we'll do that funky macro plus addon thing where people just push the button when they see stuff happen, and then it'll just be as if the addon could read it to begin with.</b></p>
<p><strong>Michael</strong> <strong>Nuthals:</strong> What a great topic. When we think about private auras, I think the ultimate goal is to encourage players to look at the world around them, take in the information, and make decisions based on what's happening in real time and when adding a private aura encourages enough consternation that players feel like they need to work around it, that's where we might re- evaluate the need for a private aura. For example Sometimes private or work really well.</p>
<p>For example, Blaze on for Rock is a great example of a private aura, but everybody understood that this giant line coming off of me is probably bad, and I don't want to stand in it. You know where folks needed to go to the macros to problem-solve, right? That's maybe an instance where we could reevaluate whether or not we're getting what we want out of it.</p>
<p>We want players to really be focused and have a good time playing the encounters and looking at the world and being in the world. Ideally, we would have players focused on just what kind of information they have in the game, but in a world of addons and weak auras and communication, we should, where it is egregious, meet the players where they are.</p>
<p><strong>Alessio Palumbo (WCCFTECH): An easy last question from me. I wanted to ask you which World of Warcraft: The War Within dungeon is your favorite and why.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tina Wang:</strong> This is a very hard question! Probably the Dawnbreaker. I really think that I love the Arathi culture that we built, and then the airships themselves are just so cool. The fight itself is really unique too, where you get to fight out that new flyer creature, right? Where, so there's fun new animations for that as well. So yeah, again, I'm going to go with the Dawnbreaker.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Nuthals:</strong> I love all the dungeons. But if I have to pick one, I'm gonna go with Cinderbrew Meadery. It's probably the one I am gonna pick here. This is an Earthen kind of meadery that was taken over by goblins. We have the fun whimsy of goblins meeting the seriousness of the Earthen and there's there's Goblin bee cowboys, like riding fire bees that they're trying to turn into mead. There's like an ale elemental. It's just a ton of fun and that, to me, really leans into the humor that our wow.</p>
<p><strong>Heather Newman (PC Gamer/Forbes): One more quick yes or no question. Michael, are we going to see the return of Mythic-only phases for end bosses and raids anytime soon? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Nuthals:</strong> I can't say right now. There's like to do them where it makes sense, right? Where we think that there's a cool story that we want to tell and there's a cool hook that we can use. Where they make sense is the goal there.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

        <p>The rhythm is gonna get ya</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>We've been distracted by Gamescom, several game releases, the rapid dwindling of the British summer. Or I assume we have, for why else would we not have yet posted about the Steam Rhythm Fest, which began on Monday and runs until August 26th at 10am PT/6pm BRDST*.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>*British Rapidly Dwindling Summer Time.
</p>
<p>As per all Steam fests, this one offers a collection of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/category/rhythm">discounts and demos on a theme</a>. Trombone Champ? 65% off. Crypt Of The Necrodancer? Cheaper than the cost of a mouth organ. Rhythm Doctor? A mere 10% reduced but worth every penny.

<p>On the demo front, you can give Rift Of The Necrodancer a whirl, which ditches the original game's dungeon-crawling for a Guitar Hero-ish take on musical combat. You can also try Bits &amp; Bops, which looks like it's performing firmly in the Rhythm Heaven mode.
</p>
<p>Otherwise I'd say there's less overlap than normal between unreleased games and those that have demos, but still plenty to play that I'd bet you haven't tried or heard of before. Robobeat, for example, which passed me by but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rhythm-shooter-robobeat-is-a-cyberpunk-metal-hellsinger-out-this-week-with-a-demo-still-available">impressed Nic when it was released back in May</a>.
</p>
<p>On the VR side, you'll also find a demo for the upcoming Metal: Hellsinger VR. The full game got a release date last week, October 3rd.

During the development of what was intended to be the next DLC, the game’s perhaps…overenthusiastic community managed to unearth and leak details about the narrative plans, spoiling the developers’ intentions and causing an internal rethink. And during that process, people fell in love with the idea of entirely changing directions and bringing back the original hero of 2015’s <em>Dying Light</em>, Kyle Crane, who ended the game in somewhat unfortunate circumstances. This, says Smektala, “was a boost of adrenaline, an injection of something powerful in our arms [and] almost overnight everyone had so many ideas of what we could do, things they really wanted to do to pay homage. And it exploded.”<br></p><p>While this all reads like fairly standard chatter a developer says to the press when doing PR for a game (and you’ll see the same story told on a dozen other sites this week), what doesn’t come across in text is the depth of passion with which everything was delivered. At times during my chat with the team, shortly after watching about 20 minutes of the game being played, both Smektala and Tarnacka-Polito were tearing up, stopping to take breaths, so palpable was their enthusiasm.<br></p><p>As the team moved away from the version of the new content that had been leaked and spoiled, and more toward this new Crane-focused project, eventually it was agreed that what they were making was no longer a DLC. <em>The Beast</em>, in which Crane returns after 10 years of being held and experimented upon by demented scientists, was a full game. At over 18 hours, it’s hard to argue.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="86c28dec61eb242f1ff369ff49c3ac4d" data-recommend-id="image://86c28dec61eb242f1ff369ff49c3ac4d" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man stands in an athletic jacket with his back to the viewer before a city at sunset.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>During Crane’s decade-long absence, he’s been through a lot. Exactly what is deliberately under wraps, and seemingly a large part of the game’s plot, but what we know for sure is that he was the victim of gruesome experiments in which scientists attempted to splice him with zombie DNA. Given the events that took place at the end of <em>The Following</em>, we can safely assume that one possible ending involving a nuclear warhead is no longer canon, but the other more tantalizingly suggests a Crane who has reason to be compatible with such corrupted genetics.<br></p><p>As a result, he’s now able to enter a beast mode, where his abilities and skills are enormously overpowered. This was demonstrated during a boss fight which began like something from <em>Dark Souls</em>, and ended like an unfairly matched bout in <em>Street Fighter</em>. At the beginning, Crane was taking chips out of this behemothic infected, dashing around and avoiding its massive, thumping arms, whittling away at its health bar. As it called in other zombies to help out, the fight started becoming overwhelming, at which point the Techland demonstrator opted to use Crane’s (limited) beastly powers. At this point the fight was a wholly different affair, Crane now taking chunks out of his foe, picking up vast concrete blocks and lobbing them at the blighter’s head, and made quick work of him. It’s certainly going to change players’ approach.<br></p><p>It’s worth adding that what was shown of <em>The Beast</em> also looked nothing like an overgrown DLC, and that’s in a huge part because of a massive step forward in fidelity. <em>Dying Light 2 </em>was a <em>beautiful</em> game, but <em>The Beast</em> is on a whole other level. That’s in large part due to the extraordinary new weather effects shown in my hands-off demo, with a heavy downpour that felt far more a part of the world than I’ve seen a game manage before. Then, surprising me further, rather than just stopping in that traditional gaming way where God flicks a switch, instead the rain began to slow as patches of blue appeared between the clouds, before it all slowly cleared up. This is, the team told me, dynamic, the game able to introduce weather at its whim, alongside the scripted moments.<br></p><p>This is all a part of an effort to give the new valley location a unique feel following on from the sunnier climes of the previous games. It has the feel of the Pacific Northwest, a fog-ridden and autumnal world still gloriously lit by sunshine, but prone to storms that add a gloom that feels appropriate given the darker nature of our character. “The sound as well,” adds art lead Katarzyna Tarnacka-Polito. “The sound of the rain, I think it’s going to add a lot to the experience.” Again, as I relay this to you, I hear how this reads like the granular details that obsess developers but rarely trouble players, but Tarnacka-Polito is really underselling the impact. When it rains, it affects all the sounds in the game, dulling impacts, with everything re-recorded appropriately. It’s the kind of detail players are unlikely to consciously notice, but—like how a David Fincher film shot through a silver gel feels so much more sullen—it has a significant aesthetic impact.<br></p><p>“Our audio department is crazy,” says Smektala. “When they record combat sounds they take this huge chunk of meat that they hit with many objects. When we worked on <em>The Following </em>[the expansion for the first game], set in more open areas, they were recording what they called ‘the sounds of silence’ in fields, so definitely crazy guys. Every aspect is changed and evolved.”</p><p>“I don’t know if you noticed in the demo,” added Tarnacka-Polito, “but the rain sounds different depending on where you are. If you’re standing knee-deep in the water, or if you’re standing in the woods, it sounds completely different. I was not expecting that!”</p><figure id="" data-id="fa8c0cf4394ff0436a77eaa50bf4c37c" data-recommend-id="image://fa8c0cf4394ff0436a77eaa50bf4c37c" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A first-person view of a rifle being fired and blood spurting from the figure being shot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A first-person view of a rifle being fired and blood spurting from the figure being shot." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Techland</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fa8c0cf4394ff0436a77eaa50bf4c37c" data-recommend-id="image://fa8c0cf4394ff0436a77eaa50bf4c37c" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A first-person view of a rifle being fired and blood spurting from the figure being shot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Where previous <em>Dying Light</em> games have really focused on the series’ trademark parkour, seeing you leap from rooftop to rooftop before dropping into grisly melee battles with the infinite hordes of undead, <em>The Beast</em> looks to be attempting to mix this up too, with the demo showing Kyle take advantage of environmental elements as he attempted to take on rooms packed with zombies (setting oil patches on fire to burn them, then hooking them up to a generator to add electricity to the mix), as well as some surprising FPS gunplay. The developers were keen to make clear this wasn’t a sea-change, but rather an additional element, used when taking on heavily armed human enemies who are controlling large bases. They have the firepower, so once you take it from them, it’s yours to use with a liberal glee that hasn’t ever been possible before in a series that relies so heavily on your improvising weapons from the junk you find lying around. And despite these moments of bullet-happy frivolity, Techland also stressed that this would mark a return to the far more survival-focused nature of the original game, rather than <em>Dying Light 2</em>’s more generous, somewhat easier approach.</p><p>Oh, and there are vehicles now as well! Given the studio’s experience in the racing genre, with pre-2010 series like <em>FIM Speedway</em> and <em>Xpand Rally</em>, this was something they felt very comfortable adding, but again made clear this wasn’t going to massively change the way you play. Driving, we were told, is a dangerous choice, with fuel extremely rare, cars very vulnerable to attack, and the chances of breaking down in the worst possible places very high.</p><figure id="" data-id="e520db3b5715778d5ca5cb16a75c7c99" data-recommend-id="image://e520db3b5715778d5ca5cb16a75c7c99" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A first-person view of clambering on a rooftop in a city at sunset (or sunrise) while a zombie appears to be in pursuit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A first-person view of clambering on a rooftop in a city at sunset (or sunrise) while a zombie appears to be in pursuit." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Techland</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e520db3b5715778d5ca5cb16a75c7c99" data-recommend-id="image://e520db3b5715778d5ca5cb16a75c7c99" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A first-person view of clambering on a rooftop in a city at sunset (or sunrise) while a zombie appears to be in pursuit." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But one thing that isn’t changing is the voice of Kyle Crane. Roger Craig Smith, who played the lead role in 2015, is a voice you know. He’s Batman in <em>Arkham Origins</em>, Mirage in <em>Apex Legends</em>, Ezio in <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, and more than anything else, he’s Sonic in just about everything <em>Sonic</em> (except for the movies) for the last decade. His agreeing to return to play a part he’d assumed was gone for good, given how things had ended ten years earlier, was crucial for the whole project. It was to Techland’s enormous relief that he was up for it. In fact, he was delighted to do it.<br></p><p>Over the years, I’ve learned that it’s not likely that a voice actor will have played the games they’ve acting in, and asking questions can lead to awkward places. But here, it was Smith who dove into memories of playing the original <em>Dying Light</em>, enthusiastically remembering a moment when Crane climbed the enormous tower, and the sound of the wind began to whip around him, and how he experienced a sense of vertigo. “I literally got queasy in my stomach. I realized how high up I was at that moment.” Even he was bubbling with excitement about making this game.<br></p><p>The Kyle Crane we meet in <em>The Beast</em> is, as mentioned, not the same man, and it was really important to everyone involved that this be demonstrated in his voice. After some early recording sessions, Smith said that Smektala gave him feedback, saying it wasn’t yet right. Without naming names, he said that he’s worked with other studios whose direction would be no more than, “Yeah, just do it like you did!” “It’s not a service to the fans,” said the actor, “so it’s always neat to be a part of something where you’ve got people who are so passionate, dedicated to wanting to get it right.”</p><p>Did he get to go beast mode in the recording booth? He laughs and says yes, talks about the fun of doing the transitions, and adds, “You can only go there so many times before your voice is trashed. So we’ve been very strategic in how we’re doing the sessions, saying ‘Hey, this is going to be a lot of effort. Are we doing the Beast? OK, we’ll save that to the end.’”<br></p><p>And he’s not the only one who’s glad he’s back. Tarnacka-Polito looked at Smith and said, “When we make the game and we play it, over and over again, for hundreds of hours, and hearing you in my head for so long—when I heard you again for the first time, after so long, was [gulps] <em>so</em> powerful.”</p><p>It’s a lot of fun to be in a room with developers who are so genuinely hyped about their own game. At events like Gamescom, you meet a lot of developers going through the motions, saying the PR-approved statements until your regimented slot is up, then doing it over and over, all day long. Perhaps I got lucky by seeing them early in the week, but their passion was so palpable, it was infectious.</p><p>It’s too early to say if that will translate to the experience of playing the game. This was all hands-off, and as impressive as it all looked, so much will depend on seeing if the game maintains that crucial sense of flow and fear that has made the previous games well worth playing, while adding in so many new elements.</p><p>But in an impressive move, those who bought the ultimate edition of <em>Dying Light II</em> won’t have to pay to find out. In a move that very sensibly prevents what could have been a tiresome debacle, despite the game being a mutation of what was once meant to be a DLC, Techland are honoring the original intention of the project and giving it for free to those customers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Some of these weapons take on even greater meaning as players use them throughout the years, and become core parts of their online personas. Few parts of this armory are as beloved as the Gjallarhorn.</p><p>A rocket launcher fashioned out of the armor of fallen guardians, the Gjallarhorn has been a staple of <em>Destiny </em>since the very beginning, and both the developers and community have never been able to let it go, making it unsurprising that there’s now an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://numskull.com/products/destiny-exotic-weapon-gjallarhorn&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://numskull.com/products/destiny-exotic-weapon-gjallarhorn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">official replica being sold</a></span>. </p><p>To be fair, it’s hard to give up a weapon so potent. The Gjallarhorn sports an Exotic perk called Wolfpack Rounds, which splits the payload into a cluster of heat-seeking missiles. So whatever finds itself on the opposite end of the gold-festooned barrel of a Gjallarhorn falls pretty quickly. Over the years, it has remained an alternative for raiding parties that need to pass difficult DPS checks, but it’s also just funny to occasionally whip it out and just annihilate unsuspecting players in competitive matches. <em>Destiny </em>wouldn’t quite be the same without the Gjallarhorn, and it even has a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1eug13x/gjallarhorn_day_2024_has_concluded_heres_how_you/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1eug13x/gjallarhorn_day_2024_has_concluded_heres_how_you/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">holiday among the community members</a></span>.</p><p>Now, thanks to Numskull Designs, which has previously released a replica of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://numskull.com/products/destiny-weapons-ace-of-spades&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://numskull.com/products/destiny-weapons-ace-of-spades" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another one of <em>Destiny</em>’s most famous weapons</a></span>, you can bring all (almost) 18 inches of the Gjallarhorn home to prominently display for $100. From the images alone, it looks like a stunning recreation of the in-game weapon, and even appears to come in a display case that makes an appropriately big deal of it. After all, the Gjallarhorn has slain tons of alien kings, gods, worms, robots, dragons, etc. You name it, this thing’s laid it flat.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Developed by Firaxis, it lets you pick a leader from history to lead your people to global domination. You can build your city, populate it with architectural wonders, and expand your rule either through conquest or cooperation with your neighboring civilizations. </p><p>You have a lot of leeway in how you steer progress for your people. You can do it in a true-to-history sort of way, or you can veer off from the textbook stories to forge a path that’s all your own.</p><p>The biggest new feature in Civ 7 is that you don’t play as a single civilization from start to finish. Instead, for each run through the game, you’ll pick a new civilization to play as during each of three Ages: Antiquity, Exploration, and Modern. The only thing that stays with you as you play is the leader you’ve chosen.</p><p>Check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/civilization-7-the-first-preview">Civilization VII preview</a> for more information.</p><h2>Other Preorder Guides</h2><div><ul><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ace-attorney-investigations-collection-is-up-for-preorder-out-september-6">Ace Attorney Investigations Collection Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-physical-edition-of-alan-wake-2-is-officially-up-for-preorder-out-october-22">Alan Wake 2 (Physical) Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadow-release-date-collectors-edition">Assassin's Creed Shadows Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Astro Bot Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-editions">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sid-meiers-civilization-7-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Sid Meier's Civilization VII Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-ps5-pc-release-date-preorder-bonus">Concord Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-is-up-for-preorder">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-dragon-age-the-veilguard">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-release-date-preorder-bonus">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club-preorder-guide">Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-final-fantasy-i-vi-collection-anniversary-edition-switch-ps4">Final Fantasy I-VI Collection Anniversary Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-xbox-pc">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-luigi-brothership-switch-release-date-preorder">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-release-date-preorder">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-arcade-classics-is-up-for-preorder">Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/master-detective-archives-rain-code-plus-is-up-for-preorder">Master Detective Archives: Rain Code Plus Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Metal Gear Solid Delta Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-release-date-collectors-edition">Metaphor: ReFantazio Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-shadow-generations-preorder-guide">Sonic X Shadow Generations Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-special-editions">Star Wars Outlaws Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-party-jamboree-release-date-preorder">Super Mario Party Jamboree Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

                <p>The team working on Amazon's Lord of the Rings MMO is "still trying to find the hook" for what the game will be, according to comments Amazon Games CEO Christoph Hartmann made in a recent interview.</p><p dir="ltr">Amazon Games announced it would make a new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-aaa-lord-of-the-rings-game-is-coming/1100-6514145/" data-ref-id="1100-6514145">Lord of the Rings MMO last year in a deal with the Embracer Group</a>. The announcement followed a previous deal between Amazon and Chinese company Leyou to make an MMO out of J.R.R Tolkein's signature work. Leyou was later acquired by Tencent and the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-amazons-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-was-canceled/1100-6507052/" data-ref-id="1100-6507052">project was canceled</a>, only for the rights to later revert back to Middle-Earth Enterprises and ultimately find a home with the Embracer Group.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Interview With the Cast of Rings of Power!</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">While the game was announced last year, Hartmann in an new interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-games-still-seeking-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-christoph-hartmann-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> said the game is still in early development. As such, the team is still trying to find an angle to make the project stand out from what's come before.</p><p dir="ltr">"We're still trying to find the hook, find that idea of what it is because we don't just want to go and do the same thing over," Hartmann said. "While it's tempting sometimes with an existing IP, that's not the point of doing it."</p><p dir="ltr">Hartmann continued by saying the team needs to find a "fresh twist" to make it "different to all the other games out there."</p><p dir="ltr">His comments about trying to stand out and not repeating what's already been done makes sense considering there is currently a long-running Lord of the Rings MMO, 2007's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-lord-of-the-rings-online/" data-ref-id="5000-18298">The Lord of the Rings Online</a>, on the market that still receives new content and updates.</p><p dir="ltr">Amazon Games has made a name for itself in the MMO space in recent years, having released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/new-world/" data-ref-id="5000-489582">New World</a> in 2021 (soon to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-world-aeternum-revamps-the-mmo-for-consoles-with-solo-play-and-more-changes/1100-6524219/" data-ref-id="1100-6524219">re-released on consoles and PC as New World: Aeternum</a>). It has also published and localized Korean MMOs like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/lost-ark/" data-ref-id="5000-533053">Lost Ark</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/throne-and-liberty/" data-ref-id="5000-582820">Throne and Liberty</a> for Western audiences.</p><p dir="ltr">In the same interview, Hartmann called developing MMOs "tough," as they are expensive both to maintain and to continually develop new content for in a way that satisfies players, calling MMO players "a very dedicated audience" that "plays a lot of hours."</p><p dir="ltr">Amazon is currently "moving out of being a MMO-only publisher," Hartmann said, using the recently revealed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/king-of-meat/" data-ref-id="5000-640430">King of Meat</a>, which falls into the action-RPG genre, as an example. Hartmann also said he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-can-help-solve-game-industrys-problems-or-at-least-some-of-them-amazon-boss-says/1100-6526061/" data-ref-id="1100-6526061">believes AI can help accelerate and improve game development</a>, but that the technology won't "solve it all," even if it might help to fasten development times and lower costs.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't the first time Hartmann has talked about the Lord of the Rings MMO. He previously said the difference between <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lotro-is-not-a-bad-game-but-amazons-new-mmo-will-be-worlds-apart/1100-6514234/" data-ref-id="1100-6514234">Amazon's new MMO and the currently existing LOTRO</a> will be like going from "black and white movies to color," and that while LOTRO "isn't a bad game," players will eventually move on. </p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Amazon's The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power show will soon debut its second season--one that will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saurons-past-will-be-explored-in-lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power-season-2/1100-6526044/" data-ref-id="1100-6526044">dive into Sauron's past</a>. The Rings of Power will not be connected to Amazon's new Lord of the Rings MMO, the company has said.</p>

                <p>On August 19, Hong Kong police raided a Pokemon TCG shop that allegedly contained 16kg of methamphetamine in the designated "staff-only area."</p><p>As reported by the <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3275171/hong-kong-police-raid-pokemon-card-shop-used-drug-front-seize-hk10-million-ice" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">South China Morning Post</a>, this Pokemon TCG shop in the residential district Hung Hom would host tournaments, and trading excursions, with groups of children and teenagers playing the beloved TCG together. Though police confirmed that none of these children or teenagers were involved in the purchasing of said drugs, it was a surprise to Hong Kong Narcotics Bureau Inspector Liong Chun-Hin.</p><p>“Storing such a large quantity of narcotics in a place where teenagers and children can visit is irresponsible and disgraceful behavior that also heightens the possible risk of teenagers and children mistakenly encountering illegal drugs,” Chun-Hin told the local media.</p><p>Chun-Hin explains that the upstairs Pokemon TCG store had been operating as a storage unit for more than a month before the police had pinned down its location.</p><p>In April of last year, The Pokemon Company spoke of a <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-tcg-fusion-strike-full-art-bad-pulls-theft-1850343930" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">printing-company worker who had allegedly stolen a stack of rare cards</a> from the Fusion Strike set to sell to his local game shop. This has been considered the "largest return of stolen property to date" in the trading card game's history, according to The Pokemon Company.</p>

		<p>Lost In Random: The Eternal Die, a sequel to 2021’s Lost In Random, has been revealed by Thunderful, with the game set to release in 2025. Where the original was an action adventure title, Lost In Random: The Eternal Die will switch genres, becoming a top down rogue-lite game. How will this genre switch will go down with the fanbase of the original? You can see some of the gameplay in the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lost in Random: The Eternal Die | Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pFthLuD4aTg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Over the years, we’ve seen how&nbsp;Lost in Random&nbsp;has resonated with players worldwide, from its captivating story to its creative combat within a world of wonder and excitement,”</em> said Game Director, Martin Storm. <em>“We’ve been thinking about how to build upon this world and we decided to create an action-packed, random-infused rogue-lite, upping the stakes and the speed to create a whole new gameplay experience. We can’t wait for players to see what we have in store in&nbsp;Lost in Random: The Eternal Die, and to take their chances yet again.”&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>In Lost In Random: The Eternal Die, players will play as Aleksandra, formerly known as The Queen, who is joined by Fortune. They have become trapped within the Eternal Die by an evil Storyteller who is attempting to get rid of the pair once and for all. The different dungeons have been inspired by various boardgames, providing unique challenges. Each run will be random as landscapes will shift and the tools available to you will change.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/09/13/lost-in-random-review/">Lost in Random Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Lost In Random review, Dom said, <em>“Lost in Random is a beautiful Burton-esque fantasy that comes close to evoking the same levels of craft and character as its obvious inspirations. It doesn’t quite sustain the wonder from start to finish, but it remains an easy recommendation.”</em></p>

<p>Lost In Random: The Eternal Die will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC via Steam. It is already available to wishlist.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tokyo-xtreme-racer-is-returning-after-18-years-with-a-new-game-coming-to-steam-next-year.961461/</guid>

            <p>I recently wrote about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/night-runners-prologue-demo-is-a-stylish-throwback-to-playstation-racing-classics">a game that aimed to recreate the old magic</a> of Tokyo Xtreme Racer, a series of late-night, urban racing games that hadn't had a new (non-mobile) entry in 18 years. Oh, what a neglected niche those indie developers were filling!
</p>
<p>Yeah, a new Tokyo Xtreme Racer was just announced from original developers Genki, and it's targeting a Steam release next year.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Here's a teaser trailer which is really just a set of logos for previous games:
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="【Tokyo Xtreme Racer】#0：Teaser PV" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T2tB96pYUoE?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

</p>
<figcaption>A teaser trailer for a new Tokyo Xtreme Racers.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2tB96pYUoE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The new entry is called simply Tokyo Xtreme Racer, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2634950/Tokyo_Xtreme_Racer/">there's little else to find out via its Steam page</a>.
</p>
<p>"Tokyo Xtreme Racer is a racing game set in a sealed-off future Tokyo, where you compete for the fastest speed in your customized cars on the highways that weave through the city, aiming to reach the top," says the description. "Drive real cars on meticulously recreated courses, compete against powerful rivals, slip through other cars, and engage in spirit-wracking battles. This is a series with unparalleled appeal."
</p>
<p>It's interesting, because Tokyo Xtreme Racer was mostly a vibe, and at least some of that vibe came from the PS2-era graphics. Mimicking that aesthetic in its jagged-edged polygons and drun-n-bass soundtrack is part of what makes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2707900/NIGHTRUNNERS_PROLOGUE/">Night-Runners Prologue so powerful</a>. Once modernised, with less of a definable style, but still limited in budget, I wonder if Tokyo Xtreme Racer will seem comparitively lackluster.
</p>
<p>Yet the Steam page says to look forward to the release of more information, and I do. Can someone revive Racing Lagoon next?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungies-original-sci-fi-shooter-marathon-hits-steam-for-free">launch</a> of Classic Marathon 1 &amp; 2 earlier this summer, Classic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marathon-infinity">Marathon Infinity</a> is now available on Steam, meaning all three games in Bungie's acclaimed first-person sci-fi shooter trilogy have now made it to Valve's platform.
</p>
<p>
Classic Marathon Infinity, which has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-fan-revival-coming-to-steam-with-bungies-blessing">released on Steam with Bungie's blessing</a>, comes from the team behind Aleph One - a fan-created engine based on the Marathon 2 source code. And as with the studio's ports of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2398450/Classic_Marathon/">Marathon</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2398490/Classic_Marathon_2/">Marathon 2: Durandal</a>, the Steam version of Classic Marathon Infinity is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2398520/Classic_Marathon_Infinity/">available to download for free</a>.
</p>
<p>
Classic Marathon Infinity features the complete 20-level Blood Tides of Lh'owon campaign, which brought the trilogy to a close when it released back in 1996. "Having defeated the Pfhor and reawakened the ancient remnants of the S'pht," teases Marathon Infinity's blurb, "the player now faces a world where friends become enemies and all is not what it seems..."

<p>
As in the original 1996 release, solo and co-op play is supported, but this Steam version also features optional widescreen HUD support, 3D filtering/perspective, positional audio, and 60+ fps interpolation, "just in case the original is <em>too</em> authentic".
</p>
<p>
2024 marks 30 years since the original Marathon's release, but beyond its anniversary celebrations, Bungie does, of course, have other reasons for keeping its classic series in the headlines. The studio announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-returns-to-its-roots-with-a-pvp-twist-on-classic-fps-series-marathon">reviving</a> Marathon - albeit as a sci-fi PvP extraction shooter - last May. It was originally due to release this year, but it's now expect to arrive sometime in 2025 following a leadership shakeup that has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-gets-new-director-as-part-of-creative-leadership-shakeup">reportedly</a> seen Valorant game director Joe Ziegler take control of the project.
</p>
<p>
Back in July, Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">announced it was laying off</a> 220 members of staff - approximately 17 percent of its total workforce - with CEO Pete Parsons blaming "rising costs of development and industry shifts as well as enduring economic conditions". The news followed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-developer-bungie-latest-playstation-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">more than 100 job cuts</a> at the studio last October, and was met with harsh criticism from current and former staff online, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inexcusable-current-and-former-bungie-employees-react-to-sweeping-layoffs">calling for Parsons to resign</a>.

But Amazon Games CEO Christoph Hartmann says fans should be patient, praising the Switch as a "great device" and saying that the label will support the next-gen Switch whenever it arrives.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>"Yeah, we obviously plan to develop games for it and I can't wait for it to be out.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-games-still-seeking-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-christoph-hartmann-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>In recent years, Amazon Games has become known for MMOs like <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/lost-ark">Lost Ark</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/throne-and-liberty">Throne &amp; Liberty</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/blue-protocol">Blue Protocol</a> — massively multiplayer games from predominantly Asian publishers built around grinding. But even with several new releases on the horizon, including a Lord of the Rings MMO, there are signs that Amazon Games is ready to move on from one of the genres that has defined it.</p><p>In an exclusive interview with IGN, Amazon Games boss Christoph Hartmann talked about the label's plans in the wake of revealing King of Meat, a new hack-and-slash co-op game that Hartmann calls Amazon's "first step out of the MMO genre" as it seeks to expand its publishing portfolio.</p><p>"As you know, we have Tomb Raider and others, so that's obviously happening regardless," Hartmann says. "But I think what's even more important is that we are taking bets on new ideas and new developers, which is very few... Well, we are not yet established publisher, but we're still a big company."</p><p>While Amazon Games has been mostly quiet through 2024, Hartmann says that the publisher has been busy behind the scenes, calling it one of its most important years to date. Amazon Games currently has 10 games in development, he says, and are currently negotiating "a couple more." These include blue chip games like Tomb Raider and the Lord of the Rings MMO, as well as a new driving game from the former developers behind Forza Horizon.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Still, questions remain. Despite saying as recently as June that a reveal for Lord of the Rings MMO is "not too far away," Amazon Games CEO Christoph Hartmann says that it's still early days for the anticipated online game based on the blockbuster fantasy franchise.</p><p>"We're still trying to find the hook, find that idea of what it is because we don't just want to go and do the same thing over," Hartmann tells IGN in an exclusive interview. "While it's tempting sometimes with an existing IP, that's not the point of doing it. You've got to find a fresh twist, and we're still, I think, in that period where we really want to find out what could be the hook, what could be the thing which is different to all the other games out there. So it's a little bit early.”</p><p>There are also plenty of questions around Tomb Raider, which has been caught up in the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/embracer-splitting-into-three-companies-middle-earth-enterprises-friends-coffee-stain-friends-and-asmodee-group">mire around the Embracer Group</a>. Hartmann mostly waves them off, saying that developer Crystal Dynamics is "fairly sheltered from everything going on with Embracer."</p><p>"People obviously look at what the parent company is doing, but it never impacted on resources, never led to any changes on management for them, so they're fine. I mean, doing a new Tomb Raider, the bar is so high. The longer you go, the expectation goes higher, so it's a huge, huge task, but things are progressing. I mean, there's some really great ideas here," Hartmann says. "Obviously, we're not going to share any with you even if we would love to, but things are going well, things are moving forward. And from what I could tell, Crystal was pretty sheltered, because also when you look before...they went through a couple of ownership changes anyway before, it's not brand new for them."</p><p>Hartmann goes on to talk about the state of the games industry, Amazon Games' stance on the Switch 2, the label's outlook on AI, and more. Read on for the full interview.</p><p><strong>King of Meat, quite the name. What does it say about Amazon's portfolio and strategy going forward?</strong></p><p><strong>Christoph Hartmann, CEO of Amazon Games:</strong> What it says about Amazon's game strategy going forward? It's a couple of things. First, we're moving out of being a MMO-only publisher...King of Meat is the first step out of the MMO genre. As you know, we have Tomb Raider and others, so that's obviously happening regardless. But I think what's even more important is that we are taking bets on new ideas and new developers. Well, we are not yet established publisher, but we're still a big company.</p><p>Very few people sign up third-party deals. We just have shown it that we heavily invested Europe and we've signed up with [Maverick Games], great talented team, and same with King of Meat. It's someone who maybe would've been able without our help to take it that level, which is financially, as well as resources, technology, service structure, also creative and so on because we have some super experienced people. </p><p>And it's just us taking risks to do something new in the industry and I think people will see more of that. I think it's important for the industry, it's fun for us to do and hopefully pays off, but that's what it really is... Going early into a stock and maybe one day have the next Tesla. Very few times it happens, but it happens.</p><p><strong>Amazon Games have had a number of projects enjoy very strong short-term success. New World comes to mind, Lost Ark, but none have really managed to truly break out and establish themselves longterm. Why do you think that is and what steps are Amazon taking to kind of ensure that happens? Or is that a goal?</strong></p><p><strong>Hartmann</strong>: Obviously, it's a goal. Everyone wants to have his evergreen franchise which goes on for 10 years, but when you and me do this for a long time now, we really run through the list of either publishers or developers. Most of the people, it took a while to get there. It doesn't happen on the first game... I was there but it was almost before my time because I was here less than nine months, and that's what makes Amazon great. Eventually we want to have a couple of evergreen franchises where we really can play to the strengths of Amazon, but we just keep on going.</p><p>With <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/new-world">New World</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/lost-ark">Lost Ark</a>, we had some promising success. Those things are hard to maintain because people invest a lot of time and try out new things, but then they quickly rotate back to their evergreen franchise they have have been playing, so we're just going to keep on going. But yes, obviously we want to have one of those big franchises, that's the whole point. Anything smaller than that would not be interesting to Amazon; we are a larger than life company. We're not in here to try it out and do some cute game development.</p><p><strong>As you look to expand your portfolio beyond just MMOs and you're placing a lot of calculated bets, are there any particular game types or genres that are really standing out to you as having particularly high upside?</strong></p><p><strong>Hartmann: </strong>Any genre has an upside if you nail it. I mean, look at Fortnite or League — it's the game quality and cycle. It's the game quality and cycles being at the right time at the right place. It's not plannable, but I think if you work really hard, keep on going, eventually it will happen. Sure, we can go through a chart now, I can tell you what market size sports has and action adventure has in this net. And obviously, yes, we are interested in the big trials, but I've done this long enough to also not just say, "Oh, sports is the biggest genre, then let's do a sports game because..." No, you need a license more than any other people. You need a license and a great developer.</p><p>By the way, knowing from my time at 2K, you know took how long it took for NBA 2K to get big, that game was around forever. And we were always behind EA... At one moment in time, everything went right and we made it big. So, I don't want to be stuck with a genre because the biggest opportunity is almost when you come with a new genre. I mean, look at battle royale. Do you call it a genre? I don't know, is it a genre, is it like a shooter? I don't know what you would call it, but that's kind of the best case which can happen. You have a breakthrough which hits the zeitgeist.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Looking at some of the other games that are currently in your portfolio, can you provide an update on how work on Lord of the Rings is going at the moment?</strong></p><p><strong>Hartmann: </strong>It's still early. It's a big IP, it's a big game. I know you're going to fish now probably every little word and try to read into it, but honestly, it's too early to read into every little word. We're still trying to find the hook, find that idea of what it is because we don't just want to go and do the same thing over. While it's tempting sometimes with an existing IP, that's not the point of doing it. You've got to find a fresh twist, and we're still, I think, in that period where we really want to find out what could be the hook, what could be the thing which is different to all the other games out there. So it's a little bit early</p><p><strong>Can you maybe give an update on the status of Tomb Raider at Crystal Dynamics given the recent turmoil at Embracer Group?</strong></p><p><strong>Hartmann: </strong>The studio, from what I can tell, is fairly sheltered from everything going on with Embracer. I mean, it has to because Embracer never was one company. It was just an accumulation of an incredibly large amount of independent businesses; and it's not just games development, they're like books and games and this and that. And they always were very sheltered. People obviously look at what the parent company is doing, but it never impacted on resources, never led to any changes on management for them, so they're fine.</p><p>I mean, doing a new Tomb Raider, the bar is so high. The longer you go, the expectation goes higher, so it's a huge, huge task, but things are progressing. I mean, there's some really great ideas here. Obviously, we're not going to share any with you even if we would love to, but things are going well, things are moving forward. And from what I could tell, Crystal was pretty sheltered..the studio went through a couple of ownership changes anyway before, it's not brand-new for them. They kind of were doing games with moving around anyway. And like, okay, new sheriff... you know what I mean, new owner in town. Let's just keep on doing what we do and make games.</p><p><strong>I would love to hear as an executive in the games industry in charge of one of the biggest publishing labels. I would love to hear some of your current insights into the games industry right now as it stands.</strong></p><p><strong>Hartmann:</strong> I think in the games industry we have to reinvent ourselves because we are competing not just against each other. I don't even think we compete in the metric, and we competing really with all the other things like TikTok, streaming services... you can keep yourself busy forever and without having to touch a game. And we have to overcome our fear of trying out new things, otherwise we're going to get boring. We can just not keep on doing the same game over and over. While I know the problem also is you have to, because the financial investment is so big nowadays, and the investment into games and games development became so much, much more expensive in relation to the growth of the overall market. The portion of money going to development, it's so high. Obviously, you take a huge risk, so everyone plays it safe.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I mean, doing a new Tomb Raider, the bar is so high</p></div><p>So, my hope is that AI will help. It's not going to solve it all, but will be one thing where we, for example, can shorten the life cycle. I think games development takes way too long, like five years per game. It's us predicting — especially in a fast-moving world — what the zeitgeist is going to be in five years. It just means basically, everything will be lucky shots and hopefully AI will help us to streamline processes so hand-done work will go fast. Ideally we can get it down to three years so we can iterate more, which then will bring the budgets down a little bit. I don't think they're really going to get cheaper, but at least you fail faster and then you can go on and go on until you find the right thing.</p><p>And I think we as a games industry need it, and AI is hopefully going to also help us to come up. I mean, we didn't really have that many new games and genres. On the other hand, we'd also be coming and doing this since 1996, we are an established industry. In 1996, you looked out of the window and said, "Let's do a skateboarding game." It was that simple... Movies or music who have been through it much, much longer than us, they have a hard time coming up with something new...But I think eventually, we as an industry definitely have to innovate on many levels to develop faster and also be willing to take more risks.</p><p><strong>It's interesting because the </strong><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-the-sag-aftra-video-game-actors-strike-means-for-gamers">SAG-AFTRA voice actors were explicitly calling a strike in part because they were seeking AI protections</a><strong>, and you were just talking about how AI is a way to streamline processes. Have you been monitoring that strike? Do you have thoughts on it?</strong></p><p><strong>Hartmann: </strong>Yeah, we have. I mean, I got to be careful what is here because we are a big company and have to deal with all those organizations, so I don't really want to get in the middle of it. But when we talk about AI, first of all, hopefully it will help us to have new gameplay ideas, which has nothing to do with taking work away from anyone. And especially for games, we don't really have acting... The majority of the team sits in programming and that's not going to go away because that's all about innovation. If it takes something, it will be really the boring parts. I think what could be super helpful is localization. Right now, we're localizing our game into a certain set of languages. Basically, does it commercially make sense to have it in a language, yes or no? Having AI actually will help us.</p><p>That's why I'm thinking it's not going to make it cheap, it's just going to make us translate our games into more languages. Which is great for gamers, because there's countries which maybe not everyone speaks perfect English and they would love to have in a local language, but they're half the size. And I think those are where AI will help us. I don't think it's something where I think actually will create more likely jobs than it will take jobs away. Technology always, always has done that. </p><p>And by the way, I don't believe any technology can replace human creativity and the uniqueness... There's always something special. Humans will be always, when it comes to that, they will be always one step ahead. The machine might get very close. I don't know what you think, but I don't think it will be able to translate those unique things into fresh ideas. If you find AI designing games, the game's going to be all the same.</p><p><strong>Since you're looking to expand your portfolio, I'm just wondering, what do you think is the state of MMOs right now?</strong></p><p><strong>Hartmann: </strong>So, MMOs. I ask, I wouldn't say every day, but weekly that question. I mean MMO, it's a tough genre and the good thing is it has a very dedicated audience. There's lots of MMO players out there. They play a lot of hours of games, they're very dedicated players. It's a great, great community. But what I said before, development costs are hard and it's actually not so much the development of the game, it's actually maintaining them. There's things like server costs, coming up with content, a lot of expectations that content is for free because the cat is out of the hat or bag. I'm not sure what you say in English, one or the other, but you get my point.</p><p>It's not anymore that you sell a game and then charge a certain amount of dollars every month, so that means that money has to come from somewhere. It's not even about someone making huge profits. It's almost the same you have for other games or the industry by itself. It will make it harder and harder to sustainable for smaller companies to do that, because either upfront, a lot of money with a lot of risk. Or as MMOs, you know how it goes up and down and up and down, and they almost go pull one year of the market and then come back again. You got to have the financial backing to actually survive that.</p><p>It will be one of the genres obviously that will be around forever, it's one of the foundations of gaming. But it's a very tough business in the long run, especially I think for smaller developers to innovate because the cost of maintaining the game is just very, very high. Because as I said, technology, servers, creating content and also the consumer... The expectation from gamers that many of the things should come for free and forgetting that someone has to build that.</p><p><strong>Are you monitoring the situation around the next generation Switch, especially given reports that it's probably not going to be out this fiscal year?</strong></p><p><strong>Hartmann: </strong>Yeah, we obviously plan to develop games for it and I can't wait for it to be out. I mean, honestly, I'd rather have them wait a year and get it perfect than rush it to the market and then we all complain about what doesn't work. Switch has been such a fantastic product, I can wait another year if I have to. And from development, I think most non-Nintendo developers are not exclusively doing titles for the Switch. They're always part of a portfolio mix of platform mix. Just wait.</p><p><strong>And last question, just how has 2024 been going for Amazon games in particular and games in general, do you feel?</strong></p><p><strong>Hartmann: </strong>I think while it's very not visible to external as much, but I think it was almost the most important year in our... history sounds so dramatic. At the end of our last couple of years sounds better. We have signed quite a few titles. Some of our biggest titles have done major progress, we're also shipping for the first time a console. Yes, everyone ships, so it's not that big of an achievement. On the other hand, putting a huge, huge MMO on a console actually is not as easy as people might think. It's definitely more to deal with than your 22-hour action-adventure single-player game, I can tell you.</p><p>It has been really, for us, I feel, a year where things are coming together. We have now 10 titles in development, we're negotiating a couple more, and there's a lot of energy going around. Whoever I talk to within our studios or in organization, they're very energized and pumped-up because I think it feels like it's really going to happen. Yes, one title's going to work, the other's not going to work, but we're just going to keep on going and having an exciting lineup, a great mix of the Tomb Raiders, the Lord of the Rings, the kind of blue chips which still have a high bar to it so they're not home runs and doing more adventurous titles like King of Meat, giving younger studios a chance with AAA support, something we have right now. </p><p>I think it's very exciting to all of us and so far, I'm very pleased with 2024, and if Throne and Liberty and New World do really great, I might be even happier.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

                <p dir="ltr">Borderlands 4 will launch on Steam and the Epic Games Store on PC--a pretty common occurrence for any big-name game. But, in this case, it's notable for a couple of reasons. First, Borderlands 3 was a timed exclusive for the Epic Games Store. And secondly, Gearbox co-founder and president Randy Pitchford shared some strong words about Steam five years ago on social media.</p><p dir="ltr">In April 2019, Pitchford believed that Steam could be "a dying store" in 5-10 years. This led to a <a href="https://x.com/ShitpostRock/status/1826109975594414283" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">viral post on X</a> calling out Pitchford for his prediction, highlighting that Borderlands 4 will launch on Steam. <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1826607833145651458" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pitchford responded directly</a> to this on the social media platform, stating that he could have been right if "if Epic successfully pressed its advantage."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1826607833145651458" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">If Epic successfully pressed its advantage, that may have been the case. But Epic did not. So, famously, Steam does very little to earn the massive cut they take and continues its effective monopoly in the West while would-be competitors with much more developer friendly models…</p>  — Randy Pitchford (@DuvalMagic) <a href="https://twitter.com/DuvalMagic/status/1826607833145651458?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 22, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">The Gearbox head honcho didn't stop there and explained his rationale for bringing Borderlands 4 to Steam (it's also arriving on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S). "...Steam does very little to earn the massive cut they take and continues its effective monopoly in the West while would-be competitors with much more developer friendly models continue to shoot themselves in the foot," Pitchford said. "I am a Steam customer and Steam developer that will continue to root for and support competition."</p><p dir="ltr">Pitchford also seems fond of his Steam Deck, adding: "As a Steam Deck customer and user, my bias for personal interest and convenience is fighting against my wish for a more developer friendly alternative on Windows PC."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1776846020" data-promo-id="0"
