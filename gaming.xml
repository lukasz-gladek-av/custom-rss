<p>Two of them, to be precise</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>You'd be forgiven for thinking that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inazuma_eleven_victory_road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a> came out years ago. We've been hearing about this Level-5 RPG under a variety of names since way back in 2018, but now, as the <strong>13th November</strong> kick-off date draws ever closer, the game has finally scored a 'final' trailer. Two of them, in fact.</p>
<p>The above 'Final Trailer 1' (because nothing screams 'final' quite like the promise that there's a number '2' around the corner) dives deep into the game's story, with over six minutes of dramatic dialogue, plot twists, and more enunciations of the word "football" than we ever thought possible. The script leaves us feeling a little worried, it's true, but there's no denying that it's comprehensive.</p>
<p>Then we have 'Final Trailer 2' (which you'll find at the bottom of this article), which has a little more gameplay to show. This one spotlights the game's 'Chronicle' mode, which sees you travel back through series history and recruit new players to your team.</p>
<p>The trailer boasts that there will be 5,400 different characters featured, once the DLC arrives shortly after launch. Yep, <em>five thousand four hundred</em>. We assumed that it was a typo too, but it's written everywhere. Talk about "Everyone is here", eh?</p>
<p>Whether you started following this one back in 2018 when it was called 'Inazuma Eleven: Balance of Ares", 2019 when it became 'Heroes' Great Road', 2021 when it shifted to 'Great Road of Heroes', 2022 when 'Victory Road of Heroes' first appeared, or 2023 when it finally settled on 'Victory Road', this one has been a long time coming. Let's just hope it's fun, after all that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>During the best of times, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-n7-day-armor-location-1851692131"><span>N7 Day</span></a><span> is BioWare’s annual </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>celebration. Sometimes the studio teases what’s to come in its science fiction universe with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-teaser-n7-day-andromeda-1850999958"><span>concept art or cinematic trailers</span></a><span>, but this year sounds like it’s going to be a bit quieter. If you’ve been paying attention to all the turmoil </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-bioware-dragon-age-veilguard-dlc-layoffs-1851750767"><span>at the studio in recent years</span></a><span>, that’s probably not surprising, but BioWare is assuring fans that </span><i><span>Mass Effect 5 </span></i><span>is still in development and is the studio’s primary focus.</span></p> <p><span>In a </span><a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/11/07/n7-day-2025/"><span>post on the studio’s blog</span></a><span>, </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>executive producer Mike Gamble addressed fans, more or less telling them the team doesn’t have much to show this November 7. I guess that’s what happens sometimes when you make an official community day; even when you’re not in a place to show something off, you’ve gotta say something publicly.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Like you, we’ve heard the rumors lately,” Gamble writes. “You’ve made it clear you care deeply about what’s next. So let’s start by setting the record straight: the next </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span> game is in development, and EA and BioWare remain committed to telling more stories in this universe.</span></p>

 <p><span>“The truth is, the last few years have been an incredibly busy time at BioWare. But currently, the team is heads-down and focused exclusively on </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span>. We have a lot of universe to cover, lots of features to build, and lots of romances to figure out. We’re excited by what we’re building, and we promise you: when we’re ready, it’ll be a lot of fun to show. Until then, thank you for your patience because y’all are thirsty for news and I see you looking for secret meaning in my tweets (okay, sometimes they have secret meaning).”</span></p>

 <p><span>However, despite Gamble’s suggestion that the team may not have much to show off for some time, there might be some more substantial teases coming. The blog post has a bunch of random italicized letters that, when isolated, spell “url krogan.” Krogan are one of the alien species in the </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>universe, but it’s unclear at this point what this might be teasing. No doubt fans will be working to piece things together as the day goes on.</span></p>

 <p><span>Beyond the next game, Gamble does confirm something significant about another </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>project: the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-tv-show-movie-amazon-live-action-fallout-1851692186"><span>Amazon TV adaptation</span></a><span>. After rumors and speculation circulated on the internet that the show might be a retread of the original trilogy’s story, Gamble confirmed that it won’t be, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-show-amazon-casting-characters-shepard-2000626536"><span>and thank god for that</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>“The writers room is going strong, and we’ve got a lot figured out about how it fits within the </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>canon, and where it sits in respect to the new game,” Gamble writes. “The show will explore a brand-new story within the universe’s timeline, and will be set after the original trilogy. It won’t be a retread of Commander Shepard’s story – because after all … that’s YOUR story, isn’t it?”</span></p> <p><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>development may be ongoing, but BioWare’s pivot into a one-game studio after EA made drastic cuts to the company’s staff means that </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>is likely in limbo. </span><i><span>The Veilguard </span></i><span>ended with a cliffhanger </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-secret-ending-executors-loghain-1851700436"><span>in its post-credits scene</span></a><span>, but </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416"><span>much of the talent behind that series has been scattered</span></a><span> across other EA studios or left the company entirely. </span></p>

<p>The next Mass Effect game is still in development at BioWare. </p>



<p>In a blog post on the studio’s website for N7 Day, Mass Effect executive producer Mike Gamble wanted to “set the record straight” after rumors began to circulate that the game wasn’t going to move forward. The studio says that not only is the next Mass Effect game in development, but <strong>“EA and BioWare remain committed to telling more stories in this universe.”</strong></p>



<p>Gamble says the team is “heads-down and focused exclusively on Mass Effect” after what they said was an incredibly busy last few years.</p>



<p><strong>“We have a lot of universe to cover, lots of features to build, and lots of romances to figure out,” </strong>he said. <strong>“We’re excited by what we’re building, and we promise you: when we’re ready, it’ll be a lot of fun to show. Until then, than<em>k</em>&nbsp;you for your patience because y’all are thi<em>r</em>sty for news and I see you looking for secret meaning in my tweets (okay, sometimes they have secret meaning).”</strong></p>



<p>Rumors have been circulating about the state of Mass Effect and BioWare for months after the release of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Those rumors picked up more after the announced $55 billion sale of EA that, should it go through, would take the company private and include taking on $20 billion in debt. Even a number of current BioWare <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-staff-worried-about-studios-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">employees expressed concern</a> for what could happen to the studio after the sale closes. </p>

<p>If you’ve played any number of RPGs, you probably know the <a href="https://gdkeys.com/keys-to-meaningful-skill-trees/">skill tree</a> as a break from the game’s core action. It’s a place to pause, take a breather, and scroll through a massive visual menu of upgrade options, considering which path of stat and ability tweaks best fits your character and your play style.</p>
<p>With <em>Skigill</em>, indie developer Achromi has taken that break-time menu and transformed it into the playing field for an intriguing <em>Vampire Survivors</em>-style roguelike. And while the Early Access game currently lacks the kind of deep content that will keep players coming back for a long time, it’s still a clever and engaging take on the genre that I haven’t been able to put down for long.</p>
<h2>Clear the way, I need +5 armor!</h2>
<p>Like <em>Vampire Survivors</em> and its many imitators, <em>Skigill</em> is all about navigating through waves of enemies that converge somewhat mindlessly on your position. The game automatically aims and deploys weapons to carve some safe space through what can be screens full of hazardous enemies, which leave behind coins as they explode in puffs of yellow smoke.</p>
<p>What sets <em>Skigill</em> apart is that skill-tree playing field, which lets you spend those coins on a wide variety of increasingly expensive stat upgrades simply by navigating yourself to the next icon-labeled dot on the branching tree under your feet. Unlike most RPGs, though, the game doesn’t pause at all while you’re picking up the next stat upgrade, meaning you have to stand still for a second or two to confirm your purchase while dozens of enemies continue to march ever closer.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>

<p>Finding that time and space can be harder than it sounds, especially late in a 10- to 15-minute run, when multilayered marching walls of enemies often clog up some crucial upgrade paths. It also means you might be forced to take an upgrade you’re not very interested in just to open up a path to more useful branches further down the line.</p>
<p>The game pauses briefly when you step over a large treasure chest icon, giving you a brief respite to choose from six different weapon upgrades. The weapon variety here is one of the game’s greatest strengths at this point, ranging from area-of-effect explosions to arcing sword slashes to targeted line-of-sight piercing arrows to slow-rolling bombs that squash enemies before exploding.</p>
<p>The damage and performance of each weapon is tied directly to different underlying skill tree stats, though, so getting the right synergistic mix of damage boosting and protective rays of force is important to staying alive. When you do get that mix going, though, it’s incredibly satisfying to tear through screens full of enemies with nigh-unstoppable automated attacks.</p>

<h2>What’s yellow and black and red all over?</h2>
<p>Aside from the skill tree playfield, <em>Skigill</em> sets itself apart with a strikingly monochrome visual style. Every enemy, weapon, and explosion in the game is rendered in a single shade of yellow, with careful black outlines to set them apart. The only occasional smears of color come in the form of those bright skill tree icons and a red outline highlighting nearby enemies that can damage you.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>The stark presentation can threaten to be overwhelming at times, especially when nearly the entire screen descends into a mass of yellow pixels. But the simplicity of the colors also makes it easy to unfocus your eyes and instinctually plan a path away from the red and yellow threats and through to the safety of the inky black void.</p>
<p><em>Skigill</em> also benefits from allowing players to speed up or slow down time with a quick tap of the shoulder buttons. This is a lifesaver for the tedium of the early parts of runs, when the enemies are coming in at a relative trickle and you don’t want to stand around waiting for the actual challenging part of the run.</p>

<p>Where <em>Skigill</em> suffers most, for the moment, is in an overall lack of variety. The recent Early Access release only has three playable characters and four skill-tree maps. While they differ in some important ways, the options fall far short of the dozens of arcane unlockable options that can keep players coming back to a game like <em>Vampire Survivors</em> for dozens of hours.</p>
<p>For replayability, <em>Skigill</em> currently relies on a difficulty system that simply scales up the quantity and health of enemies alongside a secondary skill tree that lets you purchase more permanent upgrades from the main menu. Unfortunately, even at the higher difficulty levels, you’ll see the same four yellow-on-black enemies filling your immediate vicinity, with little in the way of interesting movement or attack patterns to mix things up.</p>
<p>The developers promise on Steam that <em>Skigill</em> will see at least three new characters “along with more weapons and build possibilities” as it goes from Early Access to a Version 1.0 launch. We’re happy to hear that, because even this limited, somewhat repetitive taste of the game has had us coming back for the fun take on an old RPG staple.</p>

                <p>Today is N7 Day, which is BioWare's annual celebration of the Mass Effect series, and to mark the occasion, the developer gave an update on the next game and the TV show. Do not get too excited, though, as BioWare wants people to know it can't reveal very much.</p><p>Executive producer Michael Gamble <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/11/07/n7-day-2025/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> the next entry in the Mass Effect series remains in development and that "EA and BioWare remain committed to telling more stories in this universe." Gamble also addressed the rumors of BioWare getting shut down or sold off as part of EA's $55 billion sale to an investor consortium led by Saudi Arabi.</p><p>"Like you, we've heard the rumors lately. You've made it clear you care deeply about what's next," he said.</p><p>There has been speculation that if EA's $55 billion sale goes through, the new owners <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-may-sell-bioware-and-dice-or-close-other-studios-says-analyst/1100-6535312/" data-ref-id="1100-6535312">might close or sell BioWare</a>. The studio's latest game, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-had-far-fewer-players-than-ea-expected/1100-6528964/" data-ref-id="1100-6528964">failed to meet EA's sales expectations</a>. It remains to be seen what the new owners might do, or how EA might look to come up with the money to pay off its $20 billion in debt for the deal, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-acknowledges-risk-of-selling-to-saudi-arabia-claims-it-will-retain-creative-control/1100-6535894/" data-ref-id="1100-6535894">this uncertainty is a business risk for EA.</a></p><p>Gamble did not address these rumors specifically but said the team at BioWare is "heads-down and focused exclusively on Mass Effect."</p><p>He added: "We have a lot of universe to cover, lots of features to build, and lots of romances to figure out. We're excited by what we're building, and we promise you: when we're ready, it'll be a lot of fun to show."</p><p>Gamble said he knows people are "thirsty for news" and thanked them for being patient until the studio can share more.</p><h2><strong>Update on Mass Effect TV show</strong></h2><p>Outside of the Mass Effect game series, Gamble gave an update on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-shows-latest-update-reveals-a-key-detail/1100-6534272/" data-ref-id="1100-6534272">Mass Effect TV series at Amazon</a>. He said the writers room is "going strong," and the writers have already come up with "a lot" about how the show will connect to the wider Mass Effect canon and "where it sits in respect to the new game."</p><p>"The show will explore a brand-new story within the universe's timeline, and will be set after the original trilogy. It won't be a retread of Commander Shepard's story--because after all--that's YOUR story, isn’t it?" he said.</p><p>The Mass Effect show was <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/11/the-wheel-of-time-premiere-ratings-amazon-prime-video-mass-effect-lort-of-the-rings-jennifer-salke-qa-1234879517/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">first revealed back in 2021</a>, so it's been in the works for a long time already. In November 2024, the TV series <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-series-first-revealed-in-2021-is-apparently-back-on-with-a-key-update/1100-6527637/" data-ref-id="1100-6527637">got a key update</a>, when a report said the show was actually in development. The report said Daniel Casey (Fast &amp; Furious 9) is writing and executive producing the show, while Gamble is an executive producer as well.</p><p>Ari Arad (Iron Man, Uncharted, upcoming Zelda movie) is an executive producer, too. There are no plot details available as of yet for the Mass Effect show, but the main series follows the spacefaring events of Commander Shepard. A movie version of Mass Effect was planned at one point, but it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioware-on-why-the-mass-effect-movie-stalled-and-how-a-tv-show-might-be-better/1100-6493310/" data-ref-id="1100-6493310">never got off the ground.</a></p><p>Filming for the Mass Effect TV show <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-shows-latest-update-reveals-a-key-detail/1100-6534272/" data-ref-id="1100-6534272">could begin in 2026.</a></p><h2>"I want you to see stuff"</h2><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1986833146873024598" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media post</a>, Gamble said he's aware that BioWare's N7 Day post for this year didn't actually include much meat. However, the time is not right for more disclosure about the next Mass Effect game.</p><p>"For everyone yelling at me because we didn't use N7 Day to provide a whole bunch of info… I mean, I get it. I'm a fan too. I want you to see stuff. But it's not the time…yet. Has it been years since announce? Yes. Have we been busy? Yes. Are we NOW 100% on mass effect? Also yes," he said.</p>

            <p>Bioware has released a blog post today to mark N7 day to reassure fans that the next <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> game is still in development, stating the team "remain committed to telling more stories in this universe".</p>
<p>Written by executive producer Mike Gamble, <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/11/07/n7-day-2025/">the blog</a> shows the team's hand, revealing the team is totally focused on Mass Effect now, thanking Mess Effect lovers for their support and patience.</p>
<p>Gamble wrote: "We have a lot of universe to cover, lots of features to build, and lots of romances to figure out. We're excited by what we're building, and we promise you: when we're ready, it'll be a lot of fun to show."</p>

<p>There are no new screenshots, no trailers, no gameplay. <em>Nuthin'!</em> But, it's a sign of life from what is arguably Bioware's most popular franchise, one that comes at an especially tender time for the company as its parent company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">EA is in the midst of a potential buyout by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund and Private Equity companies</a>.</p>
<p>Gamble also teased the Mass Effect TV show in the blog, which Bioware is partnering with Amazon for. However, again, there's nothing from the production to show for now.</p>
<p>There is a fun paragraph on its progress though: "The writers room is going strong, and we've got a lot figured out about how it fits within the Mass Effect canon, and where it sits in respect to the new game. The show will explore a brand-new story within the universe's timeline, and will be set after the original trilogy. It won't be a retread of Commander Shepard's story - because after all ... that's YOUR story, isn't it?"</p><p>Gamble would conclude the blog by pointing fans to socials, as Mass Effect crossover cosmetics are coming to other EA games including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skate-2025">Skate.</a> Finally, he promises fans there's no secret message in the blog. Still, be sure to spend hours pouring over it, why not. It's what Liara would want, I'm sure.</p>
<p>The future of Mass Effect and Bioware has been up in the air recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/biowares-future-under-ea-in-question-studio-veteran-warns-if-it-makes-the-kind-of-games-that-this-new-company-isnt-interested-in-making-anymore">with some studio veterans feeling Bioware is about making: "the kind of games that this new company isn't interested in making anymore"</a>. Still, there's a lot of love for Mass Effect and Bioware both, and it would be nice for the remaining team to score a major win, especially with everything else going on.</p>

		<p>Semiwork has announced that it is looking at what to bring in the next big update for R.E.P.O, and the studio wants the players to give their input on what they want. Players can leave comments on in the comments on YouTube or through the <a href="steam://openurl_external/https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.com%2Finvite%2Frepo">R.E.P.O Discord</a> In addition, Semiwork is working on a hotfix following the<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/30/r-e-p-o-gets-10-new-monsters-in-its-monster-update/">&nbsp;Monster Update</a> that was released last week. One of the things that will be added in the R.E.P.O hotfix will be an Arachnophobia Mode, as well as some enemy tweaks.</p>
<p><iframe title="NEXT R.E.P.O. UPDATE?!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JshwMkzs_MY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Semiwork has also announced that there will be a short break when it comes to R.E.P.O videos so the team can have a bit of a rest. The break will not be that long with information to come when the team has decided on what direction to go with for the next R.E.P.O update.</p>
<p>R.E.P.O stands for The Retrieve, Extract &amp; Profit Operation, where players look for valuable items from a variety of locations while trying to avoid the monsters that lurk in these areas. These valuables could be lightweight items all the way up to grand pianos, so players need to work together to get in, get the items out, and survive. R.E.P.O entered early access in February and since then has built up a large following and overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam.</p>

		<p>Blue Dot Games has announced that following its Next Fest demo, ’83’s early access will now be releasing in 2026 and not this year as originally planned. The extra time will allow Blue Dot Games to address the issues raised by the players when playing the ’83 demo, including the UI, gunplay, and movement amongst features that will be addressed.</p>
<p><iframe title="'83 – Steam NextFest Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t72zJNyJt_s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a blog post, Blue Dot Games wrote, <em>“Following overwhelming feedback on the Steam Next Fest demo, we’ve made the decision to shift our Early Access release of ’83 out of 2025 and into early 2026. We believe in ‘83 and are committed to doing what’s best for both the project and our community.&nbsp;<wbr>We’re using this additional development time to focus on key areas the community told us matter most:&nbsp;<wbr></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Gunplay and feel&nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Optimisation and performance&nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Graphical fidelity and visual polish&nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Overhaul of the UI&nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Movement and animations&nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>General stability and bug fixes&nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The demo gave us a vital snapshot of how ’83 plays in the hands of a broad range of players, and we’re taking all of that data and feedback seriously. Our goal is to deliver an Early Access experience that reflects the ambition of the project, but more importantly, something you genuinely enjoy playing and want to return to. On top of the key areas listed above, we are also working hard to correct and improve our models for weapons, uniforms, gear and vehicles where the need for improvements has been identified.&nbsp;<wbr>Thank you again for your patience, enthusiasm, and for holding us to the highest standard. We’re listening, and we’ll be back with more updates as we continue building ’83.”</em></p>

<p>’83 is a 40v40 squad based first person shooter set during an alternate history where the Cold War erupted into full on conflict, with NATO and the USSR battling across Europe. Players can choose which side to play on as they battle in matches that will last 30 to 40 minutes, while players who take the Commander role will have an overview to help guide their sides.</p>

			<p>The next entry in the Mass Effect series continues to be in development, BioWare confirmed today during the annual series' celebrations.</p>



<p>In a new blog post shared on the developer's <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/11/07/n7-day-2025/">official website</a> for N7 Day 2025, Executive Producer Mike Gamble provided a brief update on the game, confirming that it continues to be in development, as EA and BioWare remain committed to telling more stories in the series' universe.</p>



<p>Following some busy years at the studio, BioWare is now fully dedicated to the development of the next entry in the Mass Effect series, and is continuing to explore new features to build and figure out lots of romances.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"We’re excited by what we’re building, and we promise you: when we’re ready, it’ll be a lot of fun to show,"</em> Mike Gamble wrote, thanking players for their patience.</p>



<p>Besides providing this small update on the next entry in the series, the Mass Effect Executive Producer also provided an update on the TV show based on the series, which is i<a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer/">n the works by Amazon Prime Video</a>. The show, which will explore a brand-new story within the <span>universe's timeline, will be set after the original trilogy, and&nbsp;<em>"a lot has been figured out"</em>&nbsp;about how it fits with the series' canon and&nbsp;</span>the timeline of the next entry in the series.</p>

            <p>
Blizzard are adding a new premium virtual currency to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World Of Warcraft</a> alongside player housing in the MMO's forthcoming Midnight expansion. It's called Hearthsteel, and is "purchased with real money using your Battle.net balance and used in turn to buy Housing items from the Battle.net shop and in-game shop," as detailed in a blog post this week. 
</p>
<p>
The post <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24242736">comments</a> that the "vast majority" of housing items are and will continue to be earnable through play, with a "small fraction" sold for Hearthsteel. Even then, you'll be able to buy items sold for Hearthsteel using WoW Tokens derived from in-game gold. Housing items "tied to core fantasies of a player's race or class, or that already exist in Azeroth, won't be sold in the shop", and nor will "thematically important decor that players know and love". Hearthsteel is strictly for homey boondoggles: there are "no plans to use it for the Trading Post, mounts, transmogs, or pets".
</p>
<p>
All well and good. But Blizzard's reasons for adding a new premium currency to a game that was rubbing along well enough without seem sketchy.
</p>
<p>
As the developers themselves put it in that blog post, "why bother when we already have a Battle.net balance?" They justify the introduction of Hearthsteel by noting firstly that "when dealing in transactions involving real money, a more deliberate and cautious process needs to be implemented to provide appropriate financial protections for both parties". To which I can only say: show your working, Blizzard, because I have no idea what you're referring to.
</p><p>
The developers add that buying things with real money "can be an inefficient, inconvenient, and often tedious process when a player wants to purchase multiple items", giving the example of buying a full set of chairs, candles and a dining table for a banquet. They argue that "using an in-game currency can help make the process of obtaining many of these types of inexpensive items more efficient".
</p>
<p>
I'm... not really seeing it, and neither are the Wowsers on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1oq6li7/removed_by_moderator/">Reddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/world-of-warcraft/blizzards-reason-for-adding-premium-currency-to-world-of-warcraft-after-21-years-of-doing-just-fine-without-one-has-everyone-worried-about-player-housing/">PCGamer</a>). As one user points out, why not just let players put multiple purchases into a shopping cart rather than rolling out some newfangly Azeroth doubloons?</p>
<p>It seems likely that the real rationale for Hearthsteel is the same rationale that informs purchaseable virtual currencies at large: they cloud how much you're actually spending in real money terms, and often wangle you into spending too much by flogging the virtual currency in set amounts, rather than letting you buy exactly as much as you need. The addition of housing to WOW Midnight is sure to inspire a microtransaction boom - I guess this is just Blizzard adding a little more grease to the chute.
</p>
<p>
Late last year, a consumer advocacy group <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-european-consumer-watchdog-wants-you-to-be-able-to-buy-exactly-as-much-in-game-currency-as-you-need-not-fixed-chunks">called upon the European parliament to end such predatory practices in videogames</a>, but a huge number of publishers rely upon virtual currencies, especially in the realm of free-to-play. Time to bang that drum again, while you agonise over the interior of your Razorwind Shore chalet.

              <p>How come<a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-the-kotaku-review-1829984369"><em> Red Dead Redemption 2</em></a> still isn’t on current-gen consoles? Why did Konami drop its lawsuit against the anime horse game? How many players will be humiliated by Ned Flanders before the <em>Simpsons Fortnite</em> season is over? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. <em>Call of Duty</em> is just a week away. We’ll find out how many people still care or if they’re still too busy recovering from their<em> Battlefield 6</em> and<em> Arc Raiders</em> hangovers.</p> <h2><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> is now the fourth best-selling game of all time</h2> <p>That’s another big win for meticulously rendered horse testicles and proof that painstaking craftmanship can propel your game to the top of the charts even if it’s long, often boring, and essentially feels like the Ken Burns documentary of open-world action games. Take-Two confirmed in its latest earnings report that <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> has now sold over 79 million units, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-sales-mario-kart-world-mk8-2000620694">pushing <em>Mario Kart 8</em> <em>Deluxe</em></a> into fifth place.</p>

 <p>But the game also goes on sale for just $20 a lot, whereas <em>Mario Kart 8</em> is rarely below full price. Take-Two says it’s still the top-selling game of the last seven years in the U.S. in terms of dollar sales. So, we’re getting <a href="https://kotaku.com/read-dead-redemption-2-nintendo-switch-port-rating-1850873886">that rumored Switch 2 and PS5 port</a> any day now, right? right??</p>

 <h2>Square Enix hit with mass layoffs</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-gen-ai-square-enix-qa-bugs-2000641688">The <em>Final Fantasy</em> publisher</a> has reportedly fired 140 people across its overseas publishing operations, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-announces-more-layoffs-as-part-of-us-and-europe-restructuring/"><em>VGC</em> reports</a>. The company says the move will save around $20 million as it continues overhauling its gaming business after years of misfires.</p>

 <h2>Ned Flanders has killed over 33,000 <em>Fortnite</em> players</h2> <p>The friendly <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-review-changes-new-map-short-2000640868"><em>Simpsons</em> neighbor</a> is anything but when he’s roaming the map as a deadly NPC. Epic Games confirmed he’s a stone cold killer. Here’s a clip showing why you don’t want to get in a shootout by his house.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">just checked… Ned Flanders has over 33k global eliminations in Fortnite lol 🥸 <a href="https://t.co/zxLKvdinEL">https://t.co/zxLKvdinEL</a></p> <p>— Fortnite (@Fortnite) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite/status/1986600289353515475?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>Friendship ended with <em>Skyrim</em> Grandma, now <em>Minecraft</em> Grandma is my best friend</h2> <p><em>Gamesradar</em> reports that a YouTuber who goes by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GrammaCrackers" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/@GrammaCrackers" data-hl-processed="none" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-mrf-recirculation="[Gamesradar] Article - Inline Link" data-mrf-link="https://www.youtube.com/@GrammaCrackers">GrammaCrackers</a> is delighting fans with her <em>Minecraft</em> playthroughs in which she discovers all of the twists and turns in the old survival crafting game like it’s brand-new.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>To you or me, VR gaming may have quietly died away a few years back, after everyone played&nbsp;<em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> and had their fill of&nbsp;<em>Beat Saber</em>. But to the mysterious collective known as Gen Alpha, the format is alive and well and occupying everything. At the beginning of this year <a href="https://kotaku.com/gorilla-tag-vr-meta-quest-steamvr-free-ghosts-lucy-pbbv-1851741139">we told you about&nbsp;<em>Gorilla Tag</em></a> and its massive audience who were all simultaneously under the shared delusion that the game is haunted. But that’s old hat now, because now we have a new game you’ve almost certainly never heard of with a colossal audience: the mighty <em>UG</em>.</p> <p><em>UG</em>&nbsp;bears a lot of similarities with&nbsp;<em>G-Tag</em>, but it’s not nearly as brazen a copy as it might first appear. The older game is all about being a gorilla, and—well—playing tag. It’s a lot more involved than that, not least because of all the bloody in-app cosmetic purchases, but the key thing is that it’s a game that brilliantly understood how to make free first-person movement work in a VR game without causing nausea or discombobulating incongruence. The trick is to make the player avatar into a creature with two long arms, but no legs, propelled around by the instinctive action of pulling yourself along the ground. This works for climbing and bouncing too, resulting in a way to navigate the large, vertically interesting levels as an ape. <em>UG</em>, rather smartly, just copies this wholesale. Except here (even though everyone just looks like gorillas wearing thongs), you’re playing as a bizarro-world caveman, co-existing with dinosaurs who can be hatched from eggs, raised, saddled, and ridden upon. But most importantly: swapped.</p>

  <p>My window into this peculiar world is my now 11-year-old son, for whom we bought a Meta Quest 3A last Christmas. He’s an only child, and it seemed like a great way for him to play active games with his friends even when he’s at home. And it is! Damn, the muscles he’s built flinging his body around as he plays&nbsp;<em>Gorilla Tag</em> rather put pay to all those tiresome complaints about gaming making kids sedentary. After nearly a year of on-and-off phases of playing the game, about three weeks ago a <em>G-Tag</em> playing friend told him he needed to install something new, called <em>UG</em>, and to do it with some matter of urgency. However, because every electronic item he owns is locked down to the point of being brick-like without my permissions, he then came begging to me. I checked it over, thought it looked like yet another <em>Gorilla Tag</em> knock-off he’d bounce off in a couple of days like all the others, but given it was free, I said sure.</p>

 <p>Our lives are now very much about prying him free of his headset for brief moments in which he’s not attempting to feed chickens to an ever-growing menagerie of dinosaurs. For him and squillions of kids around the world, <em>UG</em> has become a big deal.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642107" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642107"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642107">© ContinuumXR / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Quite why is really very fascinating to me, a dad looking on in bemusement (often directly, via the mobile app, where I’m instructed to cast his game to my phone so I can see the new additions to his prehistoric collection). Because while <em>Gorilla Tag</em> has a central game around which everything else is built (tag),&nbsp;<em>UG</em> does not. It’s instead a similarly designed series of large, open spaces, where players can take dinos they’ve collected to help them level up by feeding them food. Right now this food is either comically prehistoric-looking chickens or pigs, which you hold in front of your dinosaur’s foot to have it magically pop into cooked ribs and drumsticks (yes, chicken ribs and pork drumsticks), which you then feed to the beast’s mouth. As it eats its gains XP, and at level 5 will have a sudden growth spurt and become large enough to “buy” a saddle for (with in-game Bones), and then you can ride it around as your mount. There are large dinosaur bosses to fight, with very small chances of a victory seeing an egg drop as loot, but that’s about it. This is, instead, all about the trading.</p>

 <p>I should mention, there very much are in-app purchases for both cosmetics and special versions of the imaginary dinosaurs that inhabit the game, and this sucks big-time. We’ve had full-on rows over my son’s belief that $30 is a very reasonable price for a bundle, because bought separately they’d cost so much more. “THEY’RE PICTURES THAT DON’T COST <em>ANYTHING </em>TO MAKE!” I’ve yelled in exasperation, waving my arms around and adding things like, “YOU’RE TRYING TO SPEND TWENTY-FIVE POUNDS ON DRAWINGS THAT DON’T EVEN EXIST!” I don’t understand. I’m an old fool who just doesn’t get it. And it’s his money, so how is it any of my business! And so on. But that aside, there are various ways to get your own dinosaurs without paying, primary among them swapping something you have for something someone else has.</p>

 <p>To this end, the game’s main hub area has trading tables on which players can place up to five creatures they’re willing to exchange, and then each pulls a lever to seal the deal. And watching this is&nbsp;<em>extraordinary</em>. Imagine the trading floor of a financial market, but with pre-pubescent voices. It’s frantic and furious, with stakes constantly being raised as multiple people on the server start trying to outbid a player for their especially interestingly patterned version of a Grugadon. And often, this is before the kid has even suggested they’re interested in trading, just happening to have stomped by while riding their proudest dino. My son has often had to escape to a private instance (you dial a random four-digit code into a machine to do this) to get away from marauding crowds trying to scream over each other for his electric-blue Triskeletops.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642108" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642108"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642108">© ContinuumXR / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The game also demonstrates plenty of the peculiar conspiratorial nonsense that pervades&nbsp;<em>Gorilla Tag</em>. Because, guys, have you heard, Mammothors are getting deleted tomorrow? No, seriously, they’re pulling them from the game. You see, this admin leaked them before he was supposed to, and now they’re taking them all out of the game. This was the BIG story the week before last, and I’d hear kids talking about it (a weird thing about the Meta Quest headset is you can hear everything if you’re in the same room, but they can’t hear you when you mock them from the couch) no matter how many different servers my kid was on. Via the magic of checking the Discord (that just recently celebrated 100,000 members), I discovered that absolutely no dinosaurs are being deleted (clearly the rumors had spread far enough that there was a need to publicly respond), and then hilariously enough, come November’s post-Halloween update, Mammothors have become the focus. Every nonsensical memetic belief seems to be based around these spurious “admins,” not least the wild theories that everyone seems to believe about “duping,” based on a bug that was eliminated from the game over a month before. It’s fascinating to observe how these rumors evolve and spread, formed from nothing at all, and how hard it can be to dispel any one of these beliefs.</p> <p>But as inaccessibly weird as it all appears to me, there is a vast audience out there, and it’s growing fast. There have been an awful lot of attempts to muscle in on the success of <em>Gorilla Tag</em> in the three years since it released, perhaps most successfully by an extremely similar game called&nbsp;<em>Animal Company&nbsp;</em>that, earlier this year, became the most popular game on the Meta store. But most others come and go as the obvious knock-offs they are. <em>UG</em> is doing something different, however. It’s been sitting at the top of the Meta charts for weeks now, and while the perennial hit <em>Beat Saber</em> still sits in second, it’s&nbsp;<em>Animal Company</em> that’s third, while <em>Gorilla Tag</em> has been dethroned to fourth place. This really seems to suggest the caveman game is siphoning players directly from <em>G-Tag</em>‘s audience. It’s interesting to note that 2022’s gorilla game has amassed 164,000 ratings over the last three years, while <em>UG</em> already has acquired 163,000 in just the three months since it released.</p> <p>But these games have mercurial audiences, and at any moment&nbsp;<em>UG</em> could become last month’s thing, forgotten in the pile of free-to-play games inside the headset, as everyone moves on to the next near-identical game. And we, the people who think we’re the normal game players, will likely not even know any of it is happening.</p>

<p>Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> is officially getting a premium currency just for player-housing items, and Blizzard is now looking to explain its reasoning to a concerned and upset playerbase.</p><p dir="ltr">Following a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-looks-to-be-getting-a-new-premium-currency-for-housing/1100-6535888/" data-ref-id="1100-6535888">datamine earlier this week</a> that hinted at a new premium currency called Hearthsteel, Blizzard has confirmed the currency is real and how it plans to implement it in a <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24242736" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>. Once WoW's Midnight expansion releases, Hearthsteel will be available for purchase with real money and will only be used for housing items in the in-game shop. Items and Hearthsteel amounts available for purchase should align in a "player-friendly way," Blizzard states.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmG98apVwKw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="2">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WmG98apVwKw?start=2" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The big question many players have is why introduce a virtual currency at all? Microtransactions have existed in WoW for a long time now. Blizzard confirmed earlier this year it would sell premium housing items, something that was expected. But buying a fancy store mount or transmog set has always been done with real money as opposed to having to first buy a currency. According to Blizzard, using real money when purchasing multiple items can be "inefficient, inconvenient, and often tedious."</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard then seems to confirm that players who buy housing items on the shop will need to buy multiples of the same item if they want, for example, a full set of chairs, as opposed to making a single purchase and then being able to put down as many chairs as one wants.</p><p dir="ltr">"Using an in-game currency can help make the process of obtaining many of these types of inexpensive items more efficient," Blizzard states.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard notes that as is the case with store mounts, the vast majority of housing items will be earnable in-game by playing, with only a small selection of housing items available on the shop. Housing items tied to a core class or race fantasy, or "thematically important decor," won't be sold in the shop either. A housing catalog will be visible in the house-decorating UI that will let players preview decor items (including ones from the shop), so players can decide if they wish to purchase or work towards earning a specific piece of decor.</p><p dir="ltr">The end of Blizzard's Hearthsteel blog post tells players to keep the feedback coming, and judging from places like the WoW subreddit, there is plenty of (negative) feedback to go around. Some players aren't finding Blizzard's justification for the virtual currency convincing.</p><p dir="ltr">"The only reason for a virtual currency is to do the exact opposite and nudge people into buying more shit because they have leftover balance," user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1oq65xb/comment/nnh43m0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pariah</a> writes. "As if that's a secret to anyone these days."</p><p dir="ltr">As another user, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1oq65xb/comment/nnghh4b/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lord0fHats</a>, puts it: "Selling housing decor and such was a no brainer, but they had to adopt a particularly toxic method of doing it. Very disappointing."</p><p dir="ltr">Whether or not player concerns and feedback will cause Blizzard to reconsider its approach remains to be seen, but for many players who have been waiting for player housing for decades, the pivot into a virtual currency looks like nothing more than a cash grab.</p><p dir="ltr">In other WoW microtransaction news, the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-infamous-90-dinosaur-mount-may-be-coming-back/1100-6535911/" data-ref-id="1100-6535911">infamous $90 dinosaur mount</a> may be returning to the shop. Housing early access, meanwhile, is set to arrive with the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-will-launch-with-patch-11-2-7-but-not-in-full/1100-6534018/" data-ref-id="1100-6534018">11.2.7 patch</a> before the end of the year, with Midnight proper set to release early in 2026. Those waiting for WoW to arrive on console will keep waiting, as the game's director said a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-isnt-coming-to-consoles-game-director-says-no-reason-for-us-to-hide-anything-about-this/1100-6535952/" data-ref-id="1100-6535952">console version of WoW isn't in the works</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>You can really feel the Super Smash Bros. coming through in Kirby Air Riders. The distinctive tone of a Masahiro Sakurai game is clear to see, from the menu UI, to the iconography of the collectables, and the general gameplay ethos. With the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/23/the-kirby-air-riders-direct-just-revealed-so-much-stuff-top-ride-amiibo-online-demo-and-more/">first Global Test Ride demo event</a> kicking off this weekend, and ahead of a release later this month, I had a fresh opportunity to play this game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kirby Air Riders – Road Trip opening video (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y5iu4lOM37w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Having already gone <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/23/kirby-air-riders-preview-powering-up-a-gamecube-classic-for-a-new-generation/">hands-on back at Gamescom</a> in August, I was much better prepared for what Kirby Air Riders actually is. At first glance, it appears to be a follow cam racer in the vein of Mario Kart, but from the style of the racing to all the other modes that are featured in the game, it’s really nothing like Nintendo’s main kart racer.</p>


<p>For one thing, your vehicle just starts driving with no input from yourself, and the game will even (as I remembered from August) tell you off if you push forward on the analogue stick. Thankfully, I had far fewer visual slaps on the wrist this time around, and I quickly got back into the groove of this one-button racer. You really just have to concentrate on turning and pressing the context-sensitive B button, which will cause you to slow down and drift, gobble up incidental enemies, and batter any nearby rival racers with a Copy Ability that you’ve picked up.</p>


<p>There’s a few exceptions to this simplicity, with a spin attack needing you to waggle the left stick, and pulling back and forward to fly and glide from any ramps. Oh, and your character’s special ability is unleashed by hitting Y. And that’s basically it, though there are some more advanced techniques to learn, such as pumping the brakes to drift through corners without losing speed.</p>
<p>I got to put this to the test once more through the standard Air Ride mode, racing through three courses –&nbsp;the grassy meadows of Floria Fields, the almost biblical sea-splitting of Waveflow Waters, and the charming sunset ride of Mount Amberfalls. The racing is pretty rapid, with plenty of tight corners, the odd side route, and the three tracks having different numbers of laps depending on their length. Waveflow Waters felt particularly manic, as you could easily crash through the water walls of some sections and end up in the wet stuff for a few moments, and there’s some cinematic grind rails and jumps that pull some unexpected moves with the camera.</p>
<p>Revealed during the jam-packed Kirby Air Riders Direct a couple weeks ago, there’s also top-down racing with the Top Ride mode, but I feel that the real heart of this game is in the City Trial and the vehicular combat party game vibes that it gives off.</p>

<p>This was something I was utterly unprepared for during my first hands on –&nbsp;I didn’t play the GameCube original and hadn’t seen the first Direct for this game – but knowing more of what to expect, I could get into the swing of things a fair bit more. There’s tons of characters to choose from, each with their own special ability, and they can be combined with a bunch of vehicles that all have distinctive characteristics, but you have to go and find the vehicle you want when starting off in City Ride.</p>
<p>You’re basically just racing around and running into as many pick ups as possible. No need to be too discerning about what you grab, as they all go to boost your vehicle’s stats… unless they’re greyed out debuffs that you need to try and avoid instead. Skyah is a deceptively compact-feeling map with a ton of secretive feeling paths between the various locations and layers to explore, and the action is constantly mixed up by having portals to drive through, and then the big Field Events to try and draw players together. These can be things like a mini race, a huge pillar to collectively try and destroy, gigantification, or teleporting you all to a dustup derby arena for a knockout battle.</p>
<p>What’s startling is just how much the speed and action ramps up through the few minutes that you’re racing around in Skyah. If you’re sat a bit too close to the screen (as we were), it can be genuinely a bit disorienting just how quick you end up going.</p>

<p>And then, as time is up, you have the other pretty unique distinction of being able to choose the final challenge that you face in the Stadium. Four of these final modes are presented to you, and instead of voting and everyone being lumped together from that, you can actually just go and do the thing you want. If you’ve ended up with a machine that has been built for combat instead of speed, you probably want that Dustup Derby instead of a straight up race, while your more agile vehicle might help with dodging lasers, a better flier will be better suited to Air Glider or High Jump, and there’s some 90s game show classics like trying to hit scores markers on a big wall.</p>
<p>I feel that Kirby Air Riders, much like its forebear, is destined to gain a cult following. There’s a deceptive simplicity to the game that can make it accessible, and that can enable the more chaotic side of the game in City Trial. It’s also clear just how much passion Masahiro Sakurai and the team have for this game. It might not be for everyone in quite the same way as Smash Bros. is, but it’s certainly worth finding out if it is for you with the online tests over the coming weekends.</p>

<figure data-uuid="55e2521cde71a"><a title="Nintendo Life x Birthday Cake" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/55e2521cde71a/nintendo-life-x-birthday-cake.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Wow, where to start? It’s official, though. It’s been 20 years since I sat down and cobbled together the somewhat infamous '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2005/11/our_nintendo_life_begins">Our Nintendo Life Begins…</a>' article back in late 2005, a world before iPhones, iPads, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, and YouTube wasn’t even a year old yet.</p>
<p>How times have changed. Both generally and specifically, the video game industry.</p>
<p>When I wrote that first article, we were technically still in the <em>GameCube</em> era. I had really enjoyed my brief stint putting together 'GameCube UK', a website all about… (you guessed it) GameCube in 2001-2002. Then, with the Nintendo 'Revolution' on the horizon, I was getting the itch to get back into running a website about games, and Nintendo <em>Life</em> was born.</p>
<p>Back when the site turned 10, I penned <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/11/site_news_nintendo_life_turns_10_today">an article that details the early years of Nintendo Life</a>, if you are interested in that.</p>
<p>The site's name truly <em>is</em> fitting, though, considering that over the years it has become a bigger and bigger part of my life, dominating my entire adult existence. There can’t be many days over the last 20 years that I haven’t interacted with it in some way or at least read/replied to a related email.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough self-indulgence. I’m incredibly proud of Nintendo Life reaching this milestone. It is a testament to all the lovely people who have been on our team, both the amazing staff we have today and all who have come before over the decades. Without them, the website would simply be a shell.</p>
<p>Nintendo Life (mega)evolved from a hobbyist project into a fully fledged business and helped launch the careers of lots of people, most of whom are still working in the games industry today.</p>
<p>We also have to thank Nintendo itself for simply doing what Nintendo does. Given the turbulent times they have faced over the last two decades, I think this particular anniversary finds them in a pretty good position, all things considered. They’ve clearly evolved during the Switch 1 era, mainly for the better, but like any corporation driven by profits, they still have some negative aspects that concern me, as a fan.</p>
<figure data-uuid="3b070abe93bc0"><a title="Nintendo Life @ 20" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3b070abe93bc0/nintendo-life-at-20.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Nintendo Life as it looks on it's 20th Birthday, complete here with a Hyrule Warriors advert — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo UK and Nintendo of America have been very supportive of Nintendo Life over the years, and we continue to appreciate their cooperation and respect.</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, we have to thank you. Yes, you, the reader, the viewer, the user, the watcher. If you are reading this, you are part of our journey. Some of you have been around since the beginning, and for some maybe this is your first ever article. Without you, our audience, there would be no Nintendo Life. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for visiting.</p>
<p>Everything may have started with Nintendo Life, but in those 20 years, we also started a family. Our company name became <a href="https://hookshot.media/">Hookshot</a> and spawned new sites that you all (hopefully) know and love with <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/">Push Square</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/">Pure Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/">Time Extension</a>. Although each site has its own dedicated staff, Hookshot itself is one big team, something we are all incredibly proud of.</p>
<p>Only yesterday, the Hookshot team grew once more as we launched the new <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/">Digital Foundry website</a>, a new partnership between the newly independent Digital Foundry and Hookshot.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/related-articles:193425 @ 1762534811 -->

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>On one hand, Borderlands 4 had a strong launch. In its opening hours, it had the biggest launch for the entire Borderlands series on PC <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-out-now-already-biggest-borderlands-game-on-steam/">with over 100K concurrent players on Steam</a>, eventually hitting <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1285190/charts/#max">over 300K on its opening weekend</a>. It hit <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-sold-2-million-units-earned-150-million/">2 million units sold in its opening week</a>, and for September 2025, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-tops-us-sales-charts-ghost-of-yotei-matched-tsushima-covid-era-numbers/">topped sales charts in the US, becoming one of the best-selling games in the US for 2025 so far</a>. That said, according to Take-Two Interactive boss Strauss Zelnick, sales were "<em>softer</em>" than expected.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again">The Game Business</a> that went live shortly after the announcement that <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">Grand Theft Auto VI was delayed</a>, Zelnick also commented on the sales for Borderlands 4. While Zelnick commended the game's critical reception, he called the commercial success of the game "<em>softer</em>" than the company would have liked, and specifically cited the poor performance and myriad of bugs that the game launched with on PC as part of why it has fallen below expectations.</p>



<p>"<em>The critical acclaim [for Borderlands 4] was superb,</em>" Zelnick said, "<em>and we're really happy with the release. Equally, as you know, there were some challenges with the Steam release. Gearbox has been addressing those challenges and will continue to do so. So, in terms of units sold out of the gate, the numbers were a little softer than we would have liked. In the fullness of time, we think it's going to do great</em>."</p>



<p>You may recall that when Borderlands 4 launched and its PC performance was abysmal in many ways, Gearbox boss <a href="https://wccftech.com/gearbox-boss-tells-4k-stubborn-players-switch-1440p-use-dlss/">Randy Pitchford went on a tirade on X (formerly Twitter)</a> and fought back against players who were rightfully complaining that this new triple-A game they bought wasn't running well on their machines. Pitchford even <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424826697781446">called the PC version "<em>pretty optimal</em>"</a> when the game was facing well-deserved backlash.</p>



<p>Thankfully, Zelnick is right that Gearbox has been working to address its issues. A patch from a couple of weeks ago <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-october-23-patch-performance-improvements/">specifically improved performance by double-digits</a>. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-things-learned-from-ea-fc-open-world-leaks/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/5-biggest-things-we%E2%80%99ve-learned-from-ea-fc-open-world-leaks.1347037/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>EA is bringing one of the biggest changes to EA FC in history with the open-world game mode. A ton of leaks dropped following the feature’s worldwide playtest, and we’ve seen many of the new inclusions first-hand, so let’s pick apart crucial leaks.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fc-26-announces-12-new-icons-including-francesco-totti-andres-iniesta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA FC</a> (formerly FIFA) is the biggest sports game year in, year out. It’s an unstoppable juggernaut that, no matter how badly it’s received, how poorly it reviews, etc, it will still sell millions of copies. Despite this, EA knows that remaining stagnant isn’t good for the series. This is why plans for an open-world EA FC mode were unveiled a couple of years ago. With the first playtest well underway, here are our handpicked key takeaways.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-ea-fc-open-world-game-mode-leaks">Best EA FC Open-World Game Mode Leaks</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Messi will be going strong in 2026. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-ea-fc-open-world-release-period-likely-revealed">EA FC Open World Release Period Likely Revealed</h3>



<p>One of the most shocking and eye-opening revelations from the EA FC open-world leaks is the mode’s potential release window already. Playtesting will take a while, and there’s presumably already been internal testing. But we learned from <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FootballGamingZone</a> that an internal EA presentation featured countless references to one thing in particular—<strong>EA FC 27</strong>.</p>



<p>This could easily change between now and EA giving the mode the full green light to be added. However, until we hear otherwise, one of the biggest EA FC open-world leaks is its potential <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fcs-new-open-world-mode-release-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release window</a>, and that it could arrive in 2026 alongside EA FC 27.</p>



<h3 id="h-lots-of-game-modes-amp-mini-games">Lots Of Game Modes &amp; Mini-Games</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A smart integration into EA FC. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Initial leaks suggest there are quite a few <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/every-game-mode-in-ea-fcs-open-world-playtest-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game modes</a> to try out already: Six, to be precise.</p>



<ul>
<li>Balloon Ball</li>



<li>Closest To The Pin</li>



<li>Draw The Line</li>



<li>Foot Tennis</li>



<li>Kickabouts</li>



<li>Rush</li>
</ul>



<p>Most of them are fairly self-explanatory. <strong>Rush</strong> is Rush, but with even fewer rules. You need to move the ball around in <strong>Draw The Line</strong> in a way that resembles shapes to score points, and <strong>Closest To The Pin</strong> plays into its Golf theme by requiring you to get your ball as close to the target as possible.</p>



<p><strong>Foot Tennis</strong> is just like real-life Foot Tennis, <strong>Kickabouts</strong> is similar to Volta, and <strong>Balloon Ball</strong> is easily the most diverse mode, requiring you to go full dodgeball by popping balloons and using power-ups to raise the stakes!</p>



<h3 id="h-we-re-going-continent-hopping">We’re Going Continent Hopping</h3>



<p>Another <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FGZ</a> exclusive: The open world mode has <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/exclusive-ea-fcs-open-world-will-have-several-maps-to-explore-based-on-major-countries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several maps to explore based on major countries</a>.</p>



<p>The leaked presentation suggests we can jump from Europe to South America, as <strong>England</strong>, <strong>France</strong>, and <strong>Argentina</strong> are the early maps that players can explore. It’s expected that each of these districts (apart from looking culturally accurate) will have subtle nuances to make them significant. Whether this is unique mini-games or specific items remains to be seen.</p>



<h3 id="h-it-will-have-another-battle-pass">It Will Have Another Battle Pass</h3>



<p>What, you didn’t want another EA FC Battle Pass to pay for? It’s EA, so another way to make money from this mode was never going to be out of the question. Don’t be surprised to see a unique shop just for the open world, but a <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/exclusive-ea-fcs-open-world-mode-has-battle-pass-stacked-with-cosmetics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Pass stacked with cosmetics</a> is also part of the experience.</p>



<p>According to FGZ, it will feature: “Shoes, jackets, tops, trousers, and hats distributed, along with Club Points.”</p>



<p>Speaking of which.</p>



<h3 id="h-ea-fc-open-world-amp-ea-fc-will-work-alongside-each-other">EA FC Open World &amp; EA FC Will Work Alongside Each Other</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A big move. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Battle Pass’ contents underlines that the <strong>open world will be integrated into the core EA FC experience</strong>.</p>



<p>Playtesters and leaked information have revealed that it uses the same progression system that Pro Clubs uses in EA FC 26 and other recent FC games. You choose an Archetype, level up stats, earn XP, and make use of typical Clubs features.</p>



<p>It’s up to you to decide if this is lazy or not. But if you can switch your Pro from Clubs to Open-World mode, it gives you different avenues to level up your character and do it outside of a competitive environment at least.</p>



<p>What do you make of the EA FC Open-World leaks? Does the mode sound fun? Could it revolutionize the FC franchise forever?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Cygames and Konami Digital Entertainment announced today that they have resolved their patent disagreement regarding Cygames’ mobile title Umamusume: Pretty Derby.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Umamusume: Pretty Derby is a hugely popular anime racehorse-girl management game in which racehorses are reborn as cute anime girls, complete with equine ears and tails. The franchise started off in 2018 as an anime, followed by a Japan-only release of the mobile game in 2021. In the game, players can talk to, train and manage horse-girls like Special Week and Mejiro McQueen, sharing in their triumphs and losses. As a result, the Umamusume franchise has inspired a cult following, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/umamusume-pretty-derby-dev-reminds-fans-to-follow-the-rules-when-visiting-the-real-life-japanese-racehorses-behind-their-favorite-anime-horse-girls">many fans have become interested in the real-life Japanese racehorses behind their favorite characters</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in March 2023, Konami filed a lawsuit against Cygames, claiming that Cygame’s Umamusume: Pretty Derby infringed upon 18 of its patents. Konami originally called for over 4 billion yen (approx. $26 million at current exchange rates) in damages, and for Cygames to cease all production, usage and distribution of the mobile game. In response, Cygames requested invalidation trials against all the patents involved.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cygames revealed in a <a href="https://pdf.cyberagent.co.jp/C4751/lAG8/V61w/TjOR.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>press release</u></a> today that it has decided to settle the disagreement to ensure that players can continue to enjoy Umamusume: Pretty Derby in the long run. Despite this decision, Cygames “remains confident that no patent infringement has occurred.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both Konami and Cygames expressed respect for each other’s creators and games in their press releases about the settlement. Cygames stated that their group company “respects the efforts of creators at companies in the game industry, including Konami Digital Entertainment, and the numerous games they have created.” In turn, Konami <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/corporate/ja/news/release/20251107/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commented</u></a> that “we will respect each other’s creative works and strive to provide content and services that please our customers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to a <a href="https://www.cygames.co.jp/news/id-23172/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>press release</u></a> from 2023, Cygames had been in discussion with Konami about patent rights “pertaining to certain aspects of Umamusume: Pretty Derby’s game systems and programs,” however, it seems Konami disagreed with Cygames and filed the lawsuit. Both companies have been secretive about exactly which aspects of Umamusume: Pretty Derby caused the disagreement. Considering Konami’s history of making sports management games like Powerful Pro Baseball, it is possible that Umamusume: Pretty Derby’s in-game system for training its anime horse girls was part of the issue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both companies stress that due to a confidentiality agreement, the details of the settlement will not be made public.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

Apart from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/minecraft"><u>Minecraft</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v"><u>GTA 5</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/wii-sports"><u>Wii Sports</u></a>, which have sold 350 million, 220 million, and 82.9 million copies, respectively, Red Dead Redemption 2 has outsold everything.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With 79 million sales, that puts Red Dead 2 just ahead of the prior fourth-place Mario Kart 8's estimated 78.02 million sales, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pubg-battlegrounds"><u>PUBG</u></a> (75 million), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-oregon-trail"><u>The Oregon Trail</u></a> (65 million), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/terraria"><u>Terraria</u></a> (64 million), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt"><u>The Witcher 3</u></a> (60 million), and the original 1985 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-bros"><u>Super Mario Bros</u></a>. (58 million).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You'd think then, that Red Dead Redemption 3 is a dead cert. But Rockstar has yet to announce a sequel. Earlier this week, Rockstar Games co-founder and former lead writer Dan Houser said he’d feel more <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-says-red-dead-redemption-3-will-probably-happen-and-hed-feel-a-bit-sad-about-it-because-it-was-a-cohesive-two-game-arc"><u>sad to learn Red Dead Redemption 3 was in development without him than he feels about GTA 6, but admits the game "will probably happen."</u></a> As lead writer, Houser wrote almost all of Rockstar’s games, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-games-co-founder-leaves-company-dan-houser-red-dead-redemption-gta"><u>having left the company over five years ago</u></a>, Houser recently confirmed to IGN that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dan-houser-says-gta-6-will-be-great-but-thinks-the-world-probably-had-enough-gta-from-me-in-first-comments-since-leaving-rockstar"><u>GTA 6 won’t have a story or a character set he developed</u></a>, but expects the game to be great nonetheless.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Of course, letting go of something I worked on in one way or another for like 20-odd years, and wrote on them for the last 10 or 11 that came out, wrote all of them, or you know, lead writer on all of them, whatever it was… letting go of that is a big change. And sad in a way,” Houser said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Because each of the [Grand Theft Auto] games was a kind of standalone story it’s not quite the same as… I think probably it would be in some ways sadder if someone continued on Red Dead, because it was a cohesive two-game arc. That might be more sad to hear someone working on that. But again, that will probably happen too. I don't own the IP. That was part of the deal. It's a privilege to work on stuff, but you don't necessarily own it.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Rockstar Game Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2023, Roger Clark, who played Arthur Morgan, the main playable protagonist of Red Dead Redemption 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arthur-morgan-actor-certain-rockstar-will-make-red-dead-redemption-3-eventually">said he was “certain” fans will see Red Dead Redemption 3 “one day,”</a> but qualified that statement by saying he had no idea when that would be. Clark also ruled out the return of Arthur Morgan in the game, should it come to be. If you’ve played Red Dead Redemption 2, this might seem like stating the obvious, but there’s always the chance Rockstar may consider another prequel of some kind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m certain we will see Red Redemption 3 one day,” Clark said. “When that will be — I have absolutely no idea. Don’t count on Arthur’s involvement either. His story has been told, I feel.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/before-rockstar-i-was-just-a-jobbing-actor-off-broadway-arthur-morgan-actor-roger-clark-on-the-red-dead-redemption-2-effect">a subsequent interview with IGN</a>, Clark expanded on his thoughts: “Yeah, that got really picked up! I would have thought that was obvious though. Wouldn’t you? And it’s not like I have any insider information whatsoever, but of course there’s going to be another Red Dead. It sold over 60 million copies!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: “Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Take-Two said it himself. He said GTA and Red Dead are prominent franchises for Rockstar Games and that they will be returning to them in the future. So there’s no doubt there will be another Red Dead. But if Arthur Morgan will be involved? I highly doubt it, to be honest. And I think it’s going to be quite some time before we even see a snifter of anything new Red Dead related. I have no idea how it would pan out, but I wouldn’t bet on Arthur being a part of it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, Red Dead Redemption 2 is widely considered to be one of the best video games of all time. We thought it was a masterpiece, too, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-review"><u>IGN's review returning a 10/10</u></a>.

Yes, Rockstar has pushed back Grand Theft Auto’s return to its Miami-inspired setting of Vice City to November 19, 2026. I, for one, am sad about this, as I’m sure you may well also be. But this announcement isn’t necessarily bad news for everyone.

Not only should it benefit the sales of these games due to players’ money that was set aside for GTA 6’s previous May date now being freed up to be spent elsewhere, but it may even give them a little wiggle room to delay a few weeks themselves and avoid that dreaded crunch in order to get out before Rockstar’s behemoth — something <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-beyond-early-2026">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra has already done by moving “beyond early 2026”</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">99 Details in the GTA 6 Trailer - Slideshow</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">PC Gamers - Losers</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Sorry, PC gamers, but if history is anything to go by, then the wait for GTA 6 has just got even longer for you. If Rockstar is to follow its normal pattern of releases, it could well be a couple of years yet until the state of Leonida makes its way to Windows. For reference, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> launched on consoles on October 26, 2018, but didn’t find its way onto Steam until a whole year later November 5, 2019. The wait for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> on PC was even longer, with its April 14, 2015 release coming 19 months after its original September 17, 2013 console arrival. So, apologies again, but if PC is your chosen place to play, you may well be looking deep into 2027 or even early 2028 to play GTA 6.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">GTA 6’s Developers - It’s Complicated</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In theory, delaying GTA 6 is a good thing for the development team at Rockstar, hopefully preventing excessive crunch impacting the studio as it races towards deadlines. But this week also saw 30 to 40 Rockstar employees fired from their positions at the company for what <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-studio-rockstar-accuses-fired-employees-of-leaking-confidential-information-in-a-public-forum">Rockstar describes as leaking “confidential information in a public forum”</a>. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-dev-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-in-sudden-firing-of-dozens-of-staff">Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) claims this was "blatant" and "ruthless" union busting</a>, though. This is a developing situation with no clear answers at the moment. What <em>is </em>clear, though, is that having a few dozen fewer employees definitely won’t ease the burden on the developers still at the studio. Let’s hope that the theoretical crunch time saved by the delay won’t have been completely negated by this reduction in workforce.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Mandalorian and Grogu - Winners</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Pedro Pascal wins again. Yes, The Mandalorian’s feature film debut alongside his little green friend, Grogu, is scheduled to release on May 22, 2026 — the same week as GTA 6’s previous release date, May 26, 2026. Well, the upcoming Star Wars film now seemingly has a clear runway to rake it in at the box office, with people being more likely to leave their house now that the distraction of Grand Theft Auto glueing them to their TV screens is being taken away. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Microsoft - Loser</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft and its Xbox Game Studios are due for a big 2026. But with no release dates currently known for its big hitters — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fable">Fable</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-campaign-evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War E-Day</a>, and 2026’s Call of Duty included — could this spell a problem for the publisher? We can safely assume that Call of Duty would’ve been eyeing up a similar release date to GTA 6’s new November one, which would no doubt impact its playerbase, and surely at least one other game from that list has a late 2026 window pencilled in. Could this scupper Microsoft’s plan for the end of next year and mean one or two games have to get pushed back to early 2027? Of course, it would be wise to get something out the door before Grand Theft Auto arrives, but there’s only so fast developers can work, and I’d much rather wait than hear more horror stories of studio crunch.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Summer Game Events - Winners</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The bad news? You won’t be playing GTA 6 in late May. The good news? You’re now free to attend IGN Live in early June, our special event in Los Angeles, open to the public to come and enjoy all the fun of new and upcoming video games. But apart from that, it also means that all of the summer shows, such as Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest, are in no trouble of being overshadowed by the release of Grand Theft Auto just a couple of weeks prior. This means we can enjoy all of the new game announcements and looks at gameplay without having to tear ourselves away from Vice City. I’d just recommend that nobody pick November as their chosen release date at the end of those trailers.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Marvel’s Wolverine - Loser</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently scheduled for a “late 2026” release window, one of Sony’s biggest hitters for next year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvels-wolverine">Marvel’s Wolverine</a>, may want to get out before the end of October at the latest to avoid being impacted by GTA 6. In truth, any game looking to launch towards the end of next year is probably scrambling to put together a plan right now, and it will be no different between Insomniac and PlayStation as they work out the best course of action.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Black Friday 2026 Console Sellers - Winners</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6 will now drop just before Black Friday 2026, so expect both PS5 and Xbox Series X/S bundles to be in more demand than ever across Capitalism’s favourite weekend of the year. Expect low stock as electronic stores around the world make all the money they can as people get their Grand Theft Auto machines into their homes.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Us, The Players - Losers (and Winners)</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Another six months of waiting may feel painful right now, but let’s try to look on the bright side. We get our summer back. Go outside. Enjoy an ice cream. Run around on the beach and get sand between your toes. Catch up with an old friend in a leafy beer garden. Watch every minute of the World Cup. November will be here before you know it. Those shorter winter days are much better suited to locking all the doors and playing games all day, anyway.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

Play solo or gather a team of up to four players. Arm yourselves to the teeth, grab supplies, and set out to conquer the canyons on massive Crawlers.</p><p><strong>Crawlers</strong></p><p>The vast waters disappeared hundreds of years ago, but the spirit of the pioneer ancestors and their inventions remain timeless. Become the captain of a Crawler—a colossal machine from the past, essential for traversing the canyons.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Modify, upgrade, and develop your steel companion! <a title="Games > Unless" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/unless">Unless</a>, of course, you find a better friend—here, sentimentality has no place.</p><p><strong>Expeditions</strong></p><p>Welcome to a world teeming with dangers, endless storms, scorching sun, fearsome creatures, and humans steeped in cruelty. You’re very welcome here, especially if you’re tasty. Gather loyal friends, load ammo onto your rusty Crawler, and embark on expeditions to conquer, save, build, or destroy these damned canyons. Will you risk everything for legendary rewards, or will you wisely return home when things get tough? The choice is yours. There are no right decisions or proven paths here, but there is a complex procedural generation system with hand-crafted details and unique events that will let you feel the crunch of sand under your scurvy-ridden teeth over and over again.</p><p><strong><a title="Games > Haven [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/haven">Haven</a></strong></p><p>No matter how brave a warrior you are, one day you’ll have to return home. Establish your settlement in the canyon caves, equip it with everything survivors need, and they will gladly settle there. Build a shipyard for Crawler construction, garages for repair and tuning, an armory, or a fancy cafeteria with zombie burgers. Create infrastructure for traders, medics, workers, and more! And of course, ensure the protection of your home haven, as there will always be those who covet what you have.</p><p><strong>Captain</strong></p><p>Shooting is good, but shooting well is even better, and to achieve this, you must develop your captain. Besides improving basic stats, you can master dozens of professions, each enhancing your character in some aspect of the game.</p><p>While shooting bottles and lifting weights, don’t forget about morality. The canyons are a harsh place, often forcing difficult choices. How will you treat a survivor dying of thirst? Give them precious water, take them to your harbor, rob them, leave them to the monsters, or even eat them yourself? The decision is yours! But remember, everything has consequences.</p><p><strong>Inhabitants</strong></p><p>No matter how crazy an idea seems, it will always gather a group of followers. The canyons are no exception. The crowd here is peculiar. Lawmen, Marauders, the Diesel Cult, and many others await you on their lands. Or don’t—they might react uniquely to your actions and morality score. Find common ground with them, and they will aid you. For example, the Lawmen can provide the best equipment, the Diesel Cult can grant access to the finest transport and Crawler modules, and the Sun Fanatics will simply blow your head off—they are hated by everyone, and the feeling is mutual.</p><p>Of course, humans are not the only inhabitants of these lands. In the canyons, you will encounter Shrivelled, Creepers, Savages, and many other creatures that mothers use to scare misbehaving children.</p></div><p>Watch the trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/canyons-gameplay-teaser-trailer-co-op-pve-third-person-shooter-for-ps5-pc]]></content:encoded>

The highly anticipated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-open-world-games/2900-6388/" data-ref-id="2900-6388" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-open-world-games/2900-6388/">open-world game</a> from Rockstar was originally scheduled for a May 2026 release, but it will now be out on November 19 instead. A game delay is never good news, but for Take-Two Interactive, the news saw its stock price temporarily drop while the industry calibrated itself for the later launch.</p><p>GTA 6 is regarded as something truly special, a once-in-a-generation release that is being fueled by an absurd amount of hype. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-gets-a-new-trailer/1100-6531329/" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-gets-a-new-trailer/1100-6531329/">Even a simple YouTube trailer dominates discussions for days</a> after it's released--and reignites interest in Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers--and the delay has gotten a lot of responses from just about everyone with their finger on the pulse of the gaming community.</p><p>Big brands like Dominos Pizza and KFC haven't missed with their responses, and someone at Red Bull Gaming needs to stop drinking a dangerous amount of overly caffeinated energy drinks. Some of the responses have been brutally honest, others have taken the news in their stride with cheeky responses, and some people have overreacted really badly to the delay.</p><p>Fortunately, there are a lot of games scheduled to launch next year, and if you want to plan around GTA 6, you can check out our list of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2026-upcoming-games-release-schedule/1100-6534941/" data-ref-id="1100-6534941" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2026-upcoming-games-release-schedule/1100-6534941/">2026 game releases</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/redbullgaming/status/1986546697355600227" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">IT WILL BE WORTH THE WAIT<br>IT WILL BE WORTH THE WAIT<br>IT WILL BE WORTH THE WAIT<br>IT WILL BE WORTH THE WAIT<br>IT WILL BE WORTH THE WAIT <a href="https://t.co/fsrDbPtHv1" rel="nofollow " data-mce-href="https://t.co/fsrDbPtHv1">https://t.co/fsrDbPtHv1</a></p>— Red Bull Gaming (@redbullgaming) <a href="https://twitter.com/redbullgaming/status/1986546697355600227?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-mce-href="https://twitter.com/redbullgaming/status/1986546697355600227?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Several analysts believe <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-most-important-game-release-in-industrys-history-analyst-says/1100-6521839/" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-most-important-game-release-in-industrys-history-analyst-says/1100-6521839/">GTA 6 is the single most important game release of all time</a>, and its predicted to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/">sell 40 million units within its first year of release</a>.

The ports have not been officially announced, but there have been some developments, and in this post, we're rounding up everything we've heard about the rumored ports.</p><h2 id="What_do_we_know_"><strong>What do we know?</strong></h2><p>Earlier this year, reliable leaker <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-may-be-heading-to-switch-2-report/1100-6532372/" data-ref-id="1100-6532372">Nate the Hate said</a> a port of Red Dead Redemption 2 was headed to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2025, alongside an update that improves the game on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5.</p><p>Red Dead Redemption 2 has been playable on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S already through backwards compatibility.

            <title><![CDATA[Turtle Beach Racer Wireless Wheel Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/07/turtle-beach-racer-wireless-wheel-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/turtle-beach-racer-wireless-wheel-review.1346989/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Steering wheels have to be one of the most inconvenient of gaming peripherals. There’s cables dragging everywhere, clamps for nearby tables or desk that never quite sit right, or the space needed for a full stand or seating rig, if you’re truly going to commit. Equally, there are few add-ons that make games as gratifying to play. Hurtling around a race track while you feather the real-world throttle, using your paddles to gear change, all the while fighting against the bucking realism of force feedback, can make you feel like a virtual Colin McRae or Max Verstappen. If you’re into racing games, they make themselves more or less essential.</p>
<p><iframe title="Turtle Beach® Racer Wireless Racing Wheel Trailer (All-In-One Race Setup)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rgYiX1GEsqM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Turtle Beach know all this, and with the Racer Wireless Wheel for Xbox, PC and Android, they’ve tried to make a steering wheel that’s easier to live with. It’s one that’s designed to slot into your gaming life – and your living room – with a practised ease, parallel parking its way into your heart. Largely, they’ve achieved that.</p>


<p>The first thing you’ll think when you grab it out of the box, is just how good it feels. This is a premium-feeling wheel, despite coming in at £139.99/$179.99. It is largely made from a combination of matte and gloss black plastic, with some rubberised grip sections on the left and right of the wheel, but it’s solid, clean-feeling plastic, centred by a bright yellow cut-out at the top of the wheel, to provide a modicum of colour and pizazz.</p>


<p>While most wheels immediately have you looking for the nearest desk or table edge, the Racer Wireless Wheel gives you more options, starting with some metallic lap tray inserts. These slide into place at the bottom of the wheel, and you lock them with the same rotating mechanisms on the top of the device that you use for the deck clamps. The underside of the curved metal has rubberised grips, and once you’ve got it set in place on your lap, it mostly stays where you want it to be, thanks in part to the grips and thanks in part to the pleasing amount of weight in the main body.</p>
<p>The weight plays a role in making the Racer Wireless feel like a premium product, but it certainly helps it to behave more like a traditional wheel, even when it’s not attached to anything. Thankfully, you can lock it into place in a table with the simple clamps, and things feel exactly as you’d hope they would with it secured in place.</p>
<p>Serious racers will then ask, where are the pedals? The answer is, there aren’t any, with the Racer Wireless wheel dealing with accelerating and braking by mapping it onto some analogue paddles. You’ll notice that this completely does away with manual gear shifts, but it’s best to remember just who this wheel is aimed at: casual racers who want to feel more connected to their racing games. For that, it does a great job, injecting fun and a dose of realism in equal measure.</p>

<p>The lack of pedals makes the setup that much more streamlined and simple to use as well, and it makes the Racer Wireless a unique option. There’s an accessibility angle here as well, where this control set up makes it more suitable for games with &nbsp;a disability or injury that would make pedals difficult or impossible to use.</p>
<p>Across the face of the wheel, you’ll find all of the central inputs you need, and they feel solid and well-made – particularly the D-pad. I had no problem cruising through menus and making changes to the options in Forza Horizon 5, and other than the occasional moment where you might lose the touch memory of where some of them are, like the dinky shoulder buttons, they do exactly what you need them to do.</p>
<p>There are two customisable function buttons on the left side of the wheel, which can replicate any of the other main inputs, as well as a multifunction button that opens up the Racer Wireless’ other abilities, particularly its audio controls via the 3.5mm socket. You’re getting a full suite of Turtle Beach audio options, including four EQ’s and then various adjustments to mic monitoring and the like, though you’ll need the app to get to all of them.</p>

<p>You can make a bevy of adjustments to the wheel’s performance via the Turtle Beach Control Center 2 app – available for both Xbox and PC – from updating the firmware for both your wheel and the wireless dongle, to digging into the nitty-gritty of the wheel’s setup. I made the change from 360-degree rotation to 180-degree here, and it made a huge difference to my interactions with the wheel, as it felt so much less cumbersome to turn when not attached to a desk.</p>
<p>You can also alter the input levels for both the left and right paddles, and the wheel itself, adjusting deadzones for all three, as well as choosing between standard, precision and fast response times. I found that Fast suited me well enough, and made the Racer Wireless feel massively responsive, if a bit twitchy at times. It’s great to have that level of granularity though, in something that is more or less aimed at the more casual racer.</p>
<p>In keeping with the more casual, no-frills approach, there’s no force feedback or vibration, but you might not miss it once you start hammering around the track. Without those features, the Racer Wireless is capable of up to 30 hours of battery life, and that played out in our testing. In fact, it also holds onto its charge remarkably well too, and after returning from a week’s holiday, it had lost just a couple of percent.</p>

<p>The clear thing that was apparent from my time with the Racer Wireless wheel, was just how much fun I was having. It isn’t a one-to-one recreation of driving – far from it – but it does make racing games like Forza Horizon 5 come alive when you’re comparing it to a controller. It’s straightforward, and nearly as easy to pick up and play with as a regular controller. While I did once lose the 2.4Ghz dongle, there’s a handy slot in the base to keep it in when not in use, and you can always opt to go wired instead.</p>
<p>There was the occasional niggle. The selector switch at the side gives you two Xbox options, one for a wheel, and one for a controller where there’s no steering wheel option, but in F1 2025, it wouldn’t recognise either for driving the car. There is a sturdy list of supported games for both Xbox and PC, but F1 2025 isn’t currently listed, despite the previous two entries being there. Here’s hoping that more games are added in the near future.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-selling-10-chicken-helmets-reminds-players-yup-it%E2%80%99s-a-live-service-game-alright.1346977/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Online PvPvE survival extraction shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-tips-solo-group-recycle-free-loadout-2000641174"><em>Arc Raiders</em> is very good</a>. But since launching last month, players have started to grow frustrated with the paid multiplayer game’s pricey cosmetics. And a silly helmet for a chicken is perhaps the best example of how paid skins and cosmetics can go oh so wrong, even in otherwise great games.</p> <p>On November 6, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oq8xpx/charging_10_for_a_chicken_helmet_that_you_only/">a post about a new cosmetic item for a chicken exploded in popularity on the <em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ subreddit</a>. In the game, each player has a chicken named <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Scrappy">Scrappy</a> who periodically provides them with random resources between matches. This chicken can only be seen in one menu of <em>Arc Raiders</em>, and yet, developer Embark has already created at least two different paid cosmetic looks for Scrappy. The newest chicken skin for sale is an old-fashioned diving helmet. This helmet alone costs 700 Raider Tokens, which translates to about $7, though due to the way the currency is sold in bundles, you’ll have to spend $10 to get that many tokens. The post about the helmet reached over 7k upvotes by Friday.</p>

   <p>Reaction to the helmet is a bit all over the place. Some players think it’s very dumb, but don’t mind because it doesn’t affect the game. Others feel like Embark is being greedy for charging so much for something that players will rarely see. There’s also a lot of confusion over why the cosmetics in <em>Arc Raiders</em> are so expensive. Keep in mind this isn’t a free-to-play game like <em>Fortnite</em>. To play <em>Arc Raiders</em>, you gotta spend $40. Some players assumed the fact that it’s a game you buy would shield it from free-to-play cosmetic guff, but this chicken helmet has made it clear that won’t be the case.</p>

 <p>“I understand this is a live service game, being supported for 10 years. But this is a bit ridiculous,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oq8xpx/comment/nnhcsdy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said one user.</a> “Considering half the skins aren’t even a different base model and are priced half the cost of the damn game. It’s okay to speak up about these things, because ultimately greed destroys companies — even if just silly cosmetics.”</p>

   <p>That’s the other problem with this new chicken helmet. While it can be bought separately, it is also included in a cosmetic bundle that features an outfit for your in-game character. However, a lot of players noticed that this “new” skin looks nearly identical to a previously sold cosmetic outfit. This has led to some players claiming that Embark has done a mere palette swap and is charging players roughly $15 for the privilege of buying a similar skin all over again.</p> <p>I doubt these pricey and somewhat ugly skins and items will sink<em> Arc Raiders</em> anytime soon. The game is one of the most-played titles on Steam right now and shows no sign of slowing down. But these expensive cosmetics are a reminder that, somehow, <a href="https://kotaku.com/20-10-skins-expensive-microtransactions-halo-diablo-4-1851008769">we are truly in an era where a $15 to $20 skin is not just common</a>, but something most players seem to ignore or even accept. Just a few of these skins add up to the total price of <em>Arc Raiders</em>, which is wild. But if people are buying them… well.</p>

              <p>Almost nobody buys $4,000 laptops. They’re amazing on paper, sure, but they’re also out of reach for most people. That’s why <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5391/">when Dell’s Inspiron 16 laptop (1TB SSD, 32GB DDR5 RAM) suddenly drops to $999 from its regular $3,999 price</a>, it makes noise. You’re getting a powerful machine at a quarter of its usual price which is why this deal (freshly posted on Amazon for Black Friday) isn’t likely to last long.</p>

<h2>A Serious Laptop for Real Work and Play</h2>
<p>This laptop isn’t a lightweight in any sense other than how easy it is to carry: It’s designed to <strong>crush productivity tasks</strong> while staying flexible enough for entertainment, content creation or business use. At its core, you’ll find <strong>Intel’s new Core 7 150U processor</strong> which runs up to 5.4GHz with 10 cores and 12 threads. That’s a lot of power for something you can carry around all day, and you can feel it in how it handles demanding workloads or 4K streaming with zero slowdown. Paired with integrated Intel graphics, it provides a smooth experience without draining your battery too fast.</p>



<p>Dell gave this model the specs to back up that performance promise: You get <strong>32GB of high-speed DDR5 RAM</strong> to keep things running smoothly like editing video, compiling data, and jumping on a video call-all at the same time. Plus,<strong> 1TB of lightning-fast SSD storage</strong> means your laptop boots instantly, and apps open in seconds. There’s no noise, no lag, and minimal heat.</p>
<p>For one, the design itself looks and feels premium. The <strong>screen is a 16-inch touchscreen with Full HD+ resolution</strong>, supported by IPS and WVA technology, meaning users will get more vivid colors and wider viewing angles ideal for either presentation work or creative sketching. With 300 nits of brightness and anti-glare protection, you can confidently work in bright cafes or by a window without any reflections getting in the way.</p>



<p>Connectivity is another area where this laptop doesn’t compromise. It comes with all the right modern ports — USB-C, HDMI, Wi-Fi 6E, and Bluetooth 5.3 — which means pairing devices or hooking up monitors is fast and painless. The HD webcam and noise-canceling microphones make every virtual call sharper and more professional, while the backlit keyboard keeps late-night typing sessions comfortable.</p>
<p>For its class, battery life holds up solidly enough that getting through a full workday or cross-country flight without scrambling for an outlet is quite achievable. It comes with <strong>Windows 11 Pro installed by default</strong> and keeps the system stable and secure-a nice touch for those who rely on their machine daily for professional use.</p>
<p>It isn’t shy about discounts, though: Amazon has now dropped this Dell Laptop to an all-time low of $999 for Black Friday, a full 75% off its usual price. Black Friday deals this deep don’t stay live for long and this one might vanish as quickly as it appeared.</p>

              <p>There’s something addictive about smart displays once you start using one: You can check the weather, set alarms, play your favorite playlists, video call friends or peek into your connected cameras-all with a quick voice command. The Amazon Echo Show 5 nails that balance between screen and speaker and makes it one of the easiest smart home upgrades you can get. Now<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5390/"> it’s dropped to a record low of $59, down from its regular $89 price</a> which makes jumping into the Alexa ecosystem even more tempting.</p>

<h2>More Than a Smart Display</h2>
<p>Amazon designed the Echo Show 5 to do everything your old smart speaker can’t: The <strong>5.5-inch display may sound small, but it’s key to transforming how you interact with your assistant</strong>. You can glance at the time, watch your favorite Prime Video series, follow step-by-step recipes or see who’s at the door when paired with compatible cameras. It’s like having an assistant that also gives you context-perfect for those times when hearing isn’t enough.</p>



<p>This generation takes the experience up a notch: The sound is clearer, with twice the bass of older models, meaning your playlists and podcasts actually sound like something worth playing out loud. You can stream directly from Amazon Music, Spotify or any connected app with a nice balance between rich low tones and crisp vocals. And when it’s sitting idle, the screen doubles as a digital photo frame. You can set it to display your favorite pictures or even invite family members to share their own directly to your device. It includes <strong>unlimited cloud photo storage for Prime members</strong>, so it’s as much of a family hub as it is a gadget.</p>



<p>Then there is the way it doubles as your <strong>smart home control center</strong>: You can dim the lights, turn up the thermostat, or get a glimpse of what’s happening on the security feed-all with your voice or a tap. If you have compatible Ring doorbells and cameras, you’ll be able to view real-time footage right from the display. Alexa routines can automate your mornings, too: wake up to gradual light, a daily news briefing, and a playlist softly fading in before breakfast.</p>
<p>With Amazon, privacy remains front and center here. The Echo Show 5 incorporates several layers of protection such as a physical camera shutter and a microphone/camera off button. It is up to you when it’s listening and when it is not. The 2MP camera keeps you in touch through video calls using the Alexa app or another Echo device. It serves as a quick way to check up on family or roommates without opening up your phone.</p>
<p>Amazon is officially returning the Echo Show 5 to its all-time low price of $59 for this early Black Friday deal.</p>
