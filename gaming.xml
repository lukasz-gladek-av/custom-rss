              <p>Gaming at high frame rates with maxed-out settings doesn’t have to drain your bank account anymore. Asus just dropped a deal on two of its latest powerhouses: the TUF Gaming GeForce <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4923/">RTX 5070 is now down to $584 on Amazon (from $739)</a>, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4922/">the RTX 5080 sits at $1,349 (originally $1,599)</a>.</p>

<h2>Why Should You Pay Attention to These Cards?</h2>
<p>The RTX 5070 comes equipped with 12GB of GDDR7 memory whih is the most recent generation of graphics memory technology. GDDR7 brings much higher data transfer rates than the older cards’ GDDR6, so textures load sooner, stuttering is reduced, and you enjoy smoother action in memory-hungry titles like Cyberpunk 2077 or Microsoft Flight Simulator. 12GB capacity means you’ll have no VRAM bottlenecks at 1440p or even 4K resolutions in most titles, and provides you with headroom through the next couple of years as titles increasingly require increasing amounts of resources.</p>
<p>The RTX 5070 uses a 3.125-slot design which means it’s slightly thicker than traditional two-slot cards but not quite as massive as some three-slot monsters. This extra space allows for a more robust cooling solution without turning your case into an oven. Asus equips it with axial-tech fans that spin in alternating directions to reduce turbulence and increase airflow efficiency.</p>



<p>Upgrading to the RTX 5080, you’ll be getting 16GB of GDDR7 memory and the more substantial 3.6-slot build. This card aims directly at gamers who won’t compromise, running 4K resolution with ray tracing and still demanding triple-digit frame rates. That extra 4GB of VRAM over the 5070 makes all the difference when you’re gaming at higher resolutions and ultra textures or you’re doing content creation like video editing or 3D rendering on the side. Vapor chamber cooling on the RTX 5080 is an evolution of the older heat pipe technology. Instead of using the latter’s hollow tubes to conduct the heat, the vapor chamber distributes the thermal energy on a wider surface area, keeping the hotspot under control and delivering steady results even through long gaming marathons.</p>



<p>Both boards are PCIe 5.0 capable, doubling the bandwidth of PCIe 4.0. Now, you won’t be seeing huge real-world improvements to gaming these days, but future software and applications are going to be increasingly making use of that extra bandwidth. DisplayPort 2.1 and HDMI connectivity adds future-proof readiness of the next generation of monitors, including those scaling well beyond 4K resolution and higher refresh rates. If you have come to consider one of those new 240Hz 4K monitors, these cards actually have the ability to properly feed themIt manufactures these TUF Gaming cards using military-grade components and provides protective PCB coating.</p>
<p>At $584, the RTX 5070 undercuts what many people paid for last generation’s mid-range cards while delivering current-gen performance and features. The RTX 5080 at $1,349 brings flagship-tier gaming within reach of enthusiasts who don’t want to take out a loan for their hobby. Given that both cards have strong review scores on Amazon (4.7 stars for the 5070 across over 2,000 reviews, and 4.6 stars for the 5080), stock my sell out quickly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve heard of RV There Yet?, you’re not the only one. The indie title is building a big name for itself, and as an indie title, the matter of its price tag has come up more than once. We’re here to tell you if RV There Yet does cost anything, and if it doesn’t, how much the price tag is that’s been slapped on this badboy.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rv-there-yet-playstation-xbox-nintendo-switch-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RV There Yet?</a> has a simple premise: Drive through and reach the end of Route 65. You must use supplies, eat food, and overcome a marathon of hurdles and deadly obstacles to do so, though. It’s not as easy as it sounds, but then again, if you don’t like the price tag, you might never get to find out.</p>



<p>RV There Yet? could be free-to-play, or it might not, so let’s see what it takes to visit the hilariously named Mabutts Valley.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-rv-there-yet-free-to-play">Is RV There Yet Free To Play?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Worth it, in our opinion. Credit to Nuggets Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>RV There Yet? is not a free-to-play indie game, and it does have a price tag if you want to play.</strong></p>



<p>The road to Route 65 has a slight monetary hurdle to get over first. But it’s worth it to support independent developers, as games like this always exude more creativity than <em>another </em>churned-out AAA sequel.</p>



<p>You’re also getting a decent amount of features in RV There Yet? too. The co-op title includes proximity chat to communicate your craziness and capers, online co-op, and a deep and detailed map.</p>



<p>Again, the game’s not free, but the good news is that it won’t break the bank, in the same way a moose will break your RV with ease.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-does-rv-there-yet-cost-on-steam">How Much Does RV There Yet Cost On Steam?</h2>



<p><strong>RV There Yet? has a paltry price tag of $7.99 (or £6.69) on Steam, making the game a very affordable purchase for all parties.</strong></p>



<p>One of the biggest benefits when it comes to indie titles has, and always will be, the alluring price tags. It might not be free, but it’s almost as good as free! This is a fair cost for a co-op title that you can derive many hours of pleasure and pain from.</p>



<p>Furthermore, if you buy RV There Yet? before October 28 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3949040/RV_There_Yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, you get the game for a discounted introductory price: $7.19 or £6.02.</p>



<p>The sooner you buy it, the better. So, let us know if you do, what you think of it, and you can share your experience through the comments and <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1416770944961220720/1416780218936463463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

		<p>Netmarble has announced a slight delay to the release of Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive, pushing back launch from November 17th by a week. The reason given is that the team needs a bit more time to get Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive to address issues and get the game up to scratch. However, the delay is not that long with the new official date set as November 24th.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE] Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-DbLH3OKvBc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, the team said, <em>“Thanks to the valuable feedback Hunters shared across various channels during the first demo period, the development of Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE has been progressing smoothly. However, we kindly ask for your understanding as the official launch schedule has been adjusted to further enhance the game’s overall quality and deliver the best possible gameplay experience. To ease the disappointment of Hunters eagerly awaiting the official release, the demo version will remain playable according to the previously announced schedule. Please see below for more details.</em></p>
<p><em>&nbsp;Schedule</em><br>
<em>– Demo: 11/17 (Mon) 17:00 (UTC+0)</em><br>
<em>– Early Access: 11/21 (Fri) 17:00 (UTC+0)</em><br>
<em>– Official Launch: 11/24 (Mon) 17:00 (UTC+0)</em></p>
<p><em>* The detailed schedule may be subject to change.</em></p>

<p><em>In the remaining time, we will continue to dedicate the full capabilities of the OVERDRIVE team to deliver an even more polished and complete version of OVERDRIVE. We ask for your continued interest in Solo Leveling: ARISE OVERDRIVE, and we look forward to the day we can finally meet our Hunters.”</em></p>
<p>Solo Levelling centres on Sung Jin-Woo, the weakest hunter in a world where hunters fight off otherworldly threats. After an encounter in a mysterious dungeon, Sung Jin-Woo discovers that he’s become a ‘player’, experiencing the world like a video game, and able to grind and improve his hunter level – something that should be impossible. Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive is due to be released for PC and Xbox Series XS.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-cannot-possibly-be-on-sale-now">out now</a>, and naturally modders have immediately emerged from the shadows to start shaping it into what they want from a bout of neck-biting.</p>
<p>Make sure to check out Dominic Tarason's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">review for us</a> if you're still hunting for verdicts before you drain your wallet, but if you're looking to start modding away, I'm glad to report that Bloodlines 2's quickly amassing a nice array of early tweaks.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In terms of handy changes, modder Caites has snatched the lead so far in my estimation. Their <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/vtmbloodlines2/mods/1">player tweaks</a> offer a handful of adjustments like boosted attack power with the caveat of increased fragility, lowered likelihood of being sussed out via stealthy violence, and quicker general movement speed to make commuting between quest givers more palatable. Other works from the same modder include <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/vtmbloodlines2/mods/18">faster levelling</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/vtmbloodlines2/mods/3">un-vignetted sneakage</a> and a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/vtmbloodlines2/mods/20">boost to the blood</a> dished out by feeding, the latter hopefully making hunting humans a bit less tedious a process than Dominic found it.</p>
<p>Beyond those, there's a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/vtmbloodlines2/mods/9">camera freer</a>, some of the usual attempts at <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/vtmbloodlines2/mods/13">reshading</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/vtmbloodlines2/mods/8">performance optimising</a>, and oh, wait. It's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>'s famed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-f-modder-removes-the-fog-a-day-before-release-beginning-games-logical-transformation-into-a-wholesome-life-sim">fog remover</a>, FellowDemo, continuing their crusade to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/vtmbloodlines2/mods/15">de-mistify spooky locales</a>. In this case, that work looks to render Seattle's nights even more noticeably neon-drenched, so maybe worth grabbing if you're curious about architecture or have always wondered what it'd be like to go on a vampirecation to the Las Vegas strip.</p><p>Rounding things out are some basic outfit and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/vtmbloodlines2/mods/10">hair</a> revamps, in case you fancy some <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/vtmbloodlines2/mods/19">differently coloured threads</a> or wandering around in the snow with a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/vtmbloodlines2/mods/12">bit more boob on display</a>, again I assume for reasons of Vegas night out roleplay. Finally, modder Jenya66 has decided female Phyre needs a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/vtmbloodlines2/mods/21">post-prologue manicure</a> to get rid of some chipped black nail polish, because being nice and clean on the outside is always important when you regularly fill your insides with the tomato juice of random strangers.</p>
<p>Odds are plenty more Bloodlines 2 mods will be rocking up in the coming weeks and months, as folks get their teeth into it. Rest assured we'll tell you about any interesting or noteworthy ones we spot.</p>

<p>Pokémon never likes to make it easy to complete the Pokédex in any game, and the same challenges are presented in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, with some requiring trading. We’re here to help, though, with a full list of trade codes.</p>



<p>Trade codes in Pokémon Legends: Z-A are extremely beneficial as they allow you to skip past the long process of using social media platforms to organise trades with strangers, instead putting you straight into the thick of it by pairing you with a player who is looking for exactly the same thing as you.</p>



<p>Gone are the days when you needed to be in close proximity with a link cable; instead, complete your Pokémon Legends: Z-A Pokédex through the wonders of the internet using these trade codes.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Gotta swap ’em all. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 10 Pokémon</strong> <strong>in total that require trading to evolve in Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A, though some can be found in their evolved forms in the wild.</strong></p>



<p>The likes of Alakazam, Gengar, Machamp, and Gourgeist are encounterable in the wild in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, though they can be rare, while Steelix can be caught via main story progression. If you want a readily available supply of the Pokémon, however, trading is the quickest means.</p>



<p>Below, you can find all the trade codes for Pokémon Legends: Z-A, courtesy of <a href="https://x.com/AustinJohnPlays/status/1979536288400191535" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AustinJohnPlays</a>. Be sure to check the receiving Pokémon before agreeing to a trade so you don’t get trolled!</p>

<p><strong>Trading in Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A is not immediately available when you first start the game, as introductory points of the story must be completed before online access opens up.</strong></p>



<p>Once you have unlocked online features in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, including the Mystery Gift and Trading, follow these steps to initiate a trade.</p>



<ol>
<li>Hit X on your Nintendo Switch controller to open the main menu.</li>



<li>Scroll down to the ‘Link Play’ option.</li>



<li>Select ‘Link Trade’.</li>



<li>Choose the ‘Faraway Players’ option.</li>



<li>Wait for your console to connect to the internet.</li>



<li>Enter the designated code from the table above.</li>



<li>Wait for a partner to be found.</li>



<li>Select the Pokémon you wish you trade.</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A post on the official Japanese Twitter / X account for the upcoming game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dissidia-duellum-final-fantasy">Dissidia Duellum Final Fantasy</a> received a reply from none other than veteran developer Akitoshi Kawazu, who surprised users by revealing new information about the inspiration behind a Final Fantasy II character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dissidia Duellum Final Fantasy is Square Enix’s upcoming free-to-play mobile game, slated for a 2026 release. Featuring cel-shaded graphics, Dissidia Duellum takes beloved Final Fantasy characters from throughout the RPG series’ history and transports them to modern Tokyo, where they take on monsters in 3vs3 battles. Two teams of Final Fantasy characters will race to fight their way through roaming monsters to beat the boss faster than the opposing team. The game will also feature voiced story segments.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dissidia Duellum will not only let you put protagonists like Cloud, Squall, and Lightning in your party, but a whole host of other characters are also making a return, some in the form of special abilities. The official X account recently revealed that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/final-fantasy-ii/Minwu">Minwu</a>, a character from 1988’s Final Fantasy II, will be lending power to your party with his teleport ability.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">ミン=ウは漢字で表記すると、呉明、となります。モデルは戦国時代の呉起。孫呉の兵法という形で孫氏と並び立つ兵法家という評価です。</p>— 河津秋敏 (@SaGa30kawazu) <a href="https://twitter.com/SaGa30kawazu/status/1979894991829999619?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 19, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Veteran dev Akitoshi Kawazu, battle designer for Final Fantasy I and II as well as the key creator of the SaGa series, responded to this post with some insight into Minwu’s original inspiration. In his post, Kawazu revealed that Minwu was modelled on Wu Qi, a real life military general and philosopher from China's Warring States period. He explained that when Minwu’s name is written in kanji characters, it contains the same character for Wu as Wu Qi (rendered as 呉 in Japanese, and 吳 in traditional Chinese). For the Japanese release of Final Fantasy II, Minwu’s name was written phonetically in katakana (a script used for foreign loan words) just like the rest of the game’s cast of characters, so the reference to Wu Qi was not apparent to players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Final Fantasy II, Minwu is a white wizard from Mysidia who temporarily joins your party. He serves the Flynn royal family in exile as an advisor when the Palemecian Empire’s attack forces them to flee. He plays a key role in organizing rebel forces and the quest for the Ultima Tome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another reason Minwu’s inspiration is not readily apparent is his physical appearance. With his turban and dark skin, he does not visually resemble Wu Qi. However, his strategic role as an advisor plus his loyalty to the Flynn royal family and Princess Hilda does bear some resemblance to Wu Qi’s appointment as the head of Chu State and his fealty to King Dao. Sadly, both meet tragic ends.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Final Fantasy Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kawazu’s comment attracted many appreciative responses from other users. “It makes me extremely happy to receive new information about FFII in this day and age. Thank you,” said one<a href="https://x.com/kandata_dq10/status/1979940177658384569" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> commenter</u></a>. <a href="https://x.com/ZERU_KOBA/status/1980287303567512044" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Others</u></a> were eager for more insight into the 37-year-old game: “I wonder if there are any behind-the-scenes revelations or inspirations for other Final Fantasy II characters?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dissidia Duellum is scheduled to launch on iOS and Android in 2026.

            <p>Mouse: P.I. For Hire - the attractive black-and-white, vintage Disney-styled shooter - has been delayed. The game had been targeting a late 2025 release but will now arrive early in 2026.</p>
<p>Developer Fumi Games and publisher PlaySide announced the date-change in <a href="https://x.com/mousethegame/status/1980843296315568506">a shared statement on X</a>. A release date was apparently expected in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/galaxies-autumn-2025-showcase-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect">this week's Galaxies Gaming Showcase</a>, on Thursday, so the statement was issued to pre-empt any disappointment.</p>
<p>"Ahead of the reveal, we wanted to let you know that we have made the decision to move the launch of Mouse: P.I. For Hire from 2025 to early 2026," Fumi Games and PlaySide Studios wrote.</p>

<p>Mouse: P.I. For Hire is Polish studio Fumi Games' debut offering, but its art design has already helped it stand out in a couple of high profile showcases - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-june-2025-everything-announced">the 2025 Summer Game Fest Opening Showcase</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-microsofts-xbox-partner-preview-october-2024">the Xbox Partner Preview</a> which aired the other day.</p>
<p>Troy Baker stars as the cigar-munching Detective Peppers in Mouse: P.I. For Hire, and his trigger-happy antics are accompanied by a swinging orchestral score and bobbing, lively cartoon animation. It looks great.</p>

In an update video, the developers gave the reasons for the time needed with much of it to do with Starminer’s scope and making sure every system works together properly. The good news is that Cool and Good Games will be inviting 500 more testers to provide feedback, allowing the team to scale the game properly.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dev Update | Developers to Community" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JbuAvV6XeH4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There is no new release window for Starminer, but the dev team did recently provide answers in a recent Q&amp;A. In terms of release, Cool and Good Games have stated it will be able to determine that through the next phase of beta testing. The team has also confirmed it is working on a feature to allow players to share blueprints of their spacestations with others, and there are no build limits so stations can grow as big as you want them to. Starminer will have campaign, sandbox, and survival modes. The campaign will help players get to grips with Starminer’s systems while allowing some creative freedom, and you will learn more about the game’s lore through this mode too. Sandbox is a much more customisable experience allowing choices of starting ship, starting location, and whether enemies are active. Survival will have players facing endless waves of enemies with the goal to stay alive for as long as possible. Physics also plays a crucial part in Starminer with structural integrity and mass really impacting how your station moves. You can move using direct controls though the team is also working on a point and click navigation system too. You will also be able to manage the power levels of ships, allowing you to toggle consumption of various modules including factories, shields, and lasers.</p>
<p>In Starminer, your goal is to build an interstellar mining fleet to find resources among the asteroids in space, and sell those resources for profit. However, doing so will incur the wrath of alien civilisations that will do all that they can to stop you from stripping areas of resources. To counter them you can have warships and defense platforms as part of your fleet.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-lacks-credits-for-some-ridgeline-games-devs-and-marcus-lehto-isn%E2%80%99t-happy-about-it.1331200/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A Battlefield 6 controversy arose yesterday when Marcus Lehto, former Halo designer and Ridgeline Games' studio general manager, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7386081189645885440/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed in a LinkedIn post</a> that some of the studio's developers were not credited for their work on the game.</p>



<p><em>I’m disappointed to see that many of my former teammates from Ridgeline Games were not properly credited in the recent release of Battlefield 6. These talented developers worked tirelessly for 1 to 2.5 years, building the foundation of the game, before I left voluntarily and the studio was subsequently shuttered. Despite their significant contributions, most who were laid off were relegated to a “Special Thanks” section at the very end of the credits — and several were omitted entirely, including myself.</em></p>



<p><em>Out of respect for my colleagues and the awesome work they poured into this project, I want to take a moment to properly recognize them — listing their names and roles as I would have preferred them to appear in the credits.</em></p>



<p>Lehto then shared an image with their names as they should have appeared in the Battlefield 6 credits. Interestingly, his own name is among the missing ones.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Ridgeline Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-shakeup-respawn-vince-zampella-halo-designer-in-charge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was established in late 2021</a> as part of the big franchise shakeup that followed the underwhelming Battlefield 2042 launch and also included Respawn's Vince Zampella as the new head of the IP. In 2023, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-single-player-campaign-will-be-co-developed-by-dice-and-ridgeline-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that the single player campaign of Battlefield 6 would be handled by DICE and Ridgeline Games, but the studio couldn't pull it off and was closed down last year. Eventually, the single player was handled by Criterion and Motive, but as noted <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in our review of the shooter</a>, it was by far the game's weakest part. Fortunately for EA, the rest was the best rendition of Battlefield in years and <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-sold-over-7-million-units-3-days-biggest-franchise-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">led to record-breaking sales figures</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mortal Kombat 2 Movie Will Now Release a Week Earlier]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/mortal-kombat-2-movie-release-date-change/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s only been a couple of months since it was officially announced that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-mortal-kombat-2-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat 2</a> movie will be missing its 2025 release date and will be pushed back to May 2026; however, a new tidbit of news has once again changed the movie’s release date.</p>



<p>Moving from its pre-planned May 22nd, 2026 release date, Mortal Kombat 2 is not set to launch one week earlier on May 15, 2026.</p>



<p>Presumably, the date change is intended to give the film breathing room in what appears to be shaping up to be a busy month for movies in May. Notably, it avoids a same-day release as The Mandalorian and Grogu movie, which is set to launch on May 22nd.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-mortal-kombat-2-avoiding-gta-6">Is Mortal Kombat 2 Avoiding GTA 6?</h2>



<p>The movie industry usually doesn’t take note of video game releases, but it could be said that the release date move may also have been made to avoid Grand Theft Auto 6’s release date, which is currently scheduled for May 26th.</p>



<p>In the industry’s eyes, GTA 6 could be a once-in-a-lifetime event for the video game industry, causing millions of gamers to hunker down to play the game. Although movies don’t tend to take notice of video games, I think this is such an unprecedented release, that it was a wise decision if they decided to change because of it.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to watching Mortal Kombat 2 on May 15th? Let me know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>&nbsp;if you’re hoping for a resurgence of Scarface: The World is Yours.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/how-many-people-can-play-rv-there-yet-max-players/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You need to know how many people and players can play RV There Yet together if you’ve ever wanted to build haggard-looking contraptions to get an RV over obstacles, negotiate tight mountain roads leading to almost-certain death, and smoke stuff with a moose loose on the RV.</p>



<p>That was quite the opening paragraph, yet it encapsulates everything <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rv-there-yet-playstation-xbox-nintendo-switch-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RV There Yet?</a> is about. The Nuggets Entertainment project borrows the odd idea from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peak-devs-announce-a-new-co-op-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PEAK</a>—understandably, given PEAK’s unbelievable success—and adds its own flair.</p>



<p>One familiar gameplay is how many people can play RV There Yet? If you want to know if this is a co-op title with AI, or a fun party co-op game, you’re in the right place.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-players-can-play-rv-there-yet-together">How Many Players Can Play RV There Yet Together?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Nuggets Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>RV There Yet? allows for a maximum of up to four players to work together to get the all-terrain vehicle where it needs to be.</strong></p>



<p>The RV isn’t strictly an all-terrain vehicle, but you certainly need it to be to clear Route 65 in the game. Figuring out how to get past the next inconvenience is all part of the fun in RV There Yet?, and you can do so with at least three other players in your game.</p>



<p>Three of you can kick back and chill in the background, smoking and enjoying your best life, while one of you has the unenviable task of driving the RV and trying not to get it lodged in perilous positions. Exiting Route 65 is tough, but it’s better with friends, although it’s not <em>technically </em>a requirement.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-rv-there-yet-solo">Can You Play RV There Yet? Solo?</h2>



<p><strong>Officially, RV There Yet? can be tackled solo, but it’s not recommended, as the game wasn’t designed this way.</strong></p>



<p>RV There Yet? is easily at its best when there are a few of you coming together. Would Among Us, Lethal Company, Content Warning, or any similar multiplayer game be as fun if you played them by yourself?</p>



<p>Plus, there’s the fact that a dev doesn’t recommend it: “[The] game is 2-4 players (technically can play solo but wasn’t made for that),” says jace on the official RV There Yet? <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1422517981216374818/1427593942232207481/1429856409188700292" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Discord</a>.</p>



<p>For now, we recommend following these instructions and finding one to three buddies to team up with.</p>



<p>If you do play RV There Yet? on your own, let us know how it goes and if it’s even possible to complete the game. For anything else, head on over to the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1416770944961220720/1416780218936463463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming Discord</a> to discuss the breakout hit or anything else gaming-related.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NASCAR 25 Review – Heart-pounding racing action]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/22/nascar-25-review-heart-pounding-racing-action/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nascar-25-review-%E2%80%93-heart-pounding-racing-action.1331191/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>A little bit of context goes a long way. Just like Drive to Survive brought thousands of new fans to Formula 1, NASCAR: Full Speed has done a good job of selling the American-based racing series to places that think Daytona is just an old Sega game and that NASCAR drivers only know how to turn left. NASCAR 25 has a whole new audience to court then, and as the best (and admittedly only) place to properly embody drivers like Denny Hamlin and Ryan Blaney, this could be NASCAR’s breakout year.</p>
<p><iframe title="NASCAR 25 | Official Hype Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CEIYrJoXBf0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Career mode is framed in moving style by Dale Earnhardt Junior’s journey from a promising rookie to the NASCAR Hall of Fame, and it certainly sets the right tone for a game that’s designed to take you to sporting glory. Alongside the on-track action, vehicle tuning, and back-office tinkering, there’s a series of Dale JR Download podcast shows that make the experience feel thoroughly authentic, and bring you right into the thick of the world of NASCAR.</p>


<p>Creating a character is as laughably short as inputting a name, but you’ll be glad to discover that there’s a whole suite of much more important customisation options beyond that, letting you choose your car and team logo, your racing number, and then dig right into the visual look of your car, helmet and race suit. It’s easy and intuitive, and while you might be able to do more with various other racing games, I appreciated the straightforward batch of controls, and you unlock more designs as you progress.</p>


<p>The greatest shade thrown at NASCAR by racing fans around the world is that there’s no art to going round and round in a circle. NASCAR 25 shows that not only are they utterly wrong, but you need to find a place of zen and calm to be in with a hope of taking home a trophy. NASCAR is about driving on the absolute knife-edge of speed, holding your racing line, staying out of trouble, and doing so consistently, lap after lap. There isn’t anything easy in that, and frankly, I found it utterly mesmerising. Also, some of the tracks do actually have corners, with races at COTA, Sonoma, Watkins Glen and some street circuits as well, depending on the championship.</p>
<p>Somehow, the fact that your input has to be so precise, so smooth, and so controlled, makes your heart thump with the force of a punctured tyre. While Days of Thunder famously said that rubbing is racing, you’re ideally going to work your way through the pack without too much friction, finding yourself let loose by the minute mistakes made by other drivers. Honestly, it’s about the most edge-of-the-seat racing experience I’ve had in, well, forever. There’s no rewind, only a restart, and the smallest mistake can be the difference between the top 5 and 35th. It feels excellent.</p>

<p>Completing events sees you earning Rep. That’s not just based on where you finished the race, but also hitting your target in practice and qualifying, your lap speed, leading a race, and whether you raced clean. That last one is perhaps the hardest one to earn – there’s bound to be at least a little jostling in the pack – but it gives you other things to target beyond that elusive first place, and it can lead to better opportunities with sponsors, and the opportunity to earn more money.</p>
<p>There’s another reason to keep things clean, as each part of your car carries a Performance Rating. If you damage them, it’ll affect the overall performance of your vehicle, making it much tougher to perform well on race day. You’ll also get a social media blast from your opponents if they feel like you weren’t exactly trying not to run into them, and some of these definitely raised a few wry smiles along the way.</p>

<p>The pace of NASCAR 25’s Career mode might also raise a few more smiles, as it has options that allow it to be punchier and faster than you’d expect from the notoriously long-winded category. At a mere 7% race length, Practice, Qualifying and the race itself might see you complete as few as 5 to 10 laps in total, and then the back office repairs and PR choices tend to be fairly straightforward and binary. Repair decisions do become slightly tougher later on as you balance resources and cash, but the admin definitely takes a back seat to the on-track action.</p>
<p>Fans of NASCAR will be glad to know that you can race each race to its full length, and one of NASCAR 25’s greatest strengths is its adjustability. You can opt for a much lighter sim experience, dialling down the length, difficulty and damage, or you can move all the sliders to the right and make things as realistic and challenging as possible. What shines throughout is the handling model, which feels absolutely tuned in. Playing with controller is certainly an easier experience, but if you want the closest thing to being on track yourself, grab your steering wheel and check out just how good NASCAR 25 feels.</p>
<p>As you progress through Career mode, you move up through the different race categories, and you can participate in the Craftsmen Truck series at the same time, with races happening through the same weekend, maximising your time on track, which, depending on where you are could be a blessing or a curse. Your team changes and evolves as you progress too, and you can fire and hire new staff in each crucial role, giving you a boost when it comes to repairs, or helping you to gain more Rep. You may find yourself becoming strangely attached to them, and I felt a few twinges of guilt as I sacked a staff member that had been with me for a while.</p>
<p>While the Career mode is likely the main draw, you’ve got the option of Quick Race, Championship and 40-player online multiplayer to sink your teeth into as well. The multiplayer is often as chaotic as you’d expect, but if you hit upon the Goldilocks of lobbies, it’s a great experience, with reliably smooth performance and connection. Through these modes, there’s also a full roster of racers, from Cup Series stars like Byron, Hill and Reddick through to up and coming drivers like Brenden Queen and Andres Perez. The whole thing feels thoroughly authentic.</p>

<p>While this might be the premier rendition of the racing category, there’s a few elements that occasionally make it feel like slightly more of a budget release than you might be expecting. Some visual elements of the UI are very basic, and while there’s customisation, your character doesn’t even get the option of a placeholder image, or an actual character model. The car upgrade system also doesn’t extend very far beyond the fact that more expensive parts are better, which is a shame, and definitely loses out on an injection of depth into your downtime between races.</p>

			<p>Despite being developed by PlatinumGames instead of series creator Team NINJA, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-4-bathed-in-blood/">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> stays true to the franchise's root with a hardcore and challenging action game experience that's unlike anything else on the market. The relatively high challenge level of normal difficulty can turn some newcomers off, but by mastering the basics and the intricacies of these 4 core skills, you can start dominating the battlefield, have tons of fun, and prepare yourself for even more challenges to be found in Hard and Master Ninja difficulties.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>NOTE: The following strategies have been developed in Normal difficulty mode and were further refined in Hard Mode by the author, who completed two playthroughs at these difficulties and is working on a Master Ninja difficulty run, in the game's 1.0.1.0 Steam release.

<p>The Flying Swallow Combat Skill returns from previous entries in the series and is as useful as ever. While it is primarily used to attack enemies from the air, it has many very useful defensive applications that make it a must-learn right at the start of the game.</p>

<p>The Flying Swallow Combat Skill is one of Ninja Gaiden 4's easiest and most satisfying skills to use. With a very low execution barrier, you can use this skill while locked onto an enemy to close the gap quickly, deal solid damage while being generally safe from the vast majority of short-range attacks. With the Flying Swallow Barrage skill, the technique can be repeated up to three times, making it even more useful against all sorts of enemies.</p>



<h3 id="h-b-defensive-basic-repositioning-and-disengagement">B. Defensive Basic: Repositioning and Disengagement</h3>



<p>The Flying Swallow's high movement range makes it the absolute best movement skill in Yakumo and Ryu's arsenal in Ninja Gaiden 4. Its high speed and relatively low landing delay make it easy to use multiple times to cover a lot of ground extremely quickly.</p>

<p>The Flying Swallow's utility as a movement skill can be easily tested in the game's Training mode. Starting from one of the side walls, a single Flying Swallow covers almost half of the entire training room, requiring just two to cover the whole length of the room in roughly only 1.5 seconds. The same ground is covered by running in approximately 3.5 seconds. With over double the time and the vulnerability that comes from ground movement, Flying Swallow is the superior way for traversing stages and get away from danger quickly.</p>



<h3 id="h-c-advanced-defense-the-combo-break-escape">C. Advanced Defense: The Combo Break Escape</h3>



<p>Besides being a great offensive skill that stays useful at all difficulty settings and an amazing movement tool, the Flying Swallow skills has multiple defensive applications that are just as useful as its offensive capabilities. One of these defensive applications is a "Combo Break Escape" that lets Yakumo and Ryu get away from combo attacks from enemies and reposition themselves for some much needed breathing room.</p>

<p>The execution of this technique is simple. If you get caught in a combo attack from enemies like the D.D.O. Naginata enemies, all you have to do is mash the jump button (Cross or A button on the standard control scheme) and then hold a direction while pressing the heavy button. </p>



<p>While mashing buttons is always a bad idea in a game like Ninja Gaiden 4, doing so while you are stuck in a combo allows Yakumo and Ryu to jump at the earliest opportunity, giving you the chance of using Flying Swallow to reposition yourself and escape a combo that could have been lethal.</p>



<h2 id="h-mastering-blocking-dodging-and-parrying">Mastering Blocking, Dodging and Parrying</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ninja-Gaiden-4-Parry-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Parrying attacks in Ninja Gaiden 4 can be quite satisfying</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Blocking, Dodging, and Parrying are the basic defensive skills in Ninja Gaiden 4 available from the start of the game, which can be further enhanced by purchasing certain skills from Tyran, such as Fatal Flash to unlock a counter after parrying an attack, Mirage for countering after a perfect dodge and Reflect to counter after a perfect block</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Detail</th><th>Blocking</th><th>Dodging</th><th>Parrying</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>How to Learn</strong></td><td>Available at the start of the game</td><td>Available at the start of the game</td><td>Available at the start of the game</td></tr><tr><td><strong>How to Perform</strong></td><td>Hold R2 / Right Trigger to block regular melee and ranged attacks for a set number of times</td><td>Press R2 / Right Trigger and a direction on the Left Stick to dodge attacks (can result in a Perfect Dodge)</td><td>Time a regular Light or Heavy Attack in Base Form against an enemy's attack</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Cost</strong></td><td>N/A (No NinjaCoins)</td><td>N/A (No NinjaCoins)</td><td>N/A (No NinjaCoins)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3 id="h-a-defensive-basic-holding-block-to-stay-safe">A. Defensive Basic: Holding Block to Stay Safe</h3>



<p>While blocking is often ineffective in other character action games, in Ninja Gaiden 4 it is among your best defensive tools, if not the very best. Once you hold R2 / Right Trigger, Yakumo and Ryu can block several consecutive regular attacks and even a single Power Attacks (the stronger attacks indicated by the red exclamation point).</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ninja-Gaiden-4-Blocking-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Blocking is the safest and most effective defensive tool in Ninja Gaiden 4</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Comprehensive defense:</strong> What makes Blocking so good is the fact that it is an omnidirectional defensive maneuver. No matter where the attack is coming from, Yakumo and Ryu can block attacks. By learning the Art of Defense skills, they can block up to 9 consecutive attacks before their block is broken, turning an excellent defensive option into a godlike ability that will be invaluable at higher difficulty settings.</p>



<h3 id="h-b-intermediate-skill-dodging-for-positioning">B. Intermediate Skill: Dodging for Positioning</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ninja-Gaiden-4-Perfect-Dodge-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Perfect Dodging attacks can be made easier by combining it with blocking</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Dodging attacks in Ninja Gaiden 4 carries risk. Raw dodging from a neutral position is not recommended until you get comfortable with enemy movesets, as the slight recovery delay at the end of the maneuver leaves you vulnerable.</p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Safe Repositioning is Key</strong>: To dodge safely, always perform it out of a Block. Hold the Block button and press any direction on the Left Stick to perform a quick side or back step. By continuing to hold block, Yakumo and Ryu will start blocking again at the earliest opportunity, making the maneuver much safer and making it easier to land Perfect Dodges.</p>



<p>Still, even from a neutral position, <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">perfect dodging can be useful, especially with skills like&nbsp;Mirage,&nbsp;which can</span> unleash counterattacks in base form and Bloodraven Form.</p>



<h3 id="h-c-advanced-skill-high-risk-high-reward-parry-and-perfect-block">C. Advanced Skill: High-risk, High Reward Parry and Perfect Block</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ninja-Gaiden-4-Perfect-Block-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Perfect Blocking requires perfect timing to pull off in Ninja Gaiden 4</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Parry and Perfect Block (unlocked with 9000 NinjaCoins) are the most advanced defensive options in Ninja Gaiden 4, and pulling them off requires perfect timing. The rewards, however, are well worth it, as any attacking regular enemy, and even bosses, will be briefly staggered, giving you the chance to counter with skills like Fatal Flash or Reflect.</p>



<p>Of the two, however, Parry is undoubtedly the better option in most situations. Given the aggressive enemies, you will often land Parries even when you weren't fully committed to the attempt, offering precious time to counterattack or escape. Perfect Blocking, on the other hand, comes with a stricter activation window, making it a technique that only true masters can use consistently. It can, however, deflect Power Attacks, so the enhanced utility in the hands of expert players offsets its harder execution.</p>



<h4 id="h-parry-vs-perfect-block-data"><strong>Parry vs. Perfect Block Data</strong></h4>



<p>After two playthroughs and achieving several SSS ranks for chapters, I conducted a test to gauge how consistently a moderately-experienced player can pull off parries and perfect blocks against the D.D.O. Soldier: Sword enemy (chosen for its easily readable attacks):</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Parry:</strong> Success 6 out of 10 times. (Three missed attempts still resulted in the enemy being interrupted due to the early parry attempt.)</li>



<li><strong>Perfect Block:</strong> Success 4 out of 10 times. (Missed attempts did not result in damage, but the enemy was not interrupted)</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-mastering-the-combo-system">Mastering the Combo System </h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ninja-Gaiden-4-Izuna-Drop-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The iconic Izuna Drop returns in Ninja Gaiden 4</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>Combo strings in Ninja Gaiden 4 are as straightforward as they can get. By combining light attacks (Square,X) with heavy attacks (Triangle/Y), Yakumo and Ryu will perform a variety of attacks whose properties change between different weapons. If an enemy can be dismembered, the heavy attack will turn into an Obliteration attack that will instantly kill the enemy. </p>



<p>By holding the L2/Left Trigger button, Yakumo will enter Bloodbind mode, giving him access to more powerful weapons but slower weapons as long as the Bloodbind Gauge isn't empty. Ryu's Gleam Mode functions similarly, giving him access to powerful quick attacks that can't be generally interrupted, an unblockable heavy attack launcher, and the ability to use his four Ninpo Spells.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ninja-Gaiden-4-Ground-Combo-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Keep your ground combos short to prevent enemies from interrupting you</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Safety is Key:</strong> No matter how devastating a long combo can be, it means nothing if it gets interrupted. Enemies in Ninja Gaiden 4 are aggressive, even at normal difficulty, and any long combo is bound to get interrupted. As such, you will want to:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Keep your combos short:</strong> Two light attacks and a heavy finisher deals great, safe damage to weaker enemies and decent damage to stronger enemies.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Take your fight to the air</strong>: All weapons in the game have easy access to a launching attack that lifts light and medium-sized enemies into the air. Air combos not only are shorter and generally safer, as only a few enemies can attack Yakumo and Ryu out of the air, but they can also be ended with the iconic Izuna Drop (600 NinjaCoins), which also damages and pushes back any enemy located below your characters.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Extend your air combos:</strong> As the risk of getting interrupted is way lower, you can safely extend your combos in the air for extra damage. Doing so is extremely simple with Yakumo. Do a three-light attacks combo, switch to a different weapon, and repeat until you have cycled through every available weapon. You can also add your Bloodraven Form weapons into the mix, which is a little overkill for most enemies, but you still want to get used to doing it, as stronger enemies can block your attacks while in the air and break your air combos. </p>



<p>If you don't want to end an air combo with an Izuna Drop, consider using the charged heavy attack with the Takeminakata Bloodraven Form sword, as it has a really wide range that can easily take down multiple enemies at the same time while in Berserk mode (activated by pressing L3+R3 when the dedicated gauge is full)</p>



<h3 id="h-sustained-air-combo-potential">Sustained Air Combo Potential</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ninja-Gaiden-4-Air-Weapon-Switching-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(232, 230, 227, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">By switching weapons with Yakum</em><em>o</em><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(232, 230, 227, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">, you can extend your air combos and stay in the air for a very long time</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Once you have unlocked a few additional weapons for Yakumo, you can stay in the air for quite a long time by switching between them on the fly. In a test conducted in the Training Mode, I was able to make Yakumo stay in the air for seconds by alternating between 4 light attack combo strings with the Takeminakata Twin Blades, Yatousen Rapier, Magatsuhi Staff, Kage-Hiruko Assassin's Tool and Dark Dragon Blade, and the Bloodbind Form of each weapon to restore as much gauge as possible to continue the combo and ending with a full light attack combo string of the Dark Dragon Blade Shadow-gleam Mode a total of roughly 16 seconds.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>NOTE: Any enemy in the game is long dead way before completing such a long barrage of attacks, so this is an extreme case scenario that is not going to occur in regular gameplay. But still, it shows the potential of the game's combat and weapon switching mechanics.</strong></em></p>

<p>Ultimate Attacks have always been very strong in the series, and it is no different in Ninja Gaiden 4. Not only do they deal massive amounts of damage, even at Level 1 charge (indicated by the blue aura surrounding Yakumo and Ryu), but they also grant full invincibility for their whole duration, making them a great defensive tool.</p>



<h3 id="h-a-offensive-basic-enhance-ultimate-attacks">A. Offensive Basic: Enhance Ultimate Attacks</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ninja-Gaiden-4-Ultimate-Attack-Level-2-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Level 2 Ultimate Attacks are among the most powerful combat techniques in Ninja Gaiden 4</em></figcaption></figure>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Skill Name</th><th>Cost (NinjaCoins)</th><th>Effect</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Ultimate Technique: Final Charge</strong></td><td>4,000</td><td>Adds an additional charge level to the Ultimate Technique. At maximum charge (Level 2), attack up to two enemies.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Ultimate Guidance</strong></td><td>800</td><td>Absorb nearby Blood Essence while charging an Ultimate Technique to increase charge speed. Speed increase depends on size of Blood Essence.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Landing Ultimate Technique</strong></td><td>5,500</td><td>Charge an Ultimate Technique immediately upon landing on the ground (after an air attack or jump) to increase charge speed.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>At the beginning of the game, Ultimate Attacks are not ease to use, nor very effective. You can only charge up to Level 1 and must stay stationary for 1.5 seconds to fully charge the attack, which is a lot in an action game with very aggressive enemies. As such, you must purchase the additional skills detailed in the table above to enhance Ultimate Attacks to make them truly Ultimate. Ultimate Technique: Final Charge is required to unlock the Level 2 charge, while Ultimate Guidance and Landing Ultimate Guidance make charging much faster under certain conditions</p>



<h3 id="h-b-advanced-skill-the-ultimate-attacks-chains-blood-essence-loop">B. Advanced Skill: The Ultimate Attacks Chains (Blood Essence Loop)</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Ninja-Gaiden-4-Ultimate-Charging-with-Blood-Essences-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Thanks to the Blood Essences dropped by enemies, you can chain multiple Ultimate Attacks one after the other</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>After learning the Ultimate Technique, Ultimate Guidance, and Landing Ultimate Technique skills, you can now chain multiple Ultimate Attacks together to defeat many enemies quickly and safely.</p>



<p>The combat loop is also relatively easy to put into action.</p>



<p>1. Launch an enemy in the air and try to defeat them with an Izuna drop. This ensures that any enemy standing below you is pushed back, that the defeated enemy drops Blood Essence, and that you take advantage of Landing Ultimate Guidance to speed up Ultimate Attack charging.</p>



<p>2. Once you absorb the Blood Essence left behind by the enemy, with the correct activation of Landing Ultimate Guidance, you will quickly charge your Ultimate Attack to Level 2, ensuring you can defeat two more enemies and make them drop more Blood Essences.</p>



<p>3. Depending on the situation, you can restart the loop from the first step, or start charging another Ultimate Attack.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">NOTE: Getting this loop down takes some time, and may not always be effective depending on the current situation, but in the vast majority of scenarios, this will allow you to dispose of multiple enemies rather quickly, while healing with the Blood Essences you are absorbing to fasten the charge.

</blockquote>



<p>While many of the strategies outlined above sound easy on paper, it takes some time to put some of their advanced concepts in action. By putting in effort, however, you will be able to rank up from being a novice ninja in Ninja Gaiden 4 to the master ninja the game wants you to be, all the while having more fun in a game that can feel a little overwhelming, at times.</p>

<p>The age of climbing games continues with RV There Yet? Another manic title with enough comedic juice to fill a swimming pool. PC players are currently lapping up the bizarre action in it, but as an indie title, it means RV There Yet? on PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch consoles is unclear.</p>



<p>RV There Yet? is just as bonkers as it looks in the trailers. You navigate a classic RV through basic forests and woodland areas to the most perilous of scenarios and impossible-looking climbs. What could go wrong! It follows in the footsteps (and footholds) of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peak-devs-announce-a-new-co-op-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PEAK</a> and other climbing games.</p>



<p>Whether you love the genre or you want to get yourself into some chaotic mishaps, we have information on the game’s console status.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-rv-there-yet-on-playstation-consoles">Can You Play RV There Yet? On PlayStation Consoles?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Sure. Credit to Nuggets Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You currently can’t play RV There Yet? on PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 consoles.</strong></p>



<p>That’s two down, unfortunately. RV There Yet can’t be played on current-gen or last-gen PlayStation hardware. It’s not a matter of whether the consoles can support the game—as we know they’re more than powerful enough—but it comes down to coding an indie PC game for a different platform, money, and other factors.</p>



<p>It could be a while until we see it on PlayStation, if ever.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-rv-there-yet-on-xbox-consoles">Can You Play RV There Yet? On Xbox Consoles?</h2>



<p><strong>Xbox One and Xbox Series X|S players also have to miss out on RV There Yet? as it’s also not on Microsoft consoles for now.</strong></p>



<p>It’s not going great. RV There Yet? also can’t make any stops for Xbox users. It’s a similar situation for the Xbox as it is for PlayStation, and until a wider console launch is announced, Xbox owners don’t get to experience RV There Yet either.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-rv-there-yet-on-nintendo-switch">Can You Play RV There Yet? On Nintendo Switch?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s a clean sweep as RV There Yet? isn’t available on either the Nintendo Switch or the Switch 2 successor.</strong></p>



<p>The original Switch had a habit of not incorporating wider third-party AAA titles, but would be home to indie titles—some of which Nintendo got first before PlayStation and Xbox, such as Hades.</p>



<p>However, there’s no such luck with RV There yet? Not even the more powerful and superior Switch 2 has a port lined up yet.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-rv-there-yet-ever-come-to-consoles">Will RV There Yet Ever Come To Consoles?</h2>



<p><strong>The game’s developer “isn’t sure” if RV There Yet will ever see the light of day on consoles.</strong></p>



<p>RV There Yet’s Discord server is quite active, and one user <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1422517981216374818/1427593942232207481/1429855678939398296" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">asked</a>: “Will the game release on console alongside Steam? (If it will have a console release at all?)</p>



<p>jace—a dev and community manager for the game’s Discord—<a href="https://discord.com/channels/1422517981216374818/1427593942232207481/1429856287688102030" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said this</a> concerning a console launch:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“No console release planned at this stage. And unfortunately I’m not great with hardware so I’m not sure.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s not ruled out altogether. As with other breakout indie games, it will likely depend on the game’s long-term profitability, sustainability, and interest in a wider launch. We’ll let you know if the day comes when RV There Yet drives down to PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo demanding a console release.</p>



<p>Have you managed to get on RV There Yet? early, before the game goes viral? How do you think it compares to its contemporaries? Let us know through our own <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1416770944961220720/1416780218936463463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-2">Mortal Kombat 2</a> - the upcoming action movie based on the famous gory video game series - will now be releasing a week earlier than planned. You'll be able to sit down (back) and check it out on the 8th May.</p>
<p>Its original theatrical release was set to be on the 15th. This window was largely uncontested, save for Comedy Poetic License and play adaptation Is God Is. However, by moving up a week, the film moves out of range of The Mandalorian and Grogu, which may very well eat up the nerdy movie crowd on the 22nd May onwards.</p>
<p>Now, in the fight for box office success, all Mortal Kombat 2 has to kontend with is leftovers from the 1st May weekend. That includes The Devil Wears Prada 2 and an animated children's movie called Animal Friends, starring Ryan Reynolds. Not exactly similar audiences, one would assume.</p>

<p>Back in August, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-movie-release-slips-to-2026">the Mortal Kombat 2 movie was pushed back to a 2026 release</a>, forcing fans to edit their kalenders from a jubilant movie moment on the 24th October. The film is being written by Jeremy Slater, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-movie-sequel-on-the-way-with-a-script-from-the-writer-of-moon-knight">the writer behind the critically acclaimed Moon Knight series</a>. The film stars <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-movie-reveals-best-look-yet-at-karl-urbans-johnny-cage">Karl Urban as Johnny Cage</a>, coming off a very successful role in The Boys as Billy Butcher. He was also Judge Dredd in the brilliant Dredd movie which more of you should have watched back in the day, I was too young at the time and wasn't allowed.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/save-your-gbp16-the-mortal-kombat-movie-is-boring">Former Eurogamer editor-in-chief Wesley Yin Poole found the Mortal Kombat movie (2021) boring</a>. He wrote: "There's just enough low-rent entertainment to prevent the Mortal Kombat movie from being a complete disaster, but it's tough to recommend when it costs £16 to rent online. A tenner straight to Blu-ray feels like a better fit."</p>

		<p>Valve has released a new feature for Steam so people can discover games they may be interested in, as well as keeping an eye on games that they are already interested in. The new feature is the Personal Calendar, which displays games that have been recently released and is also populated with games that you may be interested in based on playtimes of similar users and the games they have been wishlisting. The feature is currently a Steam Labs experiment, so it will likely have changes made to it. You can check out your own <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/personalcalendar?snr=1_2108_9__2107">calendar at the link.</a></p>
<p>The Personal Calendar only has Monday to Friday showing due to games rarely being released on weekends, and it will cover a rolling eight week period so it is not overwhelming. You can further customise the calendar to filter out different tags and determine how many game recommendations it is showing, with the default set to 100. It is also already populated with games that you have wishlisted, so you can see when a game you are wanting to play is going to be released. The recommendations themselves will be updated daily, but Valve does not see the recommended games changing too often due to the parameters that have been set. This is because as well as using similar profiles to provide recommendations, Steam will also take into account the games you are and have been playing, using the most played ones to populate the calendar too.</p>


<p>When it comes to the feedback Valve is looking for, the company has said, <em>“Really, we’re interested to know whatever feedback you may have about this experiment. Do you find this format of recommendations to be useful? What do you think about this new set of recommendations and calendar view? Are there other things we should include on the calendar? Does it seem to be generating good recommendations for you?”</em></p>
<p>To give feedback you join the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamLabs/discussions/19/?snr=1_2108_9__2107">discussions for Experiment 16: Personal Calendar</a>.<wbr></p>

            <p>Maybe prepare to dig out your finest gaudy suit and mountains of, er, a certain substance. A PC re-release of Radical Entertainment's Scarface: The World Is Yours has suddenly popped up on the Epic Store and Steam. The Epic version is available already, having been "unintentionally pushed live" early due to backend issues, according to new publishers EC Digital Entertainment.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Listings for the 2006 GTA-like were quickly spotted on both storefronts, with the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/scarface-the-world-is-yours-7c3e6f">Epic version</a> on sale for £23.79 / $29.99, while the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4113570/Scarface_The_World_Is_Yours_2006/">Steam listing</a> says a release date's to be announced down the line. The company who look to be behind the resurrection, EC Digital Entertainment, have offered an explanation for this discrepancy in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/4113570/view/542246264930041873?l=english">Steam announcement</a>.</p>
<p>"Due to a technical issue during backend configuration, the game was unintentionally pushed live on a different platform earlier than planned," the publishers wrote. "We want to clarify that our intended long-term release platform includes Steam, and we're now accelerating our efforts to finalize this version. As such, you may notice that the current Steam page includes placeholder content. This will be updated leading up to the official release."</p>
<p>"When the game officially launches on Steam, it will include an optional HD graphics upgrade, offered as a free DLC," EC Digital continued, adding a disclaimer that the graphical upgrade may be "subject to change". As for what it entails, they explained: "This enhanced mode uses AI-assisted techniques to improve certain visual elements while keeping the core experience intact. The use of AI is completely optional. Players can choose to play in original or enhanced visuals at any time."</p><p>Now, this is where things get a bit strange. My efforts to look into who are EC Digital Entertainment have borne very little fruit. <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/scarface-the-world-is-yours-pc-re-release-announced">Gematsu</a>'s report on the re-release cites them as a Hong Kong-based publisher, but following the link through to its info/category page on the site only sees you greeted with the Scarface story, a link to a <a href="https://www.ecdeasia.com/">website</a> that's pinging up an access block notification for me, and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ecdeasia/featured">YouTube channel</a> with three subscribers which has a sole video uploaded in 2009.</p>
<p>It's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IwGZe9uvAFk">20 second trailer</a> for seemingly defunct prehistoric RPG <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/stoneage-2">Stone Age 2</a>, with the description linking a website for it that doesn't appear to exist anymore. A quick Google search of their name hasn't immediately turned up any other info about the publishers and their <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?publisher=EC%20Digital">Steam profile</a> doesn't list any other games they've published.</p>
<p>One user in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ocxf5r/comment/nkq6bwc/">Reddit thread</a> about the re-release has claimed that the new Epic version of Scarface: The World Is Yours comes with the <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/669045-silentpatch/">SilentPatch</a> and <a href="https://fusionfix.io/wfp">Fusion Fix</a> mods pre-installed. Sadly, <a href="https://x.com/__silent_/status/1980894088913383823">according to</a> one of the modders behind the two, who goes by the handle Silent, if this is the case it's happened without permission. "None of us were contacted about this in advance (which isn't necessary as per the license, but would be nice)," they wrote. "I KNOW that the holder of the Scarface license wasn't willing to re-release the game, so this is suspect. I'm going to inquire for further information to the best of my abilities, but so far I doubt that release was cleared with Universal."</p>
<p>So yeah, that's why I was hesitant to encourage the digging out of Al Pacino outfits earlier. There's a chance EC Digital Entertainment have done a proper deal for the game's rights, but if this re-release is of the unapproved or dodgy variety, odds are a takedown could be incoming.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-roadmap-explained%E2%80%94all-future-arc-raiders-plans.1331167/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New extraction shooter ARC Raiders is looking to ‘Embark’ on a long journey. Whether it has the legs remains to be seen, but we’ve extracted some new information about the shooter and the potential ARC Raiders roadmap of future content.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> is one of the big, new multiplayer dogs in 2025. With Call of Duty unable to crack the DMZ nut, Escape From Tarkov has largely had the genre to itself. Say hello to Embark Studios’ ARC Raiders!</p>



<p>The extraction shooter has had multiple betas—including the late-on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/has-arc-raiders-server-slam-playtest-been-extended-playtest-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Server Slam playtest</a>—and it’s time to look forward instead of back.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-arc-raiders-have-a-roadmap">Does ARC Raiders Have A Roadmap?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We expect to travel and go everywhere. Credit to Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, ARC Raiders doesn’t officially have a roadmap yet, as Embark Studios is unwilling to commit to additional content plans for the time being.</strong></p>



<p>However, it doesn’t mean the developer isn’t thinking about the future, and this is evident with he shocking reveal that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-will-add-10-years-worth-of-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders devs are already planning 10 years worth of content</a>.</p>



<p>Embark Studios design lead Virgil Watkins said: “I think internally, for a very long time, we referred to this [ARC Raiders] as a 10-year game. That is the ambition we are aiming for and that dictates the type and quantity of content we want to put into it.”</p>



<p>We often see multiplayer games and single-player games with season passes announce future content before the current chunk of gameplay is out! <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ARC Raiders</a> isn’t going down this path anytime soon, as these plans can “Spiral into promises that can go unfulfilled if things change.”</p>



<h2 id="h-what-new-content-is-coming-to-arc-raiders">What New Content Is Coming To ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p><strong>Virgil Watkins has stated that ARC Raiders is likely to add fresh maps, more quests, and additional common-sense content throughout the game’s lifespan.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s the design lead’s words in full: “Of course, adding things over time like new maps, extending questlines, and introducing new enemies and new weapons, and things like that. We’ll have some stuff lined up post-launch and for a little bit after, but then it will be based on what we see out of the launch and thereafter.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It sounds like the typical content you’d come to expect from a post-game launch for an extraction shooter. We respect the fact that the team doesn’t want to put a timeframe on the new content and see how the launch plays out first.</p>



<p>Based on your time in any of the game’s playtests, what do you think ARC Raiders is lacking? It’s time to let us know via the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1416770944961220720/1416780218936463463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> and the comments section below.</p>



<hr>



<p>We have much more ARC Raiders content, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-price-free-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its price and whether it’s free to play</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-early-access-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">if there’s Launch Early Access</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-will-have-optional-progression-wipes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders has optional progression wipes</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> is a "good game" but it failed to match the Fallout and Elder Scrolls games because of its use of procedural generation and the fact "space is inherently boring".</p>
<p>That's according to former Starfield systems designer Bruce Nesmith, who discussed the game with <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/starfield-designer-says-sci-fi-rpg-still-a-great-game-but-procedural-generation-stopped-fallout-elder-scrolls/">FRVR</a>.</p>
<p>Starfield was Bethesda's first new series in over 25 years, following its work on Fallout and Elder Scrolls, but its critical and commercial reception was below expectations of the beloved studio.</p>

<p>"I think it's a good game," said Nesmith. "I don't think it's in the same calibre as the other two, you know, Fallout or Skyrim, or Elder Scrolls rather, but I think it's a good game. I worked on it, I'm proud of the work I did. I'm proud of the work that the people I knew did on it. I think they made a great game."</p>
<p>As such, Nesmith believes Starfield "would have been received differently" had it been released by a different company without the same expectations.</p>
<p>He "leans towards procedural generation" as the game's biggest problem, which was used to generate the various extraneous planets players can explore.</p>
<p>"I'm an enormous space fan, I'm an amateur astronomer, I'm up on all that stuff, a lot of the work I did on Starfield was on the astronomical data," said Nesmith, "but space is inherently boring. It's literally described as nothingness. So moving throughout that isn't where the excitement is, in my opinion.</p><p>"But when the planets start to feel very samey and you don't start to feel the excitement on the planets, that's to me where it falls apart," he continued. "I was also disappointed when, pretty much, the only serious enemy you fought were people… there's lots of cool alien creatures, but they're like the wolves in Skyrim. They're just there, they don't contribute, you don't have the variety of serious opponents that are story generators."</p>
<p>In the same podcast, as Eurogamer previously reported, Nesmith stated he's "eternally shocked" at the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skyrims-lead-designer-eternally-shocked-at-games-popularity-but-its-open-world-is-like-nothing-else">continued popularity of Skyrim</a>, on which he was lead designer.</p>
<p>"I think Skyrim did the open world in a way that nobody had ever done before and very few people have really tried to do since," he said. "And one of those things that we accepted, which a lot of developers struggle to accept, is that this means you're going to have quirkiness. You're going to have weird stuff happen. And if you say that's okay, you can get this diamond."</p>
<p>Last month Bethesda marked the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-marks-two-year-anniversary-with-a-secret-message">two year anniversary of Starfield with a secret message</a> on social media, with fans speculating about further DLC.</p>
<p>Bethesda has also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-teases-starfield-space-travel-update-after-datamined-leak">teased a forthcoming update to add an overhauled "cruise mode"</a> to space travel, following a datamined leak.</p>
<p>What's still expected is a release of Starfield on PS5, which could give it a new lease of life.</p>

            <p>
Steam is getting a new eight-week calendar feature for both games you've wishlisted and recommended games based on your previous playtime. No longer will you have to source recommendations by reading tea leaves, or visualise your wishlist by labelling different-shaped food in your fridge. Now, you'll get a proper, personalised Monday-to-Friday chart that refreshes every day. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Why doesn't the calendar cover weekends? Because Valve think most developers don't release games at the weekend, and they want to avoid cluttering up the view with empty squares. Any calendar recommendations that do have the insolence to materialise on a Saturday or Sunday will appear in the following Monday box instead.
</p>
<p>
Valve have published <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/507342099205587495">a blog</a> for this latest "Steam Labs Experiment", explaining how the calendar's recommendations functionality works. "This new calendar finds people with similar playtime profiles to you, and then looks at the games those players have been adding to their wishlist," the platform holders write. 
</p>
<p>
They add that trying out a bunch of games, as when panning the demo deluge during Next Fests, won't affect your recommendations much, as the system is "more focused on games that you play the most (relative to other players), and spend most of your playtime in. So, a few minutes trying out a couple of new games or demos won't have much impact on your recommendations, but sinking a bunch of time into a new favorite will."
</p><p>
As for the daily calender refreshes, "in reality you aren't likely to see your recommendations change all that much from day to day, but as time goes by you will obviously see new things pop up as the 8-week horizon of the calendar marches forward, or as games lock in their release dates."
</p>
<p>
The calendar includes a round-up of already-released recommended games, covering the past week and the past month. These aren't organised by day or date, as Valve don't think you're bothered about specifics once a game has launched. There are also filters for adjusting the number of games displayed, hiding owned games, and selecting them by tag. As with Steam's upcoming feeds, the calendar also filters out games based on your wider content settings.
</p>
<p>
As ever, this kind of platform level adjustment could make a huge difference to the fortunes of any number of developers. Steam carries a vast quantity of games, and 'discoverability' is a perennial bugbear.</p>
<p>I've never been hugely impressed by Steam's recommendation systems, which seem far too cautious. "Mayhap if you liked <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-spider-man-2">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a> you will like [consults notes, sweating] <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvels-spider-man-remastered">Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered</a>?" I've also never really gotten along with calendars - paper ones have to be replaced, and digital ones have all this widgety bullshit in them. Still, the new all-in-one Steam calendars feel like an advance over filtering my wishlist.
</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> studio Pocketpair won't be publishing games with AI, Web3, or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/nfts">NFTs</a> in them, because the company "doesn't believe in it".</p>
<p>After the success of Palworld, Pocketpair launched a publishing arm earlier this year. Communications director and publishing manager John Buckley spoke to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-we-don-t-believe-in-it-palworld-maker-pocketpair-wont-be-publishing-games-that-use-generative-ai">Game Developer</a> at Gamescom Asia about the use of controversial technology.</p>
<p>"People are going to say I'm lying, but these are just the hard facts," he said. "We don't believe in it. We're very upfront about it. If you're big on AI stuff or your game is Web3 or uses NFTs, there are lots of publishers out there [who'll talk to you], but we're not the right partner for that."</p>

<p>Pocketpair has been falsely accused of using AI in its games, particularly due to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-fans-hit-back-at-palworlds-lazy-pal-designs">perceived similarity between its Pal monsters and the pocket monsters of Pokémon</a>.</p>
<p>Buckley admitted it's hard to quash such rumours, despite the company's stance against the technology.</p>
<p>Recently, Pocketpair was accused on social media of using machine translation tools to localise Palworld for a handful of countries. Buckley said this was incorrect and based on an incomplete list of credits, but sometimes it's best to ignore social media noise.</p>
<p>"You know, I can't just come out and start fighting with these people [who make the AI accusations] because that just fuels what's going on," said Buckley.</p>
<p>"[Regarding the translation accusation], one of their biggest pieces of 'evidence' was that because we hadn't published the individual names of the translators it must be AI. Well, no, this is just poor Japanese culture in general. A lot of Japanese games, the credits will say localisation was handled by a company.</p>
<p>"I'm not saying [that it is] right. It's unfortunate. We don't like it as much as anybody else. But it's how a lot of these companies want to operate."</p>
<p>Following the accusations, Pocketpair acquired individual names from the localisation company used and updated the credits accordingly.</p>
<p>"A lot of the people in that thread said 'we appreciate you taking the time' but of course there are still some people in that thread who say 'it's not enough, it's AI'," said Buckley. "That's when I feel there's nothing more we can do here. I can say 'it's not, we made it' and they can say 'it is, you didn't make it' and what are we going to do? Just go back and forth forever."</p>
<p>AI is an ongoing hot topic in the industry - according to a report from Japan's Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association, organiser of the Tokyo Games Show, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game companies are using AI in development</a>.</p>

		<p>Paper Cult has announced that following feedback from players that played the Tears of Metal Steam Next Fest demo, the decision has been made to push the game’s release back. The new release window that has been given is Q1 2026, allowing the development team to take on board the feedback and use the additional time to polish up later parts of Tears of Metal.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tears of Metal - Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kdt4o55qMG0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a blog post, Paper Cult Games said, <em>“First off, a massive thank you to everyone who played the demo, shared feedback, ideas, and reviews! Your support has been incredible, we’re honestly blown away. During Steam Next Fest, Tears of Metal climbed all the way to #16 in player count, earning a spot in Steam’s “50 Most-Played Demos of the October 2025 Event.” That’s huge for us and it’s all thanks to you!Even more heartwarming was earning the “Overwhelmingly Positive” review rating on the demo. It’s been an incredible boost to our morale, and we can’t wait to get the full game into your hands.</em></p>
<p><em>With all this momentum and plenty (or dare I say infinite) of new feedback in hand, we’ve decided to shift our release window to Q1 2026. We mostly want to take the extra time to polish the experience in the later part of the game. We promise, the wait will be worth it! Thanks again for marching with us. Your support truly gives us the final push to make Tears of Metal everything it deserves to be.”</em></p>

<p>Tears of Metal is a hack and slash co-op roguelike set in the Scottish Highlands. Hordes of enemies have invaded your home island, so it is up to you and your battalion of Scottish warriors to cleave through this vast number of soldiers to take back the island, and discover more about the Dragon Stone Meteor which caused the invasion to begin with. Tears of Metal has been confirmed for PC.</p>

		<p>Ahead of this weekend’s Galaxies Gaming Showcase, Fumi Games and PlaySide Studios have tempered expectations around the release date for Mouse: P.I For Hire, the 1930’s cartoon inspired first person shooter. A little while ago, the studio said that there would be a release date announcement for the game this weekend, but now that has changed with Mouse: P.I. For Hire now no longer releasing in 2025, but in early 2026 instead.</p>

<p>In a statement Fumi Games and PlaySide Studios said, <em>“Hey everyone. We know that you are excited for the release date announcement of Mouse: P.I. For Hire at the Galaxies Gaming Showcase this week 23 October. Ahead of the reveal, we wanted to let you know that we have made the decision to move the launch of Mouse: P.I. For Hire from 2025 to early 2026. The support you have shown over the years has meant the world to us. Our single highest priority is for the game to deliver you the best possible experience, and this will help ensure we can live up to that goal. Thanks for everything and we will see you at Galaxies!”</em></p>
<p>In Mouse: P.I. For Hire you play private investigator Jack Pepper, who is being voiced by Troy Baker, in a noir inspired first person shooter drawing on 1930’s animation. The setting is the city of Mouseburg and Jack is initially hired to help a “damsel in distress”. However, things take a turn as the case dives deep into the criminal and corrupt world that lays beneath the surface of the city. There will be numerous areas to explore including the city streets, the sewers, a casino, a film studio, and the docks. All of these locations will have loot and collectibles to gather, along with clues to help Jack solve the case.</p>

<p>Mouse: P.I. For Hire is due to be released for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, and Xbox One.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This morning, Remedy <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=49a7f7db-a1c3-400f-948b-f25b3b7426f8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that its CEO of nine years, Tero Virtala, will step down from the position, although he will continue to work for the Finnish developer while the studio finds a new leader. Co-founder and Chief Product Officer Markus Mäki has already assumed the temporary position of interim CEO. In a statement, Mäki (who acted as the Chairman of the Board until his new appointment and has now been replaced in that role by Henri Österlund) said:</p>



<p><em>I want to thank Tero Virtala for his substantial contribution to the management of Remedy since 2016. I personally thank Tero for good cooperation and wish him all the best for the future.</em></p>



<p>The brief press release does not mention why Virtala stepped down, but this is likely related to the financial disaster that was the launch of FBC: Firebreak. Remedy attempted to break into the cooperative multiplayer segment for the first time but failed spectacularly. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fbc-firebreak-review-in-progress-dont-forget-to-shower/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In our review</a>, we had already noted that the game quickly became repetitive and just couldn't keep the players interested for an extended period of time.</p>



<p>In August, Remedy CEO Tero Virtala had already <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-admits-disappointing-sales-fbc-firebreak-control-sold-5-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted</a> that the game was underperforming compared to the studio's expectations. The developers tried to stage a comeback <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-first-big-update-september-29/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a big free update called Breakpoint</a>, but it wasn't nearly enough. Earlier this month, the Finnish developer had to issue a warning to investors about the lower long-term sales that are now expected from the game. Additionally, they recognized a non-cash impairment of €14.9 million, representing most of the game’s capitalized development costs and allocated purchased publishing and distribution rights. Consequently, they had to adjust the 2025 operating profit to be negative and below that of 2024.</p>



<p>Remedy will post the full Q3 2025 Business Review in exactly a week, on Wednesday, October 29. Hopefully, the studio won't have to resort to layoffs. Alan Wake 2, although critically acclaimed, also did not sell a lot of copies. The studio's next projects include Control 2 (which is being done <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-2-will-be-made-on-a-smaller-budget-than-alan-wake-2-as-remedy-goes-from-surviving-to-succeeding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on a lower budget than Alan Wake 2</a>) and the Max Payne remakes for Rockstar. </p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/unrealrtx-remix-mod-replay-1998-classic-rtx-on/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/unrealrtx-remix-mod-lets-you-replay-the-1998-classic%E2%80%99s-campaign-with-rtx-on.1331137/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, modder mstewart401 uploaded UnrealRTX, a remaster of the classic 1998 first-person shooter game powered by NVIDIA's RTX Remix platform, <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/unrealrtx/downloads/unrealrtx-full-campaign" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on ModDB</a>.</p>



<p>UnrealRTX allows players to experience the full single player campaign (no multiplayer, unfortunately) with fully ray-traced global illumination, dynamic shadows, volumetric lighting and stunning emissive effects that, according to the modder, bring a whole new atmosphere to every level.</p>



<p>The addition of PBR (Physically Based Rendering) materials means that the surfaces now respond to light with realistic metallics, roughness, subsurface scattering and depth. Specific world geometry and props have also been replaced to enhance fidelity.</p>



<p>The modder revealed that most of the texture replacements were generated using RTX Remix's AI tools. They also used NVIDIA assets from NVIDIA Omniverse to replace the vegetation and add grass to outdoor areas. To do that, they extensively used UnrealED to insert dummy objects, which were later replaced with custom grass models. UnrealED was also used to place new light sources where the original maps had unmotivated lighting. As RTX Remix generally replaces assets globally, mstewart401 used UnrealED to create texture variants that enabled the implementation of emissive lights with different colours and properties to achieve the same in-game texture variation. The modder said that nearly all the emissive maps and around 90% of the height maps were crafted manually in MS Paint by blacking out non-emissive pixels and outlining textures.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The UnrealRTX modder admits the file size (currently at 48.29 GB) is a bit much. The goal is to reduce it by using lower resolution roughness and normal maps, as both are currently set to 8K each, which is probably overkill.</p>



<p>More and more PC classics are being remastered with RTX Remix. Just recently, we covered <a href="https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-rtx-ndt-remakes-no-mercy-campaign-rtx-remix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Left 4 Dead 2 RTX NDT</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-look-path-traced-gta-4-rtx-remix-test-build/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA IV</a> (although the latter is still not available to the public).</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/scarface-world-is-yours-coming-to-steam-and-epic/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/legendary-gta-competitor-%E2%80%98scarface%E2%80%99-coming-to-steam-and-epic-with-hd-graphics-mode.1331128/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In recent hours, eagle-eyed gamers have scoured repositories on Steam and Epic Games on PC to find out everything they can about a reappearance of 2006’s <strong>Scarface: The World is Yours</strong>. The open-world title emerged as a competitor to Grand Theft Auto on the PlayStation 2, but due to complex licensing issues, it was never revisited.</p>



<p>It now <span>appears to be being brought back to life by a new publisher,&nbsp;<strong>and&nbsp;</strong>it is being given a new face with an HD graphics mode added</span> as a DLC. In case you’re unfamiliar, The World is Yours puts players in the shoes of Tony Montana from the 1983 Scarface movie, presenting an alternate universe in which he survives an assassination attempt and must rebuild his drug empire.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-is-scarface-the-world-is-yours-coming-back">Is Scarface: The World is Yours Coming Back?</h2>



<p>Scarface: The World is Yours has always been one of those games that fans have desperately sought a remaster of. It was released in 2006 and offered a large open-world map of Miami, customization options, the ability to rebuild and decorate Tony Montana’s iconic mansion, and the gameplay loop facilitated the construction of an <strong>empire</strong>.</p>



<p>It was buggy as hell in many ways, and the PC port that was released way back when was a shambles, but on PlayStation 2, the game was a certified banger that still sits firmly in my mind twenty years later. It was originally pieced together by Radical Entertainment, the same studio that made The Simpsons Hit &amp; Run and the Prototype games.</p>



<p>Scarface: The World is Yours was a heavily licensed game that featured Al Pacino’s likeness as Tony Montana, dialogue, direct-to-game story elements, a top soundtrack, and branding. This long presented a licensing concern when the discussion came about remastering or re-releasing the game.</p>



<p>Now, Hong Kong-based publisher EC Digital Entertainment appears to be floating the game on digital platforms <strong>for the first time</strong>. The unheard-of publisher seems to be backing a re-release of Scarface: The World is Yours on the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/scarface-the-world-is-yours-7c3e6f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Epic Store</a> and on Valve’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4113570/Scarface_The_World_Is_Yours_2006/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> storefront, but no release date has been given.</p>



<p>It has been suggested by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ocxf5r/scarface_the_world_is_yours_store_page_shows_up/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">some users on social media</a> that the Epic Games store, especially, has been ‘released early’ in what looks like some twisted backend glitch.</p>



<p>Scarface: The World is Yours is a game that all Grand Theft Auto fans should check out. It might have twenty years on it by now, but it’s a phenomenal title that was overshadowed by the earlier launch of GTA: San Andreas in late 2004 and the later launch of GTA: IV in 2008.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re hoping for a resurgence of Scarface: The World is Yours.</p>
