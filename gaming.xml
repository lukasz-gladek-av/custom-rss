            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suikoden-program-march-3rd-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has announced that a special&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>broadcast is set to air next week, bringing more news about the cult JRPG franchise.</p>

<p>In a rather brief <a href="https://x.com/Konami/status/1894938037122957766" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, Konami says that the broadcast, which will air on March 3rd at 3pm Pacific (that's 6pm Eastern), will bring you "all the latest news on&nbsp;<em>Suikoden</em>".</p>

<p>That's a particularly interesting way of wording it, because we already know the release date for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Suikoden II&nbsp;</em>remasters, so presumably, the broadcast will contain some new information about the future of the series.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/suikoden-special-program-remaster.jpg?itok=pZdUOGOa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/suikoden-special-program-remaster.jpg?itok=q7rTwVNf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>news could be on the way.</figcaption></figure><p>If Konami does have more to reveal about the&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>franchise, I'd put my money on potential remasters for the third, fourth, and fifth games in the series.&nbsp;<em>Suikoden V</em>, in particular, is well-liked by many fans, although the other two were perhaps a little more cautiously received.</p>

<p>I think more remasters are significantly more likely than a brand new game in the franchise, although Konami must be pretty confident in&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>if it's doing more than just the upcoming remasters of the first two games.</p>

<p>News of the&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>broadcast comes as Konami revisits some of its biggest franchises in the form of remasters and remakes. Last year, for instance, the company worked with Bloober Team for the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake, which has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">amassed more than two million sales</a> around the world so far.</p>

<p>The studio is also gearing up for the release of&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>, a remake of the 2004 stealth-action classic, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">in August</a>. The game will feature a visual overhaul thanks to the magic of Unreal Engine 5, as well as updated gameplay mechanics.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>itself, the snappily-titled&nbsp;<em>Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remaster Gate Rune and Dunan Unification Wars&nbsp;</em>collection is due to launch next week.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, the collection remasters the first two games in the&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>series, which are connected by a number of recurring characters and narrative elements. The remasters will feature updated visuals, new animations, and extra quality-of-life improvements.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out the&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>remasters when they land on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1932640/Suikoden_III_HD_Remaster_Gate_Rune_and_Dunan_Unification_Wars/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10004292" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/suikoden-iii-hd-remaster-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars-pre-order-bonus/9P9FM62WZXR2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/suikoden-i-and-ii-hd-remaster-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on March 6th.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Suikoden&nbsp;</em>broadcast, meanwhile, is set for March 3rd, and you can watch it via Konami's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@KONAMI573ch" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>. The link in Konami's post on X leads to the Japanese channel, but the post itself is in English, so it's not clear whether the show will air in English or just in Japanese.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-financials-2024-revenue-falls</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warner-bros-gaming-division-reports-disappointing-2024-as-revenue-falls.1120332/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-financials-2024-revenue-falls<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warner Bros. has released its financial summary for both the fourth quarter of 2024 and the year as a whole, and it probably won't surprise you to learn that it's been a pretty bad year for the media giant's gaming wing.</p>

<p>In its earnings <a href="https://s201.q4cdn.com/336605034/files/doc_earnings/2024/q4/earnings-result/WBD-4Q24-Earnings-Release.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">release</a>, Warner Bros. says its gaming division's revenue dropped by 29% in Q4 when compared to the previous year's quarter, which the studio puts down to the "better performance" of big sellers&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hogwarts-legacy-sales-30m" rel="nofollow">Hogwarts Legacy</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-sales" rel="nofollow">Mortal Kombat 1</a>&nbsp;</em>last year.</p>

<p>This is likely at least one of the figures that caused Warner Bros. to&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monolith-productions-and-more-reportedly-closed-by-wb-games" rel="nofollow">close three of its studios recently</a>, namely Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and WB San Diego. They're not mentioned in the financial report, but that could just be because the report covers the period ending December 31st last year.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warner-bros-financials-2024-monolith.jpg?itok=b5odTwrZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warner-bros-financials-2024-monolith.jpg?itok=rIJTz3Ba 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Warner Bros. recently closed&nbsp;<em>Middle-earth: Shadow of War&nbsp;</em>developer Monolith, as well as two other studios.</figcaption></figure><p>The weak performance of two major Warner Bros. games last year, namely superhero live-service looter-shooter&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win" rel="nofollow">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>&nbsp;</em>and crossover fighter&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-flop-warner-bros-100m" rel="nofollow"><em>MultiVersus</em></a>, both contributed to WB Games' weak year.</p>

<p>Both games performed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-end-of-2024" rel="nofollow">so poorly</a> that they were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-updates-ending-season-5-offline" rel="nofollow">shut down</a> before being on general release for a year (although&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus&nbsp;</em>technically spent some time in a sort of beta-Early Access limbo between mid-2022 and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/multiversus-open-beta-will-close-in-june-full-release-coming-in-early-2024" rel="nofollow">spring 2023</a>).</p>

<p>Back in January, it was revealed that Warner Bros. gaming head David Haddad <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-games-david-haddad-stepping-down" rel="nofollow">would step down</a> after over a decade with the company. The reason for his departure wasn't officially announced, but I can't imagine&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>' failures had nothing to do with it.</p>

<p>As for what the future holds for Warner Bros., the company says it's planning to refocus on "proven IP" like&nbsp;<em>Harry Potter</em>,&nbsp;<em>Game of Thrones</em>,&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat</em>, and the wider DC universe, including "top tier characters like&nbsp;<em>Batman</em>".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warner-bros-financials-2024-batman.jpg?itok=64LAPPnr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warner-bros-financials-2024-batman.jpg?itok=wkA8H8fr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Warner Bros. says it wants to refocus its efforts on proven IP like&nbsp;<em>Batman</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>To that end, it was recently revealed that DC Studios boss James Gunn <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dc-boss-in-talks-with-rocksteady-and-netherrealm-to-develop-dc-universe-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">has been talking</a> to Warner Bros. studios Rocksteady and NetherRealm to develop DC games, although it's not clear which games those might be.</p>

<p>Given that the closure of Monolith also includes the cancellation of that studio's&nbsp;<em>Wonder Woman&nbsp;</em>game, though, I wouldn't hold your breath for anything but a new game starring Batman or one of his extended family. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>PlayStation has announced that the PlayStation VR2 will be getting a worldwide price reduction in March 2025.</p>



<p>Announced in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/02/27/a-great-new-price-for-playstation-vr2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation blog</a>, the PSVR2 will now start at a new retail price of $399.99 / €449.99 / £399.99 / ¥66,980.</p>



<p>For those whop want to purchase the Call of the Mountain Bundle, the recommend retail price will be $399.99 / €449.99 / £399.99 / ¥66,980. The bundle includes a PlayStation Store voucher code for Horizon Call of the Mountain, PS VR2 headset, PS VR2 Sense controller, and stereo headphones.</p>



<p>Announced in November 2022, the PlayStation VR2 started at $549.99 / €599.99 / £529.99 / ¥74,980, which was considered a hefty price at the time for a limited amount of games and the need to purchase a PlayStation 5 alongside it.</p>



<p>PlayStation points out that PSVR2’s catalogue of games is now better then ever, “With recently released hits like&nbsp;Alien: Rogue Incursion,&nbsp;Skydance’s Behemoth, and&nbsp;Metro Awakening VR, and exciting new game launches on the way including&nbsp;Aces of Thunder,&nbsp;Dreams of Another,&nbsp;Hitman World of Assassination, and&nbsp;The Midnight Walk, it’s never been a better time to jump into the action with PS VR2. Using the&nbsp;PS VR2 PC Adapter, players will also have access to browse, buy and play thousands of virtual reality games on Steam. Title release dates and regional availability may vary.”</p>



<p>The blog post continued, “In addition, with a recent update to PS VR2, it now supports low-latency hand tracking is now supported, which allows developers to create games that tracks a player’s hand position and movement through the cameras embedded on the PS VR2 headset. Through this new feature, players will be able to experience intuitive controls in supported games such as<em>&nbsp;</em>Waltz of the Wizard.”</p>



<p>Will you be buying the PlayStation VR2 at its new price point? Let us know down below and over at the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1705/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

                <p>Riot Games' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/league-of-legends-retail-launch-review/1900-6239387/" data-ref-id="1900-6239387">League of Legends</a> has been around since 2009, and it has attracted a large group of fans from around the world since its release. And when those fans aren't happy, they aren't afraid to be vocal about it. Some of Riot's most recent moves--including the removal of Hextech chests--angered players so much that the company is now walking back that decision as well as a few other unpopular changes.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAVa467pHl8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sAVa467pHl8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the video above--and in the accompanying <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/dev-hextech-chests-getting-champs-more/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post on Riot's site</a>--Senior Vice President Andrei Van Roon and League of Legends executive producer Paul Bellezza explained why the company is reversing its recent decisions. Bellezza noted that their choices had eroded some of the trust that fans had for Riot, and they want to fix that.</p><p>The first step in rebuilding that trust is coming in next week's patch, which will restore Hextech chests to the game. Eight chests will be available through the free seasonal pass, while players can earn two additional chests through the game's Honor system. The dev post notes that the Honor system is still being worked out, but it's meant to reward players who are good teammates and respectful opponents.</p><p>League of Legends' Exalted skin for Sahn Uzal Mordekaiser is also being delayed to give the developers more time to "deliver on its core fantasy." Fans have been very critical about the Radiant Serpent Sett and Fractured Arcane Jinx Exalted skins, which is why Riot plans to put greater effort into future Exalted skins to meet players' expectations.</p><p>Riot is also reducing the cost of unlocking champions through League of Legends' in-game currency, Blue Essence. As of the next patch, the price for all champions will drop by 50% in the hope that players can more easily expand their roster with new and older characters.</p><p>Earlier this month, Riot announced that the League of Legends fighting game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/2xko/" data-ref-id="5000-503365">2XKO</a>, won't be getting the large playtest in March that was originally planned. Instead, a smaller playtest will be held while the company builds its infrastructure for a larger test later this year. League of Legends also recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arcanes-mel-officially-joins-league-of-legends-with-a-new-noxian-look/1100-6528699/" data-ref-id="1100-6528699">added Mel Medarda to the roster</a>, following her larger role in the second and final season of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arcane-season-2-trailer-charts-the-past-and-future-of-sisters-at-war/1100-6527212/" data-ref-id="1100-6527212">Arcane</a>.

            <p>
A new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/eternal-strands">Eternal Strands</a> update has made various adjustments to the fantasy action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s movement and so, restarted the inexhaustible debate as to what manner of jank is 'good' jank.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Posting in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1491410/view/506195909797741132?l=english">their latest dev roadmap</a>, creators Yellow Brick acknowledge complaints about protagonist Brynn's motions feeling a bit slippy-slidey, particularly when accelerating or decelerating or being struck by an object. "Some of you described that her walking/running felt a little bit too much like 'skating' and that the lack of precision could be frustrating at times," they write.
</p>
<p>
That slipperiness is sort of the aim, however. Eternal Strands is broadly a Dragon Adjacent physics sandbox, with objects you can lob about with your legally distinct Jedi mind tricks, and elemental gimcrackery such as freezing and combustion. Brynn's character model doesn't stand aloof from all that - while she has more capacity to direct the proceedings, she's also basically another child in the ballpit.
</p>
<p>
 "Something to note about Brynn's movement is that much of how it feels is intended and attributable to how a 100% physics-based sandbox game like Eternal Strands is designed to work," the post goes on. "Being an object that reacts to the physics surrounding her, just like any other object in the world, means that her weight and inertia have an impact on her movement." 
</p>
<p>
They are, however, trying to find some common ground with the detractors. Difficult to find common ground when you're coasting about like a seal, I guess, but it definitely sounds like change for the better. As of today, Bryn's "minimum acceleration speed has been enhanced". Following the next update "reaching a target speed or slowing down to a full stop will happen quicker" to avoid the impression of sliding, though if you're lightly clad and equipped there will stil be a touch of "skating". Furthermore, "direction changes will be much 'snappier'."
</p>
<p>
Occasionally eccentric handling notwithstanding, Eternal Strands has found a following on Steam. While our own reviewer Sophie Glass <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eternal-strands-review">noted its "janky controls"</a>, she also pointed out that it's the work of a small team, and described it overall as "consistently surprising and enjoyable".
</p>
<p>
In particular, Sophie highlighted "the lovely improvised chaos of physics systems bumping into each other", adding that "every time I get flung directly into the sky, or a triceratops thing mistimes its own attack and slams a rock the size of a piano into its own face, I am filled with the wild joy of being alive."
</p>
<p>
Personally, I like games in which the physics often betray you. Many are the laughs I have had while accidentally judo-throwing myself in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gang-beasts">Gang Beasts</a>. I'm also fond of how Eternal Strands harkens back to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/psi-ops-the-mindgate-conspiracy-retrospective">a sillier age of video game telekinesis</a>, long before Control came along and made it all seem so stylish.

<p>The Little Nightmares 3 release window is locked in. A painful delay pushed a dagger into the heart of everyone excited for the innovative sequel. With Supermassive Games now at the helm, there’s a tangible sense of anticipation, and Little Nightmares 3 information is available already.</p>



<p>There’s a small pocket of repressed Little Nightmares trauma locked away in my brain. From my first run-in with Little Nightmares to the sequel, Tarsier Studios did a great job of making me feel trapped, defenseless, and helpless. Little Nightmares 3 looks like another mysterious and miserable meander through horror and hellacious hell, this time in the Nowhere.</p>



<p>Little Nightmares 3 was scheduled for 2024, but a delay impacted its debut. A new release window has been confirmed.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-when-little-nightmares-3-releases">Do we Know When Little Nightmares 3 Releases? </h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s going to be a scarily good time. Credit to Supermassive Games.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>An exact Little Nightmares 3 release date hasn’t been declared by Supermassive Games or Bandai Namco, but we know it’s scheduled to arrive sometime in 2025.</strong></p>



<p>May 31, 2024, was the day <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/little-nightmares-3-delayed-to-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Nightmares 3 was delayed to 2025</a>. It was a dark day, and I shut myself in my room and sulked.</p>



<p>Both developer and publisher declared in a <a href="https://x.com/LittleNights/status/1796512039768097038" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">post on X</a> they have been “Working hard towards delivering the best experience possible for the next entry in the franchise.” Here’s hoping we don’t have to wait too long for a concrete date.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-little-nightmares-3-platforms">All Little Nightmares 3 Platforms</h2>



<p><strong>Bandai Namco and Supermassive Games are giving Little Nightmares 3 a wider launch on PlayStation</strong> <strong>4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Nintendo Switch.</strong></p>



<p>It always brings me joy to tell gamers a game is coming out on all platforms. No one misses out, everyone has a chance to get involved, and the title ultimately benefits. Little Nightmares 3 has a big chance to keep the series’ momentum moving in a healthy direction. </p>



<p>I’d also wager a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a> port could happen if Nintendo feels the need to cast its net out even further.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-how-much-little-nightmares-3-is">Do we Know How Much Little Nightmares 3 is?</h2>



<p><strong><strong>The Little Nightmares 3 price hasn’t been revealed yet, and the ability to wishlist the game is currently the only option.</strong></strong></p>



<p>We’re still on for a 2025 release, but the price is a mystery. It may be a case of leaving it until the final few weeks once an official release date is announced. If I use Little Nightmares 2 as an example, the first sequel retailed at <strong>$29.99 and £24.99</strong>.</p>



<p>I can see Little Nightmares 3 either sticking to this price point, or because of extra work, slightly increasing Little Nightmares 3’s RRP to <strong>$34.99 and £29.99</strong>. This is guesswork, but don’t be shocked if it ends up in this ballpark.</p>



<hr>



<p>I’m ready for the new nightmares, are you? Will you be playing solo? Or are you grateful to finally have someone’s hand to hold through the visual hellscape unfolding before your eyes?</p>

                <p>Since the latest <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/" data-ref-id="5000-179949">Sims 4</a> update released, players have noticed some odd bugs--even by the Sims' standards. As of the latest patch, which introduced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-4-update-adds-burglars-back-to-the-series/1100-6529708/" data-ref-id="1100-6529708">burglar Robin Banks</a> to the game, child and baby Sims may appear pregnant, have beer-bellies, or be oddly muscular.</p><p>Some players on The Sims subreddit, as picked up by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-latest-patch-makes-some-children-appear-pregnant-players-say" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, noticed that some of their child sims were suddenly appearing pregnant--in one case, the user claimed the bug was affecting every male child in their game.</p><p>The bug appears to be visual only--the child Sims have thankfully not been given the actual pregnancy state and are not about to give birth to other Sims--but in a game like this, visuals are important to most players.</p><p>Other posts on the Sims subreddit suggest there are more visual glitches affecting young Sims, with one post showing a collection of strangely buff babies, and another showing a child Sim who looks like he's been hitting the gym.</p><p>One Reddit user theorized that the game is somehow mixing up child and adult body types, mistakenly applying adult musculature, beer bellies, or pregnant bellies to child and infant Sims. While it's easy to fix an adult Sim who's been assigned the wrong body type, child Sims' bodies can't be customized, making this bug difficult to get around. Even aging up and then regressing the Sim doesn't appear to reset the body-distorting bug, according to players' experiments.</p><p>The Sims has a history of unintentionally hilarious bugs, like the one that gave infants <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-4-bug-is-turning-babies-into-monsters/1100-6512406/" data-ref-id="1100-6512406">freakishly long limbs</a> back when the new life state was first introduced, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/25-years-into-the-sims-ea-is-still-making-the-same-mistakes/1100-6529270/" data-ref-id="1100-6529270">EA's poor track record</a> of fixing bugs means players are often anxious about how long disruptive bugs will stick around. While this bug hasn't been officially acknowledged yet, EA encourages players to report bugs through its forums, where <a href="https://forums.ea.com/idea/the-sims-4-bug-reports-en/toddlerinfantschild-body-and-face-distortions/11928891" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a thread</a> has been started to catalogue body distortion in child Sims.</p><p>EA recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-and-sims-2-legacy-editions-are-full-of-bugs-according-to-players/1100-6529205/" data-ref-id="1100-6529205">re-released The Sims and The Sims 2</a> as legacy editions, including all their DLC packs. However, these re-releases also launched with a number of bugs that have frustrated players. A Sims community manager has said that the legacy game bugs are currently being investigated.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-charger-first-look-suggests-it-may-have-a-detachable-cable.1120281/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-charger-detachable-cable/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new look at the Nintendo Switch 2 Joy-Con grip and the very first look at the console's charger have come today thanks to a well-known leaker.</p>
<p>As shared on the&nbsp;<a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/post-1639206" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Famiiboards forums</a>, the Xiahongshu forums user who obtained a CAD model of the console last year and provided some new images of the dock <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-new-dock-pictures-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yesterday</a> also shared a few hours ago some new pictures of the Joy-Con grip and the new console's charger. While the Joy-Con grip looks identical to the current one, although the model shared in the picture may be incomplete as it's not clear how it would hold the Joy-Con controllers in place, the charger is definitely different from the one of the current Switch models, as it is generally a little smaller with only a slightly bigger width, according to some rough measurements provided by user <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/post-1639220" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LiC</a>. The most interesting thing about the charger, however, is that no cable is visible in the model provided by the Chinese leaker, so there's the chance that it could have a detachable cable.</p>
<p>While this isn't exactly the news fans are looking forward to hearing regarding the Nintendo Switch 2, it's still nice to be able to learn more about the system before the floodgates open for real on <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-april/">April 2nd</a>, when the Japanese company will host a dedicated Nintendo Direct to provide more information on the system. In addition, the company will host several preview events around the world where players will be able to get hands-on time with the system before its launch. A release window has yet to be confirmed, but the system should be out before the end of summer, according to a<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/"> former employee.</a></p>

            <p>
Motor company Honda has unveiled a glimpse at a Pokémon motorbike themed around Legendary creature Koraidon, star of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-scarlet-violet-walkthrough-tips-9015">Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</a>.
</p>
<p>
Koraidon, along with his buddy Miraidon, are dragon-like creatures which can be used as motorbikes in the games. So the theming is appropriate. 
</p>
<p>
But is this motorbike practical for the real world? Well, that's another matter. With spikes on its wheels and actual feet (although maybe that's a stand?), it seems like not. And that's before you get to the lack of license plate. Still, if you had the money and the space for it, you would. Wouldn't you?
</p>

</p>

<p>
Honda's sneak peek of the Koraidon motorbike, made in conjunction with The Pokémon Company, is available to watch above. A full unveiling - when we're likely to find out how much this beast might cost - will come next month. 
</p>
<p>
"Honda has realised an almost life-size reproduction of the shape of Koraidon in both weight and size, down to the finest details," the company wrote.
</p>
<p>
"Honda will use its proprietary self-balancing technology to enable Honda Koraidon to walk on all four legs, and self-stand on two-wheels which is unseen in the game. This balance technology... was developed by applying the self-balancing technology cultivated in ASIMO humanoid robot research. Honda will apply this technology to realise Koraidon's 'Sprinting Build'.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time a Pokémon has been transformed into a motorbike. Last year, Toyota took the reigns on a Miraidon prototype - though it's unclear if that design was ever proven road-worthy (thanks, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/02/random-honda-teases-real-life-pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-motorbike">Nintendo Life</a>).

<p>Tripwire Interactive’s Killing Floor 3 is another bout of beautiful violence. Eviscerating Zeds and leaving them for dead is the name of the game—well, Killing Floor 3 is. If it’s your first time or you’re a returning fan, here’s the Xbox Game Pass status for the FPS title.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/killing-floor-3-release-date-platforms-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Killing Floor 3</a> is already testing the waters well ahead of time. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/killing-floor-3-release-date-announced-along-with-closed-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">closed beta</a> lets players see what’s new, what works, and what needs fine-tuning. The second installment was fun but had a penchant for repetition, and the third mainline release is looking to be the best yet.</p>



<p>Eventually, Killing Floor 3 will launch, and if it’s on Xbox Game Pass, this is a victory before we even play the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-killing-floor-3-on-xbox-game-pass">Can You Play Killing Floor 3 on Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Sir, this is a Wendy’s. Credit to Tripwire Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Xbox Game Pass is not adding Killing Floor 3 to its collection of easily accessible games.</strong></p>



<p>You get access to hundreds of games if you’re a Microsoft Xbox Game Pass subscriber. Many of these arrive as day-one debuts on the Game Pass scheme. However, <a href="https://killingfloor3.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Killing Floor 3</a> is not a day-one addition as Tripwire Interactive and Microsoft don’t have an agreement for it to happen.</p>



<p>There’s no mention of Killing Floor 3 coming to Game Pass on its official store page. Nor has the opportunity been mentioned in any trailers, prerelease material, or press releases.</p>



<p>Titles associated with Xbox Game Studios are pretty much day-one Game Pass releases. Any other third-party titles are not guaranteed and it’s up to the two companies to come to an understanding. If not, the game launches of its own accord and it’s up to the publisher to drive sales. In this case, Tripwire Interactive is handling both development and publishing duties, so it’s up to them to generate interest and revenue for KF3.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-killing-floor-3-come-to-xbox-game-pass">Will Killing Floor 3 Come to Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s uncertain if Killing Floor 3 is coming to Xbox Game Pass at any point.</strong></p>



<p>The closest KF has come to Xbox’s Game Pass subscription service was in 2024 when Killing Floor 2 was offered as a “Free Play Days” promotion. Game Pass users were allowed to sample Killing Floor 2 for a few days. After this, the title went back to being another purchasable option on the Xbox store.</p>



<p>We’ll update this guide if Killing Floor 3 does come to Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<hr>



<p>Killing Floor 3 looks to be as brutal and painful as its predecessors. Can you envisage yourself losing hundreds of hours lopping off limbs and severing skulls? Or is Killing Floor 3 not your stop?</p>



<p>We have the latest details on several other AAA games and their potential Xbox Game Pass status for you to check out: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-atomfall-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-wwe-2k25-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-assassins-creed-shadows-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-balatro-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Balatro</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-pga-tour-2k25-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PGA Tour 2K25</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-monster-hunter-wilds-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-split-fiction-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-or-ea-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Split Fiction</a>.</p>

Ubisoft has detailed the list of achievements for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, and said the game won't require you to play twice or pick a particular character at certain points in order to unlock every award.
</p>
<p>
The full list of achievements lies below - and they're the same across Steam, Xbox and for Trophies on PlayStation. There are no spoilers.
</p>
<p>
Not requiring multiple playthroughs is probably for the best - Shadows looks like another Assassin's Creed epic, following previous games like Odyssey and Valhalla where I clocked up playtime in the 100s of hours.

</figure>
<p>
Having to finish the game once to then unlock a harder difficulty and grind for another achievement after completing that? No thank you.
</p>
<p>
"Available on day one, these Steam achievements (which are the same as the Xbox achievements and PlayStation trophies) can all be earned in a single playthrough, meaning no achievement can be missed regardless of what story choices you make," Ubisoft wrote in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3159330/view/535468672209128051?l=english">blog post on Steam</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"And don't worry - your Leap of Fail will look just as spectacular whether you're playing on story mode or on expert level, as all achievements are unlockable regardless of difficulty level."
</p>
<p>
(At a guess, I'd say Leap of Fail will likely pop when you try to perform the iconic Assassin's Creed dive as samurai Yasuke - who is not trained for the purpose.)
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows' two protagonists offer two different gameplay styles (quiet assassin, or all-out samurai) and can be swapped between frequently - or not, if you so choose.
</p>
<p>
The game also features dialogue choices, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-has-a-canon-mode-story-option-without-narrative-choices">Ubisoft has also confirmed Assassin's Creed Shadows' canon story mode option</a> for those who want a strictly linear narrative.
</p>
<p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/27/monster-hunter-wilds-do-i-need-to-play-monster-hunter-world-first/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is the latest instalment in <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/capcom">Capcom</a>’s power-selling action RPG series which is out now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. Despite the rampant popularity of its predecessor, 2018’s <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter World</a>, there’s a good chance this fresh entry will attract a new generation of fans, with a considerable number of gamers sat on the fence. One of the questions they may be asking themselves is if they need to play Monster Hunter World (or indeed any other games in the franchise) before they can play Monster Hunter Wilds.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a_wNFT4j6qI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The answer is a simple, albeit emphatic, no. For those new to <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a>, each game is its own entity with no overarching narrative or core cast of characters to keep track of. Sure, beneath the surface there’s a surprisingly dense web of lore though this is all extra-curricular fluff that has little bearing on main, monster-hunting experience.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter World ushered in a new era for Capcom’s long-running series and one that focused on streamlining certain time-consuming elements thereby making it more accessible. For our money, it’s one of the greatest modern RPGs ever made, but if you’re looking to get into the series, we’d advise skipping right ahead and venturing into Wilds.</p>


<p>Yet again, Capcom has reduced the amount of busy work players need to perform between hunts, making everything – from gathering resources to crafting new gear – available at your fingertips almost instantaneously. On the flipside, there are a great deal of new mechanics for veteran hunters to sink their teeth into: each weapon type has an expanded moveset with a plethora of new advanced tools and equipment on-hand.</p>
<p>Multiplayer has always been the most enjoyable part of Monster Hunter, and this is where Wilds has World beat. There’s a good chance that most fans will emigrate from older MH titles to Wilds at launch – not only that, the inclusion of cross-play will make it easier to find online lobbies than ever before.</p>
<p>Still, if you’re looking to get a good understanding of how these games work, there’s no harm in trying Monster Hunter World first. It’s dirt cheap and if you really don’t gel with it (we won’t judge) at least you haven’t paid top whack for Monster Hunter Wilds at launch.</p>

			<p>It seems like Hogwarts Legacy 2 won't be a live service game after all. At least, that's what Jason Schreier said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/FI5wGiPFj_4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the latest Kinda Funny Gamescast episode</a> on the subject:</p>
<p><em>A lot of people have talked about how in recent years people like Zaslav and JB Perrette are talking all about games as a service, but the games as a service mandate started long before that. This is more executives just saying what shareholders want to hear, because if you look at their current slate of games, they're not games as a service. Hogwarts Legacy 2 is not going to be a game as a service, the new Batman from Rocksteady is not going to be a game as a service, and even Wonder Woman wasn't going to be a game as a service. This is not a company that is going all in on games as a service. They're going all in on those big franchises.</em></p>
<p><em>I think they still believe that there's room for success. I've talked to executives there who envision a world where you would be playing in Hogwarts with your friends and you go hang out with your buddies, you're all wizards together and taking classes together. They have these kind of fantasies in their heads about games as a service that might work. It's just that these particular projects that are currently in development - I'm sure they have a game of service at some point somewhere, but those are not them.</em></p>
<p>That is quite surprising, considering that less than a year ago, JB Perrette (CEO and President of Global Streaming and Games at Warner Bros. Discovery) <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-is-probably-going-to-be-live-service-wb-says-aaa-console-market-isnt-enough/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a>:</p>
<p><em>Rather than just launching a one-and-done console game, how do develop a game around, for example, Hogwarts Legacy that is a live service where people can live and build and play in that world on an ongoing basis?</em></p>
<p>Perhaps it is simply the case that this executive vision didn't quite align with what Avalanche Software felt they could deliver with Hogwarts Legacy 2, effectively postponing the publisher's dream of a live service game in Harry Potter's universe.</p>
<p>Anyway, Schreier also doubled down on the previous <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-coming-next-year-with-10-15-hours-of-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> that there is a Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition in the works between Rocksteady and Avalanche Software featuring new 'DLC'. It is unclear whether this DLC will be exclusive to the new edition or separately purchasable for owners of the existing game.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, if you want more Hogwarts Legacy content, there's the new official modding tools and mod support <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-pc-gets-modding-tool-and-built-in-support-on-january-30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released in late January for PC</a>.</p>

            <p>Late last week, former Striking Distance concept art director <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jesseleeconceptart_opentowork-activity-7298625255500091392-t4QX/">Jesse Lee took to LinkedIn</a> to reminisce on their time at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> studio. "Thinking back to the very beginning of Striking Distance Studios, to today - nearly six years later. Most of the devs were laid off, and it is hard to sum it all up right now," wrote Lee.</p>
<p>The layoffs were confirmed this week in a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/the-callisto-protocol-studio-lays-off-more-employees-but-remains-operational/">statement from parent company Krafton to PC Gamer</a>, which you can find below. Apologies for spoiling anyone's game of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-call-a-job-cut-a-job-cut">official statement bingo</a> but, yes, it contains the word "agile".</p>

<p>"Striking Distance Studios has reduced the size of its team to remain agile, which creates a sustainable environment for the studio at its current stage of development," a Krafton representative told PC Gamer. "The studio remains operational, and these changes will not impact any planned ongoing support. No further changes are planned at this time."</p>
<p>Several other former employees spoke about losing their jobs alongside Lee. "It was a tough morning at Striking Distance," said <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zach-volker_it-was-a-tough-morning-at-striking-distance-activity-7298480796674183168-Ft3a/">animation director Zach Volker</a>, "lots of layoffs, including myself. It was a great ride and I'm so grateful for the opportunities I had to lead the charge on multiple projects and for the new relationships I've built." Cloud devops engineer Seth Spitkoski <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/seth-spitkoski-b0316b68_opentowork-activity-7299777905088217091-fDCU/">was also impacted</a>.</p>
<p>It feels telling of LinkedIn's culture (and the nature of finding more work in a precarious landscape) that many layoff posts are often accompanied by similar expressions of gratitude and eagerness. It's terrible enough to lose your job through no fault of your own, let alone for a culture (or some cowardly NDA) to discourage or deny you the catharsis of expressing anger and grief for fear of being seen as difficult or not adequatedly cosplaying nebulous notions of 'professionalism' - not that I can know how the affected developers genuinely feel.</p>
<p>This isn't the first round of layoffs at Striking Distance, either, following 32 employees <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-callisto-protocol-studio-hit-by-lay-offs-for-32-employees">let go in August of 2023</a>. "Striking Distance Studios and Krafton have implemented strategic changes that realign the studio’s priorities to better position its current and future projects for success," said Krafton at the time. Back in January of that year, more than 20 staff alleged they had been omitted from the game's credits. "We're talking full-time employees with over a year invested in the title, and had a hand in significant parts of the product," <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/callisto-protocol-developers-left-out-of-credits">one source told Gamesindustry.biz</a>.</p>
<p>The Callisto Protocol's director Glen Schofield left the studio around the same time as the 2023 layoffs. Striking Distance followed the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror game</a> with roguelike spin-off <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/redacted">[REDACTED]</a> released last October, which reached an all-time peak concurrent player count on Steam of 169, note PC Gamer.</p>
<p>This news follows <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-bros-close-monolith-creators-of-fear-condemned-shadow-of-mordor-and-wonder-woman">closures at Warner Bros</a> including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fear">F.E.A.R</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor">Middle-Earth: Shadow Of Mordor</a> studio Monolith, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/more-job-cuts-waiting-to-bite-at-netease-studios-according-to-insiders">rumours of more slashing and burning</a> by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> owners NetEase.</p>

            <p>Details on the forthcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On The Beach are scarce at the moment, but as new details slowly emerge it sounds a lot like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> - though there's plenty still to come.</p>
<p>Ahead of creator <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/hideo-kojima">Hideo Kojima</a>'s SXSW livestream at which the release date is expected, Sony has updated the <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/">PlayStation website listing</a> for the sequel with fresh details hinting towards how it will play.</p>
<p>"Expect the unexpected," it reads, which is just par for the course with Kojima games.</p>

<p>"Sam - with companions by his side - sets out on a new journey to save humanity from extinction. Join them as they traverse a world beset by otherworldly enemies, obstacles and a haunting question: Should we have connected?"</p>
<p>Until now, we've only seen an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tr2yB93pIGw">initial teaser trailer of Death Stranding 2</a> at The Game Awards in 2022 and an announcement trailer at last year's PlayStation State of Play (above).</p>
<p>The website update essentially hints to what has already been inferred from these trailers.</p>
<p>"The large open-world environments of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach are full of secrets to be found," it reads, describing the "unique and explorable world". "They are also incredibly varied and pose unique challenges to navigate."</p>
<p>That tracks with the announcement trailer, in which we see Sam Bridges exploring a desert, a cityscape, and more beyond the first game's Icelandic-inspired highlands.</p>
<p>The game also promises "exciting and adaptable combat" where players can be aggressive, stealthy, or avoid combat, much like the first game.</p>
<p>It also confirms, as expected, the "social strand gameplay" will return, as "your actions can affect how other players interact with the game's world, and vice-versa".</p>
<p>More specifically: "Death Stranding 2: On the Beach supports asynchronous multiplayer in the same way as the original game. Actions of other players, such as the creation of roads or structures and the routes they have travelled, will become visible and usable to the player once they have successfully connected areas of the map." PS Plus is not required to access these elements.</p>
<p>Of course, there's plenty more to Death Stranding 2, even just by the trailers. How is Higgs back? Why does he battle with an electric guitar? And what the hell is with the talking puppet?</p>

<p>Kojima skipped the PlayStation State of Play earlier this month, but on 9th March he will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-skipped-playstation-state-of-play-but-kojimas-sxsw-panel-will-bring-new-details">host a panel at SXSW where we'll find out more about the game</a>. Sony has also confirmed the game is still on track for a 2025 release.</p>
<p>At SXSW Kojima will be joined by actors Norman Reedus and Troy Baker, as well as musician Woodkid (who contributed to the Arcane soundtrack).</p>

			<p>Following <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Monolith Productions' official closure</a>, renowned journalist Jason Schreier shared more details about what the studio had been working on since the 2017 launch of Middle-earth: Shadow of War.</p>
<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/FI5wGiPFj_4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the latest episode of the Kinda Funny Gamescast</a>, Schreier revealed that Monolith did not want to make another game in the 'Middle-earth: Shadow of' universe. That is understandable, as by Shadow of War, the formula had become rather stale. The developer attempted to create an original IP codenamed Legacy next, but Warner Bros. Games decided to cancel the project in April 2021. This proved to be a fatal blow for Monolith because most of the leadership team resigned and went on to found <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-new-studio-led-by-middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-veteran-kevin-stephens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cliffhanger Games</a>, an Electronic Arts-owned developer that is developing <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-panther-game-announced-cliffhanger-games-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Black Panther game</a>. Interestingly, this new game will feature 'new storytelling tech' that will be used across several EA games, sounding a lot like the Nemesis system developed at Monolith. That one is trademarked by Warner Bros. Games, but some of the former developers could have developed a similar concept without incurring legal problems.</p>
<p>Anyway, Monolith tried to make the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wonder-woman-single-player-open-world-game-in-development-at-monolith-will-use-the-nemesis-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wonder Woman game</a> powered by the Nemesis system. However, the studio had to rebuild its leadership team from scratch in the middle of this new project, and they were also unsure whether to use Unreal Engine or their own LithTech Firebird engine. The latter ultimately won out, but several of the engineers who were experienced with it had left the company by then, causing development problems.</p>
<p>As previously reported, Wonder Woman was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/wonder-woman-game-was-rebooted-last-year-rocksteady-is-going-back-to-batman/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rebooted</a> between late 2023 and early 2024. The new version was supposed to be more like God of War and no longer have the Nemesis system. Clearly, though, a lot of work was left to do before the game could ship, and Warner Bros. Games decided to cut their losses and shut down Monolith for good. As is often the case in these situations, the developers only learned about the dire news on the same day as the public.</p>
<p>Regarding the rest of Warner Bros. Games, some executives reportedly wanted to transform WB Games Montreal into a support studio after the release of Gotham Knights, and some of the team was put on helping Monolith with Wonder Woman until recently. However, the developer of Batman: Arkham Origins and Gotham Knights is still trying to pitch a Game of Thrones title, and the IP based on George R.R. Martin's world was named among the publisher's priorities going forward. According to Schreier, TT Games is also in the final steps of making a new LEGO game that could launch as early as next year.</p>

You play as an eternally T-posing teenager who must learn how to get by performing the simple tasks of life despite the challenge of having their arms permanently outstretched. We first learned about the game back in 2023, when it was announced with a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-katamari-damacy-creators-charming-next-game-t-posing-is-a-feature-not-a-bug">very sing-alongable trailer</a>. Now, it has a release date, along with another cracking musical number. Come watch.</p>

<p>Ah, that's good. The game will come out May 28th, we're told. Besides having some friendly tunes, the trailer also shows off other features of the game, including some we haven't seen until now. You can customise your Teen's appearance, for example, and pick out shirts and shoes to wear. There's a dance sequence, teeth-brushing, dog petting, and some casual unicycling. </p>
<p>Outside the episodic story and minigames, you'll also be exploring the teen's hometown, visiting the shops, and chatting to other inhabitants eg. a giant talking pigeon wearing headphones. The teen also discovers the power to spin round incredibly fast and soar into the sky like a helicopter. We have seen that one previously, but yes, it seems useful. </p>
<p>The game is being developed by Uvula, the studio led by Keita Takahashi, designer of kid-friendly games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tenya-wanya-teens">Tenya Wanya Teens</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wattam">Wattam</a>, and Noby Noby Boy (the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z_TVzFVZbl4">chaotic spaghetti 'em up</a> that sadly never came to PC). They're generally colourful, playful, and approachable games about movement and silliness. This game's theme of going through everyday life as a kid with a disability means that the studio also consulted with charity AbleGamers about the subject, and want to make sure actually playing the thing is accessible.</p>
<p>Fun fact about Keita Takahashi: he was once <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/games/japanese-games-designer-recruited-to-design-nottingham-playground-1810807.html">hired by Nottingham city council to design a playground</a>. In the end, the park was cancelled because of budget concerns, so we never got to see his wild garden of trampolines and catapults. But sometimes I still think about what <a href="https://x.com/zerofiftyone_/status/1431042842378608642?lang=en">his happy doodles</a> might have looked like in real life. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The union subsequently </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/union-calls-for-extended-strike-at-don-t-nod-with-layoffs-looming">called for walkouts and strikes</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> while it attempted to negotiate with management, who it accused of stifling its efforts by refusing to move beyond the "bare legal minimum."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Negotiations between STJV and Don't Nod management about the layoffs plan are not conducive to any serious promise to employees. Despite huge efforts from the union delegates to reach a deal, management's offers remain insignificant," read an STJV statement published in January.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The tide appears to have turned, however, with STJV now explaining it was able to "wring out" a deal thanks to the efforts of colleagues who were determined to fight for their rights.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It explained the new deal has "widened the scope for voluntary redundancies" and could save up to 23 jobs by allowing more people to consider accepting a voluntary severance package—as opposed to a select few being forced out of the door.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The ability to request a voluntary redundancy will be open to more professional categories, some of which are not targeted for jobs cuts. This could save up to 23 jobs, by letting those who wish to leave go even if they were not intended to, avoiding in return a forced job cut," </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.stjv.fr/en/2025/02/struggle-pays-a-deal-was-found-at-dont-nod/">reads a statement</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"What’s more, the number of jobs being cut has been reduced from 69 to 49, since there were numerous resignations since management announced the PSE, and thanks also to adjustments to management’s plan following some of the CSE's (workers council) observations when it was informed."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">STJV claims anybody who does lose their job will also receive "less indignant terms" in the form of extra-legal compensation paid by Don't Nod. The deal also ensures that anybody who chose to strike between January 13 and January 17 will be paid for those days.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The union previously established a strike fund to compensate employees who joined the picket line. That cash will now be used to compensate workers who went on strike in November and December last year. Any remaining funds will be transferred to the STJV's national strike fund.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We want to thank and congratulate our colleagues for their part in this historic and successful mobilization. Their support and their solidarity were outstanding," continued the STJV. "This victory would not have been reached without the titanic work of the CSE (that was elected under the STJV's banner) and the Don't Nod STJV union section, over four months.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"And crucially, we send warm thanks to all of those who supported us and who filled the coffers of the strike fund. Collective action gets results, it is our best weapon. Of course, this PSE leaves a bitter taste, and the struggle will continue for both our remaining colleagues' working conditions as well as for the uncertain future that those who will be laid off will have to face.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It is not, and it will never be satisfactory to see people be fired. We hope that this struggle will be a stepping stone on which to weigh and from which to start, if any company out there did not get the memo.

            <p>The co-creator of the original Xbox console, Seamus Blackley, said VR still doesn't have a "killer app" yet and that's why the technology hasn't taken off.</p>
<p>Blackley spoke on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/4z0BGj2zmTceUpoQ8WL2qr">VideoGamer Podcast</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcguide.com/news/xbox-creator-claims-theres-still-no-killer-app-for-vr-yet/">PC Guide</a>) and had some strong words to say about VR and AR gaming.</p>
<p>"We've seen VR and AR not really take off, and if you're a big fan, I'm sorry, but it's just the fucking fact," he said. "There is no killer app and nobody can put their finger on what a killer app could be."</p>

<p>He continued: "Everybody has a different kind of personal fantasy and then, at least in my experience, when you are given the environment that you sort of fantasised about you're like 'OK' and you just want to take the headset off, because it's this hot, heavy thing. It's weird and disappointing."</p>
<p>Blackley said one of the key issues with VR "from a narrative standpoint" is that it offers "too much freedom", and that illusion of freedom is undermined by the need for developers to provide narrative control.</p>
<p>"When you lower the structure so much for the player that they are in the headset and they look around everywhere, in principle as an elevator pitch that sounds great," he said. "In practice, when we want to be entertained, we want a storyteller to control the narrative and to entertain us.</p>
<p>"To some extent you need [developers] to be able to control what you're looking at," he continued. "You need them to constrain you to the narrative which is not the thing you're going to do. And there's a small minority of guys who are going to scream and yell at them and want full control and that's great, super cool, fine, guys but they enjoy having that control because they're getting off on breaking that narrative control and they wouldn't be getting off on it if it wasn't there already, so it's paradoxical."</p>
<p>There have certainly been some great technical showcases for VR: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-call-of-the-mountain-review-a-visually-spectacular-introduction-to-the-psvr2">Horizon Call of the Mountain</a> launched with Sony's PSVR2 to show off its capabilities, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-alyx-review-a-legend-returns-in-elegant-form">Valve's Half-Life Alyx</a> has been celebrated by the few who have played it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/synapse-a-pure-power-fantasy-that-epitomises-everything-great-about-virtual-reality">Synapse</a> is another great VR game that "epitomises everything great about virtual reality", as reads our review, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/beat-saber-out-now-on-psvr2">Beat Saber</a> - available on almost every headset - is arguably VR's "killer app".</p>
<p>Yet Sony in particular is failing to support its PS VR2 headset - its recent PlayStation State of Play had no mention of the platform whatsoever. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> creative director Nicolas Doucet said last year there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-chance-of-astro-bot-coming-to-ps-vr2-says-creative-director">"no chance" of the game coming to PS VR2</a>, and as Eurogamer's Ian Higton wrote "it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-hard-to-stay-excited-about-the-playstation-vr2-if-even-astro-bot-wont-wear-one">hard to stay excited about the PlayStation VR2</a> if even Astro Bot won't wear one", after starring in PS VR1 game Astro Bot: Rescue Mission.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
