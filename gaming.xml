            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm not the most passionate fan of the Mafia series. My history goes something like: loved the first one at the time, was ‘eh’ on the second then bounced off the third despite its novel setting. But I was <em>all in</em> on <em>The Old Country</em> when it was announced. A new Mafia<em> </em>game set in Italy, in the early 1900s (the same fascinating period as the original <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, caught on the tracks between the 19th century and modernity), and best of all it was<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/short-smart-potentially-a-gamble-with-mafia-the-old-country-take-two-grapples-with-the-past-and-future-of-video-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> short</a>? Sign me up.</p><p>I wasn't sent any code for it, and I've been too busy to work on a full review of the game, so I've just been casually playing my way through it over the past couple of weeks. One thing keeping me from <em>rushing</em> were some early reviews;<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-the-old-country-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Eurogamer's</a> led with "by-the-numbers design", while<a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-old-country-review-is-it-good-worth-playing-2000617529" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Kotaku's</a> opens with "Rote, dated gameplay burdens this entry in the Mafia saga".</p><p>Which, whatever, reviews are reviews, I knew exactly what to expect from a Mafia game, and it was never going to be a revolutionary approach to third-person open-world gaming. Harking back to the first two entries in the series, with the added fact it’s trapped within the confines of a prequel, it was never going to be an innovative approach to genre story-telling either. Mafia<em> </em>(third game aside!) is a series born in tribute, an outline traced on butcher's paper over someone else's homage to <em>The Godfather</em>, and you'd be mad to go into this hoping <em>The Old Country</em> was going to be any different.</p><p>It's not even a proper open-world game! Again, like some of its predecessors, this is a fairly guided, level-by-level experience, which while featuring a world that's big and constantly asks you to drive across it, doesn't actually contain any of the trappings of a proper open-world game like exploration and sidequests. Don't think of this as a smaller <em>GTA </em>with nicer suits; think of it as a third-person shooter that just happens to replace loading screens with leisurely drives through the Sicilian countryside.</p><p>Because of my low expectations (complimentary, as we'll get to in a second!), I had a great time with <em>The Old Country</em> because all I ever want from a Mafia<em> </em>game is to kill some time with some run-of-the-mill mob stories (which are often the best kind!) and old-timey cars and work my way through an interactive soap opera interrupted by driving sections instead of commercials, which is exactly what this game delivered.</p><p>The whole thing is just so comfortably on-brand, both as a Mafia<em> </em>game and a mob tale. Its depiction of life in 1900s Sicily ticks every expected box: forbidden love, class warfare, loyalty, corruption and family tensions, with the addition of enough Catholic idolatry crammed into every room and street corner to make the Pope blush. I am not surprised by this but nor am I let down by it; <em>The Old Country</em> sets out to colour by numbers and it colours every one perfectly, right inside the lines.</p><p>I've never once enjoyed driving its lumbering cars or riding its horses, but I've craned my neck to admire the beautiful countryside every chance I've got (this is a <em>very </em>good-looking video game). I dozed off for half the story, but I remember so many snappy lines of dialogue, and everyone's handsome faces, luscious chest hair and wry smiles will live in me long after the credits roll. And a very big and special thanks to everyone who recommended I play the Sicilian dub; it's <em>transformative</em>, and helped set the mood more than any number of paintings of The Blessed Virgin Mary or overly-detailed bottles of olive oil ever could. If you haven't played the game yet, and ever do, playing in its native tongue--<a href="https://www.elalliance.org/languages/sicilian" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which is distinct from Italian, and extremely cool to see implemented so thoroughly in a video game</a>--is an absolute must.</p><p>The ways <em>The Old Country</em> is so predictable and yet comforting really got me thinking about all the stuff we're missing out on as the AAA games industry collapses into a flaming pile of wreckage. How I have, strangely, gotten to the point in 2025 where I'm genuinely wistful for a good 'ol 7/10, last-days-of -summer video game.</p><p>As<a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-game-pass-unsustainable" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> studios close, projects are cancelled and developers laid off in their thousands</a>, we're losing tentpole shooters, licensed action games and multiplayer battle royales, sure, but we're also losing games like <em>this</em>. The kind you may never cosplay for, or put on your GOTY list, but which you were still happy to pay for, enjoyed your time with and left feeling better about at the end. A game that doesn't surprise you or have any tricks up its sleeve, but has enough production money and nice graphics behind it to put a smile on your face on the kind of day when you just want to play a video game, any video game, because video games are great.</p><p>So no, <em>The Old Country</em> is not a breakthrough in third-person action, or historical story-telling. It never needed to be. This is a good book on a rainy afternoon, the latest episode in a dependable, long-running soap opera, a ticket to the 117th <em>Mission Impossible</em> movie. It's fine, and sometimes fine is great.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/esports-world-cup-new-global-sport-conference-2025-hideo-kojima"><h3>Come On, Guys</h3></a><p>Nobody is forcing Hideo Kojima and a host of industry luminaries to attend a Saudi sportswashing conference.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-closed-weapon-system-better-beta-ea-bf6-2000618282</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fine-i%E2%80%99ll-admit-it-battlefield-6%E2%80%98s-open-weapon-system-is-good.1273284/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>When I first heard about EA and Battlefield Studios’ plan to implement an <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-battlefield-6-open-beta-nyc-teaser-trailer-gameplay-1851786700">open weapon system in the upcoming<em> Battlefield 6</em></a>, I scoffed! And playing the game in Los Angeles for an event last month didn’t sell me on it, either; I still worried it would make classes feel less unique. Now, after playing the open beta for nearly 20 hours, I’m here to say: I was wrong.</p> <p>Let’s back up for a moment and explain, briefly, open and closed weapon class systems in<a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-dragging-people-multiplayer-reveal-ea-1851787385"> <em>Battlefield</em>.</a> (I promise this won’t be too boring.) Basically, for nearly as long as the franchise has been around, classes were locked to certain weapons. Recon, for example, had to use a sniper rifle. Over time, developers at Dice tweaked this and added “neutral” weapons that could be picked by multiple classes, or they spread specific types of weapons across a few classes. <em>Battlefield 2042</em> threw a lot of this out the window when it launched without classes and let players essentially build custom heroes who could use any gadget or gun. <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-2042/news/dev-notes-classes-in-battlefield-2042">It then added classes back in when people got angry</a>. Anyway, <em>Battlefield 6</em> is trying to find a happy balance between <em>2042</em>‘s total, unbalanced openness and the classic closed weapon system of the past games. And I think, despite being nervous about the change and <a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/battlefield-6-beta-feedback-en/open-vs-closed-weapons/12440854?after=MjUuNHwyLjF8aXwxMHwzOToxfGludCwxMjQ0MTg0MSwxMjQ1OTQ5MQ">all the debate raging online among players on both sides</a>, Battlefield Studios has mostly nailed it.</p> <p>In <em>Battlefield 6,</em> any class can use any weapon. So you can spawn in as a recon soldier, but instead of a sniper rifle, you could bring an SMG. Engineers, traditionally a class that uses SMGs, can rock snipers and LMGs. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384#:~:text=This%20is%20extremely,Lots%20of%20destruction">At first, this seemed like a bad idea to me</a>. I worried that players would just pick the class with the best abilities and pick the best assault rifle, and you’d lose all the uniqueness that comes from <em>BF’s</em> old-school class system. And in some smaller, more combat-focused modes, this is indeed the case. But in bigger, <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-bf6-rush-mcom-change-wnba-mafia-news-2000618000">more <em>Battlefield</em>-y modes, like Conquest and Rush</a>, I’ve been pleasantly surprised by how things have worked out.</p>

 <p>In my hours with the beta, I found that in many matches players were spread all around the four classes. In some past games (looking at you, <em>Battlefield 3</em>),&nbsp;people would pick whatever class had the best assault rifle, and that was that. During a Q&amp;A with the devs last month in LA, they talked about this and said that the open weapon system was partly designed to combat this. The idea is that now people will pick classes based on what the team needs and their unique abilities and tools, rather than the weapons they can and can’t use.</p> <p>And yeah, that’s exactly what I saw happening in many <a href="https://kotaku.com/7-new-things-weve-learned-about-battlefield-6-multiplayer-2000616043"><em>BF6</em></a> open beta matches. If the enemy team, for example, brought in a bunch of vehicles or tanks, I’d see players swap to engineers to use that class’s RPG to take all those machines out. Likewise, I saw players and friends swap to the support class to help hold a point and revive people, or swap to recon to help pin down a target. It seems now that weapons can be freely equipped on any class, people are far more open to playing different classes and helping out the team. Sure, maybe some of these players have just equipped the same assault rifle on all of the classes, but if it helps my team stop a tank from destroying us, I’m fine with it. That’s a much better scenario than in past <em>BF</em> games, where a whole team might be assault soldiers and you’d be unable to get ammo resupplies or fight back against helis.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Battlefield 6 Official Multiplayer Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wFGEMfyAQtI?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><em>Battlefield 6</em> also rewards players for choosing a weapon that is more aligned with their class. Recon soldiers get a ton of exclusive sniper perks that make it almost silly to use a sniper rifle on any other class. But you can do it, if that makes you happy. And this is where I’d suggest some tweaks.</p>

 <p>I think rewarding players who pick class-specific weapons is a smart idea, but I almost feel like the devs could do more to make sure picking an assault rifle on every class isn’t an easy option. Perhaps class-specific weapon punishments could work? An assault class soldier picking a sniper rifle might mean they don’t get the recon benefits, and perhaps they also reload the big rifles more slowly. Or an engineer picking an assault rifle has more kick and can’t carry as much ammo for it. These tweaks would reward people playing classes more traditionally, could be overcome with skill or teamwork, and would still allow for the weapon freedom the devs want in <em>BF6</em>.</p> <p>But even if <em>Battlefield 6</em> devs don’t steal my totally-awesome-and-perfect idea, I think the open weapon system is a good change. It lets players enjoy all the classes without forcing them to play with specific guns. This leads to matches in which all the classes are used, and that leads to more enjoyable <em>Battlefield</em> action. And that’s what I’m looking for. Sure, maybe it means that I’ll be killed a lot by a few popular assault rifles, but it might also mean that there will be more medics running around who can heal me. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-open-beta-revive-medic-help-me-ea-fps-ps5-2000616628">That would be nice</a>. And don’t worry; if you hate the open weapon system, EA is going to offer playlists and modes that feature locked weapons, too. Everyone wins.</p>

Is it...finally time? Dare we hope?</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1957492830374650018?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 18, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">If that above post means nothing to you, you've managed to steer clear of the Hollow Knight: Silksong fervor for years now, somehow. Since 2021, Hollow Knight fans have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-the-story-behind-the-insanely-long-wait-clown-meme">used images and emojis of clowns</a> (and specifically, the one right below) to goof about their constant hope for news about Silksong, especially around big presentations like Nintendo Directs, The Game Awards, or Summer Game Fest. Every time a new presentation rolled around, Silksong fans would post clown images and joke about putting on clown makeup, effectively acknowledging that it was cartoonish to hope for Silksong news but that they were hoping anyway.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/18/234-1755542983064.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Keighley could just be posting himself in a clown outfit for the heck of it, but I can't imagine that would be advisable given the fervor of the Silksong audience. Earlier this year, fans <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-dev-fuels-nintendo-switch-2-direct-fever-with-a-picture-of-a-chocolate-cake">went nuts over a chocolate cake recipe</a>, in a move which went so far as to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-dev-insists-the-game-is-real-progressing-and-will-release-as-fans-obsess-over-a-picture-of-chocolate-cake">force the developers to make a statement</a>, so teasing that audience probably isn't the best idea.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Keighley's tease seems like a pretty sure thing. We know <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-makes-brief-appearance-during-nintendo-switch-2-direct-to-secure-2025-release-window">Silksong is coming out in 2025 barring any unexpected delays</a>, and there's a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-has-a-new-hollow-knight-silksong-demo-playable-at-gamescom">demo of the game playable on the show floor</a> of Gamescom this week. We also know, via a leak, that the ROG Xbox Ally will launch on October 16, and Xbox's Sarah Bond has previously stated that Silksong <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/retail-leak-reveals-rog-xbox-ally-handheld-release-date">would be on the system when it launched</a>. If everyone's telling the truth and there have been no last-minute changes, that means Silksong should be out in the next two months sometime. And that would also mean we're due for an actual, real, confirmed release date any second now. Who's got a big showcase going on where such an announcement would make a huge splash? Keighley, of course.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, there's always a chance that we're all just putting on our clown makeup today only to be disappointed once again tomorrow. Grab a slice of chocolate cake, stick on that rubber nose, and let's lock in for Opening Night Live tomorrow.

N’s Reshiram – 167/159 (Illustration Rare)</h2><div catalogid="fb05b419-6a89-42d8-a1d2-880b04bec780" id="226586"><div id="226586" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>N's Reshiram - 167/159</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite modest power on the battlefield, <a href="https://zdcs.link/av4lmo?object_uuid=89f761ee-799e-41ec-a18a-3ff382098788&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">N’s Reshiram</a> is a stunner visually. The dreamy art style sets it apart, with pastel tones that blend N’s iconic soft-spoken nature with Reshiram’s divine presence — almost making it look like the cover of a fairy tale. Its main value stems from character appeal, not competitive strength — but it’s already seeing a slow rise in demand from collectors.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">9. Iono’s Bellibolt ex – 188/159 (Hyper Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="fb05b419-6a89-42d8-a1d2-880b04bec780" id="226585"><div id="226585" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Iono's Bellibolt ex - 188/159</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This golden Hyper Rare is more than eye candy, since the Electric Streamer ability of <a href="https://zdcs.link/akK6WY?object_uuid=89f761ee-799e-41ec-a18a-3ff382098788&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Iono’s Bellibolt ex</a> provides reliable Lightning energy acceleration, making it useful in niche Electric decks. While not a meta staple, Iono’s popularity continues to push her cards into collectors’ crosshairs.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">8. N’s Zoroark ex – 189/159 (Hyper Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="fb05b419-6a89-42d8-a1d2-880b04bec780" id="226584"><div id="226584" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>N's Zoroark ex - 189/159</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">N returns once again with a sleek <a href="https://zdcs.link/9Z1VmR?object_uuid=89f761ee-799e-41ec-a18a-3ff382098788&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zoroark</a>. Like its Special Illustration Rare counterpart, this card has Trade, one of the strongest card draw abilities in the game. With its golden finish and historical relevance to classic Zoroark GX decks, this is a solid budget-friendly option for players and collectors alike.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">7. Articuno – 161/159 (Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="fb05b419-6a89-42d8-a1d2-880b04bec780" id="226583"><div id="226583" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Articuno - 161/159</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This Illustration Rare version of <a href="https://zdcs.link/a03dbp?object_uuid=89f761ee-799e-41ec-a18a-3ff382098788&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Articuno</a> brings a stunning frozen aesthetic to match its sharp blue colouring, blending a simultaneous sense of camouflage and elegance. As for gameplay, Frigid Fluttering offers decent early-game acceleration in Water decks, but it’s the artwork that carries the value here. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re a fan of the original legendary bird trio, this is a must-have.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">6. Volcanion ex – 182/159 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="fb05b419-6a89-42d8-a1d2-880b04bec780" id="226582"><div id="226582" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Volcanion ex - 182/159</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">With Akagi behind the brush to bring back their striking art style, it’s no surprise this card is climbing in value.

Hop’s Zacian ex – 186/159 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="fb05b419-6a89-42d8-a1d2-880b04bec780" id="226581"><div id="226581" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Hop's Zacian ex - 186/159</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Zacian continues its streak as a playable and collectable legend. This version, partnered with Hop, features a charming and relaxing forest scene, which comes off as an interesting tonal shift from previous Zacian cards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z7Oqp7?object_uuid=89f761ee-799e-41ec-a18a-3ff382098788&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Hop's Zacian ex</a> is still testing its footing competitively, as well, but fans of Galar’s rivals with the cash to spare will likely scoop this one up based on narrative and nostalgia alone.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">4. N’s Zoroark ex – 185/159 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="fb05b419-6a89-42d8-a1d2-880b04bec780" id="226580"><div id="226580" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>N's Zoroark ex - 185/159</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like its Hyper Rare equivalent, this SIR version of <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAdLD?object_uuid=89f761ee-799e-41ec-a18a-3ff382098788&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">N’s Zoroark ex</a> is one of the most competitively viable cards in the set. Trade is still an exceptional ability, but its slick artwork doubles the appeal, with N and Zoroark standing ominously under a moody spotlight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, with this one’s much higher value, we’d recommend keeping this version of N’s Zoroark in your folder if you have one of the cheaper versions for your deck.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">3. Iono’s Bellibolt ex – 183/159 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="fb05b419-6a89-42d8-a1d2-880b04bec780" id="226579"><div id="226579" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Iono's Bellibolt ex - 183/159</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As with many Iono cards, demand is high across the board, and this delightful SIR Bellibolt card offers the same Electric Streamer utility as its Hyper Rare with a highly animated, stylised background, and adorable close-up featuring the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-scarlet"><u>Scarlet</u></a> &amp; <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-violet"><u>Violet</u></a> gym leader and her partner Pokémon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While not dominating tournaments, the sheer popularity of Iono’s character continues to make this <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3GgjE?object_uuid=89f761ee-799e-41ec-a18a-3ff382098788&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Iono's Bellibolt ex</a> card one of the most sought-after from the set.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">2. Salamence ex – 187/159 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="fb05b419-6a89-42d8-a1d2-880b04bec780" id="226578"><div id="226578" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Salamence ex - 187/159</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObm4O?object_uuid=89f761ee-799e-41ec-a18a-3ff382098788&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Salamence ex</a> card captures everything fans love about the pseudo-legendary with its big power, bold colours, and imposing presence. It’s not the most practical card in the meta due to its high energy costs, but its nostalgic pull and sweeping museum-grade artwork have given it a big lift in value.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1. Lillie’s Clefairy ex – 184/159 (Special Illustration Rare)</h2></div><div catalogid="fb05b419-6a89-42d8-a1d2-880b04bec780" id="226577"><div id="226577" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lillie's Clefairy ex - 184/159</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Journey Together set’s crown jewel in price is, unsurprisingly, a Lillie card with a $125+ value at the time of writing.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-vp-hints-at-%E2%80%9Cmore-affordable%E2%80%9D-xbox-cloud-gaming-service.1273254/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-revenue-grew-13-percent-this-quarter/">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> subscribers know that they have the ability to stream their games through Xbox Cloud Gaming, if they're ever inclined to stream whatever they want to play rather than play it natively on their preferred device. Currently, that option is only available to players who are paying for that top-tier subscription for Xbox Game Pass, but Microsoft's vice president of next generation, Jason Ronald, seems to have hinted that a "<em>more affordable</em>" plan for Xbox Cloud Gaming could be on the way.</p>



<p>During the official Xbox podcast, Ronald and Jason Beaumont, vice president of experiences at Xbox, discussed a variety of topics, including the Cloud Gaming service, and what could be on the horizon for Microsoft's investment in cloud gaming.</p>



<p>"<em>Our goal is really simple. We want to bring more games to more people. Cloud gaming is great at that</em>," said Beaumont. He continued to say that achieving that goal would include expanding the service to more countries around the world, and to as many devices as Xbox can.</p>



<p>Ronald, for his part, added "<em>One of the things we see is there's a lot of players who use Game Pass Ultimate to access the cloud, whether that's the primary way they play, or an additional way to play on the go. And so for us, I think it really opens up the opportunity to make it much more affordable and to make it more accessible to more players, whether that's going into new regions or new ways to actually access the cloud."</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Updates on the Xbox Ally, Play Anywhere, Game Pass, and More | Official Xbox Podcast" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/biXDUvQByBw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Ronald stops there, and doesn't go further to say that Microsoft and Xbox are prepared to launch a new tier for Game Pass that's just focused on Cloud Gaming, but that's the obvious way you'd think Microsoft would make its cloud gaming service more affordable, by making a tier that is exclusively streaming-focused, and isn't tied to the rest of the features you get from Game Pass, like being able to download every title natively to your device.</p>



<p>We'll see if that's a path Microsoft ends up choosing. In the meantime, the company is preparing to debut its <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-release-date-october-2025/">ROG Xbox Ally</a> device at Gamescom 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>We are still firmly in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/dune-popcorn-bucket-barbie-ghostbusters-best-worst-1851336690#content">“Gimmick Popcorn Bucket Era” of movie theaters</a>, and it shows no signs of stopping. Usually, these gimmicky popcorn buckets are items that fans want to buy and collect. But it seems like not many people want the creepy bucket for <em>The Conjuring: Last Rites</em>, featuring iconic haunted doll Annabelle. I wonder why.</p> <p>On August 18, Regal Cinema shared a photo of its popcorn bucket for the upcoming horror film, <em>The Conjuring: Last Rites,</em> the ninth (?!) film in the wildly popular <em>Conjuring</em> series. The movie is being marketed as a sort of ending for this era of the spooky franchise, though it sounds like more <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-best-horror-movies-1851282873/5"><em>Conjuring</em> universe</a> movies will happen in the future. Anyway, <a href="https://youtu.be/FSAz556s0fM">as seen in <em>Last Rites’</em> new trailer</a>, the franchise’s famous haunted doll, Annabelle, is returning for the <em>Conjuring’s</em> finale. And to celebrate, Regal’s new popcorn bucket features the doll herself, connected to a faux-wooden bucket with the movie’s logo slapped on it. The bucket will be available to order on Wednesday, over two weeks before the movie’s release.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">She's been released once more… Annabelle popcorn buckets coming to Regal this Wednesday.🍿 <a href="https://t.co/9cPobQ1Nkt">pic.twitter.com/9cPobQ1Nkt</a></p> <p>— Regal (@RegalMovies) <a href="https://twitter.com/RegalMovies/status/1957476386852979164?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>In the <em>Conjuring</em> universe, where she has three of her own spin-off movies as well as appearances in the main series, Annabelle is portrayed as scary, dangerous, evil, and just generally not a good doll you want to take home. I wasn’t surprised, then, that a lot of fans online don’t want this cursed piece of plastic in their homes.</p>

 <p>“Oh hell no lol,” said one user. “Um, that’s one bucket I don’t want,” said another person. Someone else replied: “Y’all can keep that one.”</p> <p>“Am I supposed to take this home?” asked someone in a reply to <em>DiscussingFilm</em>‘s tweet about the doll bucket. A diffferent user replied to the same tweet with: “<span>Nah nah nah nah you’re not gonna get me Annabelle, nice try.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Haunt your popcorn with our <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheConjuring?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TheConjuring</a>: Last Rites Annabelle popcorn bucket available starting August 22! <a href="https://t.co/UiYfek3Nft">pic.twitter.com/UiYfek3Nft</a></p> <p>— Cinemark Theatres (@Cinemark) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cinemark/status/1957534818465726527?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Meanwhile, on Monday, Cinemark shared a first look at its own <em>Conjuring 4</em> popcorn bucket and uh, well, reactions were different. That’s mainly because Cinemark’s gimmick bucket featuring Annabelle makes you eat the popcorn out of her ass. Would Tom Cruise eat popcorn out of Annabelle’s ass? Probably, the dude loves popcorn. But others aren’t as interested. This bucket will be available on Friday, August 22.</p> <p><em>The Conjuring: Last Rites,</em> alongside all the fake Annabelle popcorn buckets you desire (or fear), arrives in theaters on September 5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s very easy to not do something. You can simply say no, even and perhaps especially when an arm of the Esports World Cup, <a href="https://aftermath.site/saudi-arabia-scopely-pokemon-go-street-fighter-esports-human-rights" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a vehicle for Saudi government sportswashing</a>, comes to you and asks you to speak at a conference that organizers clearly hope will confer mainstream credibility, because esports is a niche field even at max audience capacity. Anyway, a bunch of video game industry luminaries, including Hideo Kojima, said yes.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://newglobalsportconference.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New Global Sport Conference</a>, which also took place alongside the Esports World Cup in 2023 and 2024, is being billed as “the premier global platform for industry leaders at the intersection of gaming, esports and sport” where CEOs, founders, and investors “drive groundbreaking initiatives shaping the future of these dynamic industries.” In other words, it’s a networking event for rich people – some of whom might be harder up for cash than usual, relatively speaking, due to <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/are-unreasonable-investor-expectations-the-cause-of-poor-video-game-market-conditions-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the current state of the video game industry</a>.</p><p>“NGSC plays a vital role in advancing Saudi Arabia's 2030 vision, aligning with our National Gaming and Esports Strategy to position Riyadh as the global capital of esports and a hub for innovation, talent, and opportunity,” Saudi esports federation president Prince Faisal bin Bandar bin Sultan al Saud says in a blurb on NGSC's website.</p><p>Previous years’ iterations <a href="https://esportsadvocate.net/2023/10/new-global-sport-conference/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have</a> <a href="https://esportsadvocate.net/2024/08/speakers-announced-for-2024-new-global-sport-conference/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">featured</a> bigwigs from companies like Sony, Sega, and Bungie, as well as a bunch of esports types and investors, but Kojima is easily NGSC’s biggest get in terms of pure name value. This year he’s joined by the likes of Activision COO Joshua Taub, Twitch CEO Dan Clancy, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot, Sega president Shuji Utsumi, Sony CSO Toshimoto Mitomo, <em>Tekken </em>director Katsuhiro Harada, former gaming exec and current soccer team owner Peter Moore, and chess champion Magnus Carlsen, among others. I hope they all have a great time this weekend.</p><p>In other news, <a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2025/08/11/saudi-arabia-executions-surge-in-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new report from Human Rights Watch and Middle East Democracy Center</a> says that 2025 has seen Saudi authorities carry out an “unprecedented surge in executions,” notable among them Turki al-Jasser, a journalist known for exposing corruption within the Saudi royal family.</p><p>“Behind closed doors, Saudi Arabia is executing peaceful activists and journalists following politicized trials,” said Middle East Democracy Center’s Abdullah Alaoudh. “These state-sanctioned killings are an assault on basic human rights and dignity that the world cannot afford to ignore.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-nty-wapo-vanity-fair-critics"><h3>Despite What NYT, WaPo, And Vanity Fair Seem To Think, We Still Need Critics</h3></a><p>"You’re ceding that process to people who do not have experience or training or standards"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/alien-earth-noah-hawley-fx-hulu-ridley-scott"><h3>Alien: Earth Has The Juice</h3></a><p>I was skeptical, but Noah Hawley has not let me down yet.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/iwalkfree-review-broken-foot"><h3>I Broke My Foot But The iWalkFree Gave Me Mobility Back</h3></a><p>Breaking your foot sucks, but the iWalkFree 3.0 gets you half way to walking again with some minor caveats.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/esports-world-cup-new-global-sport-conference-2025-hideo-kojima]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Everyone is waiting for <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> to come out. It’s the most wishlisted game on Steam. You can’t watch <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-hollow-knight-switch-2-screenshots-date-1851775219">a new gaming showcase these days</a> without the chat being flooded with stuff like “Show<em> Silksong</em>? Where is <em>Silksong</em>? <em>Silksong</em> when?” Due out before the end of 2025, time is running out for a release date announcement or even a same-day shadow-drop. <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-2024-e3-microsoft-gaming-show-1851638178">With Gamescom 2025 Opening Night Live</a> just around the corner, could this finally be the moment of truth? Host Geoff Keighley is certainly acting like it.</p> <p>Gaming’s veteran hype man has been sharing images of Gamescom ONL prep, including one of him in front of a mirror wearing a clown nose. It’s a clear wink to the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/hollow-knight-silksong-fans-in-clown-makeup"><em>Silksong</em> fanart clown makeup meme</a> about perpetual disappointment. The trend started years ago when developer Team Cherry was MIA, but hit a new fever pitch after Xbox claimed <em>Silksong</em> would arrive in 2022, only for it to never come out. Many gaming showcases have come and gone since, with the Metroidvanaia Soulslike only ever appearing briefly as part of a sizzle reel here and there.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">First time? 🤡 </p> <p>See you tomorrow for <a href="https://twitter.com/gamescom?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@gamescom</a> ONL. <a href="https://t.co/59ef5sFysJ">pic.twitter.com/59ef5sFysJ</a></p> <p>— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1957492830374650018?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 18, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Keighley is either tipping his hand that big <em>Silksong</em> news is just around the corner or paving the way for the biggest collective letdown ever. Since the game will be playable at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1mjunk6/silksong_confirmed_to_be_playable_at_the_nintendo/">multiple booths</a> on the Gamescom show floor, my money’s on the former. It’s coming to Switch but has also been promised to be available day-one on the Xbox Ally PC gaming handheld, rumored to release in October. Plus, the soundtrack was j<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HollowKnight/comments/1mtoufc/silksongs_ost_has_been_added_to_gog_though/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=mweb3x&amp;utm_name=mweb3xcss&amp;utm_term=1">ust added to the backend of GOG</a>.</p>

  <p>Keighley’s showcase will take place on August 19, 2025, at 2:00 p.m. ET. It will run approximately two hours with a pre-show that starts at 1:30 p.m. ET. You can stream it live on both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HVC_dBNUZGc">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74oh7zD_jxI">Twitch</a>. The event tends to have new game announcements sprinkled in with trailers and updates on already revealed games coming out in the next few months, plus occasionally brief intros from the developers themselves. This year’s Gamescom ONL will also include a live orchestra performance of music from surprise hit <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> and the first footage <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-teaser-images-new-vegas-lucky-38-mr-house-lucy-2000618233">of <em>Fallout</em> season 2</a>.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="gamescom Opening Night Live 2025" width="500" height="375" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HVC_dBNUZGc?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <h2>What games will be shown at Gamescom ONL?</h2> <p>Beyond the tease for <em>Silksong</em>, Keighley has already confirmed the following nine games will also make an appearance:</p> <ul data-cy="list"> <li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></li> <li><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></li> <li><em>Ghost of Yotei</em></li> <li><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></li> <li><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></li> <li><em>Silent Hill f</em></li> <li><em>World of Warcraft: Midnight</em></li> <li><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em></li> <li><em>Lords of the Fallen 2</em></li> </ul> <p><em>Black Ops 7</em> is expected to reveal the first footage from its updated multiplayer, while<a href="https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-xbox-ps5-exclusivity-date-sale-1851783817"><em> Black Myth: Wukong</em></a> is headed to Xbox this week and could potentially be showing off its long-rumored DLC expansion. With no BlizzCon this year, Microsoft will also be using ONL to debut the next <em>World of Warcraft</em> expansion, though a much bigger deal would be if it ever gets a much-requested console port. And what about <em>Diablo 4</em>‘s recently leaked Paladin subclass, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1mq4i45/the_d4_vendor_builds_were_updated_and_it_looks/">rumored</a> to be part of its next expansion? <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is Microsoft’s other big fall release, but with few updates on its biggest in-development games at its Xbox showcase in June, there are plenty of other big releases that could make surprise appearances at ONL.</p> <p>We haven’t heard much from Ubisoft this year either. Amid big delays and internal restructurings, the French publisher declined to hold its usual Summer Game Fest-adjacent June showcase. With the next <em>Far Cry</em>, <em>Ghost Recon</em>, and<em> Splinter Cell</em> remakes all in development, any one of them could get a tease at Gamescom. The developers behind <em>The Division 2</em> have already <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/thedivision/comments/1mtq98p/the_division_2s_gamescom_schedule_this_week/">teased</a> news on the ongoing loot shooter’s big winter update. Who knows, maybe Gamescom 2025 is when <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-bg-e2-director-release-date-dead-1851679744"><em>Beyond Good and Evil 2</em> will finally resurface</a>!</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/iconic-interactive-debut-game-the-oversight-bureau-nvidia-ace-ai/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/iconic-interactive-announces-debut-game-the-oversight-bureau-coming-to-pc-in-2025-and-enhanced-by-nvidia%E2%80%99s-ace-ai-tech.1273206/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Announced during today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fuJFzmVmm-c">NVIDIA GeForce ON Community Update</a>, developer Iconic Interactive revealed its debut title, <a href="https://theoversightbureau.com/">The Oversight Bureau</a>, a puzzle game that lets players use their voice to progress through the narrative that's enhanced by NVIDIA's ACE AI technology.</p>



<p>The studio calls it an "<em>Orwellian puzzle game</em>" in a press release, with its setting being that you're stuck in something called the CUTE Reprogramming Centre, and won't be released until you're deemed "<em>a more appropiate, more compliant member of society</em>."</p>



<p>If you're wondering how you use your voice to play the game, Iconic Interactive uses its proprietary Narrative Engine and NVIDIA's AI technology ACE to create the gameplay experience where you talk to a character in the game to solve the puzzle.</p>



<p>Regarding its proprietary engine, Iconic Interactive breaks it down "<em>into two parts: one AI model analyzes and understands a player's sentiment, while the other delivers dialogue, behavior and theatrical performance relevant to the character, story, and situation</em>. <em>The innovative approach enabled developers to maintain control of the story while providing players with an unparalleled experience, fully immersing them in the narrative</em>."</p>



<p>Iconic Interactive <a href="https://www.iconicgames.io/#about">calls itself a studio that is embracing AI</a> "<em>to enhance creativity, not replace it.</em>"</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="GeForce On Community Update" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fuJFzmVmm-c?start=2&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>We're thrilled to be able to show the work we have put into creating a new experience for players and utilizing the advanced tech of the Narrative Engine</em>," said chief executive officer and founder of Iconic Interactive, Junaid Hussain. </p>



<p>"<em>The Oversight Bureau is unlike any other gaming experience, and we cannot wait to bring this to PC screens and allow players to experience the use of AI in a creative and new way. Thank you to NVIDIA for allowing us to showcase our debut title. The team has worked hard on this, and we cannot wait to see its reception at the showcase</em>."</p>



<p>The short clip of gameplay we see in the presentation is interesting, to say the least, but it's not yet clear if The Oversight Bureau works as a full game or if it falls apart beyond what we see in the tech demo shown here. We'll see how the full release fares when it launches on PC this year.</p>

<p>Illustrative text-based-bangers ahoy!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're already all clued up and in the know about Moral Anxiety Studio's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/roadwarden">Roadwarden</a>, you'll already be in the know about how it was one of the most critically acclaimed games of 2022. And now it could be repeating success on Switch as it comes to the console on 25th August 2025.</p>
<p>Preorders for this one are now available on the Nintendo eShop, and it'd be remiss of us not to point out that there's a 20% launch discount at the moment, which brings the price down to a very nice <strong>£7.91</strong> / <strong><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/roadwarden-switch/">$8.79</a></strong> until 15th September. Yessir.</p>
<p>Now, it may seem like just another retro-styled pixel adventure at first glance, but this text-based beauty is, in fact, the sort of game that has the energy and power to resurrect an entire genre. We've played it (well, this here writer has) and this release announcement got us very excited for any Switch players out there who are interested in very good games.</p>
<p>Here's some further details from the official press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Set in a gritty, low-fantasy world full of mystery, danger, and moral dilemmas, <em>Roadwarden</em> puts players in the boots of a solitary traveller tasked with exploring an untamed peninsula. The game combines <strong>isometric pixel art</strong>, <strong>deep narrative design</strong>, and <strong>RPG elements</strong> such as inventory puzzles, dialogue choices, character builds, and survival mechanics.</p>
<p><em><strong>Step into the unknown. Shape your fate. And guard the roads.</strong></em></p>
<p><strong>Key Features – Roadwarden</strong></p>
<p><strong>Explore a Mysterious Peninsula<br></strong>Uncover secrets, dangers, and hidden stories in a richly detailed, low-fantasy<br>
world.<br>
<strong><br>
Choose Your Class and Backstory<br></strong>Play as a warrior, mage, or scholar, shaping your character’s abilities, beliefs, and personality.<br>
<strong><br>
Meaningful Choices<br></strong>Engage in deep dialogue, make the right decisions and shape the world around you.<br>
<strong><br>
Unique Genre Blend<br></strong>Combines text-based storytelling, isometric pixel art, RPG systems, and adventure mechanics.<br>
<strong><br>
30+ Hour Campaign<br></strong>Immerse yourself in a narrative-driven experience full of quests, survival elements, and moral dilemmas.</p>
<p>Every shadow hides a threat, every stranger may be a friend or a foe, and every choice could be your last. <strong>Roadwarden</strong> on <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong> invites a new audience to lose themselves in a world where every path is uncertain and every decision has weight. The roads are calling and only you can decide where they lead.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>NVIDIA DLSS 4 is now supported in over 175 games, the GeForce company announced today at Gamescom 2025. The list is about to grow with the likes of Resident Evil Requiem (CAPCOM) and Directive 8020 (Supermassive Games), both due in 2026 with DLSS 4 support and full path tracing to maximize visuals and performance.</p>



<p>Several other games will include NVIDIA DLSS 4 and ray tracing:</p>



<ul>
<li>Black State (stealth action/adventure game from Turkish developer Motion Blur, which we <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-state-qa-and-exclusive-screens-making-the-best-looking-games-with-best-optimization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed</a> a while ago)</li>



<li>Cinder City (formerly known as Project LLL, an open world MMO shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-announces-project-lll-an-open-world-mmo-shooter-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> by NCSoft in late 2022)</li>



<li>Cronos: The New Dawn (the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new sci-fi survival horror IP from Bloober Team</a>, out in a couple of weeks)</li>



<li>Dying Light: The Beast (the latest entry in the open world zombie franchise, now <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-receives-four-week-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slated for September 19</a>)</li>



<li>Honeycomb: The World Beyond (a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1510440/Honeycomb_The_World_Beyond/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sci-fi survival sandbox game</a> due in 2025)</li>



<li>Lost Soul Aside (the action game that started as a one-man project, <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-soul-aside-gets-delayed-to-august-29/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due in around ten days</a>)</li>



<li>The Outer Worlds 2 (Obsidian's sci-fi RPG sequel, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-launches-this-coming-october-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled for October 28</a>)</li>



<li>Phantom Blade Zero (the <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-new-gameplay-s-party-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hotly anticipated action game from S-GAME</a> with no release window in sight)</li>



<li>PRAGMATA (CAPCOM's <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-hands-on-sgf-2025-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new sci-fi action/adventure game</a>, due at some point in 2026)</li>
</ul>



<p>In addition, Gearbox's Borderlands 4 and the free-to-play third-person anime-style hero-based shooter game Fate Trigger by Saroasis Studios will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, accelerating performance even further for GeForce RTX 50 graphics cards.</p>



<p>Matt Wuebbling, vice president of global GeForce marketing at NVIDIA, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>DLSS 4 and path tracing are no longer cutting-edge graphical experiments — they’re the foundation of modern PC gaming titles. Developers are embracing AI-powered rendering to unlock stunning visuals and massive performance gains, enabling gamers everywhere to experience the future of real-time graphics today.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[RTX Hair Is Coming in September to Indiana Jones and the Great Circle]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As part of its <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-supported-175-games-resident-evil-requiem-path-tracing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom 2025 announcements</a>, NVIDIA confirmed that the long-awaited RTX Hair feature will debut in September in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p>



<p>You might recall that it had been <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-to-get-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-and-rtx-hair-with-february-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> to arrive back in February alongside the NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation support. DLSS 4 MFG was indeed introduced with that update, but RTX Hair wasn't. Clearly, NVIDIA and MachineGames still had to iron out some kinks.</p>



<p>RTX Hair leverages linear swept spheres, a new hardware feature introduced with the GeForce RTX 50 Series of graphics cards. This new primitive renders hair with spheres instead of triangles as usual. NVIDIA says this is not only a better fit for the shape of hair but also reduces the amount of geometry needed to render each strand of hair. Additionally, RTX Hair reportedly offers better lighting and shadows while only occupying a small memory footprint. NVIDIA later clarified that in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, linear swept spheres will only be available to Blackwell GPUs, whereas any other GPU will have to stick with the existing hair model.</p>



<p>NVIDIA did not provide any detailed performance data on how RTX Hair will affect the frame rate in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, so we'll have to check that ourselves when the update goes live in a few weeks. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">excellent first-person action/adventure game</a> will also soon get its story-based premium DLC, The Order of Giants, which was included with the Premium Edition and can be bought separately (with the Digital Premium Upgrade) for €35.</p>

Nvidia has been gradually improving its new app over the past 18 months since its release, and it’s getting closer to fully migrating all the legacy control panel options.</p><p>This week’s Nvidia app update will include anisotropic filtering, anti-aliasing, and ambient occlusion options, meaning you won’t have to navigate to Nvidia’s older control panel app to improve classic games. The setup tool for Nvidia Surround will also be part of the Nvidia app now.</p><p>You also won’t have to configure DLSS override features on a per game basis anymore, as Nvidia is now adding a global option. You can set your DLSS preferences across all override supported games, and Nvidia’s overlay will also show which DLSS settings are active if you toggle this option on.</p><p>Nvidia is also bringing its <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-gb%2Fgeforce%2Fnews%2Fnvidia-app-update-dlss-overrides-and-more%2F%23nvidia-smooth-motion&amp;xcust=__vg0818awD__602963__________________google.com" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored" target="_blank">new Smooth Motion feature</a>, which was previously exclusive to RTX 50-series GPUs, to all RTX 40-series owners. It’s a driver-based AI model that enables smoother gameplay for games that don’t support DLSS Frame Generation. Smooth Motion can be applied to games running with DLSS Super Resolution, at native resolution, or even titles with other upscaling technologies. Nvidia says it will typically double “the perceived frame rate.”</p><p>If you’re a fan of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/635155/nvidia-g-assist-ai-assistant-available-download">Nvidia’s G-Assist AI assistant</a>, Nvidia is changing the AI model behind the scenes so it will use 40 percent less memory. The smaller footprint won’t affect performance either, as it’s designed to respond even faster to queries.</p><p>These latest Nvidia app changes will arrive on August 19th for beta users at 9AM PT / 12PM ET, followed by a general release next week.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/760488/nvidia-app-dlss-override-control-panel-features]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>The next <em>Skate</em> game from EA, which is often called <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-ea-full-circle-free-to-play-microtransactions-1849179812"><em>Skate 4</em></a> online by fans, is set to arrive via an early access launch later this year. And in a new blog from the devs behind the reboot, we learned that music is a big part of the upcoming skateboarding game and that a whole lotta people will be able to play it together online.</p> <p>This new <em>Skate</em> game was first officially announced all the way back <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-has-finally-announced-a-new-skate-game-1844087679">in June 2020</a>. And over the years, <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-ea-leaked-alpha-beta-build-pc-devs-1849176399">the game has leaked numerous times</a> while EA has also <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-skate-4-pre-alpha-gameplay-video-full-circle-session-1849131150">released official early footage of it</a> and brought in fans to playtest it. The development of <em>Skate</em> (which is not called<em> Skate 4</em> for some reason) has been remarkably transparent, and as part of this, <a href="https://www.ea.com/ea-studios/full-circle">developers Full Circle</a> have released regular blog posts sharing new details about the reboot. And in the latest one, the devs shared a bunch of information on how music–a very important part of any good skateboarding game–will work in <em>Skate</em>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">🚨We will be inviting all registered skate. Insiders to come playtest in July. Check your emails.</p> <p>The latest build has improved textures and lighting, more challenges, and changes to our progression system. <a href="https://t.co/fyjxtOj3qi">pic.twitter.com/fyjxtOj3qi</a></p> <p>— skate. (@skate) <a href="https://twitter.com/skate/status/1935027470480330760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/skate/news/the-grind-vol-five">In the most recent installment of “The Grind,”</a> EA and Full Circle announced that <em>Skate</em> will launch with “about 100” songs. These songs will be grouped into different, themed playlists that will act like radio stations. Players will be free to like songs and create their own playlist of favorites. There will also be a playlist that will feature songs other players are listening to and liking, which will update over time. As for what kind of music to expect in <em>Skate</em>, Full Circle says the team is “focused on emerging artists” and that they included some “deep cuts” that the devs hope will help players “discover” new favorites.</p>

 <p>EA and Full Circle also plan to add new songs to the game as it changes live-service seasons every three months. It also sounds like music that’s less popular with players might leave the game, but EA says it will make sure that the tracks you favorite and enjoy stick around in <em>Skate</em> “for longer.”</p> <p>While losing music is a bit of a shame, I’m excited to hear devs promising regular music updates. With live-service games that players are expected to play for months or years, new music being added over time can help reinvigorate things. There are only so many times you can hear the same tunes over and over before starting to hate them. As someone who has played <em>GTA Online</em> for over a decade, trust me on this.</p> <p>In the latest blog post, the devs also said that the team is aiming for about 150 players per server session. And yes, in case you forgot or weren’t aware, <a href="https://kotaku.com/skate-4-reboot-ea-no-offline-mode-always-online-2025-1851777885"><em>Skate</em> is an always-online free-to-play skating game</a>, so multiplayer is a big part of the equation. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Skate4/comments/1ln0xu4/comment/n0c50t1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Over on Reddit</a>, players who have been involved in playtesting have suggested that servers only supported 80 players during their time with the game, but that EA wanted to up that number to 150, which the blog confirms. 150 players is a lot, so hopefully <em>Skate</em>‘s open world is large enough to support all those skateboarding hooligans listening to music and popping kick flips.</p> <p><em>Skate 4</em> aka the <em>Skate</em> reboot <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-skate-4-reboot-release-date-early-access-2025-pc-ps5-1851650367">doesn’t have a specific release date yet</a>, but EA says it will be available on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC via early access at the end of the summer.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/battlefield-6-all-major-changes-confirmed-for-launch/2900-6845/" data-ref-id="2900-6845">Battlefield 6</a> open beta has officially ended after two weekends of explosive action, and based on the number of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-weekend-2-goes-live-with-some-issues-but-still-eclipses-300000-users-on-steam/1100-6533941/">concurrent players on Steam</a> and the slew of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-beta-gets-high-marks-from-digital-foundry/1100-6534010/">reactions online</a>, a lot of people took some time with Battlefield's next installment. One of the main concerns coming out of the beta involves players worried about the average size of multiplayer maps being smaller and more compact like those in the beta--but if recent datamines from the BF community are any indication, those fears appear to be unfounded.</p><p dir="ltr">Via <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/battlefield-6-large-scale-map-images-leak-comparisons-alleviate-beta-concerns" rel="nofollow ">MP1st</a>, images of maps not found in the open beta were datamined from Battlefield Labs, the official community development platform for the Battlefield games. Two maps--one called Mirak Valley, which will be included in the base game; and Eastwood, which will apparently be part of the game's first season of extra content--were found during the datamine, and both maps are considerably larger than the Siege of Cairo map found in the beta. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4551512-battlefield-6-maps.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551512" data-ratio="0.60502092050209" data-width="2390" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4551512-battlefield-6-maps.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4551512"></a><figcaption>A size comparison of the datamined maps versus Siege of Cairo, made by Reddit user u/Happysufigeee.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4551512-battlefield-6-maps.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Mirak Valley, per the datamine, features a riverbed running through two massive mountain ranges, and it's said to be more than half a kilometer in size. The other map, Eastwood, is said to be set in a country club in California, and it allegedly features a golf course, multiple burned-out houses, and two new vehicles: a golf cart and a boat.</p><p dir="ltr">Developers had addressed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-maps-are-too-small-players-say-but-bigger-ones-are-coming/1100-6533900/" data-ref-id="1100-6533900">concerns over map size</a> recently, with producer David Sirland saying that large maps exist, "and the tempo scales accordingly--you'll be able to see soon enough!" However, this is the first time that datamined information seems to back up that claim.</p><p dir="ltr">The Battlefield 6 open beta also made waves with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-reveals-rush-is-limited-to-12v12-and-people-are-upset/1100-6533943/">fans of the franchise's long-running Rush mode</a>, which was particularly affected by the smaller maps found in the beta. A few <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-makes-balance-changes-to-rush-but-its-still-12v12/1100-6533997/">balance changes</a> were made via a hotfix, but players were still upset with what the mode offered throughout the test.</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefield 6 is set to launch October 10 on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC--with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-will-let-players-have-cross-play-if-they-want-it/1100-6533699/" data-ref-id="1100-6533699">cross-play available</a> to those who wish to use it. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-preorder-guide-ps5-xbox-physical-edition-retailer-bonuses/1100-6533616/" data-ref-id="1100-6533616">Preorders are available now</a> for both the Standard and Phantom editions, the latter of which includes extra in-game skins, currency, and more for $100--compared to the standard edition's $70 price tag.</p>

But in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance</a> — which launches on Switch at the end of August — his greatest threat awaits in some DLC.</p>
<p>Coming in early 2026, <a href="https://x.com/SEGA/status/1957457668689260742">Sega has announced</a> the <strong>SEGA Villains Stage</strong>, and first up for our daring ninja is the blue blur's rival himself, Dr. Eggman. Joe Musashi and Eggman have actually met before in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/sonic_and_all-stars_racing_transformed">Sonic &amp; All-Stars Racing Transformed</a>, but this time, we imagine things won't be settled in a kart race here. Oh no.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067wymiop&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>In the promotional image, you can also see two more sets of eyes lurking in the shadows either side of Dr. Eggman. No idea who those will be yet! Any guesses? Maybe a <strong>Like A Dragon</strong> villain? Mr. X? Dr. Curien?</p>

<p>It's a fun concept, and we're excited to see some of Sega's rogue's gallery in lovely painterly form. Lizardcube's new entry in the Shinobi series already looks fantastic, so this is a fun little cherry on top.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-september-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-state-of-play-coming-in-september-2025-it%E2%80%99s-claimed-%E2%80%93-rumor.1273143/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony has had a State of Play, or some kind of presentation in September every year for the last six years, and according to Jeff Grubb, who has proven to be a reliable source for information ahead of official announcements, they won't be breaking that streak in 2025 with a State of Play, "<em>maybe a Showcase</em>," planned for "<em>before the end of September</em>."</p>



<p>Grubb made his claim during Giant Bomb's Game Mess Mornings show, at the 20 minute and 10-second mark while Grubb and his guest, IGN's Seth Macy, were discussing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fairgame-canceled-according-to-michael-pachter/">weekend scare that Fairgames from Haven Studios had been canned</a>.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="45-Minute Kirby Air Riders Direct Announced" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7KYP00kf4GM?start=1221&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>I've heard, - and this one I feel comfortable saying, you can go write headlines about this if you want</em> - <em>they're planning a State of Play, or maybe a Showcase, but probably a State of Play, for the end of September, or before the end of September. So we're gonna hear, we're going to get updates from Sony here pretty soon</em>,<em>" </em>Grubb said.</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, beyond <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-similar-length-tsushima/">Ghost of Yotei</a>, we don't know what Sony has lined up for the remainder of 2025, and after Gamescom ONL tomorrow, September would be the perfect opening for Sony to let players know what they can look forward to for the rest of the year.</p>



<p>The last <a href="https://wccftech.com/everything-shown-at-the-june-2025-state-of-play/">State of Play this past June</a> included mostly news for third-party titles and 2026 releases. In the very likely scenario that a September 2025 State of Play is on the horizon, hopefully it includes more news about what's coming from PlayStation and Sony in the next few months.</p>

              <p>Valve is overhauling how Steam reviews are displayed in a new update, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/500579345320904529?l=english">it announced on Monday</a>. The percentage score usually assigned to games based on the number of positive and negative user reviews will now exclude reviews written in other languages. The change comes as Steam becomes an increasingly popular global PC storefront and routine review-bombing from players in specific regions can torpedo a game’s rating for everyone on the platform.</p> <p>“Steam’s growth since then into an even larger global presence means customers in different regions of the world may have vastly different experiences from each other for the same game,” Valve explained <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/500579345320904529?l=english">in a new blog post</a>. “There are a variety of reasons this may happen for a particular game, including translation issues, cultural references, poor network connections, and many others; things that the Overall Review Scores haven’t been able to capture until now. Calculating a language-specific review score means that we can better distill the sentiment of these different groups of customers, and in doing so, better serve potential customers that belong to those groups.”</p> <p>Not every game will be impacted by the changes. Valve said it will only start calculating “language-specific review scores” for games with at least 2,000 total publicly visible user reviews, and at least 200 written in a particular language. Players can now click through the review score section of a game’s Steam store page to get a breakdown of the scores across different languages. While this will now be the default mode for review scores on Steam, everyone will still have the option to toggle back to the old system.</p>

 <p>“We realize that whenever we make changes to User Reviews, we’re inviting some scrutiny into our motivations for making those changes,” Valve wrote. “Maintaining trust in the system is crucial to us, so we’ve erred on the side of being as transparent as possible.”</p> <p>The move comes just days after one of Steam’s bigger releases of the season, <a href="https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-mod-censorship-1-4-2000618179"><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em></a>, implemented controversial changes to the game following apparent pushback from some Chinese fans over historical references in the fictional Soulslike. While it’s unclear if that game factored into this new policy at all, games on Steam increasingly get review-bombed for all sorts of reasons that don’t always necessarily have to do with the underlying functionality or experience, from allegations of using generative AI to complaints of terms of service requirements in places like Europe.</p> <p>Data from <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/4-great-graphs-and-1-new-feature">Simon Carless’<em> Game Discover</em> newsletter</a> earlier this year showed that a plurality of Steam users in 2024 had “simplified Chinese” as their primary language on the platform, followed narrowly by English in second place. Over the summer, <em>Helldivers 2</em> was <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-eos-prosperity-china-steam-reviews-1851782983">briefly review-bombed</a> after an apparent translation error led Chinese players to feel cheated by one of the game’s weekly mission objectives. The latest changes to review scores seem like an attempt by Valve to keep those two audiences separate, at least when it comes to rating new games.</p>

              <p><span>The Marvel universe is so vast that games like hero shooter </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-eomm-steam-reviews-max-payne-remake-n64-2000617137"><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i></a><span> and fighting game </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-vs-capcom-state-of-play-ps5-1851783734"><i><span>Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</span></i></a> <span>already have a virtually endless bucket of characters to draw on for their growing rosters. Nevertheless, it sounds like NetEase is at least considering making its own original heroes for </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>at some point. You know, if that was something you ever thought about.</span></p> <p><a href="https://mp1st.com/news/netease-green-light-marvel-create-original-characters-marvel-rivals"><i><span>MP1st</span></i></a><span> asked </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>director Guangyun “Guangguang” Chen if NetEase had considered adding heroes of its own to fight alongside Marvel staples like the Avengers and the Fantastic Four in a future season. After all, other Marvel projects like the MCU movies have created new characters. Would it be out of the question for </span><i><span>Rivals </span></i><span>to also indulge in making people up to capture an objective or push a payload? Well, Chen says that Marvel has given the team the green light to do that. While he told </span><i><span>MP1st </span></i><span>the team is “allowed to introduce original characters,” Chen played coy when asked if any are coming down the pipeline, merely saying “stay tuned.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Maybe my immediate aversion to this is just because </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>isn’t even a year old yet, and the thought that someone’s favorite comic book mainstay could get sidelined for some OC cooked up in the NetEase offices feels bad. However, Luna Snow, one of the most popular characters in </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span>,</span> <span>also started as an original character in the mobile game </span><i><span>Marvel Future Fight</span></i><span>, which has been a point of contention considering all the attention she gets in terms of cosmetics compared to fan-favorite heroes who originate from the comics. I don’t doubt some interesting heroes might come out of this, but you’re still covering the classics, NetEase, so I hope any original characters you might introduce come after you’ve spent a bit more time filling out the roster with established heroes people are still waiting for.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>For more on </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span>, check out </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>’s review</span></a><span>.</span></p>

The last character of that fourth season is also a first for the franchise: Lucy from Cyberpunk: Edgerunners enters the fray as Guilty Gear's first-ever guest character on August 21, and we have an look at nine minutes of new gameplay featuring the mysterious netrunner.</p><p dir="ltr">Lucy's main weapon is her neon whip, the Monowire, which she can quickly throw out as a potent combo starter. She also has Sprint Attack, a fast low-sweeping move that can be chained into other moves depending on the buttons the player presses after a successful hit.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Guilty Gear Strive - 9 Minutes Of NEW Lucy Gameplay</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The most notable move in Lucy's arsenal, however, is her Quickhack super move. Here, she produces a menu of six unique perks that change her attacks, give her added buffs, and even debuff the opponent for a short time. Each activation of Quickhack gives Lucy a limited amount of RAM to use when selecting perks--which each cost a specific amount--so she won't be able to activate all six at a time, but she will come out at an advantage after each Quickhack.</p><p dir="ltr">The six Quickhack perks, along with their RAM costs and abilities, are below:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Contagion</strong> (costs 3 RAM)  <ul><li dir="ltr">Lucy's attacks deal damage over time</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Energy Siphon</strong> (costs 6 RAM)  <ul><li dir="ltr">Lucy's attacks also restore her health</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Algorithm Malfunction</strong> (costs 13 RAM)  <ul><li dir="ltr">All of Lucy's attacks trigger a Counter Hit</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Resistance Glitch</strong> (costs 9 RAM)  <ul><li dir="ltr">Opponents build RISC levels faster by blocking Lucy's attacks  <ul><li dir="ltr">The higher RISC a character has, the more damage they take from the next combo that hits them</li></ul></li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Pacify</strong> (costs 8 RAM)  <ul><li dir="ltr">Opponent gains less Tension gauge, GG's version of super meter</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Optics Inhibition (</strong>costs 3 RAM)  <ul><li dir="ltr">Lucy becomes glitched and hard to see, making opponents' moves miss more often</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Guilty Gear Strive is available now on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC. Lucy will be available on August 21 as part of the game's Season 4 content bundle.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlestate Games has released a new gift code for Escape from Tarkov players, and it offers a hint regarding the game’s imminent graduation into a fully released game. For almost a decade, Escape from Tarkov has been a beta product, but in the coming months, it’ll transform, and the latest Escape from Tarkov reward code is teasing exactly that.</p>



<p>The latest Tarkov code offers a stack of free items, but more importantly, it tells us that the game’s full release is <strong>coming soon</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-latest-tarkov-code-gives-free-kit">Latest Tarkov Code Gives Free Kit</h2>



<p>If you want to redeem the latest Escape from Tarkov code, you’ll need to head to <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/promo/activate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s website</a>, sign in, and click on ‘Activate Promo Code’. Then, type in this code: RELEASECOMINGSOON.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that you can only redeem these free Tarkov items on a PvP account and <strong>not </strong>on a PvE account. If you’re only tied to the latter, you won’t even be able to claim the code, period.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Here’s everything you get when you redeem the new Escape from Tarkov gift code:</p>



<ul>
<li>Tactical Sport Headset</li>



<li>Fleece Beanie</li>



<li>TGlasses</li>



<li>AFAK</li>



<li>Esmarch x 2</li>



<li>Ultimag x 3</li>



<li>Zarya Flashbang</li>



<li>SJ6</li>



<li>7.62 PP x 60</li>



<li>7.62 PS x 120</li>



<li>RGD-5 x 2</li>



<li>Propital</li>



<li>Morphine</li>



<li>CALOK-B</li>



<li>CMS</li>



<li>Vaseline</li>



<li>A18 Skanda Armoured Rig</li>



<li>AKMN (fully kitted)</li>
</ul>



<p>The AKMN assault rifle you get with the new Tarkov code is a beaut, boasting the red hex components that are guaranteed to make it stand out.</p>



<p>You’ll notice that when you head to Escape from Tarkov to collect the rewards, you’ll be met with a message from System that simply reads ‘Soon.’</p>



<p>It’s indicative <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/">of Tarkov’s 1.0 release</a>, which might drop before the year is out (but more likely it’ll come in 2026).</p>



<p>Let me know if you’re excited about Escape from Tarkov’s imminent full release on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
