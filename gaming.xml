            <p>
Paradox Interactive has delayed Life By You - the new Sims-like from its Paradox Tectonic studio - yet again  saying "additional development time is needed" and that it doesn't want to commit to a new release date it "cannot be certain to meet".
</p>
<p>
This marks the third delay for Life By You, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradoxs-life-by-you-is-an-open-world-real-language-take-on-the-sims">announced last March</a> amid promises of a fully open-world with no loading screens, "real language conversation", digital humans that could optionally be directly controlled by players, and plenty of customisation.
</p>
<p>
It initially also featured a rather bland art style that immediately drew criticism, leading to the game's first delay. Rather than release into PC early access last September, as had originally been the plan, Paradox announced it would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sims-like-life-by-you-early-access-release-delayed-into-next-year">delaying Life by You into March this year</a> so it could spruce up its visuals, its UI, and other elements.

<p>
In February, however, Paradox <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradoxs-sims-like-life-by-you-has-been-delayed-again-and-is-now-aiming-for-june">announced a second delay</a>, this time to 4th June, to "ensure that it's as smooth and fun... as possible, and lays a strong foundation for building out [the game] during early access." But with just two weeks to go until launch, Paradox has now confirmed the game won't be making that release date either.
</p>
<p>
"After much consideration, we regret to announce that we have decided to retract Life by You’s early access release date, previously set for June 4th," the publisher <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/media/update-on-life-by-yous-early-access-release-date">wrote in its latest announcement</a>. "This was not an easy decision, especially since we understand the anticipation and excitement that many players have for the game. However, we believe that additional development time is needed."
</p>
<p>
"While we would have preferred to commit to a new release window," Paradox continued, "we believe it is more prudent to hold off while we plan ahead, rather than committing to a new date that we cannot be certain to meet."
</p>
<p>
Life By You's succession of delays comes amid a seemingly turbulent time for Paradox. Earlier this year, the publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-gets-a-3d-sequel-in-march">announced</a> then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-2-release-date-delayed-again-less-than-a-month-from-launch">twice delayed</a> a Prison Architect sequel, more recently confirming it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-developer-double-eleven-parts-way-with-paradox-after-nine-years-on-series">parted ways with its developer</a> ahead of release. That news followed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-chinese-room-is-developing-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">troubled development</a> of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-declares-pulp-strategy-the-lamplighters-league-a-22m-flop">commercial failure</a> of last year's The Lamplighters' League, and the disastrously premature launch of Cities: Skylines 2, which was recently forced to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-publisher-refunds-dlc-and-admits-we-let-you-down">halt all DLC plans</a> while its developer worked on addressing the "shortcomings of the game".
</p>
<p>
While Paradox has elected not to give Life by You a new release date following its most recent delay, the publisher says it'll share more "as soon as possible".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-launch-trailer-ninja-theory-game-greenlit/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</a> arrives tomorrow, and Microsoft and Ninja Theory have dropped one more stunning trailer that shows off the game’s impressive environments and facial animations. Don’t worry, there aren’t any spoilers, so check it out for yourself, below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Senua's Saga: Hellblade II - Official Launch Trailer (ft. Animal Soul by AURORA)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PRbOmIcVXak?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While launching a long-in-development title like Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II would usually be a celebratory moment, some Xbox fans are worried, as Microsoft recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shut down a number of mid-size first-party studios like Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin</a> shortly after they had completed games. Thankfully, Microsoft insider <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jez Corden</a> has stepped in to provide a bit of reassurance, saying Ninja Theory’s next project has already been greenlit. Interestingly, Corden says the next thing is <em>not</em> Project Mara, a prototype Ninja Theory has teased in the past.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">ICYMI: Ninja Theory offers fans a message on the eve of Hellblade 2's launch.</p>
<p>Oh, and no, it's not a "goodbye" message like some are spinning. According to sources familiar, their next game has alr been greenlit.</p>
<p>READ: <a href="https://t.co/1VVGJHFMls">https://t.co/1VVGJHFMls</a><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NinjaTheory?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NinjaTheory</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Xbox?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Xbox</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Hellblade2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Hellblade2</a></p>
<p>— Jez (@JezCorden) <a href="https://twitter.com/JezCorden/status/1792634668287742113?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Of course, take this with a grain of salt for now, but Corden usually has the goods when it comes to Xbox-related stuff, so fingers crossed for the future. Meanwhile, Ninja Theory studio head Dom Matthews has posted <a href="https://x.com/NinjaTheory/status/1792601505083621573" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this statement on the eve of Hellblade II’s release</a>…</p>
<p><em>“Hi Everyone, as we sit on the eve of the release of Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II I wanted to thank you, our fans, on behalf of everyone here at Ninja Theory. We see you and we hear you when you give us such love and support, when you tell us how much Senua means to you, when you tell us how much you are looking forward to the game and how much faith you have in us to continue Senua’s story in a way that does justice to the connection so many of you have to her and to Hellblade.</em></p>
<p><em>From the very beginning of Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II we have had you in-mind and I truly hope that when you play the 2nd chapter of Senua’s story, you will find that familiar connection once again, and that also so many more people will find their way to Senua and her world too.</em></p>
<p><em>Making video games is difficult. Much like Senua, we as a team have been guided by a conviction to achieve our quest -- To make a game that sinks you deep into Senua’s world and to take you on a journey that leaves you thinking and feeling. I believe we have achieved our quest and I hope you’ll agree. I’m very proud of the game, very proud of our team and very proud of you, our fans, who have supported us on this magical journey.”</em></p>
<p>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II launches on PC and Xbox Series X/S tomorrow (May 21).</p>

            <p>Microsoft has revealed that its AI technology will be integrated into video games.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsofts-ai-will-be-inside-minecraft-and-other-xbox-pc-games-new-copilot-features-will-search-your-inventories-offer-tips-and-guides?s=31">As reported by Windows Central</a>, <a href="https://x.com/richontech/status/1792603950186959309">first spotted by KTLA tech reporter Rich DeMuro</a>, its Copilot program was implemented into Minecraft.</p>
<p>The demonstration, which took place during the Microsoft Surface and Windows AI event, showed off the feature as a user guide. It provided details on making an item within the game and advised the player what materials were needed.</p>
<p>Microsoft's Copilot program is an AI chatbot program that was developed and launched in 2023.</p>
<p>It's unknown when the tech firm will roll out the functionality in Minecraft to the public and when it will be added to other titles.</p>
<p>In January 2023, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-plans-to-add-ai-capabilities-into-every-product">the company aims to incorporate artificial intelligence into all its products</a>.</p>
<p>During this year's DICE in February, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-ais-influence-and-future-are-unwritten">Xbox's Haiyan Zhang discussed AI's influence on gaming</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/wow-mop-remix-goat-farming-guide-wow-remix-mists-of-pandaria/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=wow-mop-remix-goat-farming-guide-wow-remix-mists-of-pandaria<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="345" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Even though the Frog farming method in <em>WoW Remix: Mists of Pandaria</em> was recently nerfed, there is a new Goat farming method that while not as good, is pretty close. We’ve put together a <em>WoW MoP Remix</em> Goat Farming Guide to show you exactly how you can farm the bleating beasts for some quick experience, Bronze, and event-specific rewards.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Blizzard</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-wow-remix-mists-of-pandaria-goat-farming-guide" data-injectable="false"><em>WoW Remix: Mists of Pandaria</em> Goat Farming Guide</h2> <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="740" data-injectable="true">The best way to farm Bronze, experience, Lesser Charms, Scrolls, and other items exclusive to the <em>WoW Remix: Mists of Pandaria</em> event is to farm Goats in the Valley of the Four Winds. As long as you have a full group clearing out the plateau of Goats, they will quickly respawn allowing you to mass farm the Goats in this area for a ton of rewards. Here is the best method and guide on how to successfully do the Goat Farm in <em>WoW Remix: MoP</em>:</p>
 <ol data-found-items="6" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false"> <li>Log in to a Level 37+ <em>WoW Remix: Mists of Pandaria</em> specific character. (Level 70 is recommended)</li> <li>Head to the plateau just west of The Heartland in Valley of the Four Winds.</li> <li>Check Group Finder for a group labeled ‘Goat Farm’ or start your own.</li> <li>Once in a group, fly up and down the plateau killing the groups of Goats as they spawn in.</li> <li>Loot them using AoE Loot to get all the Bronze, Scrolls, and Lesser Charms.</li> <li>Repeat! This is better in a group because it will constantly clear out the plateau quicker, forcing faster respawns.</li> </ol> <figure data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-where-to-farm-goats-in-wow-remix-mop" data-injectable="false">Where to farm Goats in <em>WoW Remix: MoP</em></h2> <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false">Thankfully, it’s easy to get to the right place to farm Goats in <em>WoW Remix: Mists of Pandaria</em>. Simply head down to Valley of the Four Winds, then look for the big raised elevation plateau on the map in the western part of the zone. The plateau is just to the west of The Heartland, as you can see circled in red in the map above.</p> <p data-characters="143" data-current-count="478" data-injectable="false">Up and down the entire plateau is where the Goats will continually spawn, so just fly up and down it farming the groups of Goats as they spawn!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-warframe-lander-abilities-ranked-from-worst-to-best.876645/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/all-warframe-lander-abilities-ranked-from-worst-to-best/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=all-warframe-lander-abilities-ranked-from-worst-to-best<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="423" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The trusty <em>Warframe</em> lander, or landing craft, is an iconic part of the game. From last-minute rescues in story cutscenes to the dancing landers across the loading screen, these little ships get us where we need to go. If you activate an air support charge during a mission, you’ll get to use one of the special abilities that comes through unlocking the different landers, though can use it with any lander model you own.</p> <p data-characters="158" data-current-count="158" data-injectable="false">Sadly, some of these are more valuable than others, so we’re here today to rank the currently available lander air support abilities from worst to best.</p> <h2 id="h-7-carpet-bomb-scimitar" data-injectable="false"><strong>7.&nbsp;Carpet Bomb – Scimitar</strong></h2> <p data-characters="524" data-current-count="682" data-injectable="true">This ability sends out a line of explosions that deal impact damage between the player and the air support charge. It’s fiddly to place and the damage is underwhelming against anything but the very weakest enemies. This was one of the earliest landing craft introduced, and it shows. It’s a shame, because visually-speaking it’s one of the best: it has a gorgeous manta ray design, but it’s also frustratingly hard to get parts for. Definitely not worth it right now, unless you’re a collector.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>6.&nbsp;Sentry Gun – Xiphos</strong></h2> <p data-characters="383" data-current-count="383" data-injectable="false">A fixed turret is a great idea for an air support ability, but sadly this sentry gun very quickly falls behind in damage and durability, and will survive so little time that it’s barely worth getting out of the box. While you can buff its damage output with Roar, this lander is only worth getting if you like its aesthetics, and then you should definitely replace its ability.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>5.&nbsp;Dreamers – Nightwave</strong></h2> <p data-characters="436" data-current-count="819" data-injectable="true">It breaks my heart to put this so low, because I love Nora Nightwave, but this lander is pretty middle of the road. With Dreamers, Nora unleashes a 10-meter-wide wave of sleep and deals a very small amount of damage. While this only lasts 20 seconds, you can target enemies with finishers in that time, but you would probably get more out of Rest &amp; Rage instead. This is one of my absolute favorite landers in terms of look, though.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Why yes, I did try to match my Mantis colour scheme to Poe Dameron’s X-Wing, why do you ask? Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>4. Med-Tower – Mantis</strong></h2> <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="658" data-injectable="true">The Med-Tower is the top of the middling options for me, as it provides a tower that sends out an area burst of healing and can be used 25 times. While the healing itself isn’t much, it can be useful in specific circumstances and provides an ongoing benefit. The Mantis is also a very pretty ship, so keep an eye out for the parts if you like its look.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>3.&nbsp;Override – Liset</strong></h2> <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false">The Liset is the starting lander, so it’s lucky that it also has the strongest ability of the older ships. Override stops alarms and lockdowns across the entire map instantly, and on top of that it pauses the countdowns on Rescue and Spy missions. It can be a real Hail Mary if you are bad at Spy and Rescue missions, as I am, but it does outlive its usefulness as you get better at the game.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>2. Kahl Beacon – Skaut</strong></h2> <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="800" data-injectable="true">Who doesn’t love Kahl-175 and his underdog buddies? With the Skaut lander ability, you can bring them along for the ride! While they might only stick around for five minutes, bringing in support from this ragtag band is both fun and rewarding. You can augment them with Roar or Wisp’s reservoirs and they scale with the mission’s starting level. They’re generally a great bunch of lads.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false"><strong>1. Orokin Eye – Parallax</strong></h2> <p data-characters="485" data-current-count="485" data-injectable="true">At the top of the list, Orokin Eye removes the busywork from collectibles, statues and syndicate medallions, as it highlights certain rare resources within a 150-meter radius. Unlike the Golden Instinct Helminth ability, the markers from Orokin Eye persist until all players have interacted with them or they have been removed from the map. The only tragedies of this fantastic ability are that it doesn’t recharge fast enough and that it doesn’t highlight resource caches.</p>
 <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="261" data-injectable="false">An extra tip when using air support abilities is that you’ll want to level up the Engineering Intrinsic on your Railjack to level 2, which reduces the cooldown for your air support charges from 10 minutes to 5. Particularly important for endless missions!</p>

<p>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 developer Ninja Theory has reportedly already had its next game greenlit, which is in addition to Project Mara, which was first announced in 2020.</p>



<p>The report comes from Jez Corden at <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/making-video-games-is-difficult-ninja-theory-studio-head-talks-at-the-fore-of-senuas-saga-hellblade-2s-xbox-and-pc-launch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WindowsCentral</a> and is seemingly in response to people misinterpreting the studio’s latest <a href="https://x.com/NinjaTheory/status/1792601275550302264" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter post</a>, in which Ninja Theory studio head Dom Matthews thanks fans.</p>



<p>“Making video games is difficult. Much like Senua, we as a team have been guided by a conviction to achieve our quest: To make a game that sinks you deep into Senua’s world and to take you on a journey that leaves you thinking and feeling,” a part of the message read. </p>



<p>In a time of industry mass layoffs and uncertainty, it’s not difficult to see why some people came to the conclusion that the message felt like a goodbye. However, Corden reports that this is nothing more than a warm message from the studio head and that, according to their sources, their next game has been greenlit. Corden reiterates that the greenlit project is in addition to Project Mara, which was first announced in 2020.</p>



<p>It’s anyone’s guess what the new game entails, but for now, we have Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 to look forward to, which releases on May 21, 2024, on Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>



<p>What do you think Ninja Theory’s next project is? And are you looking forward to Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

<p>If you’re like us, you probably enjoy playing through a tough-as-nails game, sitting back for a minute or two, and then diving straight into a second playthrough. But it’s better when a game offers New Game Plus. With that said, does Black Myth: Wukong offer New Game Plus?</p>



<h2 id="h-will-black-myth-wukong-have-new-game-plus">Will Black Myth: Wukong Have New Game Plus?</h2>



<p>Yes! The studio recently confirmed that, alongside boasting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-features-160-enemy-types-80-bosses-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a staggering number of unique enemies and bosses</a>, Black Myth: Wukong features New Game Plus at launch. You won’t have to wait for a content update sometime in the future to enjoy a second run with a more powerful Sun Wukong. </p>



<p>However, it’s unclear precisely what transfers over from your initial playthrough to a second playthrough. You’ll likely retain your skills and level if the game offers RPG-like progression, but as is common in most other New Game+ game modes, we’ll likely lose all equipment. But for now, we have to bide our time and patiently wait for additional word from the developers!</p>







<h2 id="h-is-black-myth-wukong-a-soulslike">Is Black Myth: Wukong a Soulslike?</h2>



<p>In many ways, Black Myth: Wukong is a Soulslike. However, the studio is on record saying it’s easier than your typical Soulsborne game. As such, we’ll likely find a far more accessible yet still challenging and rewarding gameplay experience. From the combat gameplay we’ve watched, it appears fast-paced, fluid, and complex, with various boss fight mechanics at play.</p>



<p>If you consider clearing enemies from a zone, then everything culminating in a challenging boss fight, then yeah, Black Myth: Wukong is Soulslike. I think it’ll have more in common with Elden Ring, which still offered brutal gameplay, especially with its many bosses, but felt more accessible overall.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/is-v-rising-cross-platform-answered/</link>

<p>Following its official launch out of Early Access, V Rising is taking the survival gaming world by storm. It’s an exceptional top-down action-RPG with castle-building, boss fights, and countless unique vampiric powers and lands to explore. But people on console deserve this experience, too. So, is V Rising cross platform?</p>



<h2 id="h-does-v-rising-have-cross-platform-support">Does V Rising Have Cross Platform Support?</h2>



<p>As developer Stunlock Studios only recently announced the game’s coming to PlayStation 5, they’ve unfortunately received little in the way of crossplay or cross-platform support for V Rising.</p>



<p>In fact, it’s likely not a priority whatsoever. Of course, that’s not to say it won’t happen. They’ll likely work behind the scenes to improve the console experience, tweaking balancing and controls to suit a controller and ultimately adding in highly-requested features—for instance, cross-platform support!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-systems-is-v-rising-available-on">What Systems Is V Rising Available On?</h2>



<p>Currently, you can only play V Rising on PC. Specifically, it’s available on Steam. However, the studio recently unveiled the PlayStation 5 version in June but didn’t state whether the Xbox Series X|S will receive the game soon.</p>



<p>So, as to the question about V Rising on Xbox, it’s not happening…yet. Unless developer Stunlock Studios signed an exclusivity agreement with PlayStation, the Xbox port will likely happen eventually—perhaps by this Fall. We’ll have to wait and see!</p>

                <p>Stellar Blade developer Shift Up is currently considering a PC port of the game, as well as a sequel.</p><p>According to a public offering <a href="https://dart.fss.or.kr/dsaf001/main.do?rcpNo=20240520000263" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">filing</a> on the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (translated by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/05/shift-up-considering-stellar-blade-pc-version-and-sequel-cross-platform-project-code-named-project-witches" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gematsu</a>), Shift Up mentions the potential of AAA console games like God of War and Final Fantasy. The developer says that these AAA games can evolve into franchises through a series of high-quality sequels, and as a result, are exploring the possibility of porting Stellar Blade to PC and exploring a sequel. Shift Up also once again mentions that Stellar Blade will receive more post-launch updates and DLC.</p><p>The developer is working on a new project as too, called Project Witches. It's due out in 2027 or later and is described as a "next-generation mega subculture" similar to that of MiHoYo's Genshin Impact and Honkai Star Rail. It's also intended to be a multi-platform release across console, PC, and mobile.</p><p>Stellar Blade was released on April 26 for PS5. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/stellar-blade-review/2300-6463945/" data-ref-id="2300-6463945">Stellar Blade review</a>, we said, "I came away from Stellar Blade having enjoyed the game quite a bit despite its foibles on the back of its incredibly strong systems."</p>

            <p>
Geography of Robots - the developer behind 2022's acclaimed narrative adventure Norco - has revealed its new project, Silenus, and there's an "experimental" <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2927440/Silenus/">Steam demo</a> to try right now.
</p>
<p>
Silenus is described as a "micro-adventure" - lasting 2-2.5 hours - set on a Gulf Flow oil refinery recently acquired by Rubens Link, an "enigmatic company with an unclear agenda". Cast as an android called Titian, players must investigate the company's true motives - which seems to go beyond installing automation tech as it claims - by solving puzzles, deciphering clues, conversing with characters, and poking around the remains of vanished workers.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2927440/Silenus/">newly released demo version of Silenus</a> is officially known as the Umbilical Pre-Release demo, and it's been created in collaboration with Baton Rouge doom metal band Thou to help promote its new album. "Thou composed material for our 2022 release Norco," Geography of Robots explains in an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2927440/view/6009568738060250964?l=english">FAQ accompanying the demo</a>, "and we decided to extend this collaboration to help draw attention to their upcoming album release Umbilical."
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">A demo of our short adventure game Silenus is OUT NOW on Steam. Investigate a refinery operated by an obscure organization. Unlock all tracks from Thou's upcoming album Umbilical. This is a very small taste with more to come, so be sure to wishlist! 🔗 below. <a href="https://t.co/oyymxEXfWw">pic.twitter.com/oyymxEXfWw</a></p>— geographyofrobots (@roboticgeo) <a href="https://twitter.com/roboticgeo/status/1792555607175598587?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
In the portion of Silenus available in the demo, players can unlock and listen to all the tracks from Umbilical, but the studio notes the game itself is "likely to change [a lot]" between now and release. "Many elements of the demo were designed with the Umbilical listening feature in mind," it explains. "These will likely be removed or reworked. Some narrative details will remain the same while others will change. However, the overall themes, aesthetics, and gameplay will be largely the same."
</p>
<p>
Silenus' demo is compatible with Mac, Steam Deck, and controllers but is only available for a limited time. Thou's album launches on 31st May, and Geography of Robots plans to keep the demo available "for 2 - 3 weeks following this release."
</p>
<p>
The developer say it hopes to complete the full version of Silenus "by the end of 2024". And if you've yet to experience the studio's previous project, Norco - which Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell called a "beautiful, surprising, human, and utterly magnetic debut" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/norco-review">his Recommended review</a> - it's currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1221250/NORCO/">discounted by 60 percent</a> on Steam.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24160895/i-saw-the-tv-glow-ending-explained-interpretation<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="QdE6vB"><em>I Saw the TV Glow</em> has the kind of ending that sends people running to the internet looking for explainers and conversation — not because they didn’t understand it, exactly, but because they don’t necessarily believe what they just saw. Jane Schoenbrun’s follow-up to 2022’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23027388/were-all-going-to-the-worlds-fair-review"><em>We’re All Going to the World’s Fair</em></a> is a dark movie: dark in the visuals, since so much of it takes place in queasy late-night spaces and dim, muddy interiors, and dark in the narrative specifics, which are not designed to comfort or coddle the viewers. This is not a feel-good film with a pat, heartwarming ending.</p>
<p id="WXJu9A">But it is a film that seems designed to get under viewers’ skins, and leave them examining their lives and their choices. Schoenbrun invites people to take any lingering discomfort that comes out of the end of the movie, and go do something with it. It’s a call to action, though what exactly “action” means is left wide open. Schoenbrun has a specific intention in mind, but the metaphor here is also broad enough that anyone watching this movie can wrap it tightly around their own lives and their own bodies until it fits for them.</p>

<p id="P1GVcB">The movie follows many years in the life of Owen (Ian Foreman in his younger years, Justice Smith thereafter), a hesitant, socially awkward kid who clearly struggles to relate to other people, at school and at home. When he meets hostile, disconnected Maddy (Brigette Lundy-Paine), he manages a tentative connection with her by sharing her fandom for a late-night TV show about teenagers Isabel and Tara, who fight the world’s darkest, most evil forces with their powerful psychic connection. (The show, <em>The Pink Opaque</em>, was inspired in part by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24153069/i-saw-tv-glow-amber-benson-cameo-fixing-buffy-vampire-slayer">Schoenbrun’s childhood obsession with <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em></a>.)</p>
<p id="NVDj3w">Eventually, Maddy runs away from home and disappears without a trace, while Owen trudges from high school to early adulthood without shedding any of his adolescent awkwardness. Maddy returns eight years later to tell him she’s been inside the show — from her perspective, Owen and Maddy <em>are</em> Isabel and Tara in <em>The Pink Opaque</em>, but they were captured by their enemies and buried alive, their hearts cut out and stuffed in a refrigerator. </p>
<p id="74cb0h">Maddy says she escaped and rediscovered her true identity as Tara, but back in the real world, where time runs differently, Isabel is still buried, and the vision she’s been forced into — the false identity as Owen — will soon end when they both die. Maddy wants Owen to accept this, and go through the dangerous, deadly-sounding ritual she endured to wake herself up.</p>

<p id="4rldBS">For viewers, Maddy’s version of reality is likely to sound much more compelling than Owen’s. It’s a classic escapist fantasy: “This boring life we’re living isn’t real. We’re actually heroes from another world, with superpowers, and a mission to save the world.” But the route to get there is so dark and frightening — Maddy literally wants Owen to let her seal him in a coffin and bury him alive — that he rejects it and resists her. And that’s understandable, too. Maddy’s story could also be interpreted as a dangerous, paranoid delusion, and her solution sounds potentially fatal. Schoenbrun doesn’t pull punches about this particular call to adventure: There’s no clear evidence that Maddy isn’t unintentionally luring Owen into joint suicide. There’s no overt evidence that anything she’s saying is true.</p>
<p id="gukTwo">Schoenbrun has been clear about <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158543/i-saw-tv-glow-jane-schoenbrun-interview">seeing all of this as a trans coming-out story</a>. Within the <em>Pink Opaque</em> narrative, Owen’s authentic self is female. He has periodic visions or dreams, quick flashes where he’s in the <em>Pink Opaque</em> setting as himself, but wearing Isabel’s dress. Maddy wants to take him on a journey to find his real body and his true identity as Isabel, but the path to get there will be painful and take real commitment.</p>
<p id="M3Ffwk">Owen recoils from it, refuses to accept Maddy’s revelations, and chooses to stay in his old life. Even though the <em>Pink Opaque </em>narrative haunts him, he takes the passive route, muddling through his existing life and claiming that it’s gratifying, that he’s found peace, family, and contentment there.</p>
<p id="17U07Q">Ahead of the movie’s wide release, Schoenbrun <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158543/i-saw-tv-glow-jane-schoenbrun-interview">talked to Polygon about that kind of passivity</a>, and about feeling it’s a familiar part of the trans experience:</p>
<blockquote><p id="2hPfen">I think that kind of “passivity” feels inherently tied to an experience that I — and I think many other trans folks — can relate to on a deeply visceral level. It indicates exactly how our ideas about what proper narrative or progress is is not only woefully limited in the experiences it’s showing, but also like maybe by definition, masculine and cis. [It’s] reflective of an idea of agency and individual agency that doesn’t resonate with other experiences, like my own. And so I am trying to rewrite or call into question or challenge or simply just like, exist within alternative ideas of narrative structure, to express something that feels emotionally truthful to my experience in the world.</p></blockquote>
<p id="reStUX">Schoenbrun clearly feels sympathy for Owen’s dilemma, and for his uncertainty about redefining himself as someone else. At the same time, though, the director repeatedly suggests that Owen is lying to himself. While he defends himself to the audience by saying he built a family of his own and that he loves them, we never see them or hear any details about them. They never seem real, and even their existence might be a hallucination or an outright lie. As Owen continues to reject Maddy’s version of the truth, years blur by for him, with no sense of grounding or connection in the reality he’s chosen.</p>

</p>
<p id="PlvtXr">Toward the end of the movie, he’s clearly stuck in an unsatisfying place in life, surrounded by unpleasant people and working at an unfulfilling job. In two of the movie’s most vividly painful moments, he screams that he’s dying and he pleads for help, but no one around him hears him or sees his distress. Then he cuts his own chest open, and sees the staticky glow of the TV screen inside. As Schoenbrun <a href="https://ew.com/i-saw-the-tv-glow-director-jane-schoenbrun-explains-ending-justice-smith-brigette-lundy-paine-8643442">explained it to Entertainment Weekly</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="hgRVEB">After half a lifetime of resistance, when Owen finally sees that glow inside himself — and to do so, he literally has to open himself up and see the heart that’s been taken from him, and see that it’s been replaced by this signal that could be something beautiful, but also carries the ambivalence and sinister nature of the emptiness of glow; the thing that it is representing what isn’t there inside him. This was my attempt to capture the ambivalence and overwhelming joy and possibility, but also things that feel sinister and terrifying about an egg crack — the moment when, as a queer or trans person, you understand that you aren’t yourself and that you need to become something else to conjure that magic that was maybe there in childhood and maybe there in these other moments in life.</p></blockquote>
<p id="2aj3SK">Even faced with this visible, obvious sign that his chosen mundane reality has cracks in it, though, Owen still doesn’t take that next step. He closes up his chest and goes back to his work in a shrill, dark, oppressive arcade — and he humbly apologizes to everyone he encounters, embarrassed about that outburst that no one else saw, remembers, or cares about.</p>
<p id="OLaMCA">It’s a horrifying sequence: He’s living out a series of intense private agonies and doubts, and instead of giving those doubts space, he’s muffling them for the sake of all the utterly indifferent people around him. Instead of examining the source of his terror and trying to find a solution, he begs for forgiveness from absolute strangers, out of anxiety that his impending death might have impinged on their fun. It’s hard to say which is more horrifying: his humility and humiliation, or everyone else’s apathy and inability to even see his pain. </p>

</p>
<p id="xNccXd">It’s a dark, sad ending — there is no rescue coming for Owen, no sudden breakthrough where Maddy saves him in spite of himself, or where the world of <em>The Pink Opaque </em>sends him even clearer proof that he’s on the wrong track and needs to reverse course. The message is clear enough: No one can force Owen to find his own identity or his own satisfaction in life. No one can make his choices for him, or tell him who he really is.</p>
<p id="nsFT6o">But while the ending is heavy and painful for Owen — and, if we accept Maddy’s version of events, for Isabel — it has a clear purpose beyond scaring, startling, and saddening viewers. It’s a reminder that not making choices is a form of choice — one we have to live with, one that has consequences. It’s a vibrant call to action, and a warning about how passivity and fear can be their own kind of living death. Watching Owen “decay,” <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23922584">as Schoenbrun puts it</a>, is tragic and alarming — and seemingly meant to show viewers the repercussions of holding still in their lives, of refusing to confront or examine their own questions about themselves. Owen isn’t a classic hero, he’s a cautionary tale about self-repression.</p>
<p id="9Yz1u5">Does that mean <em>The Pink Opaque</em> is real, Isabel is real, Owen is trans, and there’s only one possible way forward for him that doesn’t lead to suffocation and death? Not necessarily. Schoenbrun doesn’t leave him another obvious way out of his oppressive life, but given that he never seems to seek one, or to discuss his feelings of unreality and emptiness with anyone but Maddy, it seems that his inertia and willingness to live in apologetic misery are the problems, not just his refusal to be buried alive. He’s afraid to even explore his feelings with Maddy herself, both as a young man and an old one. He finds it safer to be stuck — and to be baffled, sad, and lonely — than to take action. And Schoenbrun shows us all the consequences of that decision. </p>
<p id="AKdrLz">That metaphor certainly isn’t limited to coming out as queer, or trans. Schoenbrun is reflecting a personal experience and a personal feeling, one that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24132301/trans-movies-2024-i-saw-tv-glow-peoples-joker-t-blockers-essay">some trans viewers certainly identify with</a>. But Owen’s withering, shrinking life is a memorable image for anyone facing similar questions about who they are, who they want to be, and whether they can find a way to that future by exploring their options and choosing change. His story doesn’t ever find a happy ending. But it’s an emotional, heartfelt plea to anyone watching <em>I Saw the TV Glow </em>to go do the frightening work of seeking out one for themselves. </p>

Season 4 begins on May 29 but there are no concrete details on when the <em>Gundam</em> bundles will become available in game. When they do arrive, they will come in the form of three special packs. Combined, the packs give players access to Operator Skins for three iconic suits from the franchise: the RX-78-2, MS-06S Zaku II, and XVX-016 Gundam Aerial. It’s a nice collection of old and new models from the franchise, but I think they should’ve gone wild and made an Operator Skin for iconic antagonist Char Aznable. He’s just a guy in a funny outfit and I want to see him go wild with a machine gun. </p><p><strong>Buy <em>Modern Warfare III:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CH17YLNC/ref=twister_B0CKT9MSMB?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-warzone-gundam-crossover-1851489124&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0CH17YLNC" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/ckYcGZuneYL&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/ckYcGZuneYL" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fproducts%2Fcall-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-cross-gen-bundle---xbox-series-x-and-xbox-one%2F399115.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=xzXATABADTI&amp;mid=24348&amp;u1=KT-&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamestop.com%2Fvideo-games%2Fproducts%2Fcall-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-cross-gen-bundle---xbox-series-x-and-xbox-one%2F399115.html" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">GameStop</a></span></p><figure id="" data-id="d78fd50f648f65e8bc17d336d8a97b04" data-recommend-id="image://d78fd50f648f65e8bc17d336d8a97b04" data-format="jpg" data-width="1695" data-height="954" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three giant robots pose over Earth" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Three giant robots pose over Earth" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d78fd50f648f65e8bc17d336d8a97b04" data-recommend-id="image://d78fd50f648f65e8bc17d336d8a97b04" data-format="jpg" data-width="1695" data-height="954" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three giant robots pose over Earth" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The packs will also include special death effects, emblems, charms, decals, and more goodies.

<p>Microsoft held its major Surface and AI event on Monday. While it wasn’t livestreamed for people to watch, there <a href="https://x.com/richontech/status/1792603950186959309" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is information coming out</a> that pertains to Microsoft’s Copilot and video games.</p>



<p>Microsoft revealed that it will begin working to add Copilot directly into its games. The game shown as an example was Minecraft that will let players use AI to ask if you have the right materials to craft an item. In this instance, the item was a sword.</p>



<p>Copilot then searches the inventory for the materials and tells you if you can make your sword or not.</p>



<p>“You’ve got some sticks, perfect for the sword’s handle,” the Copilot said. “But it looks like you’re missing the material for the blade. You can use wood, stone, iron, gold, or diamond.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While it’s unknown when these features will be added to games like Minecraft or what other games will take advantage of the ability, it’s clear that Microsoft has its sight set on guides and tutorials for gamers. This implementation could go a long way in making the ways of looking up walkthroughs a thing of the past.</p>



<p>How much it’ll be adopted, however, we’ll have to wait and see.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/what-a-community-led-shift-to-independent-fan-wikis-means-for-game-developers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Since the game industry’s early days, players have long relied on guides to help them progress in their favorite games. Developers do everything possible to deliver the needed information in a game itself, but many players inevitably turn to third-party resources.&nbsp;Publishers like Penguin Random House subsidiary Prima Games sold game guides sometimes </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/10-things-you-didn-t-know-about-the-star-wars-x-wing-series">in collaboration with the developers themselves</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company couldn’t overcome the growth of the online guides ecosystem, which has grown from the player-created guides of GameFAQs to a host of websites and wikis answering every possible question a player might need after a quick Google search. It folded in 2018.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But online guides are beginning to eat themselves alive too. Content farms with loose plagiarism policies have gamed search engine optimization methods to supersede reliable sites in the search results of platforms like Google. Some use sponsored listings to make money, not reliability, as the means of attracting advertising eyeballs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even worse, some turn to generative AI tools to just spam seemingly useful information, accuracy be damned.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The degrading resources are beginning to have an impact on game communities. Some—like the organizers of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hollow Knight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Wiki hosted on Fandom—are taking dramatic steps to preserve these vital player-led resources. It’s a noteworthy shift that could change the future of video game communities, and how developers interact with them.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What is driving players to form independent wikis?">What is driving players to form independent wikis?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fandom hosts more than a quarter million Wikis, which are walkthroughs or guides to help players get through or get the most out of games. Because of its size, it holds a large amount of influence over pop culture and is often first in a google search for the given game or property.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Wikis, also known as FAQs, are public pages, fully editable by anyone with an account. As Maws, a wiki writer, put it, “If I write a section for Dream Nail (an ability in Hollow Knight’s wiki page) I’m not entitled to it. Anyone could walk in, wipe the slate, and write something better than that afterwards.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s a communal process that ensures a competent end result, but like many passion projects that garner enough attention, the site the wiki writers had spent so much time on changed irrevocably when it was bought up by a private equity firm.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fandom was first formed as Wikicities in 2004, and took on its current name in 2016 after being acquired by former AOL CEO Jon Miller, backed by private equity firm TPG Capital.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The for-profit model under private equity led to some very unpopular decisions for many community creators. Some, like the organizers of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Terraria</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Legend of Zelda, Fallout and Minecraft wikis left the platform and changed domains.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After TPG Capital took over, the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hollow Knight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> wiki contributors saw their wiki’s quality decline as new restrictions were put in place, limiting their ability to fix issues the site itself was creating. “We tolerated it for so long because initially there was listening and feedback,” said “Zigmatism,” a wiki writer for the Hollow Knight community who asked to be referred to by their nickname.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Before all of this, [Fandom] was *the* place for hosting a wiki if you didn’t have the resources to go independent.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many community editors decamped from the site after the unusually-named “</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-grimace-wiki-ad-happy-meal-fandom-history-1850552640">The Grimace Incident</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">” where Fandom removed an entire community-generated page on McDonald’s B-tier mascot Grimace and replaced it with an ad for its Grimace-themed milkshake, “the Grimace Shake,” which had a brief viral moment in 2023.</span></p><p>Image via Fandom.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“I can add [the content] back, but what’s the point if they’re paying a dude to undo it?” contributor Nathan Steinmetz said on X (formerly Twitter). His work had been wiped away by the advertising campaign. “It sets a bad precedent when any IP holder can approach Fandom and have user content suppressed and released with an ad.”</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The ">The <span>Hollow Knight</span> wiki editors departed after an AI invasion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eventually, the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hollow Knight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> community decided to join the exodus. Their complaints included a poor user interface and aggressive ads. In a post titled “</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://hollowknight.fandom.com/wiki/Hollow_Knight_Wiki:Moving_from_Fandom">Moving from Fandom</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">,” the Hollow Knight contributors stated that the last straw was the “Quick Answers” feature, which used generative AI to ask and answer user questions. The tool was reportedly full of grammatical errors and pulled answers from unrelated pages. Community editors were initially unable to edit or remove the tool if they so desired.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The feature was pulled within 24 hours due to the backlash and is now optional for editors to use, instead of mandatory. But the damage was done.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Youtube creator Mossbag spotlighted the turmoil in his video, “</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/qcfuA_UAz3I?si=SDjXZ2BK3h25-krm">Stop Using Fandom</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">,” documenting that readers would be interrupted by links to articles from Fandom sibling organizations GameSpot and ScreenJunkies and be asked to take part in surveys, “creating a distracting, frustrating and slow experience for editors and readers alike.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Zigmatism was sour on how companies like Fandom intend to use AI tools, saying they seemed designed to replace artists and writers instead of automating backbreaking labor.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Maws noted that it’s the reason for Quick Answers that bothers him: “(It was created) for Fandom to get additional revenue. It’s not just that the human element in “writing” is erased. It’s seemingly as if the only human element is from the guy who turns that feature on, and that’s that.”</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="“Forking away” from Fandom">“Forking away” from Fandom</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With all this going on, it's no surprise that many communities would want to "fork away" from Fandom, migrating all their work to alternate platforms. In the aforementioned explanatory post, the Hollow Knight contributors wrote that they felt very little control over the content they created, stating, "Fandom does not care about the effort put into content, and will erase hours of work without a second thought."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The situation has improved, “raising the satisfaction level to what it should be,” according to Zigmatism, who also noted that would not have been possible without the immediate outrage and the threat to the company’s bottom line.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“I know [after multiple Wikis branched], Fandom went into a kind of all-hands-on-deck mode, listening to [and polling] editors and making some good changes overall,” he said. But he still believes independent, fan-hosted wikis are a better fit for developers looking to get involved, which tend to be a little more flexible and less profit-oriented.</span></p><p>Image via Team Cherry.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Any time a passionate group working on a project gains enough traction, there’s the possibility of it being bought up or monetized. That, in turn, carries the risk of degrading whatever made the original special, and in worst-case scenarios, key parts can get chopped off to be sold later.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I love archiving knowledge, and I love promoting people's hard work," Zigmatism said, when discussing the new </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://hollowknight.wiki/w/Hollow_Knight_Wiki">Hollow Knight wiki</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "Wikis are a perfect mix of those two drives."&nbsp; "You can tell people actually care about what they're doing in (the new Hollow Knight) Wiki," added Maws.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There’s good reason for developers to be aware of this growing shift. Josh Zimmerman, a professor and community engagement consultant from the University of Arizona, explained to Game Developer via email that accurate, well-functioning, fan-hosted Wikis reinforce player loyalty in games through what he described as “fannish performance.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He added that such projects can also serve as archives for games no longer in circulation or who are not playable in their original states thanks to years of bugfixes and content additions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The experience of poor wiki tech on larger sites may drive away fans who are otherwise passionate about learning the intricacies of a game. Given the depth of work that goes into chronicling the ins and outs of a title, developers should be aware that players are becoming so frustrated they jump ship for a homebrewed platform.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It could get worse. If maintaining fan wikis becomes too arduous, fans might abandon the communities around their favorite games entirely.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="210" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Modern Warfare 3 </em>players have plenty to be excited about for the upcoming season, as the update introduces new maps, modes, killstreaks, and equipment items. Here is everything you need to know about Season 4. </p> <p data-characters="459" data-current-count="459" data-injectable="true">Sledgehammer Games has consistently delivered a healthy dose of content for each seasonal update. After launching with 20 6v6 maps in November 2023, that count is now up to 33, with three more coming throughout Season 4. On top of that, a consistent offering of new game modes, events, and features makes it a great time to be a multiplayer fan. Season 4 is no different, as the devs offer up a package that will give players plenty to sink their teeth into. </p>
 <h2 id="h-mw3-season-4-patch-notes" data-injectable="false">MW3 Season 4 patch notes</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Activision </figcaption></figure> <h3 data-injectable="false">Two new 6v6 maps</h3> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Tokyo</strong>: Experience Tokyo nightlife in this mid-sized Multiplayer map featuring late night shopping, entertainment, and accommodations for the weary traveler. Battle for the map’s major power positions, the Hotel and Manga buildings facing one another over the main road. Except for these two locations, the fight stays on ground level.</li> <li><strong>Paris: </strong>Head to the City of Lights for a rendezvous with the enemy, fighting across this mid-sized map dominated by the central Police Station and Gallery. Navigate the surrounding streets to remain on ground level or take the battle to either of the two main buildings. Don’t underestimate the map’s smaller interior spaces, the Bookstore and Shop. These areas provide overhead cover in a pinch and are generally less conspicuous than the large center buildings.</li> </ul> <h3 data-injectable="false">Season 4 new game modes </h3> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Demolition</strong>: One of the finest tactical game modes in Call of Duty is finally back! Appearing for the first time since Season 3 of&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare</em>&nbsp;(2019) this round-based objective mode has similarities to Search &amp; Destroy, with teams alternating between attacking and defending two bomb sites. However, unlike S&amp;D, respawns are enabled and attacking players always spawn with a bomb, and defuses – ninja or otherwise – don’t end the round. This leads to highly tactical engagements – and pandemonium – as teams converge on bomb sites and pressure the opposition.&nbsp;</li> <li><strong>Hyper Cranked</strong>: This twisted spin on traditional Team Deathmatch gets even more frantic with this “Hyper” variant. For the uninitiated, Cranked pressures you into chaining kills, eliminating enemy opponents as often as you wish, but within a specific amount of time before a countdown reaches zero, or you’ll explode. Expect a faster reload, weapon swap, and quicker movement speed after your first kill. Points are awarded for every kill, meaning getting kills, staying alive longer, earning more points, and finally claiming victory with your team is the plan in Cranked.</li> <li><strong>&nbsp;Havoc</strong>: The action begins with the Team Deathmatch ruleset in effect, with the first team to reach 75 points awarded the win. However, Killstreaks (except those awarded with a modifier) are disabled, and a variety of match-changing modifiers come into play!</li> <li><strong>Headshots only:</strong> This team mode, played on a small moshpit of maps, is for skilled players who can demonstrate impressive aim. Using Team Deathmatch rules, augmented by the fact that only headshots count when eliminating other players; no damage is dealt, and no team score progression is possible unless your cranium-aiming is true.&nbsp;</li> </ul>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Playlist modifers </h3> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Looping Killstreaks:&nbsp;</strong>Streaks reset fully once you reach the upper end of your current streaks, allowing you to earn unlimited streaks in one life.</li> <li><strong>Earning Killstreaks:&nbsp;</strong>You receive points added to your streak if you slay an enemy player with your Killstreak, or Assist in killing a player with your Killstreak.</li> <li><strong>Killstreak Cache:&nbsp;</strong>When a player is eliminated, they drop a cache containing a percentage of their earned Killstreak progress. Grab the cache and add it to your own progress!</li> </ul> <h3 data-injectable="false">New killstreaks </h3> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>&nbsp;Intelligent Munitions Systems</strong>: The Intelligent Munitions System is loaded with smart explosives that eliminate enemy personnel and vehicles within range. When triggered, it will eject an explosive upwards, which then locks onto its target and propels it towards them.</li> <li><strong>Loitering Munition</strong>: An unmanned rocket-equipped drone loiters over the targeted areas. On each activation, the drone selects the targeted location with the largest number of viable targets to bombard with rockets. It can be activated up to three times.</li> <li><strong>Missile Drone</strong>: A small, piloted drone controlled by the player that fires guided missiles.</li> <li><strong>DNA Bomb</strong>: The discovery of a DNA Bomb Popov Power in Urzikstan is a taste of the tremendous power this brings to a Multiplayer match. The tremendous explosion can be triggered provided you’ve acquired enough consecutive kills without dying. Once you’re granted the DNA Bomb you can detonate it, eliminating all players on the opposing team. Unlike the MGB, the DNA Bomb does not conclude the match.</li> </ul> <h3 data-injectable="false">New perks and equipment</h3> <p data-characters="18" data-current-count="298" data-injectable="false"><strong>Compression Plate </strong></p> <p data-characters="203" data-current-count="501" data-injectable="true">Immediately regenerate health after a Primary, Secondary, or Throwing Knife/ Throwing Star kill. Objective captures also trigger health regeneration. An icon appears on your HUD when this Perk is active.</p>
 <p data-characters="20" data-current-count="20" data-injectable="false"><strong>Mission Control Vest</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="140" data-injectable="false"> <li>Equipment Slots (6): Tactical, Lethal, Field Upgrade, Gloves, Gear (2)</li> <li>Reduces kills required by 1 and score required by 125 for Killstreaks.</li> <li>Earn 1 kill or 125 score for every 2 Kill Assists or Cross Fire Assists <br></li> </ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/try-this-devious-dnd-pact-of-the-chain-warlock-build/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=try-this-devious-dnd-pact-of-the-chain-warlock-build<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<h4 id="h-friendship-is-magic" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Friendship is magic!</h4> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">Warlocks are one of the most customizable <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>classes, with a patron at level 1 and the actual subclass (the all-important Pact) at level 3. While patron choice has a huge impact on the flavor of your warlock, the mechanical meat of this layered and rewarding class lies in your choice of Pact.</p> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true">I’ve been using this Pact of the Chain build in my own game, and I can thoroughly recommend it! The Pacts all have their own playstyles to recommend them, and the Pact of the Chain might seem underwhelming at first glance, as wizards already get the find familiar spell. However, the warlock familiar is an entirely different animal. Quite literally.</p>
 <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true">The Pact of the Chain allows the warlock to cast the find familiar spell as any run-of-the-mill wizard can, but while most find familiar spells can only summon a fairly ordinary creature, albeit a magical version, Pact of the Chain warlocks can choose their familiar from imps, pseudodragons, quasits, and sprites instead. My personal favorite is the psuedodragon, for reasons I’ll come to soon.</p>
 <p data-characters="553" data-current-count="553" data-injectable="true">All familiars have their own initiative and can take a move and an action (such as the Help action to give the caster an advantage on their attacks against that target).&nbsp;Pact of the Chain familiars, unlike other familiars, can be commanded to attack by their pacted warlock, but the warlock must give up their own action to give their familiar an attack on the warlock’s initiative. Luckily, the Investment of the Chain Master invocation from Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything, allows you to use your bonus action to attack with your familiar.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything includes exciting new invocation options for budding warlocks. Image provided by Wizards of the Coast.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="646" data-current-count="946" data-injectable="true">The other key part of this build is that the Investment of the Chain Master means that whenever your familiar forces an enemy to make a saving throw, it uses your spell save DC instead of its usual saving throw. This is where the pseudodragon shines compared to the other familiars: its sting attack has very limited damage but forces its victim to make a Constitution saving throw using the warlock’s spell save DC for the saving throw. If the target fails the saving throw, they become poisoned for an hour, which imposes a disadvantage on all attack rolls and ability checks, and if they fail by 5 or more, they immediately fall unconscious.</p>
 <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="428" data-injectable="true">What this means in practice is that the familiar can move within 5 feet of an enemy on its turn and use the help action to give the warlock an advantage on their next attack against the target. The warlock can use their bonus action to command the pseudodragon to attack the target. The warlock then has their own standard action free to make an attack with an advantage on the target from the help action or cast another spell.</p>
 <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="405" data-injectable="true">This has some potential weaknesses: if the pseudodragon gets taken out (which did happen to my warlock’s familiar during an early adventure), your combat ability is somewhat hampered, though you still always have your spells. Luckily, Pact of the Chain warlocks can use their reaction to give their familiar resistance to the damage it just took. Look after your familiar and it will look after you!</p>
 <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="289" data-injectable="false">You can also use any familiar to deliver touch-range spell attacks on your turn with your attack modifier rather than theirs, so you may wish to consider taking the Magic Initiate feat for the Sorcerer and gain the Shocking Grasp cantrip, as Sorcerers use Charisma for their spell attacks.</p> <h4 id="h-warlock-pact-of-the-chain-build" data-injectable="false">Warlock Pact of the Chain Build</h4> <p data-characters="186" data-current-count="475" data-injectable="true"><strong>Attributes:</strong> High Charisma (vital for any Warlock — put your highest attribute score in Charisma and ideally take a species bonus to Charisma). Other attributes are very much up to you.</p>
 <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false"><strong>Patron:</strong> Patrons that provide access to spell attacks such as Scorching Ray from the Fiend or the Genie, or the Tentacle of the Deep from the Fathomless, or touch spells such as Cure Wounds from the Celestial, have slightly better synergy with this build.</p> <p data-characters="131" data-current-count="385" data-injectable="false"><strong>Invocations (level 2):</strong> Agonizing Blast and another invocation that you will replace at level 3 with Investment of the Chain Master.</p> <p data-characters="56" data-current-count="441" data-injectable="true"><strong>Pact (level 3):</strong> Pact of the Chain with the pseudodragon.</p>
 <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="310" data-injectable="false"><strong>Spells:</strong> Eldritch Blast is the real favorite here, as it is a ranged spell attack that you can use in conjunction with your familiar’s help action. For your other cantrip, Mind Sliver subtracts 1d4 from the target’s next saving throw, making them more vulnerable to your pseudodragon’s poison.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-anima-weapons-guide-every-quest-item-and-duty-required-for-heavensward-relic/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=ffxiv-anima-weapons-guide-every-quest-item-and-duty-required-for-heavensward-relic<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="234" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Anima relic weapons are, arguably, the nicest relic weapons available in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>. However, they do take one hell of a grind to acquire, and there are a lot of steps you need to go through in order to get your hands on one.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="238" data-injectable="false">That said, there are some things you can do to make life easier for yourself and this far past the <em>Heavensward</em> expansion, during which these relics became available, some of the steps can pretty much be steamrollered relatively quickly.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="195" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true">To complete your first Anima relic weapon, you’ll need to complete a total of 11 quests. We’ll go over each of these in more detail later, but for now, here’s the checklist of Anima quests:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="11" data-current-count="440" data-injectable="true"> <li>An Unexpected Proposal</li> <li>Soul Without Life</li> <li>Toughening Up</li> <li>Coming Into Its Own</li> <li>Finding Your Voice</li> <li>A Dream Fulfilled</li> <li>Future Proof</li> <li>Born Again Anima</li> <li>Body and Soul</li> <li>Words of Wisdom</li> <li>Best Friends Forever</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="239" data-current-count="239" data-injectable="false">Some of these quests are much easier to complete than others, but the overwhelming majority of them come with their own variety of grind. On the plus side, you’ll at least have an epic weapon once you’ve completed the final step.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="527" data-injectable="true">If you’re wanting to work on multiple Anima relics at one time, this is entirely possible. However, you cannot be working on the same quest for multiple relics at the same time, so you’ll need to progress one of the weapons at least one step before starting the grind for another Job.</p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-complete-an-unexpected-proposal-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to complete An Unexpected Proposal in </strong><strong><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="115" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">Before you can get to actually beginning your Anima weapon journey, you’ll need to meet a couple of requirements:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="80" data-injectable="false"> <li>Complete the level 60 MSQ quest “Heavensward”</li> <li>Reach at least level 60 on the Job you want to get an Anima relic for</li> </ul> <p data-characters="328" data-current-count="408" data-injectable="true">If you’ve done this, head to Idyllshire and go straight to Rowena (X:5.0, Y:5.1). After talking to her, she’ll send you off to Azys Lla, where you’ll need to find and talk to Ardashir (X:7.1, Y:10.9). Ardashir will be your go-to guy for all things Anima related, so you’ll soon get familiar with where to find him.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-complete-soul-without-life-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to complete Soul Without Life in </strong><strong><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="27" data-injectable="false"><strong>Relic stage: Animated&nbsp;</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="685" data-injectable="true">Speak to Ardashir in Azys Lla, and he’ll send you off to Mor Dhona to talk to Rowena. In order to complete the first ‘proper’ Anima weapon quest, you need to get your hands on one Astral Nodule and one Umbral Nodule. You’ve got a choice of which way you go about this. Both options require a bit of a grind, but let’s look at each option in detail.</p>
 <h3 id="h-complete-fates" data-injectable="false"><strong>Complete FATEs</strong></h3> <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false">Before you can get an Astral or Umbral Nodule, you’ll need to gather up six different types of Luminous Crystals. Each Crystal has a corresponding element, and each can be gained through completing FATEs in a specific <em>Heavensward</em> zone. You don’t need to complete these FATEs as the Job you’re aiming to get an Anima weapon for.</p> <p data-characters="79" data-current-count="412" data-injectable="true"><strong>The Crystals you need to create an Astral Nodule come from the following zones:</strong></p>
 <figure data-found-rows="4" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Crystal</strong></td><td><strong>Heavensward zone</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Luminous Wind Crystal</td><td>The Sea of Clouds</td></tr><tr><td>Luminous Fire Crystal</td><td>Azys Lla</td></tr><tr><td>Luminous Lightning Crystal</td><td>The Churning Mists</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="79" data-current-count="79" data-injectable="false"><strong>The Crystals you need to create an Umbral Nodule come from the following zones:</strong></p> <figure data-found-rows="4" data-current-count="539" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Crystal</strong></td><td><strong>Heavensward zone</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Luminous Ice Crystal</td><td>Coerthas Western Highlands</td></tr><tr><td>Luminous Earth Crystal</td><td>The Dravanian Forelands</td></tr><tr><td>Luminous Water Crystal</td><td>The Dravanian Hinterlands</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="253" data-injectable="false">It’s worth noting that you need to complete a FATE with a gold rating to be in with a chance of gaining a Crystal and even then, it’s far from guaranteed. You’re likely to complete a lot of FATEs before you have all of the Crystals you need.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="157" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="true">Once you’ve gathered all of your elemental Crystals, you can take them to Syndony in Mor Dhona (X:22.5, Y:5.9) and exchange them for the two Nodules.&nbsp;</p>
 <h3 id="h-trade-in-a-completed-zodiac-zeta-weapon" data-injectable="false"><strong>Trade in a completed Zodiac Zeta weapon</strong></h3> <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="253" data-injectable="false">If you’ve previously been through the mammoth grind required to get a Zodiac Zeta weapon, you do have the option to trade this in for the Astral and Umbral Nodules. To do this, simply talk to Sydony and select the option to trade a Zodiac Zeta weapon.</p> <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="534" data-injectable="true">I know this seems like a massive sacrifice after all of the hard work you put into getting the Zeta weapon, considering you’ll lose the weapon itself, but doing so will allow you to purchase replicas of every Zodiac stage weapon from Drake in North Shroud (X:30.3, Y:20.1).&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="231" data-current-count="231" data-injectable="false">You’re unlikely to be using the weapon itself, as it’s a level 50 weapon with a low iLvl, so if you’re only using it as a glamour then this option may be worthwhile to speed through this first step of your Anima weapon.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="239" data-current-count="470" data-injectable="true">Regardless of how you gained your Nodules, once you’ve got them, head back to Azys Lla and hand them over to Ardashir to complete this quest, rewarding you with your Animated Anima weapon and allowing you to pick up the next quest.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-complete-toughening-up-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to complete Toughening Up in </strong><strong><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="19" data-current-count="19" data-injectable="false"><strong>Relic stage: Awoken</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="412" data-current-count="731" data-injectable="true">Speak to Ardashir in Azys Lla again to begin the next step in the Anims journey. This stage of the Relic grind requires you to complete a long list of Dungeons with your first-stage relic equipped. Thankfully, the rest of your gear can be any iLvl and you can run the dungeons unsynced, so if you’re going back to this with a job at level 90, you’re going to speed through these dungeons without a problem.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="218" data-current-count="218" data-injectable="false">These dungeons come in three ‘waves’, with you needing to talk to Ardashir in between the ‘waves’ in order to update him on your progress. Here’s the full list of steps needed in order to complete this quest:</p> <ul data-found-items="12" data-items-injection="true" data-current-count="698" data-injectable="true"> <li data-index="0">Complete Snowcloak (Level 50)</li> <li data-index="1">Complete Sastasha (Hard) (Level 50)</li> <li data-index="2">Complete The Sunken Temple of Qarn (Hard) (Level 50)</li> <li data-index="3"><strong>Talk to Ardashir in Southern Thanalan (X:25.0, Y:12.1)</strong></li> <li data-index="4">Complete The Keeper of the Lake (Level 50)</li> <li data-index="5">Complete The Wanderer’s Palace (Hard) (Level 50)</li> <li data-index="6">Complete Amdapor Keep (Hard) (Level 50)</li> <li data-index="7"><strong>Speak to Ardashir in South Shroud (X:24.9, Y:24.1)</strong></li> <li data-index="8">Complete The Dusk Vigil (Level 51)</li> <li data-index="9">Complete Sohm Al (Level 53)</li> <li data-index="10">Complete The Aery (Level 55)</li> <li data-index="11">Complete the Vault (Level 57)</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="282" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve completed these steps, equip any other weapon for your chosen Job and make sure that your Animated weapon is in your inventory before heading back to Azys Lla. Talk to Ardashir in his usual location to complete this quest and gain the Awoken stage of your Anima relic.</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-complete-coming-into-its-own-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to complete Coming into Its Own in </strong><strong><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="18" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><strong>Relic stage: Anima</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="600" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="308" data-injectable="false">Talk to Ardashir in Azys Lla and, if this is your first Anima weapon grind, he’ll send you off to Mor Dhona to talk to Cristiana (X:21.4, Y5.4). If this isn’t your first Anima rodeo, you don’t need to talk to her again and can simply begin to hand in the items needed, which we’ll get into now.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="57" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">To complete this quest, you’ll need to get four things:</p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="525" data-injectable="true"> <li>1 Enchanted Rubber</li> <li>1 Fast-drying Carboncoat</li> <li>1 Divine Water</li> <li>1 Fast-acting Allagan Catalyst</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="182" data-current-count="182" data-injectable="false">Unfortunately, getting them is far from simple and this stage is guaranteed to take you a little while, because you need to get multiple other items to trade in for these final ones:</p> <figure data-found-rows="5" data-current-count="682" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Final item</strong></td><td><strong>Unidentifiable items</strong></td><td><strong>Crafted items</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Enchanted Rubber</td><td>10 Unidentifiable Bone</td><td>4 Adamantite Francesca</td></tr><tr><td>Fast-drying Carboncoat</td><td>10 Unidentifiable Shell</td><td>4 Titanium Alloy Mirror</td></tr><tr><td>Divine Water</td><td>10 Unidentifiable Ore</td><td>4 Dispelling Arrow</td></tr><tr><td>Fast-acting Allagan Catalyst</td><td>10 Unidentifiable Seeds</td><td>4 Kingcake</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <h3 id="h-unidentifiable-items" data-injectable="false"><strong>Unidentifiable items</strong></h3> <p data-characters="245" data-current-count="245" data-injectable="false">Thankfully, to get your hands on Unidentifiable items, you have a few options; but you’re unlikely to be able to purchase all of them in one spending spree and you’re probably going to have to grind at least a few duties to complete the set.</p> <p data-characters="276" data-current-count="521" data-injectable="true">Unidentifiable items can be purchased for 150 Tomestones of Poetics each from Auriana in Mor Dhona (X:22.0, Y:6.0) or Hismena in Idyllshire (X:5.0, Y:5.0). If you’re wanting to buy all of these Unidentifiable items with Poetics, you’ll need a total of 6,000 Poetics.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="70" data-current-count="70" data-injectable="false">Otherwise, Unidentifiable items can be obtained in the following ways:</p> <figure data-found-rows="5" data-current-count="570" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Item</strong></td><td><strong>Methods to obtain</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Unidentifiable Bone</td><td>-Tribal Quest tokens:<br>3 Steel Amalj’ok (Amalj’aa)<br>6 Vanu Whitebone (Vanu Vanu)<br>6 Black Copper Gil (Vath)<br>18 Carved Kupo Nut (Moogle)<br>-3 Precision Gordian Bolts (Alexander – The Fist of the Father)<br>-300 Allied Seals</td></tr><tr><td>Unidentifiable Shell</td><td>-Tribal Quest tokens:<br>3 Rainbowtide Psashp (Sahagin)<br>6 Vanu Whitebone (Vanu Vanu)<br>6 Black Copper Gil (Vath)<br>18 Carved Kupo Nut (Moogle)<br>-3 Precision Gordian Lens (Alexander – The Cuff of the Father)<br>-Obtained from Timeworn Wyvernskin Map</td></tr><tr><td>Unidentifiable Ore</td><td>-Tribal Quest tokens:<br>3 Titan Cobaltpiece (Kobold)<br>6 Vanu Whitebone (Vanu Vanu)<br>6 Black Copper Gil (Vath)<br>18 Carved Kupo Nut (Moogle)<br>-3 Precision Gordian Spring (Alexander – The Arm of the Father)<br>-Obtained from Timeworn Dragonskin Map</td></tr><tr><td>Unidentifiable Seeds</td><td>Tribal Quest tokens:<br>3 Sylphic Goldleaf (Sylphs)<br>6 Vanu Whitebone (Vanu Vanu)<br>6 Black Copper Gil (Vath)<br>18 Carved Kupo Nut (Moogle)<br>-3 Precision Gordian Shaft (Alexander – The Burden of the Father)<br>-300 Allied Seals</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="202" data-current-count="202" data-injectable="false">Perhaps the easiest and most time effective way to get these items is through completing the required Alexander duties ten times each, especially if you have the option to unsync them at level 90.&nbsp;</p> <h3 id="h-crafted-items" data-injectable="false"><strong>Crafted items</strong></h3> <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="598" data-injectable="true">If you don’t have a required crafting Jobs available to you, don’t panic. You can still complete this step. These items can also be purchased using Grand Company Seals, but they’re pretty expensive. Each item costs 5,000 GC Seals, so you’ll need 80,000 Seals in total. Alternatively, if you’ve got the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-make-gil-without-crafting-in-final-fantasy-xiv/">spare Gil</a>, you can purchase all of these items on the Marketboard at varying prices.</p>
 <p data-characters="64" data-current-count="64" data-injectable="false">If you want to craft these items yourself, here are the recipes:</p> <figure data-found-rows="5" data-current-count="564" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Item</strong></td><td><strong>Crafting Class</strong></td><td><strong>Recipe</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Adamantite Francesca</td><td>Blacksmith</td><td>2 Fire Clusters<br>1 Earth Cluster<br>1 Birch Lumber<br>1 Adamantite Nugget<br>1 Pterodactyl Strap</td></tr><tr><td>Titanium Alloy Mirror</td><td>Alchemist</td><td>2 Water Clusters<br>1 Lightning Cluster<br>1 Titanium Alloy Square<br>1 Holy Water<br>1 Hardsilver Sand<br>1 Vitriol</td></tr><tr><td>Dispelling Arrow</td><td>Carpenter</td><td>2 Wind Clusters<br>1 Ice Cluster<br>1 Blessed Fletchings<br>1 Hallowed Chestnut Lumber<br>1 Hardsilver Nugget</td></tr><tr><td>Kingcake</td><td>Culinarian</td><td>2 Fire Clusters<br>1 Water Cluster<br>1 Moogle Miniature<br>1 Highland Flour<br>1 Yak Milk<br>1 Okeanis Egg<br>1 Birch Syrup<br>1 Tiny Crown</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="362" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve gathered up this collection of items, you can head back to Cristiana in Mor Dhona and exchange them for the four items you need to complete this quest. Once you’ve got them, make sure the Awoken weapon is in your inventory and go back to Azys Lla. Talk to Gerolt (X:7.0, Y:11.0) to upgrade your weapon to its Anima stage and complete this step.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-complete-finding-your-voice-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to complete Finding Your Voice in </strong><strong><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="34" data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false"><strong>Relic stage: Hyperconductive Anima</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="696" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">After the grind of the previous two quests, this one isn’t actually all that bad, though you will need a rather large pile of Poetics in order to complete it. You’ll also need to complete this quest with the Anima weapon equipped. Switching Jobs will prevent you from proceeding.</p> <p data-characters="231" data-current-count="514" data-injectable="true">After speaking to Ardashir again, you’ll need to get 5 Aether Oils, which can be purchased from Hismena in Idyllshire (X:5.7, Y:5.2). Each Aether Oil costs 350 Tomestones of Poetics, so you’ll need 1,750 Poetics in total.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="233" data-injectable="false">And that’s it for this quest. Once you’ve got the Aether Oils, make sure your Anima weapon is in your inventory and head back to Azys Lla. Talk to Ardashir to finish this quest and pick up your Hyperconductive Anima weapon.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-complete-a-dream-fulfilled-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to complete A Dream Fulfilled in </strong><strong><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="32" data-current-count="265" data-injectable="false"><strong>Relic stage: Reconditioned Anima</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="565" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="432" data-injectable="true">After talking to Ardashir, head to Idyllshire to meet Ulan (X:6.4, Y:4.7), who will be your main contact during this quest. In order to help you enhance the stats (such as Critical Hit and Determination) of your weapon, Ulan needs two things – Umbrite and Crystal Sand – which can be combined to create Treated Crystal Sand. You’ll need roughly 60 of each item in order to create the 180 required Treated Crystal Sand.</p>
 <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="198" data-injectable="false">The first of these items, Umbrite, can only be obtained by purchasing it from Hismena for 75 Tomestones of Poetics each. To get the required 60 Umbrite, you’ll need a total of 4,500 Poetics.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="151" data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false">Crystal Sand, on the other hand, can be obtained through exchanging items with Ulan. Each item (or group of items) can be exchanged for 2 Crystal Sand:</p> <figure data-found-rows="12" data-current-count="1129" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Exchangeable item(s)</strong></td><td><strong>How to get</strong></td></tr><tr><td>5 Blue Crafters’ Scrip Tokens</td><td>25 White Crafters’ Scrips each (125 total)</td></tr><tr><td>5 Blue Gatherers’ Scrip Tokens</td><td>25 White Gatherers’ Scrips each (125 total)</td></tr><tr><td>1 Garlond Steel<br>1 Celestine<br>1 High Allagan Chimera Leather</td><td>– Crafted (Blacksmith, Goldsmith and Leatherworker respectively)<br>– Purchased on the Marketboard</td></tr><tr><td>1 Amber-encased Vilekin</td><td>Heavensward Levequests</td></tr><tr><td>3 Battlecraft Demimateria I<br>2 Battlecraft Demimateria II<br>3 Fieldcraft Demimateria I<br>2 Fieldcraft Demimateria II</td><td>– Desynthesis<br>– Purchased on the Marketboard</td></tr><tr><td>5 Moonstone</td><td>– Deliverance (Ixali daily quest)<br>– 4,000 GC Seals each (20,000 total)<br>– Timeworn Goatskin Map<br>– Timeworn Leather Map<br>– Purchased on the Marketboard</td></tr><tr><td>1 Inferno Horn<br>1 Crag Heart<br>1 Diamond Tear</td><td>– Level 50 Extreme Trial drops (Bowl of Embers, Navel and Akh Afah Amphitheatre)<br>– Purchased on the Marketboard</td></tr><tr><td>1 Vortex Feather<br>1 Barb of the Whorl<br>1 Large Levin Orb</td><td>– Level 50 Extreme Trials drops (Howling Eye, Whorleater, Striking Tree)<br>– Purchased on the Marketboard</td></tr><tr><td>5 Superior Enchanted Ink<br>5 Thavnairian Mist</td><td>25 Tomestones of Poetics each (125 total)<br>20 Tomestones of Poetics each (100 total)</td></tr><tr><td>5 Allagan Catalyst</td><td>– The Labyrinth of the Ancients<br>– Syrcus Tower</td></tr><tr><td>1 Unidentifiable Bone<br>1 Unidentifiable Shell<br>1 Unidentifiable Ore<br>1 Unidentifiable Seeds</td><td>Any of the methods used in the “Coming into It’s Own” quest</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="462" data-current-count="462" data-injectable="true">Once you’ve gathered all of the items (or periodically in stages, if that’s how you want to do it) talk to Ulan to create Treated Crystal Sand. You can then use this Treated Crystal Sand to modify the Stats of your weapon. Once all 180 points have been allocated, make sure your Hyperconductive Anima weapon is in your inventory and return to Azys Lla to talk to Ardashir. This will complete this quest and reward you with a Reconditioned Anima weapon.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-complete-future-proof-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to complete Future Proof in </strong><strong><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="28" data-current-count="28" data-injectable="false"><strong>Relic stage: Sharpened Anima</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="328" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="188" data-current-count="516" data-injectable="true">Talk to Ardashir, who will tell you that you need to gather 50 Singing Clusters. This quest is pretty straightforward, and thankfully there are multiple ways to get Singing Clusters.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">The first way is by purchasing them from Hismena in Idyllshire for 40 Tomestones of Poetics each. In order to get all 50 this way, you’d need 2,000 Poetics. However, to cut the cost (and the grind) there are a couple of quests which can be repeated weekly to gain Singing Clusters:</p> <figure data-found-rows="3" data-current-count="703" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Quest name</strong></td><td><strong>Quest giver &amp; location</strong></td><td><strong>Information</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Cut from a Different Cloth</td><td>Angelet<br>Idyllshire<br>(X:7.9, Y:5.8)</td><td>Complete Duty Roulette: Level 50/60/70/80 Dungeons to receive one Singing Cluster</td></tr><tr><td>Seeking Inspiration</td><td>Amphelice<br>Idyllshire<br>(X:7.9, Y:5.8)</td><td>Complete Duty Roulette: Leveling three times in order to receive 18 Singing Clusters</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="201" data-current-count="201" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve got all 50 Singing Clusters, deliver them to Blamprest in Idyllshire (X:7.9, Y:6.0), and then return to Ardashir in Azys Lla to receive your Sharpened Anima and complete this quest.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-how-to-complete-born-again-anima-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to complete Born Again Anima in </strong><strong><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="228" data-injectable="false"><strong>Relic stage: Complete Anima</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="528" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="243" data-injectable="false">After talking to Ardashir, he’ll send you off to complete three dungeons. You do not need your Sharpened Anima weapon equipped as you complete these dungeons, but you do need to complete them as the Job which you’re getting the weapon for:</p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="363" data-injectable="false"> <li>Sohm Al (Hard)</li> <li>The Great Gubal Library (Hard)</li> <li>The Lost City of Amdapor (Hard)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="707" data-injectable="true">Once you’ve done this, you’ll need to complete a side quest called “Some Assembly Required”. To do this, you’ll need to collect 15 Pneumite, which can be purchased for either 4,000 GC Seals or 100 Tomestones of Poetics each. Once you’ve done that, we can move on to the main part of this quest — Aetheric Density collection.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="337" data-injectable="false">Talk to the Verification Node and you’ll be given an Enhanced Anima Glass. You can use this at any time to check the Aetheric Density of your weapon. When you use the Glass, you’ll see a sprite surrounded by 10 glyphs and completing certain duties will reward Aetheric Density, slowly filling these glyphs and making them glow.&nbsp;</p> <h3 id="h-aetheric-density-gathering" data-injectable="false"><strong>Aetheric Density gathering</strong></h3> <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="709" data-injectable="true">Every duty that was introduced as part of the <em>Heavensward</em> expansion rewards Density, as long as it is completed while the Sharpened Anima weapon is equipped, but some offer more than others. Occasionally, you may receive a bonus amount of Density, but I wouldn’t recommend hoping for this. You’ll need to get a total of 2,000 Density in order to complete this quest.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="71" data-current-count="71" data-injectable="false">Here’s a quick rundown of all duties and how much Density they offer:</p> <figure data-found-rows="8" data-current-count="691" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Density rewarded</strong></td><td><strong>Duties</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Vague (4)</td><td>Heavensward FATEs</td></tr><tr><td>Meager (8)</td><td>The Limitless Blue (Hard or Extreme)<br>Thok ast Thok (Hard or Extreme)</td></tr><tr><td>Vigorous (16)</td><td>Containment Bay S1T7 (Extreme)<br>The Minstrel’s Ballad: Nidhogg’s Rage<br>Alexander Raids</td></tr><tr><td>Robust (32)</td><td>Heavensward Dungeons<br>A Realm Reborn level 50 Dungeons (Excluding Pratorium and Castrum Meridianum)<br>Alexander Raids (Savage 1-4)<br>Containment Bay Z1T9 (Extreme)</td></tr><tr><td>Sturdy (64)</td><td>Heavensward Alliance Raids<br>Possible bonus from anything which offers Robust Density</td></tr><tr><td>Hardened (96)</td><td>Alexander Raids (Savage 9-12)</td></tr><tr><td>Stalwart (128)</td><td>Possible bonus from Alexander Raids (Savage 9-12)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="206" data-current-count="206" data-injectable="false">The easiest and quickest way to gather Density is through completing Alexander – The Eyes of the Creator (Savage), also called A9S, 21 times (or less if you’re lucky enough to get a Stalwart bonus).</p> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="575" data-injectable="true">Once you’ve completed this step, head back to Azys Lla and talk to Gerolt to complete this quest and obtain your Complete Anima weapon. But don’t celebrate yet. You’re not finished. Yes, you have the ‘complete’ Anima weapon, but there’s one more stage which turns your weapon into the Lux variant. Does it help if I tell you that you get a cute minion, too?</p>
 <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">To unlock the next stage, you have to complete two one-time quests. The first is called “<strong>Body and Soul</strong>”, which is pretty straightforward and, when completed, will unlock the quest which allows you to upgrade your weapon to the Lux version. You only have to complete this quest for your first Anima weapon.</p> <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="645" data-injectable="true">The second is “<strong>Words of Wisdom</strong>”. You need to complete this quest before you can upgrade to the Lux variant of your first weapon, but on the plus side, you won’t ever have to do it again. It’s a simple back and forth quest between Ardashir in Azys Lla and Rowena in Idyllshire. Once completed, you can move on to the final quest.</p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-complete-best-friends-forever-in-final-fantasy-xiv" data-injectable="false"><strong>How to complete Best Friends Forever in </strong><strong><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></strong></h2> <p data-characters="16" data-current-count="16" data-injectable="false"><strong>Relic stage: Lux</strong></p> <figure data-current-count="316" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="380" data-current-count="696" data-injectable="true">After the grind that you’ve already gone through to get here, this will be easy. Speak to Ardashir and he’ll tell you that you need to complete 12 Trials. These 12 Trials come in sets of three and can be completed in any order, but must be completed with your Complete Anima weapon equipped, and the first three must be completed before moving on to the next three, and so on:</p>
 <p data-characters="5" data-current-count="5" data-injectable="false"><strong>Set 1</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="125" data-injectable="false"> <li>The Bowl of Embers (Hard)</li> <li>The Howling Eye (Hard)</li> <li>The Navel (Hard)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="5" data-current-count="130" data-injectable="false"><strong>Set 2</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="290" data-injectable="false"> <li>Thornmarch (Hard)</li> <li>The Whorleater (Hard)</li> <li>The Striking Tree (Hard)</li> <li>The Akh Afah Amphitheatre (Hard)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="5" data-current-count="295" data-injectable="false"><strong>Set 3</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false"> <li>Thok ast Thok (Hard)</li> <li>The Limitless Blue (Hard)</li> </ul> <p data-characters="5" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"><strong>Set 4</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"> <li>Containment Bay S1T7</li> <li>Containment Bay P1T6</li> <li>Containment Bay Z1T9</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="217" data-current-count="217" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve completed these Trials with your Complete Anima weapon in hand, head to Hismena in Idyllshire (or any Sundry Splendor) and pick up one bottle of Archaic Enchanted Ink for 500 Tomestones of Poetics.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="573" data-injectable="false">With that in your inventory, drag yourself back to Azys Lla for the final time, talk to Ardashir once more, and pick up your very pretty Lux weapon before deciding not to do another relic for a while – at least until you’ve mentally blocked out how much of a grind this actually was and another weapon makes you go “ooh, that’s pretty”.&nbsp;</p>

"And I truly hope that when you play the 2nd chapter of Senua's story, you will find that familiar connection once again, and so many more people will find their way to Senua and her world too." </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">A message from Studio Head Dom Matthews ahead of our launch tomorrow. <a href="https://t.co/IH98qP9evv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/IH98qP9evv</a></p>— Ninja Theory (@NinjaTheory) <a href="https://twitter.com/NinjaTheory/status/1792601275550302264?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 20, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Matthews' message points out how many fans have reached out to Ninja Theory to express how important Senua means to them and how much their faith has inspired Ninja Theory to continue her story. Ninja Theory's first chapter in the series, Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice, was released in 2017, and both fans and critics praised it for its visuals, story, and depiction of psychosis, which many have said was the most remarkable thing about the original Hellblade. </p><p>"Its incredibly smart use of audio and visual distortion and trickery to convey the frightening effects of psychosis, hallucinations, and delusion, are married with the gameplay elements for an experience that rarely ever grapples over whether it's a game or a story," we <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/08/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review">wrote</a> in our review of Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice. </p><p>During the 2019 Game Awards, Ninja Theory announced that it was working on Hellblade 2. Some fans were disappointed with a few revelations ahead of its release, such as Hellblade 2 <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-is-a-digital-only-release">not receiving a physical release</a> and the console version being <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hellblade-2-confirmed-to-run-at-30-fps-on-xbox-no-performance-mode-available">locked at 30 frames per second (FPS)</a>. </p><p>Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 is out tomorrow on PC and Xbox. For more information, check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hellblade-2-is-shaping-up-to-be-another-beautiful-nightmare">IGN's Hellblade 2 preview</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-hellblade-2-is-taking-immersion-to-the-next-level">our piece</a> on how Ninja Theory has leveraged technology, such as Epic Games' MetaHuman animator technology, to take immersion to the next level. </p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

One of these could be related to the secret collaboration teased on the roadmap, which could be the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-and-mw3-season-4-release-date-and-details/1100-6523547/">rumored crossover with Fallout</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4305559-mwiii-s4-announcement-tout3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4305559" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4305559-mwiii-s4-announcement-tout3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4305559"></a><figcaption>Call of Duty Season 4 roadmap</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4305559-mwiii-s4-announcement-tout3.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Modern_Warfare_3">Modern Warfare 3</h2><p dir="ltr">Season 4 introduces three new 6v6 core multiplayer maps. Tokyo and Paris maps arrive at launch, with Tokyo being a nighttime city setting and Paris being a daytime map that gives players a view of the Eiffel Tower. The midseason update will add Incline, which is a snowy outpost in the mountains of Warzone's Urzikstan.</p><p dir="ltr">New game modes include Demolition and Hyper Cranked at launch, while a Headshots Only playlist and other new game modes will arrive at launch.</p><p dir="ltr">The update also includes new perks and killstreaks. Players can unlock a new Mission Control Vest perk that helps them earn killstreaks faster and a Compression Plate perk to aid in health regeneration. Four new killstreaks include the return of Call of Duty's I.M.S, missile drone, DNA Bomb, as well as the new Loitering Munition streak that allows players to leave an unmanned rocket drone in the sky.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Warzone">Warzone</h2><p dir="ltr">While Season 4 doesn't provide any new maps, it does make a change to Urzikstan by adding a mysterious DNA Bomb at Popov Power. The update also teases that the bunkers on the map will be accessible once players discover how to open them.</p><p dir="ltr">The gulag will receive four random 1v1 silo variants. Each silo has a slightly different map layout, so players will have a bit of variety when fighting for their second chance.</p><p dir="ltr">The update also brings the return of Warzone's Buy Back Royale Solo playlist for Urzikstan. Additional modes are teased as being "redacted," and possibly related to upcoming IP crossovers and the reveal of Call of Duty 2024.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to new daily and weekly challenges, Season 4 introduces new Warzone Reward challenges.

The roadmap teases this area will have top-secret cargo, but the area may contain "toxic debris" with unnatural elements.</p><p dir="ltr">Rebirth Island will also have toxic elements, with green gas-filled barrels littered around the map. These are flammable, but destroying them will earn players special event points in an upcoming event.</p>

                <p>Call of Duty's next big season kicks off soon, and that means Activision is releasing another BlackCell DLC pack. The new BlackCell DLC for Season 4 once again delivers the good, as it includes multiple new operators, weapon blueprints with special tracers and death effects, and an impressive-sounding new finishing move.</p><p>The finishing move is called "Identity Theft," and it does just that. This finishing move kills your foe and then copies and equips their skin to yours. This stays in effect until your next death. This is seemingly a brand-new type of finishing move that's never been seen in Call of Duty before.</p>

<p>Of note, this new finishing move can only be equipped to Dupe or Copy, which are the two new operators included with the Season 4 BlackCell DLC.</p><p>The BlackCell DLC bundle also comes with the Ailed Caress BlackCell weapon blueprint for the Holger 556 assault rifle. This includes the Cellular Corruption tracers and the Necrosis death effects. Activision has not released any imagery or video of the death effects, but given the name--Necrosis--it sounds extreme.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4305551-screenshot2024-05-20at1.58.25pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4305551" data-ratio="0.56472491909385" data-width="618" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4305551-screenshot2024-05-20at1.58.25pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4305551"></a><figcaption>The newest BlackCell DLC bundle is out soon</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4305551-screenshot2024-05-20at1.58.25pm.png"></figure><p>Everyone who buys the BlackCell DLC gets all of this, plus 1,100 COD points and access to the exclusive BlackCell sector of the battle pass map for Season 4.

<p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free-to-play</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">fighter</a> already had the likes of (take a breath) Looney Tunes like Bugs Bunny, Taz and Marvin the Martian; Rick &amp; Morty (of Rick &amp; Morty); Tom &amp; Jerry (of Tom &amp; Jerry); Scooby-Doo’s Velma and Shaggy; Adventure Time’s Finn, Jake and, uh, a random Banana Guard; The Iron Giant’s Iron Giant; Game of Thrones’ Arya Stark; Steven Universe’s Steven Universe and Garnet; and even a couple of Gremlins in Gizmo and Stripe. Oh, plus LeBron James - apparently appearing here due to his role in the new Space Jam - and a whole host of DC comics superheroes and villains like Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, Harley Quinn, Black Adam and The Joker, with Mark Hamill returning after an absence from Suicide Squad. Phew.</p>
<p>Warner Bros isn’t done chucking familiar faces from film and TV on the list, though, revealing that Friday the 13th’s Jason Voorhees and The Matrix’s Agent Smith - no Neo, yet - will also be finding their way into the platform fighter when it returns on May 28th. Jason will be in from the word go, while Agent Smith will pop up sometime during MultiVersus’ first season of unlockables, which is titled Puns &amp; Villainy.</p>
<p>I’m not sure whether to be impressive or exhausted by the sheer number of licensed characters crammed into MultiVersus, but I’ll at least admit that it’s almost certainly the best shot at doing a Smash Bros-like with recognisable characters since Nintendo threw all their video game stars onto the Nintendo 64 25 years ago. (The less said about PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale, the better.) Still, it’s hard not to cast a cynical eye on Warner Bros in particular, given their treatment of other video games and creators in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-bros-leave-developers-feeling-sick-and-dizzy-as-more-adult-swim-games-are-being-delisted">the very recent past</a>.</p>

<p>Misgivings with the publisher aside, I do admire the commitment of developers Player First Games to take almost a full year to bring MultiVersus back, having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/multiversus-open-beta-shutting-down-in-june-relaunching-in-2024">pulled it from sale and turned off the servers</a> after running an open beta from the summer of 2022 to last June. It was a contentious choice - not least because people had already paid real money to unlock stuff during its open beta - but hopefully the results will speak for themselves, having already impressed with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/multiversus-lacks-that-nintendo-polish-but-its-still-a-slick-smash-bros-like-in-open-beta">a pretty slick offering in its pre-release form</a>.</p>
<p>We’ve only got about a wait to week before we find out if the wait has finally been worth it, as MultiVersus arrives - with Jason and Agent Smith in tow - in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/almost-a-year-after-ending-its-open-beta-multiversus-will-return-on-may-28th">just over a week on May 28th</a>.</p>

			<p>Stellar Blade is certainly one of the most successful games released this year. The PlayStation 5 action game developed by South Korean developer Shift Up garnered widespread acclaim from critics and users alike when it launched last month. Our Kai Tatsumoto rated the game 9 out of 10 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in his review</a>:</p>
<p><em>No butts about it, Stellar Blade is a marvelous feast for the eyes and a technically impressive action RPG. Those who find the hyper-sexualized Eve offputting will find little redemption in finding some modesty for the playable heroine, but at the same time, those already accustomed to the years following Bayonetta’s release and 2Booty memes will find the character designs enjoyable, to say the least. Stellar Blade is a fantastic action title and one PlayStation exclusive you’ll have to play after the kids go to bed.</em></p>
<p><em>Taking a step back from Kim Hung Tae's character designs for a moment, Stellar Blade is a phenomenal action RPG that evolves from the framework of NieR Replicant and NieR Automata to become one of the next cult classics.</em></p>
<p>It's no big surprise, then, that Shift Up has big plans for this IP. The South Korean studio is preparing its initial public offering (IPO) and <a href="https://dart.fss.or.kr/dsaf001/main.do?rcpNo=20240520000263" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the documentation</a> includes some juicy information, including upcoming DLC, a PC port, and a sequel.</p>
<p><em>Our Stellar Blade showed early signs of success as an original IP, with the highest user score on Metacritic (9.3 out of 10) among PS5 games in its first week of release. This figure is higher than recognized AAA titles such as God of War: Ragnarok, Elden Ring, and Ghost of Tsushima.</em></p>
<p><em>Stellar Blade seeks to encourage participation from not only existing users but also new users by introducing new play elements such as DLC release, PC version release, and new IP collaboration.</em></p>
<p>Elsewhere in the document, they wrote:</p>
<p><em>We are considering producing a PC version and sequel to Stellar Blade.</em></p>
<p>Shift Up isn't putting all its eggs in one basket, anyway. They are also making Project Witches, which they believe will be a big hit:</p>
<p><em>We have very high expectations for Project Witches as the next-generation mega subculture IP that will surpass Goddess of Victory: Nike.</em></p>
<p>Did you play Stellar Blade yet and if so, what did you think? Let us know in the comments.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft's upcoming tactical shooter XDefiant is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-call-of-duty-competitor-xdefiant-launches-on-may-21/1100-6523136/">set to launch</a> this week, and the publisher detailed the game's "in-game purchase philosophy" in a recent <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/xdefiant/news/1Xg1YrL6SEcqcuTDNIYSGz">blog post</a>. Most notably, the post says that XDefiant will allow players to unlock all purchasable "gameplay-impacting" content through challenges--or, as Ubisoft puts it, the game will lack "pay-to-win" mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">The blog post offers an example in the form of the DedSec faction, which players can either purchase or earn via an in-game challenge by collecting 700,000 XP. It also details how the game will reward the player's time through traditional live game mechanics such as free battle pass rewards, daily and weekly challenges, weapon mastery, and more. Ubisoft ends the post by listing the various content types in XDefiant, including the expected premium battle pass and a variety of character and weapon cosmetics.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> XDefiant - Official Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Often described as Ubisoft's answer to the Call of Duty series, XDefiant will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-call-of-duty-competitor-xdefiant-launches-on-may-21/1100-6523136/">launch</a> May 21 in preseason. The publisher recently revealed that the free-to-play shooter will not have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/as-call-of-duty-continues-attracting-skill-based-matchmaking-complaints-xdefiant-goes-in-a-different-direction/1100-6523492/">skill-based matchmaking</a> in its casual play mode, a major contrast to Call of Duty. However, it will not feature ranked play at launch, with Ubisoft stating that the feature will come in a later season. In other Ubisoft news, the publisher recently canceled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland-but-the-division-3-is-still-coming/1100-6523480/">The Division Heartland</a> to put more resources into XDefiant and the Rainbow Six series.</p>

                <p>In 2011, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3/" data-ref-id="5000-75614">Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</a> concluded Infinity Ward's original Modern Warfare trilogy, with Captain Price emerging victorious over the terrorist Vladimir Makarov after a dramatic helicopter crash and rooftop battle. But a newly surfaced post-credits scene allegedly cut from the final product completely recontextualizes the ending to one of the greatest FPS trilogies of all time.</p><p dir="ltr">The cut scene is similar to the ending seen in the original game, but takes what is a clear victory in the finished scene and instead adds a layer of tragedy to it. In the original ending, after crashing through a rooftop window and seeing Makarov strangled to death, Captain Price lights up a celebratory cigar as the scene fades to black.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=De7Axarv12E" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/De7Axarv12E" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">However, a post-credits scene allegedly found within the game's original files that has surfaced online (via Call of Duty modder <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ruvlad/videos" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vlad Lokitonov on YouTube</a>, with the scene in question restored by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU-86Tufa0HFAUre1UBoEdw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">yoyo1love</a>) continues to play out the ending. A slumped over Price wakes up to the sound of footsteps, and looks up to see a mysterious stranger off in the distance. The man briefly surveys Price's work and then turns around to leave. As he walks away, Price slumps over, his lit cigar falling from his hand and rolling away. The camera fades to black before an old image of his fallen comrades appears on screen.</p><p dir="ltr">In this ending, Price to succumbs to his wounds and dies from his encounter with Makarov. The identity of the unknown man who appears is said to be labeled as "shadowman" or "ominous stranger" in the game's files. His true identity will likely remain a mystery, but some fans have interpreted the stranger as representing death, having come to finally claim Price.</p><p dir="ltr">Had this cut post-credits scene made its way into the final game, it would have given a much different tone and ending to Infinity Ward's original Modern Warfare trilogy, with its hero dying in the end. With that in mind, it's easy to see why Infinity Ward maybe didn't want to end the trilogy on a bittersweet note, and instead opted to more definitively leave open the possibility of Price returning in a potential sequel. </p><p dir="ltr">That is, of course, if this cut ending is legitimate. As of now, it's impossible to know if this ending was actually found tucked away in the game's files for more than a decade or if this is a fan creation. Either way, it does add an interesting wrinkle to what would otherwise be a fairly standard ending to one of the greatest game trilogies ever made.</p><p dir="ltr">Infinity Ward is currently retelling and reimagining the story of its original Modern Warfare trilogy in last year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-597446">Modern Warfare III</a>. Microsoft, which now owns Activision and its various studios, including Infinity Ward, will reportedly be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-rumored-to-be-black-ops-5-is-coming-to-game-pass-report/1100-6523538/" data-ref-id="1100-6523538">adding the next installment in the Call of Duty franchise to Game Pass</a> later this year. The game, which has not yet been officially unveiled, is rumored to be a new entry in the Black Ops subseries.</p>
