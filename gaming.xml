No, I don't mean the Super Bowl - it's time for Awesome Games Done Quick, the annual charity speedrunning marathon that features a week of talented gamers showing off the wildest things they can do with video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Done Quick (GDQ) has been running for 15 years now, since 2010. The event is a live broadcast speedrunning marathon, during which speedrunners take turns showing off beating video games as fast as possible, and often in wacky and especially impressive ways. In recent years, the events have shown off increasingly ambitious performances, including blindfolded or one-handed runs, two players using a single controller, showcases of tricky arcade games, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-start-2024-by-interviewing-the-worlds-first-dog-speedrunner">even speedruns performed by dogs</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The annual event is held to raise money for the Prevent Cancer foundation, having previously raised a record high of $3,442,033 in 2022, and $2,539,832 just last year. And this year's marathon has some pretty ridiculous runs on the docket. There's a run of Crazy Taxi backed by a live band, someone playing Elden Ring with a saxophone, new Super Mario Bros. Wii run while simultaneously playing piano, a two-players-one-controller run of Breath of the Wild, loads of randomizer races, and it all wraps up with a Map Randomizer Race between some of the best Super Metroid runners out there. If you've never watched GDQ before, it's really worth tuning in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">AGDQ 2025 kicks off at 9:00 AM PT on Sunday, January 5 with a run of Pikmin on Nintendo Switch, followed by Portal 2. In fact, Sunday's full of bangers: Kirby's Air Ride follows, there's an Astro Bot run, then The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, a run infamous for appearing at GDQ every years and getting shorter each time as the community discovers new, run-changing skips.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/03/fsh-08395-1735942959021.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Awesome Games Done Quick 2024, photo by Wes "Fish" Chan</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If I keep going I'll just list every single run in the entire event, so here's a quick list of highlights you should definitely check out.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/valve-confirms-cs2-major-expansion-and-rankings-based-invitations/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Earlier today, Valve officially updated their Counter-Strike 2 Major <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/counter-strike_rules_and_regs/blob/main/major-supplemental-rulebook.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rulebook</a>, confirming the reports that their illustrious tournament would <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/40062/sources-majors-to-expand-to-32-teams-from-2025-rmrs-removed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expand from 24 teams to 32</a>. The increase in teams also means that the CS2 Major will expand the number of Swiss Stages from two to three. There will also be a new series of qualifier events, called the Major Regional Qualifiers.</p>



<p>The next Major on the schedule, the BLAST.tv Austin Major in April 2025, should be the first to incorporate the new changes.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-re-gonna-need-a-bigger-stage">We’re Gonna Need a Bigger Stage</h2>



<p>The CS2 Major will now prominently feature three 16-team Swiss Stages before culminating in the traditional eight-team single-elimination playoff bracket. Each Swiss Stage will still feature best-of-one matches in the first two rounds. </p>



<p>Eight teams will receive a direct invite to the third stage, and eight will receive a direct invite to the second stage. The Major Regional Qualifiers, which are replacing the Regional Major Ranking (RMR) events, will determine the 16 teams that begin in stage one.</p>



<p>The regional distribution of the teams invited to each stage of the CS2 Major is directly determined by that region’s performance at the previous Major. Six European teams, one Americas team, and one Asia/Pacific team are invited to stage three, based on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-spirit-win-shanghai-cs-major/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the teams that reached the playoffs of the Perfect World Shanghai Major</a>. Four EU teams and four Americas teams will be invited to stage two. Six EU teams, six Americas teams, and four Asia/Pacific teams will qualify from MRQs to stage one. </p>



<p>The official Valve Regional Standings for each of the three regions will determine which teams are invited to stage three, stage two, or the MRQs. The highest ranked teams from each region that haven’t already been invited to stage two or stage three will be invited to the MRQs.</p>



<p>Speaking of MRQs, which are replacing the Regional Major Ranking (RMR) events for determining Major participants, here are the new formats:</p>



<ul>
<li>Eight Asia/Pacific teams will compete in a two-group GSL-style bracket. Four teams will advance to Stage One.</li>



<li>16 European teams will compete in their own Swiss Stage. Six teams will advance to Stage One.</li>



<li>16 Americas teams will compete in their own Swiss Stage. Six teams will advance to Stage One.
<ul>
<li>If Americas must be subdivided to North America and South America due to ping issues, “Major invitations will be split evenly among the regions.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Additionally, the changes to the CS2 Major rulebook say that the MRQs may be held online, though players and teams will likely heavily oppose playing online. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/atari-handheld-console-gamestation-go/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/atari%E2%80%99s-new-gamestation-go-handheld-is-a-retro-futuristic-marvel.1073736/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/atari-handheld-console-gamestation-go/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Atari has unveiled the Gamestation Go, an all-new handheld device with a few bizarre features that contribute nicely to a retro-futuristic vibe. In a short trailer uploaded on social media, we’re given a glimpse at the new console, which features typical button-based inputs alongside a keypad, paddle, and a Trak-Ball input.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-an-icon-reimagined">An Icon, Reimagined</h2>



<p>Atari is preparing to fully showcase the Gamestation Go handheld console at CES 2025 in Las Vegas, which will commence on January 7.</p>



<p>The first whispers of this device surfaced more than a year ago when it was revealed that Atari was partnering with MyArcade to piece together a handheld unit with these very features. That collaboration has come to fruition with the Gamestation Go.</p>



<p>At CES 2024, the ‘Gamestation Portable’ was revealed, featuring:</p>



<ul>
<li>A 7-inch high-resolution display</li>



<li>Paddle, Trak-Ball, and keypad inputs</li>



<li>Officially licensed titles</li>
</ul>



<p>The original design showcased at CES 2024 has undergone a few changes, with the team making some aesthetic tweaks and shifting some buttons around.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer released by Atari:</p>











<p>With charming hints of backlighting, a colour scheme that screams retro, and a promising line-up of titles, the Atari Gamestation Go could be a winner in the ever-growing handheld market. The unique inputs promise to accommodate games found on platforms like the Atari 5200 and the Jaguar. </p>



<p>In recent years, the concept of the handheld console has exploded in popularity, with almost every major tech manufacturer getting in on the action. Recently, we’ve seen every tech titan from MSI to Logitech and from Lenovo to ASUS have their crack at making a handheld gaming device.</p>



<p>When CES 2025 kicks off, we’ll likely have more information about the unit, including a release window and potentially a price point.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-dead-tcg-artifact-suddenly-had-12000-players-on-new-years-day-and-the-community-is-baffled<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As we rang in the new year earlier this week, thousands of people <em>seemed</em> to be celebrating in an admittedly unusual way: by playing Valve's 2018 TCG Artifact.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, as quickly as they started, the 12,000-ish individuals all stopped playing at once on January 3, leaving the game as empty as it had been at the end of 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Who were these people? No one seems to know. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Artifact/comments/1hqvdjy/12k_players_again/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artifact community isn't reporting any sudden spikes in interest</a>, and no one's really talking about the game on social media apart from marveling at the sudden jump in player numbers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So why, then, is <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/583950/charts/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB</a> suggesting that a free-to-play card game that is, by all accounts, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/artifact-valve-stops-development-on-struggling-card-game">close to dead</a>, seeing wild spikes in users over very specific two-day periods?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2025/01/01/12000-people-are-playing-artifact-right-now-and-no-one-knows-why/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by Forbes</a>, Artifact Classic's (the original, now free-to-play version of Artifact) player count suddenly spiked on December 31, jumping from a measly ~200 concurrent players up to the 5,000s, before spiking to a height of over 12,000. Artifact remained at around 11,000 concurrents through the second, before its playercount absolutely tanked back down to ~150 at midnight on January 3rd. What's strange is that something almost exactly like this happened earlier this month, too: on December 14, player counts shot up to around 14,000, hung out there for about two days, and dive bombed again into the hundreds on the 17th.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what's really going on here? The actual answer is that no one <em>really </em>knows. The most prevalent community theory seems to be that it's bots, though why someone would train bots to play Artifact isn't exactly clear. One person suggested someone was training an AI to play the game "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Artifact/comments/1hf87nf/comment/m2agrbz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">for shits and giggles</a>" which is perhaps as good an explanation as any. Another person suggested the spikes were due to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Artifact/comments/1hqvdjy/comment/m4y3g74/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scam bots increasing playtime in random games</a> in order to make their Steam accounts look legitimate for <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/70E6-991B-233B-A37B" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other purposes</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Hero in Artifact's Call to Arms Release Set</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another theory pointed out by multiple members of the Artifact subreddit is that the spike in players is due to pirates. Because certain video games require Steam authentication, in order to pirate those games, pirates will use the AppID/SDK of a different, free-to-play game to fool Steam into thinking they have a real copy. In this case, it's being suggested they're using Artifact. That said, this theory doesn't entirely hold up, due to the extremely sudden spikes and then drops in activity at very precise times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So the actual answer behind Artifact's mysterious player numbers remains a mystery for now. We did reach out to Valve for comment, but did not hear back in time for publication. What is clear at least is that despite the numbers, Artifact itself doesn't seem to be garnering any meaningful, real-world interest eight years after launch and four years after Valve <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/artifact-valve-stops-development-on-struggling-card-game">effectively called it quits</a>, even though the game itself <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/13/artifact-review">was pretty fun at first</a>. At least the bots, if they are indeed bots, in Artifact don't seem to be bothering legitimate players, unlike <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/team-fortress-2-steam-reviews-drop-to-mostly-negative-as-players-plead-with-valve-to-do-something-about-bots">the on-and-off situation over in Team Fortress 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-first-edition-artist-proof-set-on-sale-for-2-million<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dedicated <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> collectors have gotten a golden opportunity recently. A new listing on eBay promotes the sale of a complete <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> First Edition Artist Proof set. That is over 300 cards signed by dozens of contributing artists. As for the price, you may need to take out some serious loans.</p>



<p>The official <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/386107788022" rel="nofollow">eBay listing</a> of the complete <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>First Edition Artist Proof set was posted by user thelotusvale.</p>

<p>That listing includes a comprehensive number of screenshots showcasing every single card from the first edition of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. Each card is signed by the artist. Among these cards is the one of the most sought-after, The Black Lotus, in PSA Certified mint condition.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-first-edition-card-screenshots.jpg?itok=ajpHlDfU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-first-edition-card-screenshots.jpg?itok=QGI7tsJb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In addition, each card is accompanied by a signed, sketched artist proof of each card. These are single-sided white cards with the artist's sketch of the initial card artwork. They are meant for esteemed collectors and diehard fans of the respective artists.</p>

<p>So, about that price. According to the listing, the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> First Edition Artist Proof set will be available for as little as $2.2 million. If you live in Richmond, Virginia, the set is available for local pick up on purchase. Otherwise, shipping to the US will cost you $54.67.</p>

<p>Finally, if you buy this set, no refunds. That is, unless the set isn't as advertised, which would make it fall under eBay's Money Back guarantee policy.</p>

<p>It's not an unheard of price for <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> history. Last April, a pristine copy of the Black Lotus was sold for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mtg-black-lotus-shatters-records-in-staggering-3m-sale" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">$3 million</a>. Furthermore, rap artist Post Malone purchased the one-of-a-kind <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/post-malone-buys-magic-gathering-one-ring" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The One Ring</em></a> card from the Lord of the Rings set, a card speculated at $2 million in value, for an undisclosed amount.</p>

<p><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> First Edition was released to the world in 1993. This was the start of the iconic card game and the start of collectible card games within the tabletop space, inspiring competitors like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pokemon-trading-card-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pokemon TCG</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disney-lorcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Disney Lorcana</em></a>. It is a game packed with 30 years of history and a deeply passionate playerbase still drafting decks to this day.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/rumors-say-next-gen-rtx-50-gpus-will-come-with-big-jumps-in-power-requirements/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Nvidia is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/nvidia-partners-leak-next-gen-rtx-50-series-gpus-including-a-32gb-5090/">reportedly gearing up to launch</a> the first few cards in its RTX 50-series at CES next week, including an RTX 5090, RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070. The 5090 will be of particular interest to performance-obsessed, money-is-no-object PC gaming fanatics since it's the first new GPU in over two years that can beat the performance of 2022's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/rtx-4090-review-nvidias-biggest-gpu-is-easily-its-best/">RTX 4090</a>.</p>
<p>But boosted performance and slower advancements in chip manufacturing technology mean that the 5090's maximum power draw will far outstrip the 4090's, according to leakers. VideoCardz reports that the 5090's thermal design power (TDP) will be set at 575 W, up from 450 W for the already power-hungry RTX 4090. The RTX 5080's TDP is also increasing to 360 W, up from 320 W for the RTX 4080 Super.</p>
<p>That also puts the RTX 5090 close to the maximum power draw available over a single 12VHPWR connector, which is capable of delivering up to 600 W of power (though once you include the 75 W available via the PCI Express slot on your motherboard, the actual maximum possible power draw for a GPU with a single 12VHPWR connector is a slightly higher 675 W).</p>
<p>Higher peak power consumption doesn't necessarily mean that these cards will always draw more power during actual gaming than their 40-series counterparts. And their performance could be good enough that they could still be very efficient cards in terms of performance per watt.</p>
<p>But if you're considering an upgrade to an RTX 5090 and these power specs are accurate, you may need to consider an upgraded power supply along with your new graphics card. Nvidia recommends at least an 850 W power supply for the RTX 4090 to accommodate what the GPU needs while leaving enough power left over for the rest of the system. An additional 125 W bump suggests that Nvidia will recommend a 1,000 W power supply as the minimum for the 5090.</p>
<p>We'll probably know more about Nvidia's next-gen cards after <a href="https://www.ces.tech/attendee-guides/nvidia-keynote/">its CES keynote</a>, currently scheduled for 9:30 pm Eastern/6:30 pm Pacific on Monday, January 6.</p>

That’s a shame because the bones of this tactical RPG are some of the strongest around, even if the surrounding fluff can get in the way sometimes.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196086,196599" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>A sequel to Image &amp; Form’s 2015 3DS game, <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em> trades its predecessor’s sci-fi setting for a <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em>-infused take on the high seas, but otherwise the bulk of it still revolves around turn-based encounters in side-scrolling 2D maps where gunshots ricochet and grenades blow up cover to create memorably chaotic fights.</p><p>You’re still looting procedurally generated levels and trying to escape as bullets and lasers go whizzing past your crew’s mechanical heads, but there’s a major difference in <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>. Unlike the first game, in which characters were each ingrained with specific class archetypes, the sequel lets you give any crew member any weapon and then start building their kit around that. Equip a sniper rifle and you become a sharpshooter that specializes in dealing critical damage from afar. Wield a hammer and you become a brawler who gets extra turns and other bonuses from smashing foes up close. </p><p>This offers a lot of flexibility and freedom, but <em>SteamWorld Heist II </em>goes a step further and lets characters mix and match skills from different classes once they’ve unlocked them, rewarding experimentation and incentivizing a hunt for synergies that will break the game and help you take no prisoners when breaking into high security bases in search of powerful treasure. It’s basically the inverse of the<em> Final Fantasy Tactics </em>job system where skill trees were linked to classes rather than weapons. The result is a refreshing change-up that’s more streamlined without ditching too much depth. </p><p>I finished the game last summer on Switch (it’s also on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC) and loved every minute in which I found myself analyzing bullet trajectories, blast radiuses, and the odds of success if I sacrificed one character to cover the rest of the crew’s tactical retreat. Even through procedurally generated maps where any lollygagging will quickly find you overrun by enemy forces, <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>’s ingredients form an excellent recipe for tense moments, analytical showdowns, and seat-of-your-pants escapes. It cleverly iterates on the best elements of the first game and makes them even more robust and fun. </p><p>The only downside to <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em> is that it lacks the first game’s concise 12-hour runtime. It’s almost twice as long, with the extra hours going toward some late-game grinding and a new overworld exploration system in which you explore as a submarine gunning down enemy ships in real-time in exchange for small rewards that quickly stop being worth the trouble. Like the rest of <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>, the shoot-‘em-up sections are smartly designed and control well but ultimately feel like unnecessary time wasters and frustrating distractions from the excellent 2D tactical combat at the game’s core. </p><p>Ultimately, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fsteamworld-heist-ii%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fsteamworld-heist-ii%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>SteamWorld Heist II</em></a></span><em> </em>is like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with an extra piece of bread in the middle. Still delicious but eventually way more than you want to eat. I still ended up finishing the game because the 2D <em>XCOM</em>-like shootouts are good enough to make wading through all the filler worth it. <em>SteamWorld Heist II </em>is a great tactics RPG that genre acolytes will be doing themselves a disservice to overlook.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Stern Pinball is back with another new machine and this time it’s a tribute to <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> following the tabletop RPG’s 50th anniversary. The table comes with all kinds of whimsical bells and whistles and an all-star voice cast, and it can be yours starting at $7,000. Or you could pay nearly double that for the limited edition version.</p><p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The Tyrant’s Eye</em> takes players into the Forgotten Realms to face off against owlbears, gelatinous cubes, a red dragon, and Xanathar the beholder, all with just a pair of flippers and a few steel balls. Trap doors unlock new dungeons and dice rolls will dictate how the adventure unfolds. I don’t have a spare down payment for a new car lying around, but I do have a basement just waiting to be renovated where this would fit perfectly. </p><p>  “Battle Rath the Relentless, the red dragon, the most advanced animatronic mech in pinball, [who] intelligently reacts to player action with multi-axis motion and features omnidirectional impact sensing technology,” writes Stern in a press release. “Voiced by the iconic Michael Dorn, players will attempt to defeat Rath the Relentless with pinballs and by hitting the 3-bank target, steal its treasure. When Rath the Relentless breathes his magnificent fire, multiple pinballs shoot from its mouth but be prepared. Players can activate a metal shield between the flippers to not only defend against attacks but also assist with playfield shots.”</p><p>I’m by no means a pinball connoisseur, but that all sounds rad. Critical Role fans are also in for a treat since Matthew Mercer, Laura Bailey, and Marisha Ray are also part of the <em>D&amp;D </em>pinball machine’s voice cast, along with Kevin Smith, Luke Gygax, Chris Prynoski, Brendon Small, and Gerard Way. And the table even incorporates the Stern Insider app to save progress. It’s effectively a <em>D&amp;D</em> pinball roguelike. In fact, that would be a great idea for an actual video game too. </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/guitar-hero-review/1900-6137018/" data-ref-id="1900-6137018">Guitar Hero</a> debuted in November 2005, but the franchise has been in a lull for a long time. The last game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/guitar-hero-live-review/1900-6416284/" data-ref-id="1900-6416284">Guitar Hero Live</a>, arrived in 2015 and there hasn't been any concrete word about a new title since. However, the Guitar Hero fandom lives on in 2025, and there's a new controller coming to the Wii later this month.</p><p>Hyperkin has announced that an updated version of the company's Wii Guitar is up for preorder ahead of its release date, January 8. It's called the Hyper Strummer, and it includes support for Wii's Guitar Hero and Rock Band titles, with the exception of the first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/rock-band-review/1900-6184123/" data-ref-id="1900-6184123">Rock Band</a> game.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Hyperkin/status/1874486686622556240" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">New Year, New Wii... Guitars. Introducing the HYPER STRUMMER! An updated model of our previous Wii Guitar, we have been working hard and wanted to give you a little surprise of what is to come this year! The HyperStrummer is set to pre orders start NOW! <a href="https://t.co/e82FJN6bCk" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/e82FJN6bCk</a></p>  — Hyperkin (@Hyperkin) <a href="https://twitter.com/Hyperkin/status/1874486686622556240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>At $77, the Hyper Strummer is somewhat pricey. But it was made to resemble the classic Guitar Hero controllers. It's also powered by the Wii remote, so players won't need to pickup any batteries for this controller. It's unclear how many Guitar Hero or Rock Band players are still using the Wii in 2025, but presumably Hyperkin took that into account before committing to this project. </p><p>Because Microsoft purchased Activision Blizzard, the company now controls the fate of any future Guitar Hero games. Earlier this year, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer revealed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-phil-spencer-says-he-passed-on-acquiring-so-many-games-including-destiny-and-guitar-hero/1100-6526241/" data-ref-id="1100-6526241">that he passed on Guitar Hero</a> before it became a breakout hit. In 2022, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick noted that he and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-guitar-hero-come-back-under-microsoft-kotick-says-the-xbox-company-has-resources-to-do-it/1100-6499764/" data-ref-id="1100-6499764">Spencer had discussions about bringing Guitar Hero back</a>, but we haven't heard anything new about those talks since then. Guitar Hero <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2024-video-game-hall-of-fame-finalists-include-metroid-resident-evil-and-guitar-hero/1100-6521847/" data-ref-id="1100-6521847">was also one of the finalists</a> to be added to 2024's class at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-game-in-the-video-game-hall-of-fame/2900-5170/" data-ref-id="2900-5170">Strong Museum's Video Game Hall of Fame</a>. However, the game wasn't among the titles selected for that year.</p>

The class' main damage dealers are two-handed weapons like mauls and maces, which each come with skills of their own. However, players are allowed to switch things up and make use of a one-handed weapon along with a shield if they're looking to play more defensively. Shields also has its own defensive skill that allows you to block attacks, but you won't deal as much damage with this kind of build.</p><p>Fortunately, Path of Exile 2 allows you to swap freely between two different builds. So, you can have a two-handed weapon on one build and a one-handed weapon/shield on another build. This allows you to easily change up your playstyle depending on whether offensive or defensive strategies are required for a certain fight. You can also dual-wield one-handed weapons and this does come into play with certain skills.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416247-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.03.47.20.png" data-ref-id="1300-4416247" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416247-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.03.47.20.png" data-ref-id="1300-4416247"></a><figcaption>A club and shield will be your starting weapons as a Warrior</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416247-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.03.47.20.png"></figure><p>Generally, though, the best build for a Warrior in Path of Exile 2 relies on dealing damage with two-handed weapons, as it's very easy to get overwhelmed by mobs or bosses if you try to get too defensive.</p><p>As a Warrior, you'll want to put as many attribute points as possible into Strength. The other two attributes, Dexterity and Intelligence, won't come into play too much unless you want to be a more nimble Warrior. In that case, putting some points into Dexterity could be a good idea for certain gear.</p><h2>Best Warrior Skills in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>With the overview of the Warrior out of the way, it's time to talk skills. The Warrior has access to a wide variety of powerful attacks, but the main downfall of a lot of them is their overall slowness. You'll find yourself mashing buttons trying to get attacks off quicker, but the Warrior is simply a sluggish class that takes plenty of patience.</p><p>For the most part, the Warrior relies on AoE damage to hurt and kill enemies. You'll want to stay as close as possible to enemies to inflict the most damage possible, but this also means you'll be taking more damage in return. This is where swapping back between different weapons and your shield can come into play. Using an AoE attack and then changing to a shield to survive enemies that weren't killed and repeating the process is an effective gameplay loop you'll find yourself using.</p><p>Below, you can find the skills we recommend for the Warrior in Path of Exile 2:</p><ul><li>Mace Strike</li><li>Earthquake</li><li>Boneshatter</li><li>Shockwave Totem</li><li>Infernal Cry</li><li>Leap Slam</li><li>Sunder</li><li>Ancestral Warrior Totem</li><li>Hammer of the Gods</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416248-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.09.05.97.png" data-ref-id="1300-4416248" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416248-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.09.05.97.png" data-ref-id="1300-4416248"></a><figcaption>All skills for the Warrior in Path of Exile 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416248-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.09.05.97.png"></figure><p>The best Warrior build really can't come to fruition until you complete Act 3 on standard difficulty in Path of Exile 2. The build's best skills don't come until after you get into the acts again on Cruel difficulty. Skills like Sunder, Ancestral Warrior Totem, and Hammer of the Gods are quite effective for mobs and bosses but are unlocked late.</p><p>As such, using skills like Earthquake, Boneshatter, Shockwave Tote, and Infernal Cry is going to be your best bet for the early game in Acts 1-3. The build really picks up when you unlock Leap Slam, which pairs perfectly with Bone Shatter and a two-handed weapon. You can use these two skills in concert to deal massive damage and also avoid enemy attacks in the process. Also, using Infernal Cry before performing a combo will only boost the damage you deal, so make sure you're spamming that as much as possible.</p><p>In the early game, Mace Strike is an effective way to clear mobs, but it slowly gets out-paced by other skills. Earthquake, Boneshatter, and Shockwave Totem are decent skills that deal AoE damage, but they take a while to get off.</p><h2>Best Warrior Support and Spirit Gems</h2><p>Moving on with your build, your next task is to equip your <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-how-to-get-uncut-skill-gems/1100-6528278/" data-ref-id="1100-6528278">Skill Gems</a> with the right Support Gems as well as equip some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-how-to-get-uncut-spirit-gems/1100-6528331/" data-ref-id="1100-6528331">Spirit Gems</a> to grant you persistent buffs during combat.</p><p>Here are some Support Gems we recommend for a few skills, as well as the best Spirit Gems to use:</p><p><strong>Support Gems</strong></p><ul><li>Martial Tempo (all skills, but Leap Slam specifically)</li><li>Momentum (Leap Slam)</li><li>Holy Descent (Leap Slam)</li><li>Magnified Effect (all skills, but Earthquake/Shockwave Totem specifically)</li><li>Impact Shockwave (Boneshatter)</li><li>Brutality</li><li>Fist of War (Hammer of the Gods)</li><li>Primal Armament (Hammer of the Gods)</li><li>Supercritical (Sunder)</li><li>Concentrated Effect (Sunder)</li><li>Premeditation (Infernal Cry)</li><li>Raging Cry (Infernal Cry)</li><li>Rage</li><li>Deep Cuts (Mace Strike)</li><li>Heft (Mace Strike/Hammer of the Gods)</li><li>Font of Rage (Ancestral Warrior Totem)</li><li>Splinter (Ancestral Warrior Totem)</li></ul><p><strong>Spirit Gems</strong></p><ul><li>Overwhelming Presence</li><li>Scavenged Plating</li></ul><h2>Best Warrior Passive Skills</h2><p>As you level up with the Warrior, you'll gain one Passive Point to allocate to the Passive Ability Skill Tree. The Warrior's skill tree is fairly straightforward, as you want to mainly put points toward Strength, physical damage, and AoE damage.</p><p>Here are some Passive Abilities we suggest for the Warrior:</p><ul><li>Brutal</li><li>Sturdy Metal</li><li>Smash</li><li>Unstoppable Barrier</li><li>Blade Catcher</li><li>Beef</li><li>Sudden Infuriation</li><li>Lasting Trauma</li><li>Skullcrusher</li><li>Split the Earth</li><li>Resolute Technique</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416249-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.06.22.45.png" data-ref-id="1300-4416249" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416249-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.06.22.45.png" data-ref-id="1300-4416249"></a><figcaption>The Warrior's Passive Ability Skill Tree.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416249-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.06.22.45.png"></figure><p>You'll also want to put points into different Strength attribute nodes wherever you can, as the Warrior can never have too much of it.</p><h2>Best Warrior Ascendancy in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>Finally, we've arrived at the Warrior's Ascendancy, which you can choose after slogging through the leveling process with the class. There are two choices for the Warrior's Ascendancy, which are: The Titan and Warbringer.</p><p>The key difference between the two Ascendancies is what you want to prioritize. The Titan is more about dealing damage while the Warbringer has some more defensive-minded abilities that help you survive against large mobs and bosses. With the current state of the Warrior being a little weaker, we recommend the Warbringer. You can take advantage of abilities like the Jade Heritage skill to absorb damage without it affecting your HP, making boss fights much more bearable.</p><p>However, in the future, the Titan Ascendancy will likely be the stronger pick after some buffs to the Warrior as a whole.</p>

			<p>We've brought in the new year, and we are now in 2025, where there are plenty of big-name titles that are set to release. There have already been a number of predictions, especially when it comes to the state of the video game industry, which has had a very volatile couple of years. Last year saw a devastating number of layoffs. However, according to Jason Schreier, things will be looking up in 2025 for the industry as a whole.</p>
<p>2024 ended with a lot of announcements for 2025 and, of course, the long-awaited Game Awards. The event saw many new game announcements, including the surprise announcement of<a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/"> Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>. However, there have also been a ton of rumors about upcoming titles, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-quality/">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, a game that is eagerly awaited by fans of the franchise.</p>
<p>In addition, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-01-03/video-game-predictions-for-2025-from-grand-theft-auto-vi-to-silksong?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczNTkyNzI4MiwiZXhwIjoxNzM2NTMyMDgyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUElZMDdUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.G8QUT2LbVY_4QAMSSgnnHB1OqBGcv939rI9lcczGAJU&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schreier predicts</a> that there will be major changes coming for <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-shareholders-are-reportedly-discussing-buyout-terms/">Ubisoft</a>. Out of all of the predictions, this one would be the least surprising. Ubisoft has had an incredibly tumultuous couple of years, with both Star Wars Outlaws and XDefiant not performing how the company wanted. It is so much so that the servers for <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisofts-xdefiant-will-be-closing-down-for-good-in-june-2025/">XDefiant are being shut down later this year</a>, with no new players being able to try out the game before it disappears.</p>
<p>According to the post by Schreier, Grand Theft Auto VI isn't going to perform as well as Rockstar Games may think. It is one of the most anticipated games of this year, as it's been a long time in the making, with many leaks coming out. However, being so highly anticipated puts a lot of pressure on Rockstar Games to perform, which could lead to negative consequences for the upcoming title.</p>
<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong has been a long time coming, and as the months and years pass, it feels as if we hear even less about the game. So much so that people are beginning to wonder if it even exists at all. This game was first announced in 2019 after initially being slated to be a DLC. However, the scope increased massively and has now become a full title in development by Team Cherry. The last we heard was from <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1824923122929119364" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoff Keighley in 2024</a> before Gamescom that there would be no announcements, as "Team Cherry is still cooking." The game was initially meant to be released in 2023, but they've said they are still developing it. Whether we'll actually see it released this year remains to be seen.</p>
<p>People are also hoping for a Half-Life announcement, as Half-Life: Alyx was released in 2020 but was only available to those who have VR. Last year saw a lot of rumors about Half-Life, and the possibility of the game making a resurgence with a new addition to the franchise. There is potential, but there's no certainty behind this rumor.</p>
<p>What are your video game predictions for 2025?</p>

          <p>With Valve's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/proton-update-gets-18-more-windows-games-running-on-linux-including-chex-quest-hd/">impressive work on the Proton tool for Linux</a> and the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2023/06/apple-has-a-proton-like-game-porting-toolkit-for-getting-windows-games-on-mac/">Mac's Game Porting Toolkit</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/06/new-directx-12-to-metal-translation-could-bring-a-world-of-windows-games-to-macos/">CrossOver</a> options, few games are truly "Windows only" these days. The exceptions are those with aggressive, Windows-based anti-cheating tools baked in, something that hit back hard against players eager to dive into a new superhero shooter.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a>, an <em>Overwatch</em>-ish free-to-play hero shooter released in early December 2024, has all the typical big online game elements: an in-game shop with skins and customizations, battle passes, and anti-cheating tech. While Proton, which powers the Linux-based Steam Deck's ability to play just about any Windows game, has come very far in a few years' time, its biggest blind spots are these kinds of online-only games, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/09/gta-online-is-broken-on-steam-deck-following-anti-cheat-update/">like <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/why-the-steam-deck-might-be-too-open-for-fortnite-and-destiny-2/"><em>Fortnite</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/why-the-steam-deck-might-be-too-open-for-fortnite-and-destiny-2/">Apex Legends</a>,&nbsp;</em>and the like. The same goes for Mac players, who, if they can work past DirectX 12, can often get a Windows game working in CrossOver or Parallels, minus any anti-cheat tools.</p>
<p>Is there harm in trying? For a while, there was 100 years' worth. As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/macgaming/comments/1hrsitf/marvel_rivals_banning_mac_os_users/">detailed in the r/macgaming subreddit</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1hs39mf/can_proton_cause_you_to_get_flagged_for_cheating/">at r/SteamDeck</a>, many players who successfully got <em>Marvel Rivals</em> working would receive a "Penalty Issued" notice, with a violation "detected" and bans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1hs2s6z/ban_until_2124_for_cheating_but_i_didnt_cheat/">issued until 2124</a>. Should such a ban stand, players risked entirely missing the much-prophesied Year of the Linux Desktop or Mainstream Mac Gaming, almost certain to happen at some point in that span.</p>

                <p>A designer on The Rise of the Golden Idol has announced his own game, City of Voices. The game is a collaboration between his own studio, Kimi Games, and pixel artist Matt Frith.
