            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-vatican-city<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Given how popular&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>is, it's no stretch to imagine that the game has been played all around the world, but Larian has revealed that two people in a very unusual place indeed have enjoyed the game.</p>

<p>According to publishing director <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1855995474492207263" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Michael Douse on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, two copies of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>have been sold in Vatican City, and one person there has it on their Steam wishlist as well.</p>

<p>Douse rather amusingly says he likes to imagine the wishlisting person is "the Pope waiting until he has a free minute", expressing a wish to "see their mod list" and suggesting said list is "absolutely gnarly". That seems like an understatement.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-vatican-city-karniss.jpg?itok=q9QxJQxL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-vatican-city-karniss.jpg?itok=TAhuSMY4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>has somehow sold two copies in the Vatican, of all places.</figcaption></figure><p>Technically speaking, the Vatican is a city-state in its own right, although it does qualify as the smallest state in the world. At <a href="https://www.vaticanstate.va/it/stato-governo/note-generali/popolazione.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">last count</a>, 764 people inhabited Vatican City, with 618 of those people being citizens.</p>

<p>It should go without saying that Vatican City is an intensely religious place, so it's quite amusing to imagine someone living in such a place playing&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, a game that might have been considered heretical by the Catholic Church just a few decades ago.</p>

<p>Perhaps even more amusingly, <a href="https://x.com/samito/status/1856006701259816994" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">one person</a> in the replies to Douse's original post suggests that the two Vatican City sales of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>were a "clerical error". Badum, and indeed, tish.</p>

<p>In any case, I hope the two Vatican City players of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>are enjoying it, whoever they happen to be, and I hope whoever has it on their wishlist decides to take the plunge and buy it. You won't regret it!</p>

They include Switch bundles, $20 to $30 off games ranging from <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> to <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, and discounted controllers. Here’s the full list so far:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><strong>Hardware</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li> Switch <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> Bundle - $300 (normally $380)</li><li>Switch OLED <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> Bundle - $350 (normally $430)</li><li>Switch Lite Hyrule Edition w/ Online + Expansion Pack - $210 (normally $250) </li></ul><p><strong>Games</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>The Legend of Zeld: Tears of the Kingdom</em> - $50 (normally $70)</li><li><em>Super Mario Maker 2</em> - $40 (normally $60)</li><li><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons - </em>$40 (normally $60)</li><li><em>Pikmin 4</em> - $40 (normally $60)</li><li><em>Nintendo Switch Sports - </em>$40 (normally $60)</li><li><em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em> - $40 (normally $60)</li><li><em>﻿Super Mario Odyssey </em>- $30 (normally $60)</li><li><em>Pikmin 1 + 2 </em>- $30 (normally $60)</li></ul><p><strong>Accessories</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li> Neon Red and Neon Blue Joy-Con controllers - $60 (normally $80)</li><li>Switch Pro Controller - $50 (normally $70)</li><li><em>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> Switch Carrying Case - $15 (normally $25)</li></ul></blockquote><p>As has become something of a seasonal tradition, the <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> bundle is back in pole position, with both base Switch and OLED variants that essentially include the hit party racing game for free as well as a year of Switch Online. The Expansion Pack portion is missing though, which is a shame since that’s what includes access to all of the <em>Mario Kart 8 DLC </em>for free (otherwise it’s $30 extra).</p><p>In fact, Nintendo is pushing Switch Online memberships big-time as part of its Black Friday deals this year. The Hyrule Edition Switch Lite, which looks fantastic, will be bundled with a year of Switch Online + Expansion Pack for $40 off. The subscription includes access to dozens of games from the NES, SNES, Nintendo 64, Game Boy, Game Boy Advance, and Sega Genesis libraries. </p><p>When it comes to games, there’s no noteworthy deals on anything that got released this year or even in late 2023 like <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> or<em> Super Mario RPG</em>. Then again, $20 off <em>Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> isn’t bad by Nintendo’s normally stingy standards. While it never got DLC, the game’s world is so massive, it still essentially feels like a forever game. I have over 100 hours in it and still haven’t seen everything. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-project-u-development/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-ubisoft%E2%80%99s-project-u-is-back-to-the-drawing-board-after-5-years-of-development.1033797/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-project-u-development/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft’s Project U returned to the drawing board this year following five years of development.</p>



<p>Project U was officially announced in September 2022 as a revolutionary “new kind of session-based cooperative shooter,” but after over two years since its announcement, nothing publically about the game has yet been announced. That’s because <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-project-u-gameplay-details-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project U</a>, internally codenamed Pathfinder, quietly returned to the drawing board in Spring 2024 following issues surrounding the game’s replayability.</p>



<p>For those unfamiliar with Project U, its premise is that Earth has been invaded by machines that want to mechanize all life. The game would see ten teams of four battle it out in PvE combat against progressively more difficult enemies as they progressed through the map’s zones, which could have thousands of enemy AI robots on the map at any given time. Eventually, players would enter the final zone in the middle of the map, where they’d need to defeat the boss.</p>



<p>Despite initially receiving generally positive feedback from players, one fundamental flaw plagued the game from the start: its replayability. Sources say it was a constant issue for the developers and would see the project’s budget balloon due to continuous reworks. Such reworks included adding more variations to the map with biomes and adding new bosses to change its repetitive nature; however, playtests in February 2024 revealed that the game lacked the replayability needed.</p>



<div><p>In March 2024, Ubisoft Annecy announced that Project U (codenamed Pathfinder) development would cease immediately and that outsourcing studios would move on to different projects. Two of the game Directors, Mathieu Granjon and Damien Kieken left the project among many other developers, with Granjon moving to Assassin’s Creed and Kieken eventually making his way to DICE this month.</p><p>Instead of being canceled, Ubisoft internally noted that PvE games can still be successful, citing the viral launch of Helldivers 2, which sold an estimated million units in its first five weeks. As such, it’s said that Ubisoft still believes in the project and moved Project U back into incubation with a new producer and a small team to explore new ideas. However, after over five years of development, current and past project developers tell me it’s difficult to see how the game would succeed.</p></div>



<p>Will Project U end up being another decade-long project at Ubisoft? Only time will tell.</p>



<p>&nbsp;What do you think of Ubisoft returning to the drawing board with Project U? Let us know in the comments or our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/south-of-midnight-first-preview-compulsion-games-bets-big-on-art-music-and-deep-south-folklore<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Hypnotized by that southern charm.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether you adored 2013 indie darling Contrast or were disappointed by 2016’s We Happy Few, it’s hard to argue that developer Compulsion Games doesn’t swing for the fences and try new things. After spending a day with the team taking a closer look at South of Midnight, it’s clear that innovation streak hasn’t slowed down one bit, and I went from mild curiosity to full-blown hype for this unique action-adventure game. Though I didn’t see anything that blew my socks off in terms of gameplay, it stood out in just about every other way, especially with its striking setting, curious stop motion animation, and stellar original soundtrack. That all left me eager to see more and play it for myself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">South of Midnight is set in a part of the world we don’t see too often in games: the American deep south. It isn’t just a backdrop for you to fight monsters, but rather the entire premise on which the adventure sits, with characters, folklore, and mythical creatures all drawn from real-world places and stories. During a hands-off demo, I saw flooded wetlands after a recent storm, mosquito-riddled swamps, and ostentatious Antebellum manors, each infused with elements of fantasy I’d not seen anywhere else.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">South of Midnight Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These exotic places fit nicely with an equally unusual art style that emulates stop motion animation – yet another rarity in games, and one that would be sure to fog up Guillermo del Toro’s glasses. The whole thing looks like it was ripped from the pages of a children’s story book, which I really dug. It definitely took some getting used to at first, as the jerky movement might easily be mistaken for framerate wonkiness to the untrained eye, but it also adds to the otherworldly fantasy charm that South of Midnight oozes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It can sometimes be pretty difficult to understand how exactly a game will feel to play during a hands-off demo, but in the case of South of Midnight touching a controller wasn’t necessary to recognize its best quality: its music. Each level has you facing off against a cryptid from deep south folklore as southern-inspired blues and jazz intensifies and the lyrics help tell the story of whatever beast you’re tracking down. In the case of this demo, it was an enormous alligator called Two-Toed Tom (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-Toed_Tom" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>based on an actual legendary creature</u></a>). At first the music started slow with a slick bassline and a choir whispering “Two-Toed Tom,” but by the time we unraveled the mystery of the mythical gator and progressed to the final confrontation, the chorus reached a fevered pitch, the words of which told the tale of poor, old Tom.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"The setting, art, and music set South of Midnight apart in a major way and made me extremely excited to get my hands on it."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these components – the setting, art, and music – set South of Midnight apart in a major way and made me extremely excited to get my hands on it. The flipside of that is that what I saw of gameplay offered far less originality. Combat looked like a pretty by-the-numbers system of dodging, striking, and finishing moves that are quite well-trodden, and exploration relied on double jumping, midair dashing, and grappling to distant locations that are pretty standard stuff. The boss fight against Two-Toed Tom, for example, was a very repetitive process of leaping over telegraphed attacks and whaling on the gator when he presented obvious opportunity to do so.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Compulsion Games says that while they expect gameplay to be engaging, it isn’t nearly as much of a focus as the story, music, and other elements they’ve clearly put the lion’s share of work into. Instead, they’re keeping levels relatively short for a ten-ish hour story and putting all of their chips into South of Midnight’s exceptional presentation and worldbuilding, and so far I’m convinced they just might pull it off. After all, even without playing it myself, it’s made a great impression on me. Here’s hoping it delivers when we finally get to play it next year.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In September 2023, the North Carolina studio behind Fortnite and Unreal Engine <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-maker-epic-games-laying-off-870-employees"><u>suffered a significant round of layoffs</u></a> that saw 830 employees, about 16% of its workforce, lose their jobs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Separately, Epic divested music service platform Bandcamp and spun off most of SuperAwesome, a kid-safe technology company. These were acquired by Epic Games in 2022 and 2020, respectively. Around 250 people left Epic through the divestitures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, Sweeney said the company had been spending “way more money than we earn, investing in the next evolution of Epic and growing Fortnite as a metaverse-inspired ecosystem for creators.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He also pointed to a “major structural change to our economics” after Fortnite growth transitioned from the explosively popular and highly profitable battle royale that funded its initial expansion, to the lower margin business that came from creator content with significant revenue sharing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking during a presentation at Unreal Fest 2024, Sweeney said that Epic “spent the last year rebuilding and really executing solidly on all fronts.” He added: "I'm happy to tell you now that the company is financially sound, and that Fortnite and the Epic Games Store have hit new records in concurrency and success."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On that front, Fortnite hit 110 million monthly active users over the 2023 holiday season, an impressive milestone for a game now seven years old. To put that into context, in August 2018 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/20/fortnite-had-biggest-month-ever-in-august-with-783-million-players"><u>Fortnite hit 78.3 million MAUs</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic rarely makes Fortnite player numbers public, and when it does so it uses various metrics that make direct comparisons difficult. Last year's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/fortnite/Fortnite_Chapter_4_Season_OG_Map"><u>Season OG</u></a>, which brought back the Chapter 1 Season 5 map and with it classic areas like Tilted Towers, Pleasant Park, and Risky Reels, saw Fortnite hit a new peak of 44.7 million players in just one day. Epic previously said Fortnite saw a <em>concurrent</em> player record of 15.3 million players for the December 2020 end-of-season live event, which saw players teaming up with Iron Man, Wolverine, and other Marvel heroes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-galactus-event-start-time-what-to-expect-battle-bus-glitch"><u>to defeat Galactus</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p dir="ltr">At the height of its popularity, Tomb Raider was everywhere, from video games to big-budget movies. Tomb Raider comic books were also produced, and if you've been looking to get your hands on the first run of issues printed by Top Cow, then prepare yourself for some good news. Dark Horse has announced Tomb Raider: Colossal Collection Volume 1, a gigantic reprint of Lara Croft's first adventures that began in 1999. Priced at $99, this massive 888-page hardcover is now available to preorder and will be released on June 25, 2025.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4397764-tomb-raider-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4397764" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4397764-tomb-raider-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4397764"></a><figcaption>Tomb Raider: Colossal Collection Volume One</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4397764-tomb-raider-2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Top Cow's Tomb Raider comics have long been out of print, and the older "Archive" editions fetch an astronomical sum on the reseller market, often going for hundreds of dollars each. This hardcover looks to be a <em>nearly </em>comprehensive collection, as it contains issues #1-24 and #26-34 from the first run.</p><p dir="ltr">In case you're wondering, issue #25 saw Lara Croft team up with Witchblade. Tomb Raider was licensed to Top Cow at the time, and with the rights lapsed, it's likely that there were probably a few legal issues that made it easier to omit that particular comic book rather than include it.</p><p dir="ltr">The Tomb Raider series ran for 50 issues from 1999 to 2005, and it was pretty popular as it was released during the peak of Tomb Raider-mania. The comics were set in the same continuity as the games developed by Core Design, making a few tweaks to Lara Croft's story along the way. A pretty talented roster of artists and writers were involved in this series, including Dan Jurgens, Adam Hughes, Michael Turner, Andy Park, Marc Silvestri, David Finch, and several others.</p><hr><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4398010-evercadetombraider.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4398010" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4398010-evercadetombraider.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4398010"></a><figcaption>Evercade EXP-R with Tomb Raider games</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4398010-evercadetombraider.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you're looking for some more Tomb Raider gear, you can also check out the upcoming <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Evercade-Gaming-Handheld-Console-Atari-2600/dp/B0D1VZQ2VL?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Evercade EXP-R</a>.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> COD Warzone &amp; Black Ops 6 - Season 01 Battle Pass Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As seen in the trailer above, the page designs are similar to Fortnite's style of battle pass. Each page features several items that can be unlocked in any order, giving players more choice and flexibility. Unlocking all the items on a page will then grant a high-tier item called the HVT reward.</p><p dir="ltr">Just like previous years, players can still choose to have their battle pass tokens automatically unlock rewards sequentially, or they can turn the auto feature off and pick and choose the order they want to unlock.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 1's pass includes the new Krig C assault rifle and Saug submachine gun in the free tiers of the pass, while the paid version includes several high-end operator skins and weapon blueprints. The extra-premium BlackCell pass also returns with tons of additional content and battle pass tier skips.</p><p dir="ltr">For more on Call of Duty, make sure to check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-roadmap-shows-mp-maps-7-new-weapons-and-castle-map-for-zombies/2900-5940/#11">all the major highlights from the Season 1</a> roadmap, including new multiplayer maps, the first look at the upcoming Zombies map, and all the big changes for Warzone.</p>

It’s something I’ve grown to love very much, and I’ve developed a few basic principles for how I approach things that I’d like to share. These techniques straddle the border between visual design and tech because that’s my skillset, and they’re mostly designed to create something acceptable as fast as possible. If you specialize in UI/UX, you may even be offended by my low-brow approach! But I hope you can forgive me and we can still be friends.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="One neat trick">One neat trick</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When I’m looking into a new project, art direction is one of the first things I establish, and the art direction naturally guides the appearance of the UI as well. Once I have a general idea of how the game will look, I usually program a few helper functions/shaders to make certain effects or shapes as easy as possible to drop in anywhere. Then, for years after that, I use those little helper functions everywhere… all of the time… for everything.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That’s the entire trick, but we can look at it in practice with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Beastieball.</span></span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Parallelograms and patterns in Beastieball">Parallelograms and patterns in Beastieball</h2><p>Images via Greg Lobanov/Klei Publishing.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Beastieball</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> UI, the key theme is all parallelograms because they are the sportiest shape. (I think ESPN did this). The game is an RPG with a lot of UI, numbers and lists, so this basic style works great because it’s just </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>barely</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> a twist on the most boring, simple layout style you can do, which is just putting text in rectangles. The slight skew, and arranging things on an angle rather than straight up and down, makes the game feel infinitely more stylish. In the biz, this is what we call "art direction."</span></p><p>The other main repeating visual motif are the looping shape patterns (dots, lines, diamonds) which scroll ambiently. Images and captions via Greg Lobanov/Klei Publishing.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All of these were supported by very simple one-line functions, which I used everywhere, brainlessly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>draw_pgram(x1,y1,x2,y2) </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">was the first of these I wrote. It just draws a parallelogram within the specified boundaries. The angle of the tilt is determined by a universal macro/global number which I basically never changed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>shader_set_scrollpattern(graphicAsset, color) </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">was another one. I created a shader which would take an input texture (like a scrolling dot pattern) and overlay it on whatever was rendered after that, with the texture position slowly scrolling over time. So for example, if I set this shader to use a dot pattern and a yellow color, then rendered a pink parallelogram, the result would be a pink parallelogram with scrolling yellow dots on it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That’s pretty much it. The entire UI style of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Beastieball</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was founded on basic one-line functions like this. Some of the cleverness comes in the consistency of application; by using these visual motifs for EVERYTHING, I sometimes ran into problems conveying the info I needed. But I persevered and made everything work without ever breaking the boundaries I’d set. As a developer, this can be seen as a sort of laziness, but to players I think the effect is also one of the game having a very clear and consistent visual style.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Lazy tweens">Lazy tweens</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I need to credit my college professor </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="http://jervo.org/">Jervis Thompson</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for this one. I use it so many times per day, I sometimes forget that it might(?) not be common knowledge to everyone. It’s basically a braindead method for having stuff move around the screen in a pleasing way, using as few codelines and states as possible. This is it:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Position += (TargetPosition - Position) * Speed;</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Where </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Position</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the current position of a UI element (this could also be its angle, scale, opacity, or any variable, really).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>TargetPosition</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the intended final resting place of that element.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Speed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a value above 0 and below 1. My favorite value for Speed is 0.3 but maybe you’ll find your own which you like even more!</span></p><p>Images via Greg Lobanov/Klei Publishing.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This simple sort of code is what drives a ton of tiny UI animations in the game, like the scale and position of elements animating when you open and close a menu. It’s really easy to add this anywhere, and it always makes things look better, so it’s a good habit to get into if you’re a complete hack (affectionate) like myself and Jervis.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Indexed palettes">Indexed palettes</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I use this technique everywhere I possibly can, not just in UI. But, basically: I define a small list of colors, and then every UI element gets its color by referencing one of those pre-defined colors by index (i.e. color 1, color 2, color 3…). I do this rather than defining the colors for each asset, or using imported image assets with colors already on them, because it makes it very easy to adjust the colors as I go, and also ensures that every visual element is harmonious.</span></p><p>I can also swap out the list of colors easily to create visual theme options for players that work across all menus. Images and captions via Greg Lobanov/Klei Publishing.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="UI should support the core gameplay">UI should support the core gameplay</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is the part where I get more annoying and philosophical about UI design like I’m some kind of sage.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I think it’s really important to recognize that UI is the player’s window into the soul of your game. The things that you choose to show them, and NOT show them, entirely define their understanding of your world. So be careful about overusing or underusing UI… think about where you want the player’s attention to be and where you want them to look to find certain information. A classic example of overwrought UI would be when maps in games are easier to navigate than the game world itself, leading players to navigate purely by UI and ignore all your amazing environments, etc.</span></p><p>Images via Greg Lobanov/Klei Publishing.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’ll share one specific example where I avoided UI overuse (in my opinion). In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wandersong</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, there’s a section with a bunch of different islands you can visit, each containing parts of a larger puzzle/quest so the player has to navigate around between them. Generally, the game is a side-scroller, and my initial plan for navigating the islands was to add some sort of quick menu that would let the player fast travel between them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But when it came time to implement, the menu idea seemed incredibly boring for an over-the-top adventure like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wandersong</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. I wound up adding a special screen that was unlike anything else in the game, wherein you used singing to steer a pirate boat around instead. It does feature a map of the islands, which you can quickly bring up with a button press </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>(that’s a lazy tween…), </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">but you can’t move while looking at the map, so it invites you to plan a route and then sing your way there. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>(Also, we hid a secret bonus island under the character’s thumb).</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Mechanically speaking, it’s very shallow, and it certainly added a lot of extra travel time. But it also remains one of the most popular segments of the game and one players frequently comment on, I think in part because of the way it breaks with expectations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The lesson here isn’t that all fast travel menus should be replaced with a musical pirate boat, but more that it’s worth taking the extra time to consider your approach to game elements and to be intentional about how and when you use different interfaces. A fast travel menu is convenient, but it also invites players to look at your world in a more utilitarian way, and takes away the simple pleasure of moving yourself from point A to point B. It’s a great fit for lots of games, but maybe not all of them.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Core gameplay supports the UI">Core gameplay supports the UI</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">OK, last point to make from way up here on my high horse.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You know how I said UI is the player’s window to the game’s soul? Well, it’s also yours as the developer. It’s an organized visual representation of the chaotic, dark inner world of the thing you’re making. And when your game has problems, sometimes those will first surface in the UI. Because of this, it can be helpful to actually design your game’s underlying systems in such a way that they support the UI (!).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This was an idea that was crystallized really well in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/into-the-breach-interface-design">Into the Breach</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/into-the-breach-interface-design">’s design post-mortems</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which I think all designers could stand to learn from.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’ll say this has come up all the time in a million tiny ways while designing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Beastieball</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and I’m sure any designer who’s worked on a tactics or RPG-style game can relate. To improve the clarity of UI, we put all sorts of restrictions on the design, such as how many status effects a move can apply. Sometimes, we’ll have a great idea for a new play or a new Beastie game mechanic, but it gets tossed out in the planning stage because we realize there’s simply no easy way to explain it to players. And, to be clear, I don’t think that compromises the quality of the game design… the fact that our ideas are too complex to communicate via UI means they are inherently confusing and unnecessary! The UI is just always our first clue to that realization.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In many ways, the design of the UI </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>is</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the game design, too. Even on larger teams that segment those into separate roles, I’d recommend that teams foster good communication and let UI designers have a voice in broader design decisions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Thanks for reading, I hope you go make some awesome video games!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> is reviving its beloved original map once again - but this time as a permanent mode.
</p>
<p>
Chapter 1 Season 1 of Fortnite will begin once more on 6th December, developer Epic Games said today, with future updates offering the chance to "relive OG seasons". 
</p>
<p>
Fans expect the permanent Fortnite OG mode to rotate through each of the game's first 10 seasons over time, giving players a chance to relive the map's various iterations. Remember when the meteor hit? When the iceberg arrived? When the volcano erupted?

<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-smashes-concurrent-user-records-as-over-6m-players-log-on-this-weekend">Fortnite OG originally returned last November to enormous success</a>, giving the game its best-ever player count of 44.7 million participants in 24 hours. As a result, Epic Games promised to revive Fortnite OG again this year. 
</p>
<p>
Exactly what that meant, however, remained unclear - until now. Earlier this year, Fortnite launched its faster-paced Reload mode based on a shrunk-down version of the game's OG map. And <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-estimated-release-date-and-time">Fortnite is currently hosting another OG-style take, this time of its Chapter 2 incarnation</a> - although now remixed with various musical stars like Eminem and Snoop Dogg.

<p>
It should be made clear, all of this comes alongside Fortnite's next all-new map. Fortnite Chapter 6 is expected to arrive on Sunday, 1st December, meaning players have around five days to check that out before the OG mode goes live. 
</p>
<p>

		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> pulled up to the starting line with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/04/sony-confirm-the-55-ps5-pro-enhanced-games-for-launch/">a broad list of 55 games that were PS5 Pro enhanced</a> at launch. While we’re still waiting for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gran-turismo-7">Gran Turismo 7’s</a> update, three of these are racing games – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/24/ea-sports-f1-24-review/">F1 24</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/29/the-crew-motorfest-review/">The Crew Motorfest</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/13/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-review/">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a> – and they really do give us the full highs and lows of what PS5 Pro Enhanced games can be with different results thanks to a trio of bespoke in-house game engines.</p>
<p><iframe title="PS5 Pro Enhanced Racing Game Round-up –&nbsp;F1 24, The Crew Motorfest, Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mHMdNTV6IE8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Let’s start with The Crew Motorfest, which would appear to be the most straightforward. As a cross-gen game it’s inherently very scalable son base PS5 you had two graphics modes because of this, giving you a pretty much locked 30FPS in Quality mode and generally solid 60FPS in its Performance mode. Visual quality between the two is pretty much identical outside of resolution –&nbsp;a full 4K target in Quality mode, and a dynamic 1440p with FSR2 upscaling in Performance mode –&nbsp;though there’s some more noticeable pop-in for smaller scenery items and shadows in performance mode, arriving at roughly half the distance to the camera.</p>


<p id="caption-attachment-454498">The overhead lanterns pop in at around 215m for PS5 Pro, 175m for PS5 ‘Fidelity’, and 115m for PS5 ‘Performance.</p>
<p>The PS5 Pro ditches the graphics setting, giving you a 60FPS target and a 4K output, but it using PSSR upscaling to enable Ubisoft Ivory Tower to push some higher quality effects, as detailed in the patch notes.</p>

<p>Screen Space Reflections are still used here, as opposed to a jump to ray tracing, but they use higher level of detail to make car bodies and water look more precisely reflective, so you have the same weaknesses that SSR give you, such as driving under a bridge darkening all the road’s surface light reflections for a moment. They’ve also increased the shadowmap cascade detail, to give sharper shadowing. Then there’s a 15% bump in world objects and foliage, aiming to fill out crowds that bit more, upgraded volumetric clouds, and an increase in the number of Image-Based Lighting elements to again improve quality of lighting and reflections. With PSSR, the game should have around 1700p before upscaling to 4K, and the result is sharp and good looking.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-454496">Outside of some minor pop in and a softer image, PS5 ‘Performance’ holds up well.</p>
<p>The thing is that this all feels like the RPG looting and perks where you get a 2% upgrade to damage output – it’s a little bit underwhelming. The PS5’s performance mode is really the go-to, with FSR2 working fairly well from a 1080p to 1440p core resolution range, and while that does give a softer image, it’s honestly quite difficult to spot when you’re 2 or 3 meters from your TV. Get closer and the PS5 Pro does take that step forward, but without the highlighted features from Ubisoft, I was very hard pressed spotting the differences outside of sharpness. Not only that, but there are minor dips in performance still, which I could find when skimming through frame-by-frame for points of comparison.</p>
<p>Still, this is a good “does what it says on the tin” kind of upgrade.</p>
<hr>
<p>Moving on to F1 24, and we get meaningful ray-tracing on console for the first time in this series. Ray tracing first debuted with F1 21 on PC, but on console had only ever been featured during non-racing moments. Now with the PS5 Pro, ray tracing is featured in racing for the first time and in a rather refined form as Codemasters have iterated on their EGO engine.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-454489">F1 24 ray tracing is best seen during wet races.</p>
<p>First things first, F1 24 has a different meaning to quality and performance than most games. The base PS5 Quality here is the 60fps game mode with a native 4K target, while Performance shoots for 120fps.</p>
<p>Really the only place for the PS5 Pro to go is for adding ray tracing on track. There’s the eye-catching ray-traced reflections, of course, but that’s joined by ray traced ambient occlusion (RTAO) for improved shading, and dynamic diffuse global illumination (DDGI). The main one that’s missing on PS5 Pro during a race is ray traced shadows. Put things together and, depending on the time of day, the lighting and weather, this can all lead to some quite notable changes.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-454494">The screen is no longer reflected unrealistically on the wet track surface.</p>
<p>The difference is most strikingly rendered on a very wet race day. The base PS5 uses screen space reflections, but with a wet and shiny asphalt surface, the limits of SSR are shown as it can be excessive and give an over-the top mirroring effect, where reality would be much more subtle. By contrast, ray traced reflections are a little less… shouty, let’s say. Things like billboards on bridges and big screens are no longer reflected in the wet floor as their reflected or emitted light is more rapidly diffused onto the rough surface.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-454492">Spot the ray-traced reflections in the glass barriers at Melbourne.</p>
<p>However, there are still more shiny ray-traced reflections on show. You can spot it in places like the reflective protective glass along the pit wall at Albert Park mirroring the grand stands opposite, as opposed to being a white reflection of the sky, as just one trackside example, or on the often shiny front wheel vanes that will now reflect the scenery you’re zipping past. One neat improvement is that, where SSR in bodywork refreshed at 30Hz on PS5, the ray-traced reflections update at 60Hz on PS5 Pro.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-454490">RTAO adds shading to the trees in the track scenery.</p>
<p>RTAO and DDGI both also really help to bring more realistic feeling light and shade to the environment, and this is most noticeable on tracks at night, where trees behind trackside barriers are no longer uniformly lit through all their branches, and even further in the backdrops, you can see the skyscrapers in Singapore lit directionally in a way that fits with a city’s nighttime lighting. During the day, take a comparative peek at covered grandstands and you’ll notice that they’re more shaded inside</p>
<p>You’ll spend a lot of time look at the exhaust and rear end of both rivals and your own car if you race third person, and there’s a lot of complexity to the self-shading and reflections that come from the flowing bodywork, suspension and rear wings that is better represented here.</p>
<p>All in all, there’s a pretty good case for bringing ray tracing into racing games as GPU power is increasing… so long as the same frame rate target can be met. The thing is that, as will be familiar to PC gamers, adding ray tracing is expensive, forcing you to sacrifice resolution and use upscaling to claw back the difference. Without ray-tracing the base PS5 has that native 4K target, but the PS5 Pro with ray tracing drops to a dynamic resolution limit of 1440p and uses Sony’s PSSR to get back to 4K. That’s a high enough resolution to give high quality results, though upscaling problem areas like chain fences can break up a bit in motion, having a more jagged, aliased appearance compared to the temporal anti-aliasing of the base PS5 game… not that this matters at the speeds you’re typically going!</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-454491">PSSR and the lower base resolution on PS5 Pro does lead to some more jaggies.</p>
<p>Two further features that the PS5 Pro offers to F1 24, though which we weren’t able to test at this time, were the 120Hz performance mode and an 8K resolution mode – both sacrificing ray tracing to get the job done.</p>
<p>On the whole, F1 24 on PS5 Pro is a success, folding in naturalistic ray-tracing features without impacting underlying performance. It’s an often subtle difference though, and you’re already starting from a 4K 60fps game on base PS5.</p>
<hr>
<p>Finally, we come to the runt of the litter with Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown. This open world racer had a troubled launch back in September with some spotty performance and image quality to go alongside its launch server issues. PS5 Pro support was added in patch 2 a few days ahead of the console release, but there’s very little song and dance about this. In fact, the messaging in general is rather confusing.</p>
<p>For the base PS5, patch 2 reportedly increases the resolution of the 30FPS quality mode from 1080p to 1440p, though it was meant to be 1440p at launch already. The update also makes certain optimisations to try and steady the frame rate in the 60fps performance mode, though dips are still pretty easy to find.</p>
<p id="caption-attachment-454493">There is no meaningful improvement for PS5 Pro in TDU Solar Crown.</p>
<p>For PS5 Pro, there’s no apparent difference in the settings –&nbsp;it’s the same Quality and Performance options with no naming distinction or description changes –&nbsp;and there’s no appreciable difference in frame rate, resolution or graphics targets. The PS5 Pro might be able to work at the top end of any dynamic resolution scaling and there’s perhaps some areas where frame stutters have been ironed out, but I’ve also found areas that do still stutter and resolution gains are debatable without pixel counting. There’s also identical visual quirks and glitches in areas glass building faces, shadow draw distances, and plenty more beside.</p>
<p>If you were hoping that PS5 Pro would be some kind of panacea to improve the game’s visuals, it sadly hasn’t been, and KT Racing still has a good bit of work to do if they’re to win over a somewhat disaffected community.</p>

<p>This is definitely a genre that can benefit from higher powered machines, whether it’s helping open world racers pull off 60fps, or feeding more ray tracing reflections, lighting and shading in to provide more realistic, true-to-life visuals. Though this trio of games definitely shows the variance in what different games, engines and developers can and will pull off.</p>
<p>And on the whole, I would say that it’s fair to be a little bit underwhelmed. The Crew looked good in PS5 performance mode, F1 24 was already at 4K 60 so leans on ray tracing to actually add more subtlety to its graphics instead of glitzy reflections that were already there, and Test Drive Unlimited is… well, it’s still in a difficult spot. So… see you for Gran Turismo 7, racing fans!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-msrp-had-been-dropped-to-379-99-in-the-us-until-december-24th.1033755/</guid>

			<p>Getting a brand new PlayStation 5 in the United States will be cheaper than ever for the next month or so, as the console's MSRP has been officially dropped for the holiday shopping season.</p>
<p>A new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J40QG4CVaww" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ad</a> shared today confirmed that the MSRP for the console's Digital Edition has been dropped to $379.99 from $449.99. The offer, which has only been confirmed for the US as of now, will be available until December 24th, so there will be plenty of time to take advantage of this deal before it ends.</p>
<p><iframe title="Play Has No Limits | PS5" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/J40QG4CVaww?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While an MSRP drop for the console's Standard Edition would have been welcome, those who wish to play retail versions of games still have the option of purchasing the external disc drive, although they may have a hard time doing so at a reasonable price as the recently released PlayStation 5 Pro is lacking a disc drive, leaving those wishing to play retail games with no other options other than buying one. Despite this shortcoming, the mid-generation system is still a worthwhile purchase for those who wish to experience games at their best, offering considerable visual and performance improvements, as seen in <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-god-of-war-ragnarok-pssr-framerate-down/">God of War Ragnarok</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-patch/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth.</a> More information on the console can be found in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Mark Cerny has crafted something amazing with the PlayStation 5 Pro, introducing new AI upscaling and PSSR rendering techniques that will make existing games look their best. Rather than being a new console entirely, Sony is positioning themselves as the graphics card upgrade that players have been asking for for years.</em></p>

<p>During Gamescom, Techland unveiled Dying Light: The Beast, a full-sized, standalone title that brings Kyle Crane back into the post-apocalyptic action. It has been almost a decade since Crane first appeared on our screens in Dying Light, and in this new adventure, he’s making a bold return.</p>



<p>The Beast is a unique title set in a rural region away from the dense urban sprawls of Harran or Villedor. It’s set 13 years after the events of the first Dying Light game, with players getting to assume control of a twisted, grizzled version of Kyle Crane.</p>

<h2 id="h-everything-we-wanted">Everything We Wanted</h2>



<p>Fans of the original Dying Light were enthused to learn that Roger Craig Smith is returning to play Kyle Crane in Dying Light: The Beast. I got to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-roger-craig-smith-dying-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sit down with Smith at Gamescom</a> and talk to him about this upcoming game, which is shaping up to be nothing short of phenomenal.</p>



<p>The Beast offers plenty of opportunity to explore a decent-sized world, and Techland has brought back drivable vehicles to make traversal all that more diverse. In this game, Crane has beast-like powers, hence the name of the game, and players can unleash devastating abilities as a result.</p>



<p>Like other Dying Light titles, The Beast will be playable either as a solo player or with up to three friends.</p>



<p>Recently, Techland revealed that Dying Light: The Beast had hit one million wishlists in just 10 weeks, a figure that’s indicative of the hype building behind the game. The franchise director of Dying Light, Tymon Smektala, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Thank you for believing in us and for your enthusiasm for Kyle Crane’s next adventure. Your excitement fuels our passion, and we are committed to delivering an unforgettable experience</em>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That pre-order performance makes The Beast the fastest-wishlisted game in franchise history, which is nothing short of impressive.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to returning to Kyle Crane’s character when Dying Light: The Beast is released next year? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/avatar-disney-concept-artist<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday the official social media account of the <em>Avatar </em>series <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zacharyberger.bsky.social/post/3lap2l5awjk2w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted some concept art by creature designer Zachary Berger</a>, which was then shared by the main Disney account, putting the image in front of potentially <em>hundreds of thousands </em>of people.&nbsp;</p><p>That's extremely common–big companies use art to hype and sell their stuff all the time–but what made this stand out was the fact that <a href="https://linktr.ee/artofzachary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Berger was directly credited</a>. That almost never happens!</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:vvcleiau3hx7bx4ojnokhl5q/app.bsky.feed.post/3lap2l5awjk2w" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreighcbx76skscshdv6e4x3qiffboguo7xpm5ovhljsrr636ubfqc5e"><p lang="en">Well, this is a career first - so cool to have artwork shared by the official accounts and actually have my name credited!! 🤯🤯🤯Speaks volumes about Dylan Cole, Ben Procter, Aashrita Kamath and the rest of the leadership for making sure the team receives proper credit!!</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:vvcleiau3hx7bx4ojnokhl5q?ref_src=embed">Zachary Berger (@zacharyberger.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:vvcleiau3hx7bx4ojnokhl5q/post/3lap2l5awjk2w?ref_src=embed">2024-11-11T19:30:30.422Z</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>Think about it: whenever you see a piece of production art featured in a social media post or a press release or a game announcement at a big televised showcase, all you ever see is the art. You never know who made it, whether it was created by an individual or a small team (or even a studio).&nbsp;</p><p>This isn't an accident! The companies who own these games never bother to credit the artist, because the art isn't seen as <em>art</em>. It's a brick, a piece of company property, which is why even <em>years </em>after a project is finished--or thrown in the bin before it can even reach that point--<a href="https://aftermath.site/most-video-game-artwork-will-never-be-seen" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">artists working in video games aren't allowed to share things they've created</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In this rare exception to the rule, Berger tells us the crediting was likely down to the fact that many of his bosses on the project come from an art background, like production designers Aashrita Kamath and Dylan Cole. "I have been working in the entertainment/film industry for around a decade and a half, and this has NEVER happened to me", Berger says. "It is an incredible reminder that we work with an amazing group of people who genuinely care about their team."</p><p>So this is cool! And if Avatar and Disney can do it, then anyone can do it, including big games publishers and marketing companies. More of this please!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We Happy Few developer Compulsion Games has released a half hour documentary all about its upcoming game, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a>.</p>
<p>South of Midnlight was first revealed in June last year, with an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/we-happy-few-developer-reveals-south-of-midnight-at-xbox-showcase">eye-catching and atmospheric stop motion trailer set in an alternate version of the American Deep South</a>. Described as a "fantastical" and "macabre third-person action-adventure", South of Midnight will place players in the role of a young Weaver named Hazel. And it is Hazel that this newly-released documentary has been named after.</p>

<p>Weaving Hazel's Journey: A South of Midnight Documentary debuted today, and offers a fresh look at gameplay, as well as interviews with the cast and crew, who share more on behind-the-scenes processes and the game's inspiration.</p>
<p>Speaking in the documentary, creative director David Sears reflected on his own childhood, and his sense of exploration and discovery. His imagination led him to start creating his own adventure stories, as he made his way through the world around him. These stories often featured fantastical creatures and monsters.</p><p>It is this sense of adventure and discovery that Sears wants players to feel with South of Midnight. "The genesis of [South of] Midnight was my desire to create a love letter to the South," Sears said. As such, the creatures that Hazel will meet in South of Midnight have been inspired by folktales and urban legends from the South.</p>
<p>"Every region [in South of Midnight] has a distinctive creature, and they rule entirely," the developer said. "Each kingdom is structured so that you understand 'how did a creature become a monster'."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the landscapes are also inspired by real places found within the American Deep South such as New Orleans, with art director Whitney Clayton saying these locations are almost characters themselves.</p>
<p>As well as Sears, Ahmed Best - best known for playing Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars - also features in South of Midnight's documentary. Best serves as the game's performance and voice director. He and the cast note <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/south-of-midnight-developer-ensured-its-black-heroine-was-created-by-black-women">how important representation is in games like South of Midnight</a>. "When I think about how many games are set in the South with a strong Black female lead, I don't recall that many," said Hazel actress Adriyan Rae. "That in itself shows how important this is." </p><p>"I think it's really cool that a little Black girl could cosplay Hazel with the hair that is growing out of her head," added writer Zaire Lanier. "It is nice to see yourself reflected in a piece of media, and not in a way that feels sterotypical or inauthentic."</p>

<p>Those interested can pre-order the box set from Cook and Becker <a href="https://www.cookandbecker.com/en/artwork/3528/the-art-and-music-of-south-of-midnight-compulsion-games.html">starting today</a><em>.</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-og-returns-as-a-permanent-game-mode-next-month.1033656/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-og-permanent-december<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has announced that the popular&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>OG game mode is coming back, and this time, it won't be a temporary mode, so you'll be able to ask your friends "where we droppin?" whenever you like.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1856351379838701691" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Epic reveals that&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>OG will return on December 6th, and that it's "here to stay". You'll be able to "explore the OG map, collect OG loot, and relive OG seasons".</p>

<p>It sounds like the new, permanent version of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>OG will function in a similar way to when this mode appeared as <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-og-drop-back-into-battle-royale-chapter-1?lang=en-US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">part of the game's fourth season last year</a>, focusing on multiple seasons rather than a single point in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s history.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-og-permanent-shooting.jpg?itok=3TBk39WX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-og-permanent-shooting.jpg?itok=rM_jPV6K 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>OG is coming back, and this time, it's "here to stay".</figcaption></figure><p>We don't have much more info about the way&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>OG will work as a permanent game mode, but I expect it'll function similarly to experiences like&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival</em>, i.e. as a menu option you can pick whenever you want to go back in time.</p>

<p>Epic had already announced that&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>OG <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-will-bring-back-og-in-2024-after-it-shattered-records-with-100-million-players" rel="nofollow">would return at some point</a> this year following the original OG run <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-achieves-biggest-day-ever-with-447-million-players-following-return-of" rel="nofollow">shattering player records in November 2023</a>. They had not, however, revealed that it would be a permanent mode rather than a limited-time seasonal affair.</p>

<p>In any case, if you and your friends want to relive the glory days of&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>(assuming you consider the original seasons to be those glory days, of course), then you now know when you'll be able to jump in and do just that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-og-permanent-shotgun.jpg?itok=Dpf74Wxk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-og-permanent-shotgun.jpg?itok=0IKcvzxp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll soon be able to revisit&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s past whenever you want.</figcaption></figure><p>As a reminder, Epic recently consolidated all of its previously-disparate&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>battle passes, allowing you to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-battle-pass-xp-simplified" rel="nofollow">gain XP for any mode</a> when playing any other mode. That means if you're playing&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>OG, you're also amassing XP for the main battle royale mode,&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite</em>, and everything else.</p>

<p>OG&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>arrives on December 6th, presumably across all platforms on which the game is currently available. Stay tuned for more.</p>

It’s an indie horror game focusing on body horror and possession but with far more action-combat than most horror titles, making it easily accessible and approachable for those who don’t often lean into the genre. It’s not altogether terrifying, thanks to the ability to ground-stomp and slash your enemies using powerful, blood-based skills. Still, the horror elements are there, sometimes leaving you desiring more. More horror, more combat.</p><p><br>To that end, there are a number of other games with similar mechanics, gameplay style, and feel that could scratch the itch you’re feeling after completing <em>Slitterhead</em>. Here are a few recommendations! <br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bfe5ae6006b76d4bb037e850166ad51a" data-recommend-id="image://bfe5ae6006b76d4bb037e850166ad51a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A group of villagers move to attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A group of villagers move to attack." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bfe5ae6006b76d4bb037e850166ad51a" data-recommend-id="image://bfe5ae6006b76d4bb037e850166ad51a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A group of villagers move to attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>When combining horror and action, nothing quite compares to <em>Resident Evil 4</em>. It’s far less terrifying than much of the franchise, primarily thanks to the ability to gun down every villager and monster you encounter. </p><p><br>But just because you’re playing as Leon Kennedy and have a handgun and shotgun doesn’t mean you’re immune to fear. <em>Resident Evil 4</em> occasionally ramps up the terror with a few notable jump scares and eerie setpieces that immerse you in its uncanny story. <br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6139c20496d6220c1b4c0c352a71d197" data-recommend-id="image://6139c20496d6220c1b4c0c352a71d197" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Magical streams of light emit from a characters hands." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Magical streams of light emit from a characters hands." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Tango Gameworks</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6139c20496d6220c1b4c0c352a71d197" data-recommend-id="image://6139c20496d6220c1b4c0c352a71d197" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Magical streams of light emit from a characters hands." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Like with <em>Slitterhead </em>and <em>Resident Evil 4</em>, <em>Ghostwire: Tokyo</em> doesn’t simply thrust you into a terrifying world and ask you to survive. It provides you with abilities and weapons to fight against ghosts and supernatural happenings across the city. Unfortunately, the ability to launch elemental abilities from your fingertips doesn’t always ease the tension. Early in the game, you’ll wander through an abandoned hospital, and it’s downright terrifying.</p><p>The ability to become more powerful by upgrading your skills helps turn the tide of battle. However, that eerie tension that stems from unseen supernatural mishaps never lets up throughout the campaign. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9e10f4bc806c87761d37e37f4be429ae" data-recommend-id="image://9e10f4bc806c87761d37e37f4be429ae" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character looks at a destroyed piano." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character looks at a destroyed piano." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Pieces Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9e10f4bc806c87761d37e37f4be429ae" data-recommend-id="image://9e10f4bc806c87761d37e37f4be429ae" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A character looks at a destroyed piano." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>At its core, <em>Slitterhead </em>is a story-driven experience. While the combat is a nice break from the usual pace of horror titles, those who connect with the story side of the game will likely want more on that front. In steps <em>Alone in the Dark</em>. The recent 2024 reimagining didn’t review well initially but has since earned a small following for its psychological horror elements, puzzles, and action. </p><p><br>It helps that David Harbour (<em>Stranger Things</em>) and Jodie Comer (<em>Free Guy</em>) play the main characters, allowing players to immerse themselves further in the story-driven horror experience. Of course, if you’re not a fan of puzzle-heavy gameplay, then you might not click with this one as intended.  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5d9c9894763ac74baebd81bd3c305b45" data-recommend-id="image://5d9c9894763ac74baebd81bd3c305b45" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A bloody nurse approaches the protagonist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A bloody nurse approaches the protagonist." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bloober Team</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5d9c9894763ac74baebd81bd3c305b45" data-recommend-id="image://5d9c9894763ac74baebd81bd3c305b45" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A bloody nurse approaches the protagonist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>What else can be said about <em>Silent Hill 2</em>? The recent remake is one of the most well-received survival horror titles in recent years, and considering the number of hits we’ve had in the past twelve months, that’s saying something. If <em>Slitterhead </em>didn’t scare you, but you’re craving terror in your life, please play <em>Silent Hill 2</em>. The sound design alone is enough to give you goosebumps, and the more action-oriented combat does help draw in new crowds.</p><p>If you’re brave, play it at night with the lights off. Otherwise, I won’t judge you for playing during the day. It’s a highly immersive remake that’s more approachable than the original titles, but retains all of its essence.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="81b8568056ed1da93c6a32fccb50e053" data-recommend-id="image://81b8568056ed1da93c6a32fccb50e053" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Nero attacks a group of demons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nero attacks a group of demons." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="81b8568056ed1da93c6a32fccb50e053" data-recommend-id="image://81b8568056ed1da93c6a32fccb50e053" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Nero attacks a group of demons." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>One thing I genuinely enjoyed about my time with <em>Slitterhead </em>was the feeling you get when facing down one of the grotesque enemies, then whipping out a set of blood claws to tear it to shreds. You felt powerful at times, and I think <em>Devil May Cry</em> captures that intense, action-oriented feeling fantastically. While it does feature a few horror elements, it’s not about the fear; it’s about slaying demons in the most imaginative and bombastic manners imaginable. </p><p><br>Personally, I’m not a fan of the story or dialogue in <em>DMC</em>, but to each their own. Nothing quite compares if you’re after pure action-packed scenes with over-the-top violence!  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="leb09rkf10hgwbvgbafo" data-recommend-id="image://leb09rkf10hgwbvgbafo" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="2B looks past the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="2B looks past the camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Platinum Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="leb09rkf10hgwbvgbafo" data-recommend-id="image://leb09rkf10hgwbvgbafo" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="2B looks past the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Once more, while leaning into the action aspect of <em>Slitterhead</em>, we have <em>NieR</em>: <em>Automata</em>. It’s certainly not a horror game unless you’re terrified of machines. If you are, you’ll be happy to learn that <em>NieR </em>allows you to wield various weapons and attacks to smash those machines to bits. It’s a satisfying albeit odd gameplay loop that, once it clicks for you, it’ll stick with you for quite some time.</p><p><br>One thing I wanted from <em>Slitterhead </em>was larger environments to explore, and I think <em>NieR </em>perfectly nails that aspect and its combat. It’s just all-around satisfying.  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ffe9c53e80892335c1fb527d2a52342e" data-recommend-id="image://ffe9c53e80892335c1fb527d2a52342e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A mutated giraffe clings to the ceiling." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A mutated giraffe clings to the ceiling." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Clapperheads</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ffe9c53e80892335c1fb527d2a52342e" data-recommend-id="image://ffe9c53e80892335c1fb527d2a52342e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A mutated giraffe clings to the ceiling." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Body horror is one of the more unsettling horror techniques used to terrify and leave a lasting impression. It’s bad enough when it’s a human, as in <em>Slitterhead</em>. In <em>Zoochosis</em>, it’s animals, and there’s something far more terrifying about a giraffe splitting apart and scrambling up a wall like a spider.</p><p><br>While <em>Zoochosis </em>doesn’t receive the same recognition as most of the titles on this list, being an indie horror project, it does nail the atmosphere and grotesqueness I think <em>Slitterhead </em>fans will enjoy.  </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
