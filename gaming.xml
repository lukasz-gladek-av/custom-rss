		<p>ATLUS has announced a stream for tomorrow, May 15th, at 3pm BST to reveal Persona5: The Phantom X. What we already know about the game is that it is a free to play mobile title that has been in open beta in China since April 2014, and also launched in Taiwan, and South Korea. Just like Persona 5, Persona5: The Phantom X is set in Tokyo, but introduces a new main character for players to name and customise.</p>
<p><iframe title="P5X News -First announcement! We’re the Phantom Thieves, and we’re here to steal your heart!-" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yQsdIWTGn_Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The stream for tomorrow will delve into details including release dates, at least for a Japan version, along with the newly announced English version of the game. Details of a release date are also expected for that. Much like the mainline Persona 5 game, players will be able to take part in various activities around Tokyo that can help boost stats, gain experience points, or earn some money. Confidants are also dotted around and are people you can speak to you. To unlock unique dialogue options with them, you will need to rank up your relationships. It’ll take longer to do in Persona5: The Phantom X compared to the main game as there are more ranks to work through. There are turn based battles too that will take place in Mementos, where you will grind out daily challenges, along with battles in the story specific Palaces.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/14/persona-5-tactica-review/">Persona 5 Tactica Review</a></h2>
<p>The last Persona 5 game we reviewed was Persona 5 Tactica, and in that review Nic said, “Persona 5 Tactica is a good game, but it is a game that’s standing on the shoulders of giants – when the giant is the size of Satanael, you have a lot to live up to. Indeed, it’s very difficult to score this and not compare it to the other games in the series as a result. Tactica is good, but it’s not great, and while it is always nice to sink into that warm-bath feeling of hanging out with your fictional friends, it won’t be remembered as either a series high or the best spin-off the franchise has to offer.”</p>

		<p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/05/riders-republic-adil-bilall-gaumont-ubisoft-1236397176/">Deadline</a> is reporting that Ubisoft’s extreme sports game Riders Republic is going to be getting a movie adaptation, with Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah set to jointly direct. Writer Noé Debré is also attached to the project, and he has writer on films including Dheepan, Stillwater, and Parlement. Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah are best known for Bad Boys For Life and Bad Boys: Ride or Die.</p>
<p><iframe title="Riders Republic: Season 14 Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZB-d5e_Z7wc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Riders Republic launched in October 2021, bringing a wacky approach to extreme sports with snowboards, skis, and wingsuits, bikes, and jetpacks all being added. It is essentially a sequel to Ubisoft’s 2016 winter extreme sports game Steep. Riders Republic has been getting regular content updates since its release, which points to an active player base, with Season 14 coming last month. That added the Pockett Car and the Park Creator to the game.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/11/02/riders-republic-review/">Riders Republic Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Riders Republic review, Jim said, “Riders Republic is a game players can effortlessly lose themselves in, even if the gameplay itself is pretty shallow. The endless barrage of events populating the world map become less exciting over time, resembling a shopping list rather than milestones in your ascension to extreme sports godhood. If you’re still keen to take the plunge, make sure you have a posse ready to party up with.”</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-dimension-20-cloudward-ho-trailer-reveals-characters-and-more</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-dimension-20-cloudward-ho-trailer-reveals-characters-and-more<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dropout has released a brand new trailer for the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Dimension 20&nbsp;</em>series&nbsp;<em>Cloudward Ho!</em>, and it introduces the players' characters, the steampunk land of Gath, and more.</p>

<p>The trailer teases the steampunk adventure on which the gang will be embarking, which premieres on June 4th. During the trailer, perennially irrepressible DM Brennan Lee Mulligan describes Gath as "a world of high-flying stunts and wild adventure".</p>

<p><em>Cloudward Ho!&nbsp;</em>will serve as an Intrepid Heroes series, which means your players will be the usual rogues' gallery: Ally Beardsley, Brian Murphy, Emily Axford, Lou Wilson, Siobhan Thompson, and Zac Oyama (and, of course, Mulligan himself in the top chair).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dimension-20-cloudward-ho-new-trailer-cast.jpg?itok=H2OCJjmg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dimension-20-cloudward-ho-new-trailer-cast.jpg?itok=WY4K1k74 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cloudward Ho!&nbsp;</em>takes the Intrepid Heroes to the steampunk land of Gath.</figcaption></figure><p>First up, Thompson introduces her character Van Chapman, who comes from an "old sailing family". Murphy will play a strapping athlete by the name of Maxwell, and Axford will play Marya Junková, who is "gaunt with starvation, not of the body but of the soul".</p>

<p>Oyama's character doesn't get a name during the trailer, but he's an elderly cowboy type with a pistol and bandolier (and, of course, a Texas-style southern-boy accent to match). He's joined by Beardsley's Olethra McCloud, an adventurer who's "extremely into" her family's adventuring legacy.</p>

<p>Finally, Wilson's character, who, like Oyama's cowboy, is unnamed in the trailer. He is possessed of "big, broad shoulders" and a "big chest", and his art shows him with a pencil and book in hand, as well as mutton chop-style facial hair.</p>

<p>Together, the group will form the Windrider Society, who will be taking to the skies of Gath in order to search for "the missing Professor Comfrey MacLeod", according to a press release. It promises to be another unforgettable Intrepid Heroes adventure.</p>




<p><em>Cloudward Ho!&nbsp;</em>reunites the core Intrepid Heroes cast following <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dimension-20-fantasy-high-junior-year-trailer-highlights-new-looks-for-bad-kids-and" rel="nofollow">last year's&nbsp;<em>Fantasy High: Junior Year</em></a>. It'll be the show's third actual play series to air this year, following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dimension-20-titan-takedown-combines-tabletop-storytelling-with-pro-wrestling" rel="nofollow">April's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dimension-20-titan-takedown-combines-tabletop-storytelling-with-pro-wrestling" rel="nofollow">Titan Takedown</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dimension-20-dungeons-drag-queens-season-2-sashays-onto-dropout-in-january" rel="nofollow">January's second season of&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Drag Queens</em></a>.</p>

<p>Digital Foundry also notes that the Switch 2's stated clock speeds can be tuned to higher theoretical maximums: 1.4 GHz for the GPU and 1.7 GHz for the CPU. Nintendo could eventually make use of this headroom for improved graphical performance and faster loading screens, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2019-nintendo-switch-boost-mode-analysis">it did on the original Switch in 2019</a>. And while developers can adjust the GPU clock rate used by their games, it's unclear if they'll be able to directly overclock to the theoretical maximum themselves.</p>
<h2>System resources</h2>
<p>As on the original Switch, 25 percent of the CPU cores and overall memory on the Switch 2 is reserved by the system for OS features and is thus inaccessible to game developers directly. Digital Foundry also notes that some GPU resources are reserved by the system OS, though it didn't provide a precise measurement for this amount.</p>

<p>This time around, those system-level features include <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-offers-new-details-on-switch-2-hardware-software/">Game Chat</a>, which offers the ability to stream gameplay and/or webcam video from up to four friends to a single system. Even with significant resources set aside by the OS, though, Digital Foundry notes that Game Chat has "a significant impact on system resources," leading Nintendo to provide developers with a testing tool that "simulates API latency and L3 cache misses" that can happen when Game Chat is in use.</p>
<p>Aside from the core pixel-pushing hardware, the Switch 2 also adds a new separate File Decompression Engine, which can handle loading game data off of the system's 256GB of on-board UFS memory and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/04/what-is-microsd-express-and-why-is-it-mandatory-for-the-nintendo-switch-2/">MicroSD Express expansion cards</a> without taxing the CPU. And while the Switch 2's portable screen includes support for variable refresh rates up to 120 Hz, there is currently no official support for VRR on HDMI displays connected to the system's dock.</p>
<p>While it's fun to look at numbers, the real proof of the Switch 2's hardware power will be in the performance of its games. We look forward to having more direct comparisons of software performance when the console launches next month.</p>

"We‛re not just simply calculating the tariff to come up with 100 billion yen, but thinking about the currently available information and also looking at the market trend, we might pass on to the price and also shipment allocation, so we‛re taking different measures in managing to come up with the 100 billion figure," Tao said via a translator.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As pointed out by senior vice president Sadahiko Hayakawa, the 100 billion figure may not be reflecting this week‛s reduction between China and the US.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Ubisoft says it has postponed several of its "biggest productions" currently in development in order to grant them more time in the oven, after previously delaying <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> in order to provide further polish. 
</p>
<p>
Exactly which games these are was not named by Ubisoft during its financial results broadcast today, though in an investor call listened to by Eurogamer, Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot suggested the impacted titles came from the publisher's top five brands - Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, Rainbow Six, The Division and Ghost Recon.
</p>
<p>
Guillemot said Shadows' delay had been a "good decision to deliver a really strong quality" and that the delayed projects would now launch beyond the current financial year ending 31st March 2026, in either the following year ending March 2027, or the year after ending March 2028.
</p>
<p>
"After a review of our pipeline, we have decided to provide additional development time to some of our biggest productions in order to create the best conditions for success," Guillemot said today in a statement. "As a consequence, FY2026-27 and FY2027-28 will see significant content coming from our largest brands."
</p>
<p>
What's coming this year then? Ubisoft lists Anno 117: Pax Romana, its long-delayed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> remake, Rainbow Six Mobile and The Division spin-off Resurgence, as well as "other titles" to be announced at a later stage. Assassin's Creed Shadows will get is first major expansion later this year, while Rainbow Six Siege gets its big X update in June. (There's no mention at all of Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2.)
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, Ubisoft has commented further on Assassin's Creed Shadows' launch, its plans for a new subsidary backed by Chinese publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>, and ongoing push to cut costs and headcount.
</p>
<p>
The company's latest financial results show it earned a "slightly below objective" €1.85bn (£1.56m) for the year ending 31st March, a miss it blamed on "lower than expected partnerships, notably due to a timing impact". 
</p>
<p>
Of course, Ubisoft's biggest launch of the year was Assassin's Creed Shadows, which finally arrived in March after a notable delay from last year. Ubisoft avoided providing a new sales figure for the game today, though said its financial performance "reaffirms the strength and resilience" of the brand.
</p>
<p>
As previously announced, Shadows had the second-highest day one sales revenue for the series - behind the lockdown-era launch of Valhalla. Today, Ubisoft said Shadows had now recorded 160m gameplay hours across all players to date. How many players? Ubisoft isn't saying, and hasn't provided a fresh figure since the game passed 3 million players a week after launch.
</p>
<p>
The Assassin's Creed brand as a whole had "around 30 million unique players" for the fourth consecutive year, Ubisoft said, the same as Rainbow Six. Ubisoft's third pillar, Far Cry, had "around 20 million" meanwhile.
</p>
<p>
On Ubisoft's continued mission to cut costs - and employees - the company said it had succeeded in trimming €200m from its fixed costs ahead of time, with a lowered headcount now at 17,782 people. That's a decrease of 3000 people from September 2022, due to layoffs and reduced recruitment.
</p>
<p>
"This year has been a challenging one for Ubisoft, with mixed dynamics across our portfolio, amid intense industry competition," Guillemot continued. "Despite these headwinds, Ubisoft managed to deliver positive free cash flow generation over the fiscal year, reflecting the discipline applied across the Group.
</p>
<p>
"Aware of the challenges ahead, we took decisive steps to continue strengthening the company's future," Guillemot continued. "The launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows was a defining moment. It reaffirmed the power of the Assassin's Creed brand, with a highly favorable community response from long-time fans and new players alike. We also completed our initial cost savings program ahead of schedule. We are committed to going further, with additional savings of at least €100m over the next two years to drive structural efficiencies and reinforce the foundations of our organisation."
</p>
<p>
Further details of Ubisoft's plan to launch a new subsidiary with Tencent that will house the company's biggest three brands - Assassin's Creed, Rainbow Six and Far Cry - will be laid out later this year, Ubisoft said. 
</p>
<p>
That said, Ubisoft said today that this new group will focus on "improving the quality of narrative-driven solo experiences", "expanding live service offerings with richer multiplayer features and more frequent content updates", and targeting "underpenetrated markets such as mobile and China".
</p>
<p>
And in other news, Ubisoft's film and television division has announced a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/riders-republic">Riders Republic</a> movie, with Bad Boys for Life directors Adil El Arbi and Bilall Fallah signed up to work on the project.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/sour-patch-kids-flavor-rankings<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Three years ago, Sonic (the drive-in fast food restaurant, not the blue hedgehog) started selling Sour Patch Kids ice cream floats — a sour watermelon-flavored slushie, soft serve vanilla ice cream, and sprinkles of chopped up Sour Patch Kids on top. Sonic itself sucks, but the Sour Patch Kids float is perfect. I’ve been chasing the pure happiness I felt after my first sip for years.&nbsp;</p><p>I’ve loved Sour Patch Kids for a long time, but the float kicked that into overdrive. I actively started seeking out new varieties and flavored items, something to fill the hole the Sour Patch Kids float left in my heart. The bad news is that nothing has ever come close. The good news is that I still got to eat a lot of Sour Patch Kids. Most are good. Some were awful.</p><p>Through years of research, this is where I’ve landed:</p><ol><li><span>Sonic’s Sour Patch Kids ice cream float</span></li><li><span>Lemonade Fest</span></li><li><span>Original Sour Patch Kids (from the Mexico factory, which I think are denser and more delicious)</span></li><li><span>Ghost’s Sour Patch Kids electrolyte powder</span></li><li><span>Peach&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Heads (the heads are a different flavor from the body)</span></li><li><span>Watermelon</span></li><li><span>Sour Patch Kids Glow Ups (they have glow in the dark confetti and are strawberry watermelon flavored)</span></li><li><span>Trident’s Sour Patch Kids gum</span></li><li><span>Big Sour Patch Kids</span></li><li><span>Strawberry&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Grape&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Apple&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Tropical&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Sour Patch Kids Oreos</span></li><li><span>Cola&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Original Sour Patch Kids (when they are too soft)</span></li></ol><p>And if we’re ranking the original flavors:</p><ol><li><span>Red Raspberry</span></li><li><span>Blue Raspberry</span></li><li><span>Lemon</span></li><li><span>Lime</span></li><li><span>Orange</span></li></ol><p>I’m also convinced that Sour Patch Kids quality varies heavily depending on where the candy is made. I have not done the research to determine which factory I like the best, but Sour Patch Kids can be downright awful or life-changing. Mexico <em>typically</em> has the best texture; bonus points if they’re a little stale. There are a bunch of varieties of the candies that I haven’t tried yet, but one tormets me: Sour Patch Kids Gamerz. I can’t really tell if the flavors are different, but they are gamer-shaped and, unfortunately, only available in Australia.</p><p>The last thing is that a new sour candy has actually overtaken Sour Patch Kids as my number one: the AirHeads Xtremes Rainbow Berry Sour Belts. Please note, though, that the AirHeads Xtremes Rainbow Berry Sour <em>Bites</em> are absolute trash.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/thunderbolts-marvel-avengers-cube-escape-room"><h3>Thunderbolts* Could Have Been Marvel’s Cube</h3></a><p>It could have been an escape room movie starring Florence Pugh, but we got New Avengers instead

In part, that’s because games are getting way more complex than they were in the PS1 or even the Xbox 360 days.

The main character would forget information and abilities the longer you stay away from the game. They might not know their role in the story, or even how to fire a gun. Abandon the game for long enough and the character wouldn’t be able to move at all. “Players would have to take a week off work or school to play it,” Kojima said. </p><p>As many have pointed out, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/IGN/status/1922630747497677243/quotes&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/IGN/status/1922630747497677243/quotes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this is just real life for lots of us now</a></span>. Most modern games now essentially have a “forgetting mode” on by default, though some attempt to remedy the issue by providing optional recaps on what players were recently doing, or ongoing tutorials they can easily return to if they forget how to play. Often the friction remains, however. I can’t even imagine how bad it would be if my character was just as lost as I was. We’d be the gaming equivalent of lotus eaters, idly listening to the ambient soundtrack while the clock ticked by. </p><p>It’s hardly the first time Kojima has wanted to mess around with the real-world passage of time inside of one of his games. He explained in the latest podcast that he had thought of making Sam Porter’s hair grow in <em>Death Stranding 2</em> when players are logged off, but didn’t want to make a “big star” like Norman Reedus “look uncool.” Fans of <em>Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater</em>, meanwhile, will recall the fight with sniper The End. It’s a tough encounter players can completely bypass if they just wait several days in the real world until the enemy dies of old age. It’ll be interesting to see how it’s captured in the <em>Delta</em> remake coming this summer. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The studio is warning against issues with fake merch sales around him, but also teasing an official plush Esquie that's in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1922603248415908078" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a> from the official Expedition 33 account, Sandfall Interactive said it has seen a number of "suspicious" websites pop up selling Esquie plushies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"To be clear: any third-party websites selling Esquie plushies are NOT officially licensed," the studio said. "Many of them are using AI-generated artwork to advertise, and we strongly recommend against purchasing from these sources. They could be scams."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To balance out the wheee with the whooo though, as Esquie might say, Sandfall confirms it is looking into making official Esquie plushies, and wants to get them out as soon as it can. "In the meantime, please be patient — and don’t get scammed!" the studio said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Those who have played the game probably get why an Esquie plushie might be in high demand. If you haven't gone on Expedition 33 yet, Esquie is a giant helper you meet in Act 1 of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 who becomes both a traveling companion and overworld travel method. He's got the same vibe as Big Hero 6's Baymax.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that in mind, it's easy to see how an Esquie plush might garner some interest, so it's good to know Sandfall is working on an official solution. A cursory search on Google pulled up both an unofficial site, and a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1kh8sug/esquie_plush_scam/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">few threads</a> asking about Esquie plush peddlers. If you want the real thing from Sandfall and Kepler, you'll have to wait a bit. No news on whether the real-life plushie will also be filled with wine, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-patch-123-is-a-big-one-nerfs-maelles-game-breaking-stendahl-build">Sandfall Interactive released patch 1.2.3</a> for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, addressing some balance tweaks around Maelle's Stendhal ability.

One is that a player might go "all the way in" and dedicate lots of time and money. A second category of players might find the perceived time sink to be too enormous and simply play something else instead.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> FBC: Firebreak – Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>FBC aims to be a game that people can pick up and play in short bursts, at a modest price point ($40). The game is also included in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Xbox Game Pass</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-plus-essential-free-games-for-may-2025/1100-6531161/" data-ref-id="1100-6531161">PlayStation Plus</a> from day one, which in theory should help it reach a potentially larger audience.</p><p>"The game is made by middle-aged dads for middle-aged dads," Remedy's Anssi Hyytiäinen told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/with-fbc-firebreak-remedy-says-its-made-a-control-shooter-for-dads/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>. "That was something that we talked about a lot. We wanted to make the game easy to pick up and throw yourself in there and have fun with your friends."</p><p>Kayatta, meanwhile, said FBC's session lengths were deliberately designed to be played in as little as five minutes. Even for a completionist, the game might take 30 or 40 hours to play as opposed to "thousands of hours."</p><p>"So we're not like Monster Hunter for sure. And that's been conscious decision also in that this we don't want it to be like almost predatory design practices of trying to suck all of your time out of your life," he said.</p><p>Kayatta told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fomo-has-infected-modern-games-says-remedy-director-of-fbc-firebreak" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that FOMO design concepts have "infected a lot of modern games," and that Remedy intentionally tried to reduce FOMO with FBC.</p><p>On the subject of FOMO, former Call of Duty veteran developer Mark Rubin recently said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-cod-dev-laments-the-series-leaning-so-heavily-into-fomo/1100-6531275/" data-ref-id="1100-6531275">Activision is resorting to manipulation tactics</a>, including FOMO, to encourage people to play Call of Duty.</p><p>FBC releases on June 17 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

Ubisoft describes the movie as “poised to be an electrifying action movie, delivering non-stop thrills, humor, and spectacular stunts on the snowy slopes of the Alps."</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bD0HSMRtxMM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bD0HSMRtxMM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>So far, that’s all Ubisoft has revealed about the Riders Republic movie, which is based on the 2021 game of the same name that more than 10 million people have played. Players can do all kinds of extreme sports in the game, including biking, snowboarding, skiing, wingsuit flying, and more. Given the movie’s logline features the snowy slopes of the Alps, it seems the film will be centered on winter sports.</p><p>While waiting to learn more about the movie, read <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/riders-republic/riders-republic-review-a-missed-opportunity"><em>Game Informer’s</em> Riders Republic review</a>.</p><p>Are you excited about a Riders Republic movie?

            <p>Sony has revealed the next round of additions to its PS Plus Catalogue for subscribers, which will be added on 20th May.</p>
<p>The following games will be available later this month for Premium and Extra subscribers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sand Land | PS4, PS5</li>
<li>Soul Hackers 2 | PS5</li>
<li>Five Nights at Freddy's: Help Wanted - Full Time Edition | PS4, PS5</li>
<li>Battlefield 5 | PS4</li>
<li>STALKER: Legends of the Zone Trilogy | PS4, PS5</li>
<li>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising | PS4, PS5</li>
<li>Humankind | PS4, PS5</li>
<li>Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life | PS5</li>
<li>Gloomhaven Mercenaries Edition | PS4, PS5</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, Premium subscribers will get access to PS2 classic Battle Engine Aquila on PS4 and PS5.</p>
<p>Action-RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sand-land">Sand Land</a> was released last year and features designs from Dragon Ball creator Akira Toriyama - this was his last game before he passed away. He <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-ball-creator-akira-toriyama-gives-posthumous-praise-for-sand-land-game">posthumously praised the game</a> in a statement shared after his death: "I haven't watched through all of the gameplay yet," he said. "However, it greatly expands the worldview of the original manga with many new exciting elements. It is high-quality as a stand alone game and I can tell it is a highly satisfying action-RPG game!"</p>
<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/original-stalker-trilogy-getting-an-enhanced-edition-upgrade-on-ps5-series-xs-and-pc">GSC Game World announced a free Enhanced Edition upgrade for Stalker: Legends of the Zone Trilogy</a>, which combines the first three games in the series. It includes a visual upgrade and other improvements, but it's unclear if PS Plus subscribers will have access following its inclusion here in the subscription.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Soul Hackers 2 is a 2022 RPG from Persona-maker Atlus that, confusingly, is the fifth installment in the Devil Summoner series, which is part of the Megami Tensei franchise. If you like anime RPGs, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/granblue-fantasy-versus">Granblue Fantasy Versus</a>: Rising is probably also worth a shot, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/story-of-seasons-a-wonderful-life">Story of Seasons: A Wonderful Life</a> is a more relaxed farming experience.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Are you excited to play any of these? | <span>Image credit: <cite>Sony</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>These Catalogue games are in addition to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/here-are-your-playstation-plus-games-for-may">free monthly games also available this month</a> to those on the Essential tier:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ark: Survival Ascended | PS5</li>
<li>Balatro | PS5, PS4</li>
<li>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun | PS5, PS4</li>
</ul>
<p>New additions mean some games will likely be leaving the service this month too, we'll update once we know more.</p>
<p>More details on this month's games can be found on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/14/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-may-sand-land-soul-hackers-2-five-nights-at-freddys-help-wanted-battlefield-v-and-more/">PlayStation Blog</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/666867/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-canceled<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Square Enix has announced that it is cancelling the mobile spinoff <em>Kingdom Hearts Missing-Link</em>. In <a href="https://www.kingdomhearts.com/missinglink/">a statement on the game’s website</a>, Square Enix apologized to fans who were anticipating the game. The announcement also mentioned that Square was still hard at work on <em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em> perhaps to allay fears that this cancellation might indicate problems for other games in the sprawling Disney video game series.</p><p><em>Kingdom Hearts: Missing-Link</em> <a href="http://v/">was announced in 2022 alongside <em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em></a><em>.</em> It was billed as a mobile action game that made use of GPS technology to give players the ability to “travel the world without stepping outside,” according to one trailer. However, apparently that goal was a bit too lofty as Square Enix wrote, “We determined that it would be difficult for us to offer a service that players would find satisfactory over a long period of time, leading us to the decision to cancel development.”</p><p>Square Enix’s statement provided insight as to the reason for a game’s cancellation – something most game studios do not often offer. And while making any game is a miracle, making a successful live-service game is like asking for lightning to strike the head of a pin in a forest. After all, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282900/sony-shutting-down-concord-firewalk-studios">how</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312584/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-refunds">many</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317407/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-final-season-offline-mode">live-service games</a> (some of them <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/foamstars-season-pass-ends-with-ironically-titled-party-goes-on">even made by Square Enix itself</a>) were released only to die shortly thereafter while the concurrent player counts for <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Roblox</em>, and <em>Call of Duty</em> remain largely unmoved. So it’s a rare and refreshing bit of honesty, especially in an industry as opaque as game development, that Square Enix was willing to name the reason for cancelling <em>Missing-Link</em> and I hope more studios follow suit in the future. </p><p>But it’s not all bad news for Square Enix. As reported by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/05/square-enix-and-tbs-television-announce-collaboration-to-develop-original-ip-game"><em>Gematsu</em></a>, Square has also started a new partnership with the Tokyo Broadcasting System Television. Known as TBS, it’s a Japanese TV and media company which produced <a href="https://www.sfgate.com/shopping/article/takeshis-castle-reboot-amazon-prime-17048691.php"><em>Takeshi’s Castle</em></a> – an internationally popular physical competition show known in the US as <em>Most Extreme Elimination Challenge</em> or <em>MXC</em>. TBS started its own games division in 2023 and with Square Enix, the two companies will work on a new gaming property.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' first "special collaboration" will be a crossover with survival horror game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a>, set to arrive on 27th May. 
</p>
<p>
"Step into The Fog," reads a post on social media by the Assassin's Creed account this afternoon. "A new Dead by Daylight quest begins. Slip through the shadows. Survive the ordeal."
</p>
<p>
An accompanying teaser video shows Naoe and Yasuke resting by a campfire, while a figure with glowing red flames around their arms and feet faces them. Exact details on what the crossover will contain are presumably set to arrive at a later date.
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-post-launch-roadmap-features-regular-new-story-missions-parkour-updates-new-game-plus">Assassin's Creed publisher Ubisoft revealed that Shadows would get multiple "special collaboration" updates as part of its free post-launch content roadmap</a>. 
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Today's announcement appears to put a date on Shadows' next big update, in which this first collaboration is included. Other additions expected on 27th May include improvements to the game's photo mode and additional flashy parkour moves.
</p>
<p>
This update will then be followed by at least one further update in June, where a second free story mission will be added. This will feature a new ally that can come hang out at your homebase. June's update is also set to feature new difficulty options, and the ability to wear headgear in cutscenes (a highly requested feature by fans).
</p>
<p>
Beyond June, Ubisoft has said it has plans to add a New Game Plus Mode, additional story missions, and more "special collaborations". 
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time Assassin's Creed has provided optional post-launch content crossing over with other games, of course. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-assassins-creed-origins-will-get-a-chocobo-horse">Final Fantasy's Chocobo turned up in Assassin's Creed Origins</a>, while multiple Assassin's Creed heroes have themselves crossed over into the world of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"Majestic in scope, impressive in detail, Assassin's Creed Shadows honours the beauty of feudal Japan," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Eurogamer's Assassin's Creed Shadows review</a>, "even if its strongest moments are saved for the personal stories of its two protagonists."
