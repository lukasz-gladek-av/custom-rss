		<p>Semiwork has announced that it is looking at what to bring in the next big update for R.E.P.O, and the studio wants the players to give their input on what they want. Players can leave comments on in the comments on YouTube or through the <a href="steam://openurl_external/https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.com%2Finvite%2Frepo">R.E.P.O Discord</a> In addition, Semiwork is working on a hotfix following the<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/30/r-e-p-o-gets-10-new-monsters-in-its-monster-update/">&nbsp;Monster Update</a> that was released last week. One of the things that will be added in the R.E.P.O hotfix will be an Arachnophobia Mode, as well as some enemy tweaks.</p>

UPDATE?!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JshwMkzs_MY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Semiwork has also announced that there will be a short break when it comes to R.E.P.O videos so the team can have a bit of a rest. The break will not be that long with information to come when the team has decided on what direction to go with for the next R.E.P.O update.</p>
<p>R.E.P.O stands for The Retrieve, Extract &amp; Profit Operation, where players look for valuable items from a variety of locations while trying to avoid the monsters that lurk in these areas. These valuables could be lightweight items all the way up to grand pianos, so players need to work together to get in, get the items out, and survive. R.E.P.O entered early access in February and since then has built up a large following and overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam.</p>

		<p>Blue Dot Games has announced that following its Next Fest demo, ’83’s early access will now be releasing in 2026 and not this year as originally planned. The extra time will allow Blue Dot Games to address the issues raised by the players when playing the ’83 demo, including the UI, gunplay, and movement amongst features that will be addressed.</p>
<p><iframe title="'83 – Steam NextFest Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t72zJNyJt_s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a blog post, Blue Dot Games wrote, <em>“Following overwhelming feedback on the Steam Next Fest demo, we’ve made the decision to shift our Early Access release of ’83 out of 2025 and into early 2026. We believe in ‘83 and are committed to doing what’s best for both the project and our community.&nbsp;<wbr>We’re using this additional development time to focus on key areas the community told us matter most:&nbsp;<wbr></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Gunplay and feel&nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Optimisation and performance&nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Graphical fidelity and visual polish&nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Overhaul of the UI&nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Movement and animations&nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>General stability and bug fixes&nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The demo gave us a vital snapshot of how ’83 plays in the hands of a broad range of players, and we’re taking all of that data and feedback seriously. Our goal is to deliver an Early Access experience that reflects the ambition of the project, but more importantly, something you genuinely enjoy playing and want to return to. On top of the key areas listed above, we are also working hard to correct and improve our models for weapons, uniforms, gear and vehicles where the need for improvements has been identified.&nbsp;<wbr>Thank you again for your patience, enthusiasm, and for holding us to the highest standard. We’re listening, and we’ll be back with more updates as we continue building ’83.”</em></p>

<p>’83 is a 40v40 squad based first person shooter set during an alternate history where the Cold War erupted into full on conflict, with NATO and the USSR battling across Europe. Players can choose which side to play on as they battle in matches that will last 30 to 40 minutes, while players who take the Commander role will have an overview to help guide their sides.</p>

			<p>The next entry in the Mass Effect series continues to be in development, BioWare confirmed today during the annual series' celebrations.</p>



<p>In a new blog post shared on the developer's <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/11/07/n7-day-2025/">official website</a> for N7 Day 2025, Executive Producer Mike Gamble provided a brief update on the game, confirming that it continues to be in development, as EA and BioWare remain committed to telling more stories in the series' universe.</p>



<p>Following some busy years at the studio, BioWare is now fully dedicated to the development of the next entry in the Mass Effect series, and is continuing to explore new features to build and figure out lots of romances.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"We’re excited by what we’re building, and we promise you: when we’re ready, it’ll be a lot of fun to show,"</em> Mike Gamble wrote, thanking players for their patience.</p>



<p>Besides providing this small update on the next entry in the series, the Mass Effect Executive Producer also provided an update on the TV show based on the series, which is in the works by Amazon Prime Video. The show, which will explore a brand-new story within the <span>universe's timeline, will be set after the original trilogy, and&nbsp;<em>"a lot has been figured out"</em>&nbsp;about how it fits with the series' canon and&nbsp;</span>the timeline of the next entry in the series.</p>



<p>The <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/new-mass-effect-development/">next entry in the Mass Effect series was announced on November 7, 2020</a>, but very little has been said about it over the years, as BioWare was focused on the development of projects such as <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. As Mass Effect Andromeda ultimately proved to be a disappointing release for many fans in the series, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/mass-effect-andromeda-pathfinder/">although it got gameplay right, in my opinion</a>, it makes sense for BioWare to take all the time it needs to make this comeback one to remember.</p>

            <p>
Blizzard are adding a new premium virtual currency to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World Of Warcraft</a> alongside player housing in the MMO's forthcoming Midnight expansion. It's called Hearthsteel, and is "purchased with real money using your Battle.net balance and used in turn to buy Housing items from the Battle.net shop and in-game shop," as detailed in a blog post this week. 
</p>
<p>
The post <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24242736">comments</a> that the "vast majority" of housing items are and will continue to be earnable through play, with a "small fraction" sold for Hearthsteel. Even then, you'll be able to buy items sold for Hearthsteel using WoW Tokens derived from in-game gold. Housing items "tied to core fantasies of a player's race or class, or that already exist in Azeroth, won't be sold in the shop", and nor will "thematically important decor that players know and love". Hearthsteel is strictly for homey boondoggles: there are "no plans to use it for the Trading Post, mounts, transmogs, or pets".
</p>
<p>
All well and good. But Blizzard's reasons for adding a new premium currency to a game that was rubbing along well enough without seem sketchy.
</p>
<p>
As the developers themselves put it in that blog post, "why bother when we already have a Battle.net balance?" They justify the introduction of Hearthsteel by noting firstly that "when dealing in transactions involving real money, a more deliberate and cautious process needs to be implemented to provide appropriate financial protections for both parties". To which I can only say: show your working, Blizzard, because I have no idea what you're referring to.
</p><p>
The developers add that buying things with real money "can be an inefficient, inconvenient, and often tedious process when a player wants to purchase multiple items", giving the example of buying a full set of chairs, candles and a dining table for a banquet. They argue that "using an in-game currency can help make the process of obtaining many of these types of inexpensive items more efficient".
</p>
<p>
I'm... not really seeing it, and neither are the Wowsers on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1oq6li7/removed_by_moderator/">Reddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/world-of-warcraft/blizzards-reason-for-adding-premium-currency-to-world-of-warcraft-after-21-years-of-doing-just-fine-without-one-has-everyone-worried-about-player-housing/">PCGamer</a>). As one user points out, why not just let players put multiple purchases into a shopping cart rather than rolling out some newfangly Azeroth doubloons?</p>
<p>It seems likely that the real rationale for Hearthsteel is the same rationale that informs purchaeable virtual currencies at large: they cloud how much you're actually spending in real money terms, and often wangle you into spending too much by flogging the virtual currency in set amounts, rather than letting you buy exactly as much as you need. The addition of housing to WOW Midnight is sure to inspire a microtransaction boom - I guess this is just Blizzard adding a little more grease to the chute.
</p>
<p>
Late last year, a consumer advocacy group <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-european-consumer-watchdog-wants-you-to-be-able-to-buy-exactly-as-much-in-game-currency-as-you-need-not-fixed-chunks">called upon the European parliament to end such predatory practices in videogames</a>, but a huge number of publishers rely upon virtual currencies, especially in the realm of free-to-play. Time to bang that drum again, while you agonise over the interior of your Razorwind Shore chalet.

              <p>How come<a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-the-kotaku-review-1829984369"><em> Red Dead Redemption 2</em></a> still isn’t on current-gen consoles? Why did Konami drop its lawsuit against the anime horse game? How many players will be humiliated by Ned Flanders before the <em>Simpsons Fortnite</em> season is over? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. <em>Call of Duty</em> is just a week away. We’ll find out how many people still care or if they’re still too busy recovering from their<em> Battlefield 6</em> and<em> Arc Raiders</em> hangovers.</p> <h2><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> is now the fourth best-selling game of all time</h2> <p>That’s another big win for meticulously rendered horse testicles and proof that painstaking craftmanship can propel your game to the top of the charts even if it’s long, often boring, and essentially feels like the Ken Burns documentary of open-world action games. Take-Two confirmed in its latest earnings report that <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> has now sold over 79 million units, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-sales-mario-kart-world-mk8-2000620694">pushing <em>Mario Kart 8</em> <em>Deluxe</em></a> into fifth place.</p>

 <p>But the game also goes on sale for just $20 a lot, whereas <em>Mario Kart 8</em> is rarely below full price. Take-Two says it’s still the top-selling game of the last seven years in the U.S. in terms of dollar sales. So, we’re getting <a href="https://kotaku.com/read-dead-redemption-2-nintendo-switch-port-rating-1850873886">that rumored Switch 2 and PS5 port</a> any day now, right? right??</p>

 <h2>Square Enix hit with mass layoffs</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-gen-ai-square-enix-qa-bugs-2000641688">The <em>Final Fantasy</em> publisher</a> has reportedly fired 140 people across its overseas publishing operations, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-announces-more-layoffs-as-part-of-us-and-europe-restructuring/"><em>VGC</em> reports</a>. The company says the move will save around $20 million as it continues overhauling its gaming business after years of misfires.</p>

 <h2>Ned Flanders has killed over 33,000 <em>Fortnite</em> players</h2> <p>The friendly <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-review-changes-new-map-short-2000640868"><em>Simpsons</em> neighbor</a> is anything but when he’s roaming the map as a deadly NPC.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>To you or me, VR gaming may have quietly died away a few years back, after everyone played&nbsp;<em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> and had their fill of&nbsp;<em>Beat Saber</em>. But to the mysterious collective known as Gen Alpha, the format is alive and well and occupying everything. At the beginning of this year <a href="https://kotaku.com/gorilla-tag-vr-meta-quest-steamvr-free-ghosts-lucy-pbbv-1851741139">we told you about&nbsp;<em>Gorilla Tag</em></a> and its massive audience who were all simultaneously under the shared delusion that the game is haunted. But that’s old hat now, because now we have a new game you’ve almost certainly never heard of with a colossal audience: the mighty <em>UG</em>.</p> <p><em>UG</em>&nbsp;bears a lot of similarities with&nbsp;<em>G-Tag</em>, but it’s not nearly as brazen a copy as it might first appear. The older game is all about being a gorilla, and—well—playing tag. It’s a lot more involved than that, not least because of all the bloody in-app cosmetic purchases, but the key thing is that it’s a game that brilliantly understood how to make free first-person movement work in a VR game without causing nausea or discombobulating incongruence. The trick is to make the player avatar into a creature with two long arms, but no legs, propelled around by the instinctive action of pulling yourself along the ground. This works for climbing and bouncing too, resulting in a way to navigate the large, vertically interesting levels as an ape. <em>UG</em>, rather smartly, just copies this wholesale. Except here (even though everyone just looks like gorillas wearing thongs), you’re playing as a bizarro-world caveman, co-existing with dinosaurs who can be hatched from eggs, raised, saddled, and ridden upon. But most importantly: swapped.</p>

  <p>My window into this peculiar world is my now 11-year-old son, for whom we bought a Meta Quest 3A last Christmas. He’s an only child, and it seemed like a great way for him to play active games with his friends even when he’s at home. And it is! Damn, the muscles he’s built flinging his body around as he plays&nbsp;<em>Gorilla Tag</em> rather put pay to all those tiresome complaints about gaming making kids sedentary. After nearly a year of on-and-off phases of playing the game, about three weeks ago a <em>G-Tag</em> playing friend told him he needed to install something new, called <em>UG</em>, and to do it with some matter of urgency. However, because every electronic item he owns is locked down to the point of being brick-like without my permissions, he then came begging to me. I checked it over, thought it looked like yet another <em>Gorilla Tag</em> knock-off he’d bounce off in a couple of days like all the others, but given it was free, I said sure.</p>

 <p>Our lives are now very much about prying him free of his headset for brief moments in which he’s not attempting to feed chickens to an ever-growing menagerie of dinosaurs. For him and squillions of kids around the world, <em>UG</em> has become a big deal.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642107" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642107"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642107">© ContinuumXR / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Quite why is really very fascinating to me, a dad looking on in bemusement (often directly, via the mobile app, where I’m instructed to cast his game to my phone so I can see the new additions to his prehistoric collection). Because while <em>Gorilla Tag</em> has a central game around which everything else is built (tag),&nbsp;<em>UG</em> does not. It’s instead a similarly designed series of large, open spaces, where players can take dinos they’ve collected to help them level up by feeding them food. Right now this food is either comically prehistoric-looking chickens or pigs, which you hold in front of your dinosaur’s foot to have it magically pop into cooked ribs and drumsticks (yes, chicken ribs and pork drumsticks), which you then feed to the beast’s mouth. As it eats its gains XP, and at level 5 will have a sudden growth spurt and become large enough to “buy” a saddle for (with in-game Bones), and then you can ride it around as your mount. There are large dinosaur bosses to fight, with very small chances of a victory seeing an egg drop as loot, but that’s about it. This is, instead, all about the trading.</p>

 <p>I should mention, there very much are in-app purchases for both cosmetics and special versions of the imaginary dinosaurs that inhabit the game, and this sucks big-time. We’ve had full-on rows over my son’s belief that $30 is a very reasonable price for a bundle, because bought separately they’d cost so much more. “THEY’RE PICTURES THAT DON’T COST <em>ANYTHING </em>TO MAKE!” I’ve yelled in exasperation, waving my arms around and adding things like, “YOU’RE TRYING TO SPEND TWENTY-FIVE POUNDS ON DRAWINGS THAT DON’T EVEN EXIST!” I don’t understand. I’m an old fool who just doesn’t get it. And it’s his money, so how is it any of my business! And so on. But that aside, there are various ways to get your own dinosaurs without paying, primary among them swapping something you have for something someone else has.</p>

 <p>To this end, the game’s main hub area has trading tables on which players can place up to five creatures they’re willing to exchange, and then each pulls a lever to seal the deal. And watching this is&nbsp;<em>extraordinary</em>. Imagine the trading floor of a financial market, but with pre-pubescent voices. It’s frantic and furious, with stakes constantly being raised as multiple people on the server start trying to outbid a player for their especially interestingly patterned version of a Grugadon. And often, this is before the kid has even suggested they’re interested in trading, just happening to have stomped by while riding their proudest dino. My son has often had to escape to a private instance (you dial a random four-digit code into a machine to do this) to get away from marauding crowds trying to scream over each other for his electric-blue Triskeletops.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642108" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642108"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642108">© ContinuumXR / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The game also demonstrates plenty of the peculiar conspiratorial nonsense that pervades&nbsp;<em>Gorilla Tag</em>. Because, guys, have you heard, Mammothors are getting deleted tomorrow? No, seriously, they’re pulling them from the game. You see, this admin leaked them before he was supposed to, and now they’re taking them all out of the game. This was the BIG story the week before last, and I’d hear kids talking about it (a weird thing about the Meta Quest headset is you can hear everything if you’re in the same room, but they can’t hear you when you mock them from the couch) no matter how many different servers my kid was on. Via the magic of checking the Discord (that just recently celebrated 100,000 members), I discovered that absolutely no dinosaurs are being deleted (clearly the rumors had spread far enough that there was a need to publicly respond), and then hilariously enough, come November’s post-Halloween update, Mammothors have become the focus. Every nonsensical memetic belief seems to be based around these spurious “admins,” not least the wild theories that everyone seems to believe about “duping,” based on a bug that was eliminated from the game over a month before. It’s fascinating to observe how these rumors evolve and spread, formed from nothing at all, and how hard it can be to dispel any one of these beliefs.</p> <p>But as inaccessibly weird as it all appears to me, there is a vast audience out there, and it’s growing fast. There have been an awful lot of attempts to muscle in on the success of <em>Gorilla Tag</em> in the three years since it released, perhaps most successfully by an extremely similar game called&nbsp;<em>Animal Company&nbsp;</em>that, earlier this year, became the most popular game on the Meta store. But most others come and go as the obvious knock-offs they are. <em>UG</em> is doing something different, however. It’s been sitting at the top of the Meta charts for weeks now, and while the perennial hit <em>Beat Saber</em> still sits in second, it’s&nbsp;<em>Animal Company</em> that’s third, while <em>Gorilla Tag</em> has been dethroned to fourth place. This really seems to suggest the caveman game is siphoning players directly from <em>G-Tag</em>‘s audience. It’s interesting to note that 2022’s gorilla game has amassed 164,000 ratings over the last three years, while <em>UG</em> already has acquired 163,000 in just the three months since it released.</p> <p>But these games have mercurial audiences, and at any moment&nbsp;<em>UG</em> could become last month’s thing, forgotten in the pile of free-to-play games inside the headset, as everyone moves on to the next near-identical game. And we, the people who think we’re the normal game players, will likely not even know any of it is happening.</p>

Once WoW's Midnight expansion releases, Hearthsteel will be available for purchase with real money and will only be used for housing items in the in-game shop. Items and Hearthsteel amounts available for purchase should align in a "player-friendly way," Blizzard states.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WmG98apVwKw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="2">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WmG98apVwKw?start=2" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The big question many players have is why introduce a virtual currency at all? Microtransactions have existed in WoW for a long time now. Blizzard confirmed earlier this year it would sell premium housing items, something that was expected. But buying a fancy store mount or transmog set has always been done with real money as opposed to having to first buy a currency. According to Blizzard, using real money when purchasing multiple items can be "inefficient, inconvenient, and often tedious."</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard then seems to confirm that players who buy housing items on the shop will need to buy multiples of the same item if they want, for example, a full set of chairs, as opposed to making a single purchase and then being able to put down as many chairs as one wants.</p><p dir="ltr">"Using an in-game currency can help make the process of obtaining many of these types of inexpensive items more efficient," Blizzard states.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard notes that as is the case with store mounts, the vast majority of housing items will be earnable in-game by playing, with only a small selection of housing items available on the shop. Housing items tied to a core class or race fantasy, or "thematically important decor," won't be sold in the shop either. A housing catalog will be visible in the house-decorating UI that will let players preview decor items (including ones from the shop), so players can decide if they wish to purchase or work towards earning a specific piece of decor.</p><p dir="ltr">The end of Blizzard's Hearthsteel blog post tells players to keep the feedback coming, and judging from places like the WoW subreddit, there is plenty of (negative) feedback to go around. Some players aren't finding Blizzard's justification for the virtual currency convincing.</p><p dir="ltr">"The only reason for a virtual currency is to do the exact opposite and nudge people into buying more shit because they have leftover balance," user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1oq65xb/comment/nnh43m0/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pariah</a> writes. "As if that's a secret to anyone these days."</p><p dir="ltr">As another user, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1oq65xb/comment/nnghh4b/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lord0fHats</a>, puts it: "Selling housing decor and such was a no brainer, but they had to adopt a particularly toxic method of doing it. Very disappointing."</p><p dir="ltr">Whether or not player concerns and feedback will cause Blizzard to reconsider its approach remains to be seen, but for many players who have been waiting for player housing for decades, the pivot into a virtual currency looks like nothing more than a cash grab.</p><p dir="ltr">In other WoW microtransaction news, the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-infamous-90-dinosaur-mount-may-be-coming-back/1100-6535911/" data-ref-id="1100-6535911">infamous $90 dinosaur mount</a> may be returning to the shop. Housing early access, meanwhile, is set to arrive with the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-will-launch-with-patch-11-2-7-but-not-in-full/1100-6534018/" data-ref-id="1100-6534018">11.2.7 patch</a> before the end of the year, with Midnight proper set to release early in 2026. Those waiting for WoW to arrive on console will keep waiting, as the game's director said a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-isnt-coming-to-consoles-game-director-says-no-reason-for-us-to-hide-anything-about-this/1100-6535952/" data-ref-id="1100-6535952">console version of WoW isn't in the works</a>.</p>

			<p>You can really feel the Super Smash Bros. coming through in Kirby Air Riders. The distinctive tone of a Masahiro Sakurai game is clear to see, from the menu UI, to the iconography of the collectables, and the general gameplay ethos. With the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/23/the-kirby-air-riders-direct-just-revealed-so-much-stuff-top-ride-amiibo-online-demo-and-more/">first Global Test Ride demo event</a> kicking off this weekend, and ahead of a release later this month, I had a fresh opportunity to play this game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kirby Air Riders – Road Trip opening video (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y5iu4lOM37w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Having already gone <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/23/kirby-air-riders-preview-powering-up-a-gamecube-classic-for-a-new-generation/">hands-on back at Gamescom</a> in August, I was much better prepared for what Kirby Air Riders actually is. At first glance, it appears to be a follow cam racer in the vein of Mario Kart, but from the style of the racing to all the other modes that are featured in the game, it’s really nothing like Nintendo’s main kart racer.</p>


<p>For one thing, your vehicle just starts driving with no input from yourself, and the game will even (as I remembered from August) tell you off if you push forward on the analogue stick. Thankfully, I had far fewer visual slaps on the wrist this time around, and I quickly got back into the groove of this one-button racer. You really just have to concentrate on turning and pressing the context-sensitive B button, which will cause you to slow down and drift, gobble up incidental enemies, and batter any nearby rival racers with a Copy Ability that you’ve picked up.</p>


<p>There’s a few exceptions to this simplicity, with a spin attack needing you to waggle the left stick, and pulling back and forward to fly and glide from any ramps. Oh, and your character’s special ability is unleashed by hitting Y. And that’s basically it, though there are some more advanced techniques to learn, such as pumping the brakes to drift through corners without losing speed.</p>
<p>I got to put this to the test once more through the standard Air Ride mode, racing through three courses –&nbsp;the grassy meadows of Floria Fields, the almost biblical sea-splitting of Waveflow Waters, and the charming sunset ride of Mount Amberfalls. The racing is pretty rapid, with plenty of tight corners, the odd side route, and the three tracks having different numbers of laps depending on their length. Waveflow Waters felt particularly manic, as you could easily crash through the water walls of some sections and end up in the wet stuff for a few moments, and there’s some cinematic grind rails and jumps that pull some unexpected moves with the camera.</p>
<p>Revealed during the jam-packed Kirby Air Riders Direct a couple weeks ago, there’s also top-down racing with the Top Ride mode, but I feel that the real heart of this game is in the City Trial and the vehicular combat party game vibes that it gives off.</p>

<p>This was something I was utterly unprepared for during my first hands on –&nbsp;I didn’t play the GameCube original and hadn’t seen the first Direct for this game – but knowing more of what to expect, I could get into the swing of things a fair bit more. There’s tons of characters to choose from, each with their own special ability, and they can be combined with a bunch of vehicles that all have distinctive characteristics, but you have to go and find the vehicle you want when starting off in City Ride.</p>
<p>You’re basically just racing around and running into as many pick ups as possible. No need to be too discerning about what you grab, as they all go to boost your vehicle’s stats… unless they’re greyed out debuffs that you need to try and avoid instead. Skyah is a deceptively compact-feeling map with a ton of secretive feeling paths between the various locations and layers to explore, and the action is constantly mixed up by having portals to drive through, and then the big Field Events to try and draw players together. These can be things like a mini race, a huge pillar to collectively try and destroy, gigantification, or teleporting you all to a dustup derby arena for a knockout battle.</p>
<p>What’s startling is just how much the speed and action ramps up through the few minutes that you’re racing around in Skyah. If you’re sat a bit too close to the screen (as we were), it can be genuinely a bit disorienting just how quick you end up going.</p>

<p>And then, as time is up, you have the other pretty unique distinction of being able to choose the final challenge that you face in the Stadium. Four of these final modes are presented to you, and instead of voting and everyone being lumped together from that, you can actually just go and do the thing you want. If you’ve ended up with a machine that has been built for combat instead of speed, you probably want that Dustup Derby instead of a straight up race, while your more agile vehicle might help with dodging lasers, a better flier will be better suited to Air Glider or High Jump, and there’s some 90s game show classics like trying to hit scores markers on a big wall.</p>
<p>I feel that Kirby Air Riders, much like its forebear, is destined to gain a cult following. There’s a deceptive simplicity to the game that can make it accessible, and that can enable the more chaotic side of the game in City Trial. It’s also clear just how much passion Masahiro Sakurai and the team have for this game. It might not be for everyone in quite the same way as Smash Bros. is, but it’s certainly worth finding out if it is for you with the online tests over the coming weekends.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/site-news-nintendo-life-turns-20-today.1347046/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="55e2521cde71a"><a title="Nintendo Life x Birthday Cake" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/55e2521cde71a/nintendo-life-x-birthday-cake.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Wow, where to start? It’s official, though. It’s been 20 years since I sat down and cobbled together the somewhat infamous '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2005/11/our_nintendo_life_begins">Our Nintendo Life Begins…</a>' article back in late 2005, a world before iPhones, iPads, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, and YouTube wasn’t even a year old yet.</p>
<p>How times have changed. Both generally and specifically, the video game industry.</p>
<p>When I wrote that first article, we were technically still in the <em>GameCube</em> era. I had really enjoyed my brief stint putting together 'GameCube UK', a website all about… (you guessed it) GameCube in 2001-2002. Then, with the Nintendo 'Revolution' on the horizon, I was getting the itch to get back into running a website about games, and Nintendo <em>Life</em> was born.</p>
<p>Back when the site turned 10, I penned <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/11/site_news_nintendo_life_turns_10_today">an article that details the early years of Nintendo Life</a>, if you are interested in that.</p>
<p>The site's name truly <em>is</em> fitting, though, considering that over the years it has become a bigger and bigger part of my life, dominating my entire adult existence. There can’t be many days over the last 20 years that I haven’t interacted with it in some way or at least read/replied to a related email.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough self-indulgence. I’m incredibly proud of Nintendo Life reaching this milestone. It is a testament to all the lovely people who have been on our team, both the amazing staff we have today and all who have come before over the decades. Without them, the website would simply be a shell.</p>
<p>Nintendo Life (mega)evolved from a hobbyist project into a fully fledged business and helped launch the careers of lots of people, most of whom are still working in the games industry today.</p>
<p>We also have to thank Nintendo itself for simply doing what Nintendo does. Given the turbulent times they have faced over the last two decades, I think this particular anniversary finds them in a pretty good position, all things considered. They’ve clearly evolved during the Switch 1 era, mainly for the better, but like any corporation driven by profits, they still have some negative aspects that concern me, as a fan.</p>
<figure data-uuid="3b070abe93bc0"><a title="Nintendo Life @ 20" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3b070abe93bc0/nintendo-life-at-20.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Nintendo Life as it looks on it's 20th Birthday, complete here with a Hyrule Warriors advert — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Nintendo UK and Nintendo of America have been very supportive of Nintendo Life over the years, and we continue to appreciate their cooperation and respect.</p>
<p>Last but certainly not least, we have to thank you. Yes, you, the reader, the viewer, the user, the watcher. If you are reading this, you are part of our journey. Some of you have been around since the beginning, and for some maybe this is your first ever article. Without you, our audience, there would be no Nintendo Life. From the bottom of our hearts, thank you for visiting.</p>
<p>Everything may have started with Nintendo Life, but in those 20 years, we also started a family. Our company name became <a href="https://hookshot.media/">Hookshot</a> and spawned new sites that you all (hopefully) know and love with <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/">Push Square</a>, <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/">Pure Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/">Time Extension</a>. Although each site has its own dedicated staff, Hookshot itself is one big team, something we are all incredibly proud of.</p>
<p>Only yesterday, the Hookshot team grew once more as we launched the new <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/">Digital Foundry website</a>, a new partnership between the newly independent Digital Foundry and Hookshot.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/related-articles:193425 @ 1762531203 -->
<p>It’s hard to know where Nintendo Life will be in another 20 years' time; uncertain times are almost certainly ahead. Right now, the internet is clearly evolving, and so must we.</p>
<p>Support from our audience is required now, more than ever. If you enjoy our work, it’s easy to support us. Visit the website (without an adblocker) or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/03/site-news-love-what-we-do-become-a-nintendo-life-supporter">become a paid supporter</a> - then, if you can, spread the word to your friends, and finally, tell us how Nintendo Life can serve <em>you</em> better.</p>
<p>Today, though, is for celebration, and whilst 7th November 2025 is the official birthday/anniversary of Nintendo Life turning 20, we will be putting together various mini projects and articles over the next 12 months to fully celebrate the occasion. Watch this space!</p>
<p>Thanks for playing!</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/take-two-boss-borderlands-4-sales-softer-than-expected-poor-pc-release/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/take-two-boss-says-borderlands-4-sales-were-%E2%80%9Csofter%E2%80%9D-than-expected-points-to-poor-pc-release.1347043/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>On one hand, Borderlands 4 had a strong launch. In its opening hours, it had the biggest launch for the entire Borderlands series on PC <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-out-now-already-biggest-borderlands-game-on-steam/">with over 100K concurrent players on Steam</a>, eventually hitting <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1285190/charts/#max">over 300K on its opening weekend</a>. It hit <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-sold-2-million-units-earned-150-million/">2 million units sold in its opening week</a>, and for September 2025, it <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-tops-us-sales-charts-ghost-of-yotei-matched-tsushima-covid-era-numbers/">topped sales charts in the US, becoming one of the best-selling games in the US for 2025 so far</a>. That said, according to Take-Two Interactive boss Strauss Zelnick, sales were "<em>softer</em>" than expected.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-again">The Game Business</a> that went live shortly after the announcement that <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">Grand Theft Auto VI was delayed</a>, Zelnick also commented on the sales for Borderlands 4. While Zelnick commended the game's critical reception, he called the commercial success of the game "<em>softer</em>" than the company would have liked, and specifically cited the poor performance and myriad of bugs that the game launched with on PC as part of why it has fallen below expectations.</p>



<p>"<em>The critical acclaim [for Borderlands 4] was superb,</em>" Zelnick said, "<em>and we're really happy with the release. Equally, as you know, there were some challenges with the Steam release. Gearbox has been addressing those challenges and will continue to do so. So, in terms of units sold out of the gate, the numbers were a little softer than we would have liked. In the fullness of time, we think it's going to do great</em>."</p>



<p>You may recall that when Borderlands 4 launched and its PC performance was abysmal in many ways, Gearbox boss <a href="https://wccftech.com/gearbox-boss-tells-4k-stubborn-players-switch-1440p-use-dlss/">Randy Pitchford went on a tirade on X (formerly Twitter)</a> and fought back against players who were rightfully complaining that this new triple-A game they bought wasn't running well on their machines. Pitchford even <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967424826697781446">called the PC version "<em>pretty optimal</em>"</a> when the game was facing well-deserved backlash.</p>



<p>Thankfully, Zelnick is right that Gearbox has been working to address its issues. A patch from a couple of weeks ago <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-october-23-patch-performance-improvements/">specifically improved performance by double-digits</a>. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[5 Biggest Things We’ve Learned From EA FC Open-World Leaks]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-things-learned-from-ea-fc-open-world-leaks/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/5-biggest-things-we%E2%80%99ve-learned-from-ea-fc-open-world-leaks.1347037/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>EA is bringing one of the biggest changes to EA FC in history with the open-world game mode. A ton of leaks dropped following the feature’s worldwide playtest, and we’ve seen many of the new inclusions first-hand, so let’s pick apart crucial leaks.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fc-26-announces-12-new-icons-including-francesco-totti-andres-iniesta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA FC</a> (formerly FIFA) is the biggest sports game year in, year out. It’s an unstoppable juggernaut that, no matter how badly it’s received, how poorly it reviews, etc, it will still sell millions of copies. Despite this, EA knows that remaining stagnant isn’t good for the series. This is why plans for an open-world EA FC mode were unveiled a couple of years ago. With the first playtest well underway, here are our handpicked key takeaways.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-ea-fc-open-world-game-mode-leaks">Best EA FC Open-World Game Mode Leaks</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Messi will be going strong in 2026. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-ea-fc-open-world-release-period-likely-revealed">EA FC Open World Release Period Likely Revealed</h3>



<p>One of the most shocking and eye-opening revelations from the EA FC open-world leaks is the mode’s potential release window already. Playtesting will take a while, and there’s presumably already been internal testing. But we learned from <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FootballGamingZone</a> that an internal EA presentation featured countless references to one thing in particular—<strong>EA FC 27</strong>.</p>



<p>This could easily change between now and EA giving the mode the full green light to be added. However, until we hear otherwise, one of the biggest EA FC open-world leaks is its potential <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fcs-new-open-world-mode-release-window/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release window</a>, and that it could arrive in 2026 alongside EA FC 27.</p>



<h3 id="h-lots-of-game-modes-amp-mini-games">Lots Of Game Modes &amp; Mini-Games</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A smart integration into EA FC. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Initial leaks suggest there are quite a few <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/every-game-mode-in-ea-fcs-open-world-playtest-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game modes</a> to try out already: Six, to be precise.</p>



<ul>
<li>Balloon Ball</li>



<li>Closest To The Pin</li>



<li>Draw The Line</li>



<li>Foot Tennis</li>



<li>Kickabouts</li>



<li>Rush</li>
</ul>



<p>Most of them are fairly self-explanatory. <strong>Rush</strong> is Rush, but with even fewer rules. You need to move the ball around in <strong>Draw The Line</strong> in a way that resembles shapes to score points, and <strong>Closest To The Pin</strong> plays into its Golf theme by requiring you to get your ball as close to the target as possible.</p>



<p><strong>Foot Tennis</strong> is just like real-life Foot Tennis, <strong>Kickabouts</strong> is similar to Volta, and <strong>Balloon Ball</strong> is easily the most diverse mode, requiring you to go full dodgeball by popping balloons and using power-ups to raise the stakes!</p>



<h3 id="h-we-re-going-continent-hopping">We’re Going Continent Hopping</h3>



<p>Another <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FGZ</a> exclusive: The open world mode has <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/exclusive-ea-fcs-open-world-will-have-several-maps-to-explore-based-on-major-countries/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several maps to explore based on major countries</a>.</p>



<p>The leaked presentation suggests we can jump from Europe to South America, as <strong>England</strong>, <strong>France</strong>, and <strong>Argentina</strong> are the early maps that players can explore. It’s expected that each of these districts (apart from looking culturally accurate) will have subtle nuances to make them significant. Whether this is unique mini-games or specific items remains to be seen.</p>



<h3 id="h-it-will-have-another-battle-pass">It Will Have Another Battle Pass</h3>



<p>What, you didn’t want another EA FC Battle Pass to pay for? It’s EA, so another way to make money from this mode was never going to be out of the question. Don’t be surprised to see a unique shop just for the open world, but a <a href="https://footballgamingzone.com/ea-sports-fc/exclusive-ea-fcs-open-world-mode-has-battle-pass-stacked-with-cosmetics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Pass stacked with cosmetics</a> is also part of the experience.</p>



<p>According to FGZ, it will feature: “Shoes, jackets, tops, trousers, and hats distributed, along with Club Points.”</p>



<p>Speaking of which.</p>



<h3 id="h-ea-fc-open-world-amp-ea-fc-will-work-alongside-each-other">EA FC Open World &amp; EA FC Will Work Alongside Each Other</h3>



<figure><figcaption>A big move. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Battle Pass’ contents underlines that the <strong>open world will be integrated into the core EA FC experience</strong>.</p>



<p>Playtesters and leaked information have revealed that it uses the same progression system that Pro Clubs uses in EA FC 26 and other recent FC games. You choose an Archetype, level up stats, earn XP, and make use of typical Clubs features.</p>



<p>It’s up to you to decide if this is lazy or not. But if you can switch your Pro from Clubs to Open-World mode, it gives you different avenues to level up your character and do it outside of a competitive environment at least.</p>



<p>What do you make of the EA FC Open-World leaks? Does the mode sound fun? Could it revolutionize the FC franchise forever?

The franchise started off in 2018 as an anime, followed by a Japan-only release of the mobile game in 2021. In the game, players can talk to, train and manage horse-girls like Special Week and Mejiro McQueen, sharing in their triumphs and losses. As a result, the Umamusume franchise has inspired a cult following, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/umamusume-pretty-derby-dev-reminds-fans-to-follow-the-rules-when-visiting-the-real-life-japanese-racehorses-behind-their-favorite-anime-horse-girls">many fans have become interested in the real-life Japanese racehorses behind their favorite characters</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in March 2023, Konami filed a lawsuit against Cygames, claiming that Cygame’s Umamusume: Pretty Derby infringed upon 18 of its patents. Konami originally called for over 4 billion yen (approx. $26 million at current exchange rates) in damages, and for Cygames to cease all production, usage and distribution of the mobile game. In response, Cygames requested invalidation trials against all the patents involved.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cygames revealed in a <a href="https://pdf.cyberagent.co.jp/C4751/lAG8/V61w/TjOR.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>press release</u></a> today that it has decided to settle the disagreement to ensure that players can continue to enjoy Umamusume: Pretty Derby in the long run. Despite this decision, Cygames “remains confident that no patent infringement has occurred.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both Konami and Cygames expressed respect for each other’s creators and games in their press releases about the settlement. Cygames stated that their group company “respects the efforts of creators at companies in the game industry, including Konami Digital Entertainment, and the numerous games they have created.” In turn, Konami <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/corporate/ja/news/release/20251107/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commented</u></a> that “we will respect each other’s creative works and strive to provide content and services that please our customers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to a <a href="https://www.cygames.co.jp/news/id-23172/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>press release</u></a> from 2023, Cygames had been in discussion with Konami about patent rights “pertaining to certain aspects of Umamusume: Pretty Derby’s game systems and programs,” however, it seems Konami disagreed with Cygames and filed the lawsuit. Both companies have been secretive about exactly which aspects of Umamusume: Pretty Derby caused the disagreement. Considering Konami’s history of making sports management games like Powerful Pro Baseball, it is possible that Umamusume: Pretty Derby’s in-game system for training its anime horse girls was part of the issue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both companies stress that due to a confidentiality agreement, the details of the settlement will not be made public.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

Apart from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/minecraft"><u>Minecraft</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v"><u>GTA 5</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/wii-sports"><u>Wii Sports</u></a>, which have sold 350 million, 220 million, and 82.9 million copies, respectively, Red Dead Redemption 2 has outsold everything.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With 79 million sales, that puts Red Dead 2 just ahead of the prior fourth-place Mario Kart 8's estimated 78.02 million sales, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pubg-battlegrounds"><u>PUBG</u></a> (75 million), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-oregon-trail"><u>The Oregon Trail</u></a> (65 million), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/terraria"><u>Terraria</u></a> (64 million), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt"><u>The Witcher 3</u></a> (60 million), and the original 1985 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/super-mario-bros"><u>Super Mario Bros</u></a>. (58 million).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You'd think then, that Red Dead Redemption 3 is a dead cert. But Rockstar has yet to announce a sequel. Earlier this week, Rockstar Games co-founder and former lead writer Dan Houser said he’d feel more <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-says-red-dead-redemption-3-will-probably-happen-and-hed-feel-a-bit-sad-about-it-because-it-was-a-cohesive-two-game-arc"><u>sad to learn Red Dead Redemption 3 was in development without him than he feels about GTA 6, but admits the game "will probably happen."</u></a> As lead writer, Houser wrote almost all of Rockstar’s games, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-games-co-founder-leaves-company-dan-houser-red-dead-redemption-gta"><u>having left the company over five years ago</u></a>, Houser recently confirmed to IGN that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dan-houser-says-gta-6-will-be-great-but-thinks-the-world-probably-had-enough-gta-from-me-in-first-comments-since-leaving-rockstar"><u>GTA 6 won’t have a story or a character set he developed</u></a>, but expects the game to be great nonetheless.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Of course, letting go of something I worked on in one way or another for like 20-odd years, and wrote on them for the last 10 or 11 that came out, wrote all of them, or you know, lead writer on all of them, whatever it was… letting go of that is a big change. And sad in a way,” Houser said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Because each of the [Grand Theft Auto] games was a kind of standalone story it’s not quite the same as… I think probably it would be in some ways sadder if someone continued on Red Dead, because it was a cohesive two-game arc. That might be more sad to hear someone working on that. But again, that will probably happen too. I don't own the IP. That was part of the deal. It's a privilege to work on stuff, but you don't necessarily own it.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Rockstar Game Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2023, Roger Clark, who played Arthur Morgan, the main playable protagonist of Red Dead Redemption 2, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arthur-morgan-actor-certain-rockstar-will-make-red-dead-redemption-3-eventually">said he was “certain” fans will see Red Dead Redemption 3 “one day,”</a> but qualified that statement by saying he had no idea when that would be. Clark also ruled out the return of Arthur Morgan in the game, should it come to be. If you’ve played Red Dead Redemption 2, this might seem like stating the obvious, but there’s always the chance Rockstar may consider another prequel of some kind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I’m certain we will see Red Redemption 3 one day,” Clark said. “When that will be — I have absolutely no idea. Don’t count on Arthur’s involvement either. His story has been told, I feel.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/before-rockstar-i-was-just-a-jobbing-actor-off-broadway-arthur-morgan-actor-roger-clark-on-the-red-dead-redemption-2-effect">a subsequent interview with IGN</a>, Clark expanded on his thoughts: “Yeah, that got really picked up! I would have thought that was obvious though. Wouldn’t you? And it’s not like I have any insider information whatsoever, but of course there’s going to be another Red Dead. It sold over 60 million copies!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: “Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Take-Two said it himself. He said GTA and Red Dead are prominent franchises for Rockstar Games and that they will be returning to them in the future. So there’s no doubt there will be another Red Dead. But if Arthur Morgan will be involved? I highly doubt it, to be honest. And I think it’s going to be quite some time before we even see a snifter of anything new Red Dead related. I have no idea how it would pan out, but I wouldn’t bet on Arthur being a part of it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, Red Dead Redemption 2 is widely considered to be one of the best video games of all time. We thought it was a masterpiece, too, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-review"><u>IGN's review returning a 10/10</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not sure if you’ve heard, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">GTA 6 has been delayed again</a>. Yes, Rockstar has pushed back Grand Theft Auto’s return to its Miami-inspired setting of Vice City to November 19, 2026. I, for one, am sad about this, as I’m sure you may well also be. But this announcement isn’t necessarily bad news for everyone. So, let’s see who may profit and who might take a hit from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6’s</a> latest change of date. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Every Spring 2026 Game - Winners</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Congratulations, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/007-first-light">007 First Light</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/saros">Saros</a>, and any other game currently planning on a March or April 2026 release. I’m sure a huge sigh of relief was let out at the South Korean headquarters of Pearl Abyss and the Scandinavian studios of IO Interactive and Housemarque. Not only should it benefit the sales of these games due to players’ money that was set aside for GTA 6’s previous May date now being freed up to be spent elsewhere, but it may even give them a little wiggle room to delay a few weeks themselves and avoid that dreaded crunch in order to get out before Rockstar’s behemoth — something <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-beyond-early-2026">Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra has already done by moving “beyond early 2026”</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">99 Details in the GTA 6 Trailer - Slideshow</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">PC Gamers - Losers</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Sorry, PC gamers, but if history is anything to go by, then the wait for GTA 6 has just got even longer for you. If Rockstar is to follow its normal pattern of releases, it could well be a couple of years yet until the state of Leonida makes its way to Windows. For reference, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> launched on consoles on October 26, 2018, but didn’t find its way onto Steam until a whole year later November 5, 2019. The wait for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> on PC was even longer, with its April 14, 2015 release coming 19 months after its original September 17, 2013 console arrival. So, apologies again, but if PC is your chosen place to play, you may well be looking deep into 2027 or even early 2028 to play GTA 6.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">GTA 6’s Developers - It’s Complicated</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In theory, delaying GTA 6 is a good thing for the development team at Rockstar, hopefully preventing excessive crunch impacting the studio as it races towards deadlines. But this week also saw 30 to 40 Rockstar employees fired from their positions at the company for what <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-studio-rockstar-accuses-fired-employees-of-leaking-confidential-information-in-a-public-forum">Rockstar describes as leaking “confidential information in a public forum”</a>. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-dev-rockstar-accused-of-union-busting-in-sudden-firing-of-dozens-of-staff">Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) claims this was "blatant" and "ruthless" union busting</a>, though. This is a developing situation with no clear answers at the moment. What <em>is </em>clear, though, is that having a few dozen fewer employees definitely won’t ease the burden on the developers still at the studio. Let’s hope that the theoretical crunch time saved by the delay won’t have been completely negated by this reduction in workforce.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Mandalorian and Grogu - Winners</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Pedro Pascal wins again. Yes, The Mandalorian’s feature film debut alongside his little green friend, Grogu, is scheduled to release on May 22, 2026 — the same week as GTA 6’s previous release date, May 26, 2026. Well, the upcoming Star Wars film now seemingly has a clear runway to rake it in at the box office, with people being more likely to leave their house now that the distraction of Grand Theft Auto glueing them to their TV screens is being taken away. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Microsoft - Loser</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft and its Xbox Game Studios are due for a big 2026. But with no release dates currently known for its big hitters — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fable">Fable</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-campaign-evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War E-Day</a>, and 2026’s Call of Duty included — could this spell a problem for the publisher? We can safely assume that Call of Duty would’ve been eyeing up a similar release date to GTA 6’s new November one, which would no doubt impact its playerbase, and surely at least one other game from that list has a late 2026 window pencilled in. Could this scupper Microsoft’s plan for the end of next year and mean one or two games have to get pushed back to early 2027? Of course, it would be wise to get something out the door before Grand Theft Auto arrives, but there’s only so fast developers can work, and I’d much rather wait than hear more horror stories of studio crunch.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Summer Game Events - Winners</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The bad news? You won’t be playing GTA 6 in late May. The good news? You’re now free to attend IGN Live in early June, our special event in Los Angeles, open to the public to come and enjoy all the fun of new and upcoming video games. But apart from that, it also means that all of the summer shows, such as Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest, are in no trouble of being overshadowed by the release of Grand Theft Auto just a couple of weeks prior. This means we can enjoy all of the new game announcements and looks at gameplay without having to tear ourselves away from Vice City. I’d just recommend that nobody pick November as their chosen release date at the end of those trailers.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Marvel’s Wolverine - Loser</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently scheduled for a “late 2026” release window, one of Sony’s biggest hitters for next year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvels-wolverine">Marvel’s Wolverine</a>, may want to get out before the end of October at the latest to avoid being impacted by GTA 6. In truth, any game looking to launch towards the end of next year is probably scrambling to put together a plan right now, and it will be no different between Insomniac and PlayStation as they work out the best course of action.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Black Friday 2026 Console Sellers - Winners</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">GTA 6 will now drop just before Black Friday 2026, so expect both PS5 and Xbox Series X/S bundles to be in more demand than ever across Capitalism’s favourite weekend of the year. Expect low stock as electronic stores around the world make all the money they can as people get their Grand Theft Auto machines into their homes.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Us, The Players - Losers (and Winners)</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Another six months of waiting may feel painful right now, but let’s try to look on the bright side. We get our summer back. Go outside. Enjoy an ice cream. Run around on the beach and get sand between your toes. Catch up with an old friend in a leafy beer garden. Watch every minute of the World Cup. November will be here before you know it. Those shorter winter days are much better suited to locking all the doors and playing games all day, anyway.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

Play solo or gather a team of up to four players. Arm yourselves to the teeth, grab supplies, and set out to conquer the canyons on massive Crawlers.</p><p><strong>Crawlers</strong></p><p>The vast waters disappeared hundreds of years ago, but the spirit of the pioneer ancestors and their inventions remain timeless. Become the captain of a Crawler—a colossal machine from the past, essential for traversing the canyons.</p><!-- AD: content -->

You’re very welcome here, especially if you’re tasty. Gather loyal friends, load ammo onto your rusty Crawler, and embark on expeditions to conquer, save, build, or destroy these damned canyons. Will you risk everything for legendary rewards, or will you wisely return home when things get tough? The choice is yours. There are no right decisions or proven paths here, but there is a complex procedural generation system with hand-crafted details and unique events that will let you feel the crunch of sand under your scurvy-ridden teeth over and over again.</p><p><strong><a title="Games > Haven [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/haven">Haven</a></strong></p><p>No matter how brave a warrior you are, one day you’ll have to return home.

Besides improving basic stats, you can master dozens of professions, each enhancing your character in some aspect of the game.</p><p>While shooting bottles and lifting weights, don’t forget about morality. The canyons are a harsh place, often forcing difficult choices. How will you treat a survivor dying of thirst? Give them precious water, take them to your harbor, rob them, leave them to the monsters, or even eat them yourself? The decision is yours! But remember, everything has consequences.</p><p><strong>Inhabitants</strong></p><p>No matter how crazy an idea seems, it will always gather a group of followers. The canyons are no exception. The crowd here is peculiar. Lawmen, Marauders, the Diesel Cult, and many others await you on their lands. Or don’t—they might react uniquely to your actions and morality score. Find common ground with them, and they will aid you. For example, the Lawmen can provide the best equipment, the Diesel Cult can grant access to the finest transport and Crawler modules, and the Sun Fanatics will simply blow your head off—they are hated by everyone, and the feeling is mutual.</p><p>Of course, humans are not the only inhabitants of these lands. In the canyons, you will encounter Shrivelled, Creepers, Savages, and many other creatures that mothers use to scare misbehaving children.</p></div><p>Watch the trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/canyons-gameplay-teaser-trailer-co-op-pve-third-person-shooter-for-ps5-pc]]></content:encoded>

Some of the responses have been brutally honest, others have taken the news in their stride with cheeky responses, and some people have overreacted really badly to the delay.</p><p>Fortunately, there are a lot of games scheduled to launch next year, and if you want to plan around GTA 6, you can check out our list of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2026-upcoming-games-release-schedule/1100-6534941/" data-ref-id="1100-6534941" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2026-upcoming-games-release-schedule/1100-6534941/">2026 game releases</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/redbullgaming/status/1986546697355600227" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">IT WILL BE WORTH THE WAIT<br>IT WILL BE WORTH THE WAIT<br>IT WILL BE WORTH THE WAIT<br>IT WILL BE WORTH THE WAIT<br>IT WILL BE WORTH THE WAIT <a href="https://t.co/fsrDbPtHv1" rel="nofollow " data-mce-href="https://t.co/fsrDbPtHv1">https://t.co/fsrDbPtHv1</a></p>— Red Bull Gaming (@redbullgaming) <a href="https://twitter.com/redbullgaming/status/1986546697355600227?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-mce-href="https://twitter.com/redbullgaming/status/1986546697355600227?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Several analysts believe <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-most-important-game-release-in-industrys-history-analyst-says/1100-6521839/" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-is-most-important-game-release-in-industrys-history-analyst-says/1100-6521839/">GTA 6 is the single most important game release of all time</a>, and its predicted to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/">sell 40 million units within its first year of release</a>.

                <p>Rockstar's 2018 open-world Western Red Dead Redemption 2 is a huge success with more than 79 million copies sold, making it one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-best-selling-video-games-of-all-time/2900-4814/" data-ref-id="2900-4814">top five best-selling games in history</a>. The game is expected to continue to make a mark on the gaming industry with rumored ports for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch 2. The ports have not been officially announced, but there have been some developments, and in this post, we're rounding up everything we've heard about the rumored ports.</p><h2 id="What_do_we_know_"><strong>What do we know?</strong></h2><p>Earlier this year, reliable leaker <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-may-be-heading-to-switch-2-report/1100-6532372/" data-ref-id="1100-6532372">Nate the Hate said</a> a port of Red Dead Redemption 2 was headed to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2025, alongside an update that improves the game on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5.</p><p>Red Dead Redemption 2 has been playable on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S already through backwards compatibility. That was also true for GTA 5, which was playable on the latest consoles prior to Rockstar releasing new versions of GTA 5 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in March 2022 with significant upgrades.</p><p>Then in October 2025, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-still-planned-for-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-switch-2-report/1100-6535240/" data-ref-id="1100-6535240">Nate the Hate said the ports are still in the works</a>, but had no information to share regarding when they could be released.</p><p>There is no word on what the rumored PS5 and Xbox Series X|S upgrades could be, but improved graphics and performance are two possibilities.</p><p>The original Red Dead Redemption, meanwhile, came to Switch in 2023 after it originally launched in 2010.</p><h2 id="What_has_Rockstar_Take_Two_said_"><strong>What has Rockstar/Take-Two said?</strong></h2><p>Officially, Rockstar and Take-Two have not said a peep about new ports of Red Dead Redemption 2.

<p>Whiskerwood is a game not just about building cities, managing resources, and setting up supply lines. It is a game about rebellion, with the cat overlords demanding more and more from the mice everyday. The choice players will have is whether to continue trying to meet the demands or look to break free of the system.</p>

			<p>Steering wheels have to be one of the most inconvenient of gaming peripherals. There’s cables dragging everywhere, clamps for nearby tables or desk that never quite sit right, or the space needed for a full stand or seating rig, if you’re truly going to commit. Equally, there are few add-ons that make games as gratifying to play. Hurtling around a race track while you feather the real-world throttle, using your paddles to gear change, all the while fighting against the bucking realism of force feedback, can make you feel like a virtual Colin McRae or Max Verstappen. If you’re into racing games, they make themselves more or less essential.</p>
<p><iframe title="Turtle Beach® Racer Wireless Racing Wheel Trailer (All-In-One Race Setup)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rgYiX1GEsqM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Turtle Beach know all this, and with the Racer Wireless Wheel for Xbox, PC and Android, they’ve tried to make a steering wheel that’s easier to live with. It’s one that’s designed to slot into your gaming life – and your living room – with a practised ease, parallel parking its way into your heart. Largely, they’ve achieved that.</p>


<p>The first thing you’ll think when you grab it out of the box, is just how good it feels. This is a premium-feeling wheel, despite coming in at £139.99/$179.99. It is largely made from a combination of matte and gloss black plastic, with some rubberised grip sections on the left and right of the wheel, but it’s solid, clean-feeling plastic, centred by a bright yellow cut-out at the top of the wheel, to provide a modicum of colour and pizazz.</p>


<p>While most wheels immediately have you looking for the nearest desk or table edge, the Racer Wireless Wheel gives you more options, starting with some metallic lap tray inserts. These slide into place at the bottom of the wheel, and you lock them with the same rotating mechanisms on the top of the device that you use for the deck clamps. The underside of the curved metal has rubberised grips, and once you’ve got it set in place on your lap, it mostly stays where you want it to be, thanks in part to the grips and thanks in part to the pleasing amount of weight in the main body.</p>
<p>The weight plays a role in making the Racer Wireless feel like a premium product, but it certainly helps it to behave more like a traditional wheel, even when it’s not attached to anything. Thankfully, you can lock it into place in a table with the simple clamps, and things feel exactly as you’d hope they would with it secured in place.</p>
<p>Serious racers will then ask, where are the pedals? The answer is, there aren’t any, with the Racer Wireless wheel dealing with accelerating and braking by mapping it onto some analogue paddles. You’ll notice that this completely does away with manual gear shifts, but it’s best to remember just who this wheel is aimed at: casual racers who want to feel more connected to their racing games. For that, it does a great job, injecting fun and a dose of realism in equal measure.</p>

<p>The lack of pedals makes the setup that much more streamlined and simple to use as well, and it makes the Racer Wireless a unique option. There’s an accessibility angle here as well, where this control set up makes it more suitable for games with &nbsp;a disability or injury that would make pedals difficult or impossible to use.</p>
<p>Across the face of the wheel, you’ll find all of the central inputs you need, and they feel solid and well-made – particularly the D-pad. I had no problem cruising through menus and making changes to the options in Forza Horizon 5, and other than the occasional moment where you might lose the touch memory of where some of them are, like the dinky shoulder buttons, they do exactly what you need them to do.</p>
<p>There are two customisable function buttons on the left side of the wheel, which can replicate any of the other main inputs, as well as a multifunction button that opens up the Racer Wireless’ other abilities, particularly its audio controls via the 3.5mm socket. You’re getting a full suite of Turtle Beach audio options, including four EQ’s and then various adjustments to mic monitoring and the like, though you’ll need the app to get to all of them.</p>

<p>You can make a bevy of adjustments to the wheel’s performance via the Turtle Beach Control Center 2 app – available for both Xbox and PC – from updating the firmware for both your wheel and the wireless dongle, to digging into the nitty-gritty of the wheel’s setup. I made the change from 360-degree rotation to 180-degree here, and it made a huge difference to my interactions with the wheel, as it felt so much less cumbersome to turn when not attached to a desk.</p>
<p>You can also alter the input levels for both the left and right paddles, and the wheel itself, adjusting deadzones for all three, as well as choosing between standard, precision and fast response times. I found that Fast suited me well enough, and made the Racer Wireless feel massively responsive, if a bit twitchy at times. It’s great to have that level of granularity though, in something that is more or less aimed at the more casual racer.</p>
<p>In keeping with the more casual, no-frills approach, there’s no force feedback or vibration, but you might not miss it once you start hammering around the track. Without those features, the Racer Wireless is capable of up to 30 hours of battery life, and that played out in our testing. In fact, it also holds onto its charge remarkably well too, and after returning from a week’s holiday, it had lost just a couple of percent.</p>

<p>The clear thing that was apparent from my time with the Racer Wireless wheel, was just how much fun I was having. It isn’t a one-to-one recreation of driving – far from it – but it does make racing games like Forza Horizon 5 come alive when you’re comparing it to a controller. It’s straightforward, and nearly as easy to pick up and play with as a regular controller. While I did once lose the 2.4Ghz dongle, there’s a handy slot in the base to keep it in when not in use, and you can always opt to go wired instead.</p>
<p>There was the occasional niggle. The selector switch at the side gives you two Xbox options, one for a wheel, and one for a controller where there’s no steering wheel option, but in F1 2025, it wouldn’t recognise either for driving the car. There is a sturdy list of supported games for both Xbox and PC, but F1 2025 isn’t currently listed, despite the previous two entries being there. Here’s hoping that more games are added in the near future.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-selling-10-chicken-helmets-reminds-players-yup-it%E2%80%99s-a-live-service-game-alright.1346977/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Online PvPvE survival extraction shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-tips-solo-group-recycle-free-loadout-2000641174"><em>Arc Raiders</em> is very good</a>. But since launching last month, players have started to grow frustrated with the paid multiplayer game’s pricey cosmetics. And a silly helmet for a chicken is perhaps the best example of how paid skins and cosmetics can go oh so wrong, even in otherwise great games.</p> <p>On November 6, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oq8xpx/charging_10_for_a_chicken_helmet_that_you_only/">a post about a new cosmetic item for a chicken exploded in popularity on the <em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ subreddit</a>. In the game, each player has a chicken named <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Scrappy">Scrappy</a> who periodically provides them with random resources between matches. This chicken can only be seen in one menu of <em>Arc Raiders</em>, and yet, developer Embark has already created at least two different paid cosmetic looks for Scrappy. The newest chicken skin for sale is an old-fashioned diving helmet. This helmet alone costs 700 Raider Tokens, which translates to about $7, though due to the way the currency is sold in bundles, you’ll have to spend $10 to get that many tokens. The post about the helmet reached over 7k upvotes by Friday.</p>

   <p>Reaction to the helmet is a bit all over the place. Some players think it’s very dumb, but don’t mind because it doesn’t affect the game. Others feel like Embark is being greedy for charging so much for something that players will rarely see. There’s also a lot of confusion over why the cosmetics in <em>Arc Raiders</em> are so expensive. Keep in mind this isn’t a free-to-play game like <em>Fortnite</em>. To play <em>Arc Raiders</em>, you gotta spend $40. Some players assumed the fact that it’s a game you buy would shield it from free-to-play cosmetic guff, but this chicken helmet has made it clear that won’t be the case.</p>

 <p>“I understand this is a live service game, being supported for 10 years. But this is a bit ridiculous,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oq8xpx/comment/nnhcsdy/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">said one user.</a> “Considering half the skins aren’t even a different base model and are priced half the cost of the damn game. It’s okay to speak up about these things, because ultimately greed destroys companies — even if just silly cosmetics.”</p>

   <p>That’s the other problem with this new chicken helmet. While it can be bought separately, it is also included in a cosmetic bundle that features an outfit for your in-game character. However, a lot of players noticed that this “new” skin looks nearly identical to a previously sold cosmetic outfit. This has led to some players claiming that Embark has done a mere palette swap and is charging players roughly $15 for the privilege of buying a similar skin all over again.</p> <p>I doubt these pricey and somewhat ugly skins and items will sink<em> Arc Raiders</em> anytime soon. The game is one of the most-played titles on Steam right now and shows no sign of slowing down. But these expensive cosmetics are a reminder that, somehow, <a href="https://kotaku.com/20-10-skins-expensive-microtransactions-halo-diablo-4-1851008769">we are truly in an era where a $15 to $20 skin is not just common</a>, but something most players seem to ignore or even accept. Just a few of these skins add up to the total price of <em>Arc Raiders</em>, which is wild. But if people are buying them… well.</p>

              <p>Almost nobody buys $4,000 laptops. They’re amazing on paper, sure, but they’re also out of reach for most people. That’s why <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5391/">when Dell’s Inspiron 16 laptop (1TB SSD, 32GB DDR5 RAM) suddenly drops to $999 from its regular $3,999 price</a>, it makes noise. You’re getting a powerful machine at a quarter of its usual price which is why this deal (freshly posted on Amazon for Black Friday) isn’t likely to last long.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5391/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Serious Laptop for Real Work and Play</h2>
<p>This laptop isn’t a lightweight in any sense other than how easy it is to carry: It’s designed to <strong>crush productivity tasks</strong> while staying flexible enough for entertainment, content creation or business use. At its core, you’ll find <strong>Intel’s new Core 7 150U processor</strong> which runs up to 5.4GHz with 10 cores and 12 threads. That’s a lot of power for something you can carry around all day, and you can feel it in how it handles demanding workloads or 4K streaming with zero slowdown. Paired with integrated Intel graphics, it provides a smooth experience without draining your battery too fast.</p>



<p>Dell gave this model the specs to back up that performance promise: You get <strong>32GB of high-speed DDR5 RAM</strong> to keep things running smoothly like editing video, compiling data, and jumping on a video call-all at the same time. Plus,<strong> 1TB of lightning-fast SSD storage</strong> means your laptop boots instantly, and apps open in seconds. There’s no noise, no lag, and minimal heat.</p>
<p>For one, the design itself looks and feels premium. The <strong>screen is a 16-inch touchscreen with Full HD+ resolution</strong>, supported by IPS and WVA technology, meaning users will get more vivid colors and wider viewing angles ideal for either presentation work or creative sketching. With 300 nits of brightness and anti-glare protection, you can confidently work in bright cafes or by a window without any reflections getting in the way.</p>



<p>Connectivity is another area where this laptop doesn’t compromise. It comes with all the right modern ports — USB-C, HDMI, Wi-Fi 6E, and Bluetooth 5.3 — which means pairing devices or hooking up monitors is fast and painless. The HD webcam and noise-canceling microphones make every virtual call sharper and more professional, while the backlit keyboard keeps late-night typing sessions comfortable.</p>
<p>For its class, battery life holds up solidly enough that getting through a full workday or cross-country flight without scrambling for an outlet is quite achievable. It comes with <strong>Windows 11 Pro installed by default</strong> and keeps the system stable and secure-a nice touch for those who rely on their machine daily for professional use.</p>
<p>It isn’t shy about discounts, though: Amazon has now dropped this Dell Laptop to an all-time low of $999 for Black Friday, a full 75% off its usual price. Black Friday deals this deep don’t stay live for long and this one might vanish as quickly as it appeared.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/echo-show-5-is-back-to-its-black-friday-record-low-amazon%E2%80%99s-smart-display-now-costs-pennies.1346971/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s something addictive about smart displays once you start using one: You can check the weather, set alarms, play your favorite playlists, video call friends or peek into your connected cameras-all with a quick voice command. The Amazon Echo Show 5 nails that balance between screen and speaker and makes it one of the easiest smart home upgrades you can get. Now<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5390/"> it’s dropped to a record low of $59, down from its regular $89 price</a> which makes jumping into the Alexa ecosystem even more tempting.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5390/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>More Than a Smart Display</h2>
<p>Amazon designed the Echo Show 5 to do everything your old smart speaker can’t: The <strong>5.5-inch display may sound small, but it’s key to transforming how you interact with your assistant</strong>. You can glance at the time, watch your favorite Prime Video series, follow step-by-step recipes or see who’s at the door when paired with compatible cameras. It’s like having an assistant that also gives you context-perfect for those times when hearing isn’t enough.</p>



<p>This generation takes the experience up a notch: The sound is clearer, with twice the bass of older models, meaning your playlists and podcasts actually sound like something worth playing out loud. You can stream directly from Amazon Music, Spotify or any connected app with a nice balance between rich low tones and crisp vocals. And when it’s sitting idle, the screen doubles as a digital photo frame. You can set it to display your favorite pictures or even invite family members to share their own directly to your device. It includes <strong>unlimited cloud photo storage for Prime members</strong>, so it’s as much of a family hub as it is a gadget.</p>



<p>Then there is the way it doubles as your <strong>smart home control center</strong>: You can dim the lights, turn up the thermostat, or get a glimpse of what’s happening on the security feed-all with your voice or a tap. If you have compatible Ring doorbells and cameras, you’ll be able to view real-time footage right from the display. Alexa routines can automate your mornings, too: wake up to gradual light, a daily news briefing, and a playlist softly fading in before breakfast.</p>
<p>With Amazon, privacy remains front and center here. The Echo Show 5 incorporates several layers of protection such as a physical camera shutter and a microphone/camera off button. It is up to you when it’s listening and when it is not. The 2MP camera keeps you in touch through video calls using the Alexa app or another Echo device. It serves as a quick way to check up on family or roommates without opening up your phone.</p>
<p>Amazon is officially returning the Echo Show 5 to its all-time low price of $59 for this early Black Friday deal.</p>

            <p>miHoYo, the developer behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a>, and other gacha titles, has released a teaser video for its upcoming Unreal Engine 5 project. It's a fantasy MMO which, you guessed it, makes use of AI.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/mihoyo-is-working-on-new-open-world-game-mmo-pvp-ue5-ai.1346665/">Spotted by users on ResetEra</a>, miHoYo's hiring department posted a video and additional project information on Xiaohongshu (a Chinese social media platform). The post lists out a number of key quirks of the game, including MMO, PvP, Open World, "Artificial Intelligence Stimulated Eco System", All-Terrain Battle AI, and "Intellectual NPC".</p>
<p>It's worth noting that these are translated, and therefore the exact wording must be taken with a grain of salt. However, it does provide some manner of insight into one of miHoYo's big upcoming projects. First of all, one immediate thing one can see from the post is that the aesthetic of this mysterious new project isn't miHoYo's typical anime style. Instead, you see the obvious marks of Unreal Engine 5.</p>

</figure>
<p>What might raise an eye brow is the mention of AI there, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenless-zone-zero-studio-uses-ai-technology-to-smoothen-development-process">which miHoYo has used in the past in Zenless Zone Zero to "smoothen" the development process</a>. The company has previous drawn a line in the sand when it comes to AI art and voicework, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-zenless-zone-zero-actors-lose-jobs-over-ai-dispute-without-notice-finding-out-alongside-players">claimed it had AI voice protections in its contracts</a> when a contract dispute led to the recasting of SAGAFTRA members.</p><p>This post appears to indicate a continuation of miHoYo's approach to AI in game development, though obviously the full extent of its use remains unclear. We don't know the name of the game, when it'll be coming out, what the gameplay will actually look like... It's a big question mark over the company's line-up at the moment.</p>
<p>What isn't a mystery are some of the other games miHoYo is working on, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/honkai-nexus-anima-revealed-a-spin-off-creature-collector-from-genshin-impact-studio">including a monster-collection game called Honkai: Nexus Anima</a>. For now, we'll have to just hunker down and wait for more information as to this new project.</p>

		<p>OwlCat Games has released the main theme song for The Expanse: Osiris Reborn, with the theme being composed by Paweł Perepelic. It has quite the epic sound to it and does capture some of that The Expanse feeling, delving into something that seems hopeful and inspiring but ending slightly on a mournful note. Have a listen for yourselves.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Expanse: Osiris Reborn — Main Theme" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9PqNeoff3NI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Here’s a little bit of blurb to establish the setting of The Expanse: Osiris Reborn:</p>
<p><em>You play as a Pinkwater Security mercenary whose brief shore leave on the asteroid Eros spirals out of control. Trapped in a deadly lockdown and drawn into a solar system-wide conspiracy far beyond your control, you’ll have to adapt, survive, taking command of the most advanced ship in the whole of the solar system. Gather a crew and find your own path through the web of lies to leave your mark on the solar system.</em></p>
<p>This puts the game’s setting right at the start of the sci-fi series’ timeline, running in parallel to the adventures of the crew of the Rocinante during the first and second seasons of the TV series. You can choose to be from Earth and Mars, or be a Belter. You will need to use different skills in combat and outside of it. In combat, the action will be that of a third person shooter but with tactical elements as you will need to use tactical items and the skills of your crew to get the upper hand. The crew will be incredibly important to the story and the way events can unfold. Each person you pick up has their own goals, motivations, and history to unpick, which you may discover while living together on the ship, which is called Gemini. Uncovering the layers of your crew and the secrets of the wider Expanse universe, and by doing so the paths that open to you can and will change.</p>

<p>There are four versions of The Expanse: Osiris Reborn including the standard edition, the deluxe edition, the Miller’s Pack, and the Collector’s edition. What is worth noting is that the game will not be getting a physical release. The standard edition is priced at $49.99 which includes the game, an early adopter item and a Discord role.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Deluxe Edition ($59.99) – </strong>All standard edition items plus name in credits, Miller’s OPA Heavy armour, and UN Spec Ops assault rifle.</li>
<li><strong>Miller’s Pack ($79.99)&nbsp;</strong>– All standard and deluxe items plus digital Artbook, digital soundtrack, Hall of Fame, Miller’s Casual outfit, Miller’s revolver, exclusive beta access.</li>
<li><strong>Collector’s Edition ($249.99)&nbsp;</strong>– All the items from the other editions plus a physical Gemini ship model, a physical Gemini medallion, printed artbook, three embroidered patches, and stickers.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Expanse: Osiris Reborn will be released for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/europa-universalis-v">Europa Universalis 5</a> has its first public patch, which encompasses over 350 fixes. Among the bigger things it smacks with the heal-o-spanner (an actual game development tool, traditionally carved from the base of a Taito arcade machine) is the Steams achievements system, which will no longer shower players in plaudits they haven't earned. On the plus side, you'll now earn achievements even if you activate the "allow ahistorical" game rule.
</p>
<p>I grasp at those relatively intelligible nuggets like somebody lunging for the doorhandle in a room full of bees. I do not play Europa Universalis 5. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/europa-universalis-5-review">That review gig</a> went to Brendy, who was anointed many months ago as our human sacrifice to this particular god of grand <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a>. Brendy is now more number table than man. He bleeds - erm, well, I can't even say what he bleeds, because I'm not hip to the Europa Universalis terminology. As such, I'm a poor choice to write up the game's first set of patch notes, but what can you do. Here are the apparent highlights, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3450310/view/589535332141105331?l=english">as detailed on Steam</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Fixed more than 350 bugs (not counting Translation-related number of errors fixed, which you can find in its own section)</li>
<li>Fixed the scope type for Achievement triggers, which was triggering several errors, along with many other minor fixes to them; also, activating the "Allow Ahistorical" game rule now doesn't block getting Achievements</li>
<li>Fixed several CTDs</li>
<li>Made several fixes to Personal Unions, especially to AI Union Law voting, making it less spammy</li>
<li>Fixed an issue making the Timurid spawning player event to not work properly</li>
<li>The 'Claim French Throne' peace treaty during the 'Hundred Years' War' situation no longer requires you to be senior in a PU already</li>
<li>The events that convert Hussite pops for Bohemia during the 'Hussite Wars' situation are now converting much more aggressively and impactfully</li>
<li>Japanese clans will now properly lose their clan's foreign buildings when being landed after the 'Sengoku Jidai' situation starts</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The rest of the notes span all aspects of the game, from whether or not the Earldom of Ulster is a Vassal of the Pale, through the addition of province capital map markers, to ensuring that there are "proper reasons for countries to join Autocephalous Patriarchates". WTF is an Autocephalous Patriarchate. Some kind of octopus grandad? Can you conquer things with it? If you're reading these notes, you've likely played the game and I look forward to your generous explanations.
</p><p>Europa Universalis 5 seems to be going down well among players. It and Paradox stablemates <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings 3</a> and Hearts Of Iron IV are currently congregating in the high 20s on Steam's 100 Most Played. They've got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> sandwiched between them like a strip of horse jerky. If you're keen on EU5, but are having trouble running it, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-your-pc-is-too-puny-to-launch-europa-universalis-5-theres-a-secret-very-low-graphics-preset">this workaround for lower-spec graphics cards might be of interest</a>.</p>

              <p>We’re all now used to every big-name game coming out in five differently priced versions, each containing more in-game stuff than the last, but no matter which you choose you will still be buying the <em>same game</em>. That’s never been the case for the mainline&nbsp;<em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>series, starting even with its very first English-language release in 1998 with <em>Pokémon Red</em> and <em>Pokémon Blue</em>, each version subtly (but to fans, crucially) different. But have you ever stopped to wonder why? The reason is wonderfully silly.</p> <p>Creating two versions of what mostly boils down to the same game is certainly not an obvious choice. It introduces a huge amount of confusion to an unaware audience, not sure which is the most recent game or whether they’re making a mistake by buying one over the other. To those familiar with the series, it’s a huge feature and selling point, and deciding which version of the game you’re going to buy and why is a big part of the experience. But given the fear of alienation and confusion, it’s hard to imagine most marketing executives would ever allow such a conceit to survive its first boardroom whisper. Yet one of the best-selling game series of all time suggests it can work out OK.</p>

 <p>But why? Well, as&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/pokemon/nintendo-legend-shigeru-miyamoto-says-one-of-the-reasons-pokemon-red-and-green-were-made-was-because-creator-satoshi-tajiri-joked-mario-couldnt-be-surpassed-unless-fans-were-sold-2-copies-of-a-game/">GamesRadar</a>&nbsp;</em>spotted via <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1986266577789133097">Genki_JPN’s X account</a>, in a recent shareholders meeting Nintendo director Shigeru Miyamoto was asked if anything could ever outsell <em>Mario Kart 8</em>. This caused him to recall a conversation with the creator of the&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em> franchise, Satoshi Tajiri, about how the monster-catching games could ever outdo the success of the <em>Mario&nbsp;</em>games. Via machine translation, <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105_2.pdf">Miyamoto told investors</a>, “A long time ago, Tajiri-san, the director of <em>Pokémon</em>, joked with me that if you want to surpass Nintendo’s <em>Mario </em>you’ll have to sell two copies of the game to each customer.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">In a shareholders meeting Shigeru Miyamoto shared a story about Pokémon creator Satoshi Tajiri and one of the reasons Pokémon Red and Green came to be!</p> <p>"A long time ago, Tajiri-san, the director of Pokémon, before creating the first Pokémon game, once joked to me ‘If you want to… <a href="https://t.co/YTS4AvAbu9">pic.twitter.com/YTS4AvAbu9</a></p> <p>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1986266577789133097?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Miyamoto continued, “This was one of the reasons why <em>Pokémon Red&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Green</em> were created.”</p> <p>(In Japan, the games were originally released in 1996 as&nbsp;<em>Red</em> and&nbsp;<em>Green</em>, with a&nbsp;<em>Blue</em> later the same year.)</p> <p>For what it’s worth, it’s rarely actually worked! As phenomenally successful as the <em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>games have been,&nbsp;<em>Mario</em> tends to beat them on each system. The two wins for <em>Pokémon</em><em>&nbsp;</em>in this match-up have been <em>Pokémon Gold </em>and&nbsp;<em>Silver</em> on Game Boy Color and <em>Pokémon</em> Ruby and&nbsp;<em>Sapphire</em> on Game Boy Advance. On the DS, 3DS and Switch, <em>Mario</em> has taken the lead each time. (There were no mainline <em>Pokémon</em> games on Wii or Wii U.) But it certainly hasn’t hurt, either, with&nbsp;<em>Sword</em> and&nbsp;<em>Shield</em> selling 26.84 million copies, and&nbsp;<em>Scarlet </em>and&nbsp;<em>Violet</em> hitting 27.15 million. It’s just that&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart 8</em> has rather rudely sold 69.56 million, <em>Super Smash Bros</em>. <em>Ultimate</em> 36.93 million, and&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> 29.84 million.</p>

              <p><span>Sony is filing a lawsuit against an eBay seller who it accuses of selling fake PlayStation 5 accessories, such as carrying cases for the console and its various peripherals, claiming that it has made unauthorized use of the company’s trademarks.</span></p> <p><span>As </span><a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-lawsuit-ebay-counterfeit-playstation-5-accessories-2-million/"><i><span>The Game Post</span></i></a><span> lays out, Sony’s lawsuit against eBay user “zaocuand-002” has the company seeking potentially millions of dollars in damages as it continues to target counterfeit PlayStation products being sold around the internet. eBay is but one of several platforms Sony has been combing through in its search for fake PS5 accessories, as it has also gotten into legal scraps with sellers on Amazon, Walmart, and other sites.</span></p>

 <p><span>Sony has previously targeted “dozens” of anonymous marketplace sellers in its lawsuits targeting counterfeit PS5 accessories, but this latest eBay lawsuit specifically homes in on the zaocuand-002 account which has, according to </span><i><span>The Game Post</span></i><span>, sold over 9000 items on the platform. A PS5 carrying case is specifically mentioned in the lawsuit, but this listing has seemingly been taken down after the lawsuit was filed in October. Sony’s suit demands that platforms such as eBay “shall disable and cease displaying any advertisements used by or associated with Defendant in connection with the sale of counterfeit and infringing goods using the PlayStation Trademarks</span><span>.” </span><span>Alternatively, the company requests up to $2 million “for each and every use” of the counterfeit trademark, as well as compensation for its legal fees.</span></p>

However, the Chinese publisher claims Sony is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/light-of-motiram-horizon-lawsuit-sony-tencent-monopoly-2000626858"><span>trying to monopolize open-world genre conventions</span></a><span> with the suit.</span></p>
