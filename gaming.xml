            <p>Markus "Notch" Persson has "basically announced" Minecraft 2.</p>
<p>In an X exchange over the New Year, Persson invited his millions of followers to indicate which project they'd like him to focus on in 2025 - a traditional roguelike mixed with a "tile-based first-person dungeon crawler" or a "spiritual successor" to Minecraft.</p>

<p>In the post asking for "honest and legitimate [...] feedback for once", Persson explained briefly what his dungeon crawler would entail, but then admitted, "but then I gots to thinking that maybe there are people who like my work but might not share my taste in retro nostalgia and would prefer for me to make a spiritual successor thing to Minecraft, and I mean sure, I'd take that cash".</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Honest and legitimate request for feedback for once:</p><p>The new game I'm passionately working on is currently set to be a traditional roguelike (i.e. ADOM, nethack, etc) mixed with a tile based first person dungeon crawler (ie Legend of Grimrock (esp 2), Eye of the Beholder)</p><p>But…</p></div>— notch (@notch) <a href="https://twitter.com/notch/status/1874522284813107617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>At the time of writing, almost a quarter of a million of his followers have left a vote, 78 percent of which have, perhaps unsurprisingly, been in favour of a new Minecraft game, even though he'd asked people to "[please] vote potion. You can do this Zoomers, it's actually super cosy.</p>
<p>"Kinda feels like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, but more diagonal door kicking," Notch added.</p> <div>

<p>A few days later, responding to commenters who missed his original posting, Persson summarised what had happened, saying: "I basically announced Minecraft 2. I thought that maybe people ACTUALLY do want me to make another game that's super similar to the first one, and I'm loving working on games again.</p>
<p>"I don't super duper care exactly which game I make first (or even if I make more), but I do know I'm making one, so I figured I'd absolutely be willing to give it an honest shot in the form of a spiritual successor to Minecraft and put up a poll about it.</p><p>"My intentions are to be clear and honest about it, saying that spiritual successors are usually kind of... you know... washed up. Tragic," he added. "The things I'm fearing my next game is going to be anyway and try to push myself to avoid. So why not do the thing that people DO want and are willing to give me, somehow, even MORE cash for.</p>
<p>"I intend for the money to the [sic] spent for good, but my God, have I learned I fail a lot. Winning is failing until you make yourself succeed."</p>
<p>Persson <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874532193227473093">added</a> that he had no non-compete clause in the sale of Minecraft to Microsoft - "there was a one-year period where I couldn't make a game with modifiable terrain or something like that, but I was off in the Maldives during all that, didn't affect any creative decisions" - but did acknowledge that using the Minecraft name "would be super illegal".</p>
<p>"Instead, I'd make a new original game of the same type as Minecraft and call it something else," he <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1874523772734390380">said</a>. "These are traditionally sometimes referred to as 'spiritual successors', but usually kinda mostly feel a bit flat.</p>
<p>"But, like, if that's actually what people want, I would LOVE to make that game. It'd be my Gremlins 2."</p>
<p>Persson also said that as "a man of [his] word", he intended "to do this in a way that in no way tried to sneakily infringe on the incredible work the Mojang team is doing and that Microsoft is successfully doing the Microsoft shittification about".</p>
<p>"And I respect them for doing that. It's their job. And they, from what I understand, let the studio do things their way, which seems very fair to me," he added.</p>
<p>It's been a busy time for Minecraft. At the end of last year, the game finally received a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-years-after-ps5s-launch-minecraft-finally-gets-a-native-version">PlayStation 5 native version</a>, announced it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-ditching-psvr-support-minecraft-is-officially-abandoning-vr-on-pc-from-next-year">ditch PC VR support</a>, and confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-attractions-set-to-open-in-uk-and-us-as-85m-deal-with-alton-towers-owner-signed">plans to launch Minecraft theme park areas in the US and UK</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The first few days of a year are always a bit sleepy in the game’s industry. It takes a little while for those press releases to start rolling in, for the announcements and trailers to drop, and developers and publishers alike are wary of launching too soon after everyone’s Christmas spending. So, it’s a quiet week for this round-up, but here’s what’s happened.</p>
<h2>In the News This Week</h2>
<p>Naturally, there hasn’t been all that much news in the past few weeks, so here’s the sum total of our reporting:</p>

<h2>Game of the Year 2024</h2>

<p>So… that’s just about it for this weekend. Things will no doubt pick up next week, not least because of CES bringing some GPU announcements from Nvidia and AMD. We’ll see you then!</p>

But slow news hardly means no news, and we kicked off the new year with a look at the games to keep an eye out for this month. Also, the chief creative officer at Arrowhead, the studio behind <em>Helldivers 2</em>, chimed in on “DEI” in games in an online exchange, the devs of <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>hinted at why last year’s blockbuster has yet to arrive on Xbox, and the folks behind a stunning fan remake of <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion </em>using the <em>Skyrim </em>engine announced that we can expect that massive project to release this year. Read on for these and more stories. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9001c1b94dfd9716f187596c1cb4a1ea" data-recommend-id="image://9001c1b94dfd9716f187596c1cb4a1ea" data-format="png" data-width="1261" data-height="710" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Donkey Kong, a cyborg, and a mystical warrior pre-order some games.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> co-founder Andrew Gavin has opened up about why the studio was acquired by Sony back in 2001.</p>
<p>In a lengthy post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrew-gavin-441765_why-did-we-sell-naughty-dog-its-a-question-activity-7277011334121058305-JZKz/">LinkedIn</a>, Gavin cited the spiralling costs of game development as one of the reasons the studio was sold, saying "a systemic issue in the AAA space" wherein developers "almost never have the resources to fund their own games [...] gives publishers enormous leverage".</p>

<p>"Why did we sell Naughty Dog? It's a question I've been asked countless times. The answer is simple: budgets were skyrocketing," Gavin - who worked at Naughty Dog for almost 20 years before leaving in 2004 - said (via <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/522635/article/naughty-dog-co-founder-reveals-why-they-were-acquired-by-sony/">Gameranx</a>).</p><p>"When we started Naughty Dog in the 1980s, game development expenses were manageable. We bootstrapped everything, pouring profits from one game into the next. Our early 80s games cost less than $50,000 each to make. Rings of Power ('88-91), saw budgets rise to about $100,000, but yielded slightly more than that in after tax profits in 1992.</p>
<p>"In 1993, we rolled that $100k from Rings into a self-funded Way of the Warrior. But Crash Bandicoot ('94-96) cost $1.6 million to make. By the time we got to Jak and Daxter ('99-01), the budget busted the $15 million mark.</p>
<p>"By 2004, the cost of AAA games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jak-3">Jak 3</a> had soared to $45-50 million - and they have been rising ever since," Gavin added. "But back in 2000, we were still self-funding every project, and the stress of financing these ballooning budgets independently was enormous.</p>
<p>"It wasn't just us. This was (and still is) a systemic issue in the AAA space. Developers almost never have the resources to fund their own games, which gives publishers enormous leverage. Selling to Sony wasn't just about securing a financial future for Naughty Dog. It was about giving the studio the resources to keep making the best games possible, without being crushed by the weight of skyrocketing costs and the paralysing fear that one slip would ruin it all.</p>
<p>"Looking back, it was the right call."</p>
<p>Gavin ended by admitting that "AAA games have only gotten more expensive since then", citing costs for today's big-budget games "easily" top "$300, $400, or even $500 million".</p>
<p>"Would we have been able to keep up? Maybe. But selling - to the right party - gave Naughty Dog the stability it needed to thrive and to continue making the kinds of games we'd always dreamed of!"</p>
<p>Several months after studio lead Neil Druckmann confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-neil-druckmann-says">Naughty Dog had a number of games in the works</a>, the team has lifted the lid on its next, all-new title: Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet for PS5.</p>
<p>"Set thousands of years in the future, Intergalactic puts players into the role of Jordan A. Mun, a dangerous bounty hunter who ends up stranded on Sempiria – a distant planet whose communication with the outside universe went dark hundreds of years ago," teases the blurb.</p>
<p>"Jordan will have to use all her skills and wits if she hopes to be the first person in over 600 years to leave its orbit," reads the game's official blurb."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> Nightreign will not include the game's signature in-game messaging system because there will be "no time" to read or write messages.</p>
<p>Whilst Nightreign's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-is-making-more-elden-ring-after-all-with-the-co-op-elden-ring-night-reign">announcement trailer</a> featured plenty of familiar elements like sites of grace and Evergaols - as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-will-feature-enemies-from-dark-souls-director-confirms">enemies from Dark Souls</a> like The Nameless King from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a> - Elden Ring Nightreign director Junya Ishizaki has confirmed the studio is pulling its in-game communication because with sessions around 40-minutes long, there simply isn't any time to waste.</p>

<p>"You can still see the ghosts of other players, but the ability to leave messages has been removed," Ishizaki told <a href="https://jp.ign.com/elden-ring-nightreign/77870/interview/elden-ring-nightreign-403rpg">IGN Japan</a> via machine translation.</p>
<p>"The reason we removed the message feature is that in this game, where each session is about 40 minutes long, there is no time to write your own message, and no time to read messages written by others."</p>
<p>"The concept was to make a 'condensed RPG'. RPGs have their ups and downs, and players sometimes gain and sometimes lose," Ishizaki added. "I think the best part of RPGs is that all of these experiences ultimately come to fruition. In order to create a harmonious experience that allows players to experience the true essence of RPGs, each game took place over three days."</p><p>Interestingly, this means defeated foes will not revive during the match - not even when you rest at a site of grace - and although ashes will make an appearance in Nightreign, how they're "handled" will differ from the original Elden Ring game.</p>
<p>The interview also revealed that Miyazaki was involved "up until the creation of the initial concept" for Nightreign, but he has since stepped aside for the new director, who has been at FromSoft since 2011.</p>
<p>"Elden Ring spin-off Nightreign is a very exciting game that will excite players," Ishizaki concluded. "It will provide a sense of accomplishment and joy that is different from previous titles, so please look forward to it."</p>
<p>ICYMI, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-co-op-spin-off-nightreign-network-test-announced-and-you-can-register-for-it-soon">network test for Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> will take place in February, with registration beginning on 10th January.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/04/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-40-to-36/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-%E2%80%93-40-to-36.1073889/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/04/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-40-to-36/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Just like the music charts, we are now entering the Top 40 of the games we are looking forward to this year. The countdown here may throw up some surprises, with games maybe not being where you would expect them to be in this countdown. Without further ado, let us commence the Top 40 countdown with a musical number…</p>
<h2>40 – Ratatan</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, NSW, PC – TBC</em></p>
<p>Patapon lovers, rejoice! Revealed towards the end of 2024, producer Hiroyuki Kotani announced a spiritual follow up to Patapon with Ratatan. Ratatan is a rhythm roguelike action game, that will combine the beat of the music with the action on screen, with up to 100 characters fighting on screen at any one time. Players can also play in four player co-op.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ratatan Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HR9r-LXLGnI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>RATATAN’s roguelike element comes from the fact that after each battle players are rewarded with different power ups and awards, with these changing on each run. Ratatan is accompanied by Cobuns, and it is they who get these power ups to use in battles and trials that are on their path.</p>

<h2>39 – Hell Is Us</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – TBC</em></p>
<p>Hell Is Us was<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/04/12/hell-is-us-nacon-trailer/"> first announced back in 2022</a>, and after a long period of quiet development, we were treated to 1<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/01/15-minute-hell-is-us-gameplay-video-explains-lack-of-maps-and-quest-markers/">5 minutes of gameplay</a> in October that gave us a good long look into the world.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hell is Us - Gameplay Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/it9wGffvYGM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hell Is Us is set in the fictional country of Hadea, which has been torn apart by war. Players will have to explore the world with melee weapons and a drone, which will help navigate as well as face off the dangerous creatures that wander it. Players won’t be able to rely on map markers and waypoints, instead having to learn the world itself and pay attention to everything happening in it, and listen to what people are saying to figure it out.</p>
<h2>38 – Dragon Quest 1&amp;2 HD</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, NSW, PC – 2025</em></p>
<p>Probably the shortest entry on this list as there is so little official information on it, and yet such surety of what this will offer. These remakes of the earliest Dragon Quest games were announced back in June alongside a re-reveal for Dragon Quest III HD-2D, a long in development project that built up to release in November getting a<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review/"> 9/10 in our review.</a></p>
<p>Dragon Quest 1&amp;2 HD will continue the narrative chronologically, and it is likely it will have the same features as Dragon Quest III HD-2D, including HD-2D graphics, an improved battle system, and a large world to explore.</p>
<h2>37 – Eternal Strands</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 28th January 2025</em></p>
<p>Eternal Strands is another one that is coming early in 2025. This month, in fact. Eternal Strands has a huge and expansive open world that can all be explored, which is called the Enclave. Unfortunately, the Enclave has largely been invaded and taken over by a force known as the Surgeborn, an otherworldly enemy that has trapped the people in a smaller and smaller corner of it.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Eternal Strands - Release Date Trailer | Yellow Brick Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VhMT5IWrTlk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Enter the Weaver, Brynn. She is on a mission to push back the Surgeborn, liberating the Enclave from their incursion. It will not be an easy fight as the Surgeborn consist of towering creatures that will prove a challenge to take down. However, Brynn has access to weapons and magical abilities to fight back, as well as being able to use the environment to help her. You can use enemy attacks against each other as well to even the odds. The world can be manipulated so new paths can be created showing hidden parts of the Enclave. Be careful though, as the world is dangerous and destructible.</p>
<h2>36 – Pokémon Legends Z-A</h2>
<p><em>NSW – 2025</em></p>
<p>Pokémon Legends Z-A was announced back in February 2024, another spin off following in the footsteps of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/01/26/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch/">Pokémon Legends Arceus</a>. However, where that game jumped back hundreds of years in time, Pokémon Legends Z-A is set in a modern setting and swaps the wilds for one city setting, that being the Paris inspired Lumiose City. The city itself is undergoing a major redevelopment plan to make it easier for Pokémon and people to co-exist within it.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Pokémon Legends: Z-A releases simultaneously worldwide in 2025!​" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uq-Znr_jGIg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That will mean Pokémon will be roaming around Lumiose City, so you will be trying to catch them all as people go about their lives. We do know Mega Evolutions will return, and… that is pretty much all we do know!</p>
<p>There have been no further official updates regarding the starter Pokemon, how the gameplay will work, and what the city will look like. What we can say is that Pokémon Legends Z-A is expected in 2025 for the Switch, and we’d bet it’s a cross-gen game for Switch 2 as well.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Warhammer Orruk Warclans New Releases Review - Waaagh!]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-orruk-warclans-new-releases-review-waaagh</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warhammer-orruk-warclans-new-releases-review-waaagh.1073886/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-orruk-warclans-new-releases-review-waaagh<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When the Waaagh! bells begin to ring, there's no more terrifying sound for civilized society. But for the Orruk Warclans, it's sweet, sweet music! Games Workshop sent us a few new&nbsp;<em>Warhammer: Age of Sigmar</em> Orruk Warclans releases, along with their updated Battletome, to check out - so follow along for our thoughts! (Psst... stick around to the end for new&nbsp;<em>Bloodbowl</em>&nbsp;releases!)</p>

<h2>Battletome: Orruk Warclans</h2>

<p>Let's start with the wonderfully aggressive&nbsp;<em>Battletome: Orruk Warclans</em>, which reintroduces the army into the newest edition of&nbsp;<em>Warhammer: Age of Sigmar</em>&nbsp;(we <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-skaventide-review-perfect-starter-set" rel="nofollow">reviewed the new edition with the release of the&nbsp;<em>Skaventide</em>&nbsp;box set</a>). Over 120 pages long, this&nbsp;<em>Battletome</em>&nbsp;covers everything you need to know to play with the Orruk Warclans army. The first 76 pages are devoted to backgrounds and lore for the army, including information on various clans, how the Orruks see the world (generally as a place to fight), and more.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-orruk-warclans-battletome.jpg?itok=bcio2SZD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-orruk-warclans-battletome.jpg?itok=XTgiNxEC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>From there we get into the rules, and there are distinct sections for both the Ironjawz faction and the Kruleboyz faction. I can't show screengrabs from my review PDF of the Battletome, so I'll summarize some of my favorite bits here.</p>

<p>For the Ironjawz, there are brand new battle traits that key off of their aggressive nature, with one allowing a friendly Ironjawz unit to move up to 3" (including moving into combat), and the other allowing a friendly Ironjawz Hero to add 1 to charge rolls and 1 to their Attacks characteristic of their melee weapons.</p>

<p>There are also Battle Formations (you can pick one) which allow them to add 1 to attack rolls for a unit that rolled high on their charge roll, give them Ward (6+) when they're near Ironjawz Wizards and Priests, and more! There are also Artefacts of Power like Trophy Skulls (which add 10 to the unit's control score, not bad!), and spells like "Da Great Big Green Hand Of Gork" which, along with winning the award for the best name of a spell, allow you to teleport a unit halfway across the battlefield.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-orruk-warclans-ironjawz-medium.jpeg?itok=ue3_Ixv1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-orruk-warclans-ironjawz-medium.jpeg?itok=rY3x3Em9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>For the Kruleboyz, there are plenty of dirty tricks they can employ (with a successful dirty trick roll), allowing them to sneak around the battlefield, use venom-encrusted weapons to score crits on rolls of 5+, and more. Their battle formations allow them to hide near terrain features, boost the range of ranged weapons (not that&nbsp;<em>too</em>&nbsp;many units are interested in ranged here), and more.</p>

<p>Their Artefacts of Power include Mork's Eye Pebble, which gives them Ward (5+) for the rest of the turn, the ability to boost a wizard up with a Swamp Staff, and stinging ash that makes it harder for your enemies to hit you. Along with updated unit profiles, rules for Spearhead and campaign play, and so much more - if you run a Orruk Warclans army, you really can't afford to skip the new&nbsp;<em>Battletome</em><em>: Orruk Warclans</em>.</p>

<p>Now let's take a look at some of the new models we received!</p>

<h2>Warhammer Orruk Warclans - Hobgrot Slittaboss</h2>

<p>For when your Kruleboyz need some leadership - and I use that term&nbsp;<em>very&nbsp;</em>loosely when talking about the Orruk Warclans - you can now look to the Hobgrot Slittaboss, a real mean little dude with a Toxin-smeared Slitta-sword (ouch!). He's got two nasty abilities.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-orruk-warclans-hobgrot-slittaboss.jpg?itok=0v2sos5p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-orruk-warclans-hobgrot-slittaboss.jpg?itok=r_jFICgS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>First up is the Kompany Taktikz (these spellings are driving my spellcheck insane) ability, which triggers after you've declared a Fight action with this unit. In doing so, you can then allow another friendly Hobgrot Slittaz unit in his command range to immediately fight after he fights, adding 1 to their wound rolls.</p>

<p>There's also the potentially devastating Toxic Stash ability, which can be used once per battle. This ability allows you to pick an enemy unit currently in combat with the Slittaboss and roll 2D6, if you roll higher than the target's health characteristic... they're immediately destroyed! All in all, I think this leader does what I want a Orruk leader to do - some light unit benefits, with a big old nasty attack up his sleeve. From here, we move onto some fun terrain/manifestations for the army.</p>

<h2>Warhammer Orruk Warclans -&nbsp;Bossrokk Tower/Skaregob Totem</h2>

<p>This absolutely towering piece of terrain can be put together either as a Bossrokk Tower (if you're running an Ironjawz army) or as a Skaregob Totem for you Kruleboyz players. I built it as a Bossrokk Tower, but both builds are easy to assemble considering their size and amount of component parts.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-orruk-warclans-bossrokk-tower.jpg?itok=pRfZaG_N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-orruk-warclans-bossrokk-tower.jpg?itok=beEJvB34 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As a Bossrock Tower, which has 12 Health and a 4+ save, you'll move an Infantry Hero onto it and from then on all attacks against them will target the Tower. The Tower also boasts the "Aggressively Bossy" ability, which effects a visible enemy unit within 18" of the Tower. The Tower is surprisingly defensive (which makes sense as its a Tower, but doesn't make sense as this is the Orruks we're talking about), and can subtract from an enemy's control score, subtract 1 from casting rolls, or even subtract 1 from the number of dice rolled when making charge rolls!</p>

<p>As a Skaregob Tower, you'll really only want to use this if you're all-in on Kruleboyz' dirty tricks, as it adds 1 to your dirty trick rolls and can extend the range of said tricks to 18". Of the two, the Bossrokk Tower definitely packs more of a punch, but it still looks extremely cool on the tabletop in any configuration.</p>

<h2>Warhammer Orruk Warclans Manifestations</h2>

<p>Next up is a collection of Manifestation spells that you can cast with both Ironjawz or Kruleboyz factions, adding a bit of fun chaos to your army.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-orruk-warclans-foot-of-gork.jpg?itok=iann9cbA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-orruk-warclans-foot-of-gork.jpg?itok=jZdBuoLt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Let's start here with the Foot of Gork, the only spell you can rely on to put a big, stinky foot on the battlefield. Coming in two parts as you can see from the image above, these big footprints wander around the battlefield, stomping enemies where they land. These stomped units lose 1 of their charge dice, seriously slowing down your enemies!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-orruk-warclans-gork-roara.jpg?itok=GAnLDpDY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-orruk-warclans-gork-roara.jpg?itok=EWCRP_sN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There's also the Gork-Roara, a floating skull spewing out Waaagh! energy! This, with proper rolls, speeds up nearby armies, allowing them to add (with good enough rolls) additional value to their charge rolls. Sort of like the opposite of the big foot!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-orruk-warclans-morkspit-marsh.jpg?itok=ocdZlcsK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-orruk-warclans-morkspit-marsh.jpg?itok=lKgYDMIm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>And finally in this kit, there's the Morkspit Marsh, which is a goopy, swampy morass of sludge that looks amazing on the battlefield&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;has a few key, hindering abilities. First up, any enemy unit within 3" of the Marsh subtracts 3 from their control scores (which could be huge with proper placement). Secondly, enemy units cannot use Run abilities when they're within 6" of this Manifestation.</p>

<p>All in all, these Manifestations are really fun ways to utterly mess with the tempo of the game - much to the advantage of a charge-happy Orruk Warclans army. This isn't really the kind of utility I think of when I think about running Orruks, but seeing it all laid out here I can really appreciate a path forward with the Warclans where you're stifling your enemy's movement and rolling over them like a tide of blades and jawz.</p>

<h2>BONUS! New <em>Bloodbowl</em> Releases!</h2>

<p>In addition to all this great Orruk Warclans content, I also got to check out the new&nbsp;<em>Spike! Presents: 2024 Almanac!</em>&nbsp;and two new models for&nbsp;<em>Bloodbowl</em>, Rowana Forestfoot and Rashnak Backstabber.</p>

<h3><em>Spike! Presents: 2024 Almanac! and New Models</em></h3>

<p>Mostly focused on the Vampire, Gnome, and Chaos Dwarf teams, the new&nbsp;<em>Spike! Presents: 2024 Almanac!</em>&nbsp;offers a veritable feast for&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl</em>&nbsp;players.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blood-bowl-2024-almanac.jpg?itok=hV7w8ozt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blood-bowl-2024-almanac.jpg?itok=JwCG40X9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Each of the three above-mentioned teams get updated rules and little bonuses. I won't go through them all here but to highlight some of the juiciest bits, for the Vampires, you can now run a Vampire Lord as your head coach, who can recruit a new thrall in the post-game sequence if you've killed a specific kind of enemy player during the match. They also have the Bloodlust rule, which effectively says that if they roll poorly after taking an action, they have to bite a nearby friendly thrall to feed!</p>

<p>For the gnomes, a new trait called "My Ball" means that the player holding the ball cannot willingly give up the ball under any circumstances - so long to handing off the ball when in a tight spot! They also have the new Trickster trait, which says when a Gnome is about to be hit by a block action they can move one adjacent square! Very tricky indeed!</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blood-bowl-rowana-forestfoot.jpg?itok=JWmWezby 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blood-bowl-rowana-forestfoot.jpg?itok=PhyDhvIo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Also included is one of the models we received, Rowana Forestfoot, who sits atop an elk! I LOVE the look of this model, and her special ability "Bounding Leap" allows her to take no penalties to an Agility test while leaping, and she can even re-roll the result.</p>

<p>Finally, the Chaos Dwarves get the new Breathe Fire special trait, allowing them to attempt to blast an opponent with a ball of mouthy fire. On a good enough roll, they make their opponent go prone (and with a roll of a 6, the target is Knocked Down). They also have an update to their Iron Hard Skin skill, which reads" Opposing players cannot modify any Armour rolls made against this player. In addition, the Claws skill cannot be used when making an Armour roll against this player."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blood-bowl-rashnak-backstabber.jpg?itok=U9nmj3dM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blood-bowl-rashnak-backstabber.jpg?itok=ori0Bnzm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Finally, in addition to the Almanac and Rowanna, I also got to check out another new Star Player, Rashnak Backstabber. This Hobgoblin plays the Sneaky Stabba position, and has the special rule "Toxic Connoisseur," which reads: "Once per game, when Rashnak successfully breaks an opposition player's armour as a result of a Stab Special action, you may apply an additional +1 modifier to the Injury roll. This modifier may be applied after the roll has been made.</p>

<p>Nastiness all around! For fans of&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl</em>&nbsp;a new year always sees an exciting new Almanac, and I think this year's edition is one of the most useful for fans of the three featured armies. Everything I've written above is just the smallest little sample of what's included, so I'll leave it to you to dive in to see more Star Players, more sample lineups, point buy values for these armies, and so much more.</p>

<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Over the next few weeks we'll see more exciting new releases from Games Workshop I can't talk about yet, which will be a little less "all over the place" than this week's batch of fresh entries. But even so, I don't see how you could be disappointed as either an Orruk Warclans player or a&nbsp;<em>Blood Bowl</em>&nbsp;fan. These new releases give fans exactly what they're looking for - and while they won't be of much value if you don't field Orruk or play&nbsp;<em>BB</em>, for those interested this is going to feel like a real touchdown. Waaagh!</p>

<p>In 2001, Naughty Dog was acquired by Sony for an undisclosed amount after the two companies had worked together on Crash Bandicoot in the 1990s. Recently, one of the co-founders of Naughty Dog, one of the most iconic modern gaming studios, revealed exactly <strong>why </strong>the studio was happy to be acquired by Sony.</p>



<p>In a post on LinkedIn, Andrew Gavin explained that it was all down to the stress of managing budgets.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-makes-the-world-go-around">It Makes The World Go Around</h2>



<p>Andrew Gavin and Jason Rubin founded Naughty Dog in 1984, creating a few forgettable (or never-heard-of) titles before moving into the success stakes with the likes of Crash Bandicoot in the 1990s. From there, the studio blossomed, with the team coming up with Jak and Daxter, Uncharted, and The Last of Us.</p>



<p>For the longest time, Naughty Dog has been a Sony studio. It was one of the earliest acquisitions made by the tech titan, and it has proven to be one of the most fruitful purchases the Japanese firm ever made.</p>



<p>In a recent post <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/andrew-gavin-441765_why-did-we-sell-naughty-dog-its-a-question-activity-7277011334121058305-JZKz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on LinkedIn</a> (found by <a href="https://gameranx.com/updates/id/522635/article/naughty-dog-co-founder-reveals-why-they-were-acquired-by-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gameranx</a>), Andrew Gavin, one of the co-founders of Naughty Dog, explained why they were eager to accept an acquisition by Sony in 2001:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Back in 2000, we were still self-funding every project, and the stress of financing these ballooning budgets independently was enormous. It wasn’t just us. This was (and still is) a systemic issue in the AAA space. Developers almost never have the resources to fund their own games, which gives publishers enormous leverage.</p>



<p>Selling to Sony wasn’t just about securing a financial future for Naughty Dog. It was about giving the studio the resources to keep making the best games possible, without being crushed by the weight of skyrocketing costs and the paralyzing fear that one slip would ruin it all.</p>



<p>Looking back, it was the right call. AAA games have only gotten more expensive since then. Today’s big budget games can easily cost $300, $400, or even $500 million to develop.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Gavin went on to suggest that Naughty Dog <strong>might </strong>have been able to ‘keep up’, but selling to Sony allowed the studio ‘to thrive’.</p>



<p>Today, Naughty Dog is one of the most recognised and awarded studios on Earth.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/esports-betting-100-million-customers/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A research group has estimated that the esports betting industry could accommodate up to 100 million customers by 2029, marking an increase of almost 30 million users from today. It’s no big secret that esports betting is a major revenue driver in the world of competitive gaming, but these predictions suggest up to 60% of all revenue will be associated with betting by 2029.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-money">Big Money</h2>



<p>From data collected by Statista and leaned on by BetIdeas, it has been estimated that approximately 74 million people worldwide take part in esports betting, in some capacity. This figure is expected to swell to around 95.2 million by the start of 2029.</p>



<p>The amount of money the esports industry generates will grow in kind.</p>



<p>It was suggested that this year, the esports industry will generate $4.8 billion in revenue, more than $2 billion of which will be associated with betting. In 2029, the numbers are expected to climb to $5.9 billion and $3.5 billion, respectively.</p>



<p>This data was compiled by BetIdeas (and circulated <a href="https://cardbiz.ca/esports-betting-will-drive-nearly-of-market-revenue-by-p739-178.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Cardbiz</a>). The report also suggested that by the end of the decade, a whopping 900 million people worldwide will be tuning into esports events.</p>



<p>For years, esports and betting have gone together like peanut butter and jelly. They’re complementary concepts, working together in the same way that traditional sports have for many years. The COVID-19 pandemic brought about a boom in the esports betting industry, and things have been riding high ever since.</p>



<p>Per the predictions, almost 20 million Americans are expected to lay a bet on esports by 2029. That’s immense growth.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/notch-announce-minecraft-2-spiritual-successor/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/notch-has-%E2%80%98basically-announced-minecraft-2%E2%80%99-on-social-media.1073868/</guid>

<p>Markus ‘Notch’ Persson, best known for creating Minecraft, has written a lengthy post on social media explaining how he has ‘basically announced Minecraft 2’.</p>



<p>The comment comes almost fifteen years after he produced the first working version of Minecraft, a feat that took little more than a week in 2009. On Twitter, Notch explained that the game might never see the light of day and he doesn’t ‘super duper care’ which game he makes, but he ‘(does) know (he’s) making one’.</p>



<p>In his words, it could be a spiritual successor to Minecraft.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-minecraft-2-two-decades-later">Minecraft 2, Two Decades Later</h2>



<p>The first iteration of Minecraft, released in 2009, is now known as the Java Edition – Notch pieced it together in just a few days, and it eventually became a powerhouse of the gaming world worth billions of dollars. For the longest time, fans have wondered what comes next, but since Microsoft acquired the label, nothing more than a few spin-off titles have emerged.</p>



<p>Minecraft 2? Perhaps Notch wants to take control of that one.</p>



<p>On social media, <a href="https://x.com/notch/status/1875230756437479658" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Notch wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I basically announced minecraft 2. </p>



<p>I thought that maybe people ACTUALLY do want me to make another game that’s super similar to the first one, and I’m loving working on games again. </p>



<p>I don’t super duper care exactly which game I make first (or even if I make more), but I do know I’m making one, so I figured I’d absolutely be willing to give it an honest shot in the form of a spiritual successor to minecraft and put up a poll about it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He went on to explain that spiritual successors are ‘tragic’ and ‘washed up’ but he’s willing to do what people want if they’re open to stumping up the cash for a new product. </p>



<p>Notch also assured fans that his game wouldn’t infringe on ‘the incredible work the Mojang team is doing and that Microsoft is successfully doing’.</p>



<p>However, further down in the comments under his post, Notch was transparent:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Honestly, I’m not even sure I’ll make it to release, based on having been me for all my life. </p>



<p>But I do know I’m genuinely loving having fun working on a game in an office and would love to give it a shot.</p>
</blockquote>

No, I don't mean the Super Bowl - it's time for Awesome Games Done Quick, the annual charity speedrunning marathon that features a week of talented gamers showing off the wildest things they can do with video games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Games Done Quick (GDQ) has been running for 15 years now, since 2010. The event is a live broadcast speedrunning marathon, during which speedrunners take turns showing off beating video games as fast as possible, and often in wacky and especially impressive ways. In recent years, the events have shown off increasingly ambitious performances, including blindfolded or one-handed runs, two players using a single controller, showcases of tricky arcade games, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-start-2024-by-interviewing-the-worlds-first-dog-speedrunner">even speedruns performed by dogs</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The annual event is held to raise money for the Prevent Cancer foundation, having previously raised a record high of $3,442,033 in 2022, and $2,539,832 just last year. And this year's marathon has some pretty ridiculous runs on the docket. There's a run of Crazy Taxi backed by a live band, someone playing Elden Ring with a saxophone, new Super Mario Bros. Wii run while simultaneously playing piano, a two-players-one-controller run of Breath of the Wild, loads of randomizer races, and it all wraps up with a Map Randomizer Race between some of the best Super Metroid runners out there. If you've never watched GDQ before, it's really worth tuning in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">AGDQ 2025 kicks off at 9:00 AM PT on Sunday, January 5 with a run of Pikmin on Nintendo Switch, followed by Portal 2. In fact, Sunday's full of bangers: Kirby's Air Ride follows, there's an Astro Bot run, then The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, a run infamous for appearing at GDQ every years and getting shorter each time as the community discovers new, run-changing skips.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/03/fsh-08395-1735942959021.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Awesome Games Done Quick 2024, photo by Wes "Fish" Chan</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If I keep going I'll just list every single run in the entire event, so here's a quick list of highlights you should definitely check out.

<p>Earlier today, Valve officially updated their Counter-Strike 2 Major <a href="https://github.com/ValveSoftware/counter-strike_rules_and_regs/blob/main/major-supplemental-rulebook.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rulebook</a>, confirming the reports that their illustrious tournament would <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/40062/sources-majors-to-expand-to-32-teams-from-2025-rmrs-removed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expand from 24 teams to 32</a>. The increase in teams also means that the CS2 Major will expand the number of Swiss Stages from two to three. There will also be a new series of qualifier events, called the Major Regional Qualifiers.</p>



<p>The next Major on the schedule, the BLAST.tv Austin Major in April 2025, should be the first to incorporate the new changes.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-re-gonna-need-a-bigger-stage">We’re Gonna Need a Bigger Stage</h2>



<p>The CS2 Major will now prominently feature three 16-team Swiss Stages before culminating in the traditional eight-team single-elimination playoff bracket. Each Swiss Stage will still feature best-of-one matches in the first two rounds. </p>



<p>Eight teams will receive a direct invite to the third stage, and eight will receive a direct invite to the second stage. The Major Regional Qualifiers, which are replacing the Regional Major Ranking (RMR) events, will determine the 16 teams that begin in stage one.</p>



<p>The regional distribution of the teams invited to each stage of the CS2 Major is directly determined by that region’s performance at the previous Major. Six European teams, one Americas team, and one Asia/Pacific team are invited to stage three, based on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-spirit-win-shanghai-cs-major/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the teams that reached the playoffs of the Perfect World Shanghai Major</a>. Four EU teams and four Americas teams will be invited to stage two. Six EU teams, six Americas teams, and four Asia/Pacific teams will qualify from MRQs to stage one. </p>



<p>The official Valve Regional Standings for each of the three regions will determine which teams are invited to stage three, stage two, or the MRQs. The highest ranked teams from each region that haven’t already been invited to stage two or stage three will be invited to the MRQs.</p>



<p>Speaking of MRQs, which are replacing the Regional Major Ranking (RMR) events for determining Major participants, here are the new formats:</p>



<ul>
<li>Eight Asia/Pacific teams will compete in a two-group GSL-style bracket. Four teams will advance to Stage One.</li>



<li>16 European teams will compete in their own Swiss Stage. Six teams will advance to Stage One.</li>



<li>16 Americas teams will compete in their own Swiss Stage. Six teams will advance to Stage One.
<ul>
<li>If Americas must be subdivided to North America and South America due to ping issues, “Major invitations will be split evenly among the regions.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>Additionally, the changes to the CS2 Major rulebook say that the MRQs may be held online, though players and teams will likely heavily oppose playing online. </p>

<p>Atari has unveiled the Gamestation Go, an all-new handheld device with a few bizarre features that contribute nicely to a retro-futuristic vibe. In a short trailer uploaded on social media, we’re given a glimpse at the new console, which features typical button-based inputs alongside a keypad, paddle, and a Trak-Ball input.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-an-icon-reimagined">An Icon, Reimagined</h2>



<p>Atari is preparing to fully showcase the Gamestation Go handheld console at CES 2025 in Las Vegas, which will commence on January 7.</p>



<p>The first whispers of this device surfaced more than a year ago when it was revealed that Atari was partnering with MyArcade to piece together a handheld unit with these very features. That collaboration has come to fruition with the Gamestation Go.</p>



<p>At CES 2024, the ‘Gamestation Portable’ was revealed, featuring:</p>



<ul>
<li>A 7-inch high-resolution display</li>



<li>Paddle, Trak-Ball, and keypad inputs</li>



<li>Officially licensed titles</li>
</ul>



<p>The original design showcased at CES 2024 has undergone a few changes, with the team making some aesthetic tweaks and shifting some buttons around.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer released by Atari:</p>











<p>With charming hints of backlighting, a colour scheme that screams retro, and a promising line-up of titles, the Atari Gamestation Go could be a winner in the ever-growing handheld market. The unique inputs promise to accommodate games found on platforms like the Atari 5200 and the Jaguar. </p>



<p>In recent years, the concept of the handheld console has exploded in popularity, with almost every major tech manufacturer getting in on the action. Recently, we’ve seen every tech titan from MSI to Logitech and from Lenovo to ASUS have their crack at making a handheld gaming device.</p>



<p>When CES 2025 kicks off, we’ll likely have more information about the unit, including a release window and potentially a price point.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-dead-tcg-artifact-suddenly-had-12000-players-on-new-years-day-and-the-community-is-baffled<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As we rang in the new year earlier this week, thousands of people <em>seemed</em> to be celebrating in an admittedly unusual way: by playing Valve's 2018 TCG Artifact.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, as quickly as they started, the 12,000-ish individuals all stopped playing at once on January 3, leaving the game as empty as it had been at the end of 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Who were these people? No one seems to know. The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Artifact/comments/1hqvdjy/12k_players_again/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Artifact community isn't reporting any sudden spikes in interest</a>, and no one's really talking about the game on social media apart from marveling at the sudden jump in player numbers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So why, then, is <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/583950/charts/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB</a> suggesting that a free-to-play card game that is, by all accounts, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/artifact-valve-stops-development-on-struggling-card-game">close to dead</a>, seeing wild spikes in users over very specific two-day periods?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2025/01/01/12000-people-are-playing-artifact-right-now-and-no-one-knows-why/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by Forbes</a>, Artifact Classic's (the original, now free-to-play version of Artifact) player count suddenly spiked on December 31, jumping from a measly ~200 concurrent players up to the 5,000s, before spiking to a height of over 12,000. Artifact remained at around 11,000 concurrents through the second, before its playercount absolutely tanked back down to ~150 at midnight on January 3rd. What's strange is that something almost exactly like this happened earlier this month, too: on December 14, player counts shot up to around 14,000, hung out there for about two days, and dive bombed again into the hundreds on the 17th.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what's really going on here? The actual answer is that no one <em>really </em>knows. The most prevalent community theory seems to be that it's bots, though why someone would train bots to play Artifact isn't exactly clear. One person suggested someone was training an AI to play the game "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Artifact/comments/1hf87nf/comment/m2agrbz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">for shits and giggles</a>" which is perhaps as good an explanation as any. Another person suggested the spikes were due to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Artifact/comments/1hqvdjy/comment/m4y3g74/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">scam bots increasing playtime in random games</a> in order to make their Steam accounts look legitimate for <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/70E6-991B-233B-A37B" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">other purposes</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Hero in Artifact's Call to Arms Release Set</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another theory pointed out by multiple members of the Artifact subreddit is that the spike in players is due to pirates. Because certain video games require Steam authentication, in order to pirate those games, pirates will use the AppID/SDK of a different, free-to-play game to fool Steam into thinking they have a real copy. In this case, it's being suggested they're using Artifact. That said, this theory doesn't entirely hold up, due to the extremely sudden spikes and then drops in activity at very precise times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So the actual answer behind Artifact's mysterious player numbers remains a mystery for now. We did reach out to Valve for comment, but did not hear back in time for publication. What is clear at least is that despite the numbers, Artifact itself doesn't seem to be garnering any meaningful, real-world interest eight years after launch and four years after Valve <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/artifact-valve-stops-development-on-struggling-card-game">effectively called it quits</a>, even though the game itself <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/13/artifact-review">was pretty fun at first</a>. At least the bots, if they are indeed bots, in Artifact don't seem to be bothering legitimate players, unlike <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/team-fortress-2-steam-reviews-drop-to-mostly-negative-as-players-plead-with-valve-to-do-something-about-bots">the on-and-off situation over in Team Fortress 2</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-first-edition-artist-proof-set-on-sale-for-2-million<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dedicated <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> collectors have gotten a golden opportunity recently. A new listing on eBay promotes the sale of a complete <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> First Edition Artist Proof set. That is over 300 cards signed by dozens of contributing artists. As for the price, you may need to take out some serious loans.</p>



<p>The official <a href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/386107788022" rel="nofollow">eBay listing</a> of the complete <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>First Edition Artist Proof set was posted by user thelotusvale.</p>

<p>That listing includes a comprehensive number of screenshots showcasing every single card from the first edition of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. Each card is signed by the artist. Among these cards is the one of the most sought-after, The Black Lotus, in PSA Certified mint condition.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-first-edition-card-screenshots.jpg?itok=ajpHlDfU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-first-edition-card-screenshots.jpg?itok=QGI7tsJb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In addition, each card is accompanied by a signed, sketched artist proof of each card. These are single-sided white cards with the artist's sketch of the initial card artwork. They are meant for esteemed collectors and diehard fans of the respective artists.</p>

<p>So, about that price. According to the listing, the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> First Edition Artist Proof set will be available for as little as $2.2 million. If you live in Richmond, Virginia, the set is available for local pick up on purchase. Otherwise, shipping to the US will cost you $54.67.</p>

<p>Finally, if you buy this set, no refunds. That is, unless the set isn't as advertised, which would make it fall under eBay's Money Back guarantee policy.</p>

<p>It's not an unheard of price for <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> history. Last April, a pristine copy of the Black Lotus was sold for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mtg-black-lotus-shatters-records-in-staggering-3m-sale" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">$3 million</a>. Furthermore, rap artist Post Malone purchased the one-of-a-kind <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/post-malone-buys-magic-gathering-one-ring" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The One Ring</em></a> card from the Lord of the Rings set, a card speculated at $2 million in value, for an undisclosed amount.</p>

<p><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> First Edition was released to the world in 1993. This was the start of the iconic card game and the start of collectible card games within the tabletop space, inspiring competitors like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pokemon-trading-card-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pokemon TCG</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disney-lorcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Disney Lorcana</em></a>. It is a game packed with 30 years of history and a deeply passionate playerbase still drafting decks to this day.</p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/rumors-say-next-gen-rtx-50-gpus-will-come-with-big-jumps-in-power-requirements/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rumors-say-next-gen-rtx-50-gpus-will-come-with-big-jumps-in-power-requirements.1073661/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/01/rumors-say-next-gen-rtx-50-gpus-will-come-with-big-jumps-in-power-requirements/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Nvidia is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/12/nvidia-partners-leak-next-gen-rtx-50-series-gpus-including-a-32gb-5090/">reportedly gearing up to launch</a> the first few cards in its RTX 50-series at CES next week, including an RTX 5090, RTX 5080, RTX 5070 Ti, and RTX 5070. The 5090 will be of particular interest to performance-obsessed, money-is-no-object PC gaming fanatics since it's the first new GPU in over two years that can beat the performance of 2022's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/10/rtx-4090-review-nvidias-biggest-gpu-is-easily-its-best/">RTX 4090</a>.</p>
<p>But boosted performance and slower advancements in chip manufacturing technology mean that the 5090's maximum power draw will far outstrip the 4090's, according to leakers. VideoCardz reports that the 5090's thermal design power (TDP) will be set at 575 W, up from 450 W for the already power-hungry RTX 4090. The RTX 5080's TDP is also increasing to 360 W, up from 320 W for the RTX 4080 Super.</p>
<p>That also puts the RTX 5090 close to the maximum power draw available over a single 12VHPWR connector, which is capable of delivering up to 600 W of power (though once you include the 75 W available via the PCI Express slot on your motherboard, the actual maximum possible power draw for a GPU with a single 12VHPWR connector is a slightly higher 675 W).</p>
<p>Higher peak power consumption doesn't necessarily mean that these cards will always draw more power during actual gaming than their 40-series counterparts. And their performance could be good enough that they could still be very efficient cards in terms of performance per watt.</p>
<p>But if you're considering an upgrade to an RTX 5090 and these power specs are accurate, you may need to consider an upgraded power supply along with your new graphics card. Nvidia recommends at least an 850 W power supply for the RTX 4090 to accommodate what the GPU needs while leaving enough power left over for the rest of the system. An additional 125 W bump suggests that Nvidia will recommend a 1,000 W power supply as the minimum for the 5090.</p>
<p>We'll probably know more about Nvidia's next-gen cards after <a href="https://www.ces.tech/attendee-guides/nvidia-keynote/">its CES keynote</a>, currently scheduled for 9:30 pm Eastern/6:30 pm Pacific on Monday, January 6.</p>

That’s a shame because the bones of this tactical RPG are some of the strongest around, even if the surrounding fluff can get in the way sometimes.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196086,196599" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>A sequel to Image &amp; Form’s 2015 3DS game, <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em> trades its predecessor’s sci-fi setting for a <em>Pirates of the Caribbean</em>-infused take on the high seas, but otherwise the bulk of it still revolves around turn-based encounters in side-scrolling 2D maps where gunshots ricochet and grenades blow up cover to create memorably chaotic fights.</p><p>You’re still looting procedurally generated levels and trying to escape as bullets and lasers go whizzing past your crew’s mechanical heads, but there’s a major difference in <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>. Unlike the first game, in which characters were each ingrained with specific class archetypes, the sequel lets you give any crew member any weapon and then start building their kit around that. Equip a sniper rifle and you become a sharpshooter that specializes in dealing critical damage from afar. Wield a hammer and you become a brawler who gets extra turns and other bonuses from smashing foes up close. </p><p>This offers a lot of flexibility and freedom, but <em>SteamWorld Heist II </em>goes a step further and lets characters mix and match skills from different classes once they’ve unlocked them, rewarding experimentation and incentivizing a hunt for synergies that will break the game and help you take no prisoners when breaking into high security bases in search of powerful treasure. It’s basically the inverse of the<em> Final Fantasy Tactics </em>job system where skill trees were linked to classes rather than weapons. The result is a refreshing change-up that’s more streamlined without ditching too much depth. </p><p>I finished the game last summer on Switch (it’s also on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC) and loved every minute in which I found myself analyzing bullet trajectories, blast radiuses, and the odds of success if I sacrificed one character to cover the rest of the crew’s tactical retreat. Even through procedurally generated maps where any lollygagging will quickly find you overrun by enemy forces, <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>’s ingredients form an excellent recipe for tense moments, analytical showdowns, and seat-of-your-pants escapes. It cleverly iterates on the best elements of the first game and makes them even more robust and fun. </p><p>The only downside to <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em> is that it lacks the first game’s concise 12-hour runtime. It’s almost twice as long, with the extra hours going toward some late-game grinding and a new overworld exploration system in which you explore as a submarine gunning down enemy ships in real-time in exchange for small rewards that quickly stop being worth the trouble. Like the rest of <em>SteamWorld Heist II</em>, the shoot-‘em-up sections are smartly designed and control well but ultimately feel like unnecessary time wasters and frustrating distractions from the excellent 2D tactical combat at the game’s core. </p><p>Ultimately, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fsteamworld-heist-ii%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fsteamworld-heist-ii%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>SteamWorld Heist II</em></a></span><em> </em>is like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with an extra piece of bread in the middle. Still delicious but eventually way more than you want to eat. I still ended up finishing the game because the 2D <em>XCOM</em>-like shootouts are good enough to make wading through all the filler worth it. <em>SteamWorld Heist II </em>is a great tactics RPG that genre acolytes will be doing themselves a disservice to overlook.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Stern Pinball is back with another new machine and this time it’s a tribute to <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> following the tabletop RPG’s 50th anniversary. The table comes with all kinds of whimsical bells and whistles and an all-star voice cast, and it can be yours starting at $7,000. Or you could pay nearly double that for the limited edition version.</p><p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The Tyrant’s Eye</em> takes players into the Forgotten Realms to face off against owlbears, gelatinous cubes, a red dragon, and Xanathar the beholder, all with just a pair of flippers and a few steel balls. Trap doors unlock new dungeons and dice rolls will dictate how the adventure unfolds. I don’t have a spare down payment for a new car lying around, but I do have a basement just waiting to be renovated where this would fit perfectly. </p><p>  “Battle Rath the Relentless, the red dragon, the most advanced animatronic mech in pinball, [who] intelligently reacts to player action with multi-axis motion and features omnidirectional impact sensing technology,” writes Stern in a press release. “Voiced by the iconic Michael Dorn, players will attempt to defeat Rath the Relentless with pinballs and by hitting the 3-bank target, steal its treasure. When Rath the Relentless breathes his magnificent fire, multiple pinballs shoot from its mouth but be prepared. Players can activate a metal shield between the flippers to not only defend against attacks but also assist with playfield shots.”</p><p>I’m by no means a pinball connoisseur, but that all sounds rad. Critical Role fans are also in for a treat since Matthew Mercer, Laura Bailey, and Marisha Ray are also part of the <em>D&amp;D </em>pinball machine’s voice cast, along with Kevin Smith, Luke Gygax, Chris Prynoski, Brendon Small, and Gerard Way. And the table even incorporates the Stern Insider app to save progress. It’s effectively a <em>D&amp;D</em> pinball roguelike. In fact, that would be a great idea for an actual video game too. </p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/guitar-hero-review/1900-6137018/" data-ref-id="1900-6137018">Guitar Hero</a> debuted in November 2005, but the franchise has been in a lull for a long time. The last game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/guitar-hero-live-review/1900-6416284/" data-ref-id="1900-6416284">Guitar Hero Live</a>, arrived in 2015 and there hasn't been any concrete word about a new title since. However, the Guitar Hero fandom lives on in 2025, and there's a new controller coming to the Wii later this month.</p><p>Hyperkin has announced that an updated version of the company's Wii Guitar is up for preorder ahead of its release date, January 8. It's called the Hyper Strummer, and it includes support for Wii's Guitar Hero and Rock Band titles, with the exception of the first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/rock-band-review/1900-6184123/" data-ref-id="1900-6184123">Rock Band</a> game.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Hyperkin/status/1874486686622556240" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">New Year, New Wii... Guitars. Introducing the HYPER STRUMMER! An updated model of our previous Wii Guitar, we have been working hard and wanted to give you a little surprise of what is to come this year! The HyperStrummer is set to pre orders start NOW! <a href="https://t.co/e82FJN6bCk" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/e82FJN6bCk</a></p>  — Hyperkin (@Hyperkin) <a href="https://twitter.com/Hyperkin/status/1874486686622556240?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>At $77, the Hyper Strummer is somewhat pricey. But it was made to resemble the classic Guitar Hero controllers. It's also powered by the Wii remote, so players won't need to pickup any batteries for this controller. It's unclear how many Guitar Hero or Rock Band players are still using the Wii in 2025, but presumably Hyperkin took that into account before committing to this project. </p><p>Because Microsoft purchased Activision Blizzard, the company now controls the fate of any future Guitar Hero games. Earlier this year, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer revealed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-phil-spencer-says-he-passed-on-acquiring-so-many-games-including-destiny-and-guitar-hero/1100-6526241/" data-ref-id="1100-6526241">that he passed on Guitar Hero</a> before it became a breakout hit. In 2022, Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick noted that he and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-guitar-hero-come-back-under-microsoft-kotick-says-the-xbox-company-has-resources-to-do-it/1100-6499764/" data-ref-id="1100-6499764">Spencer had discussions about bringing Guitar Hero back</a>, but we haven't heard anything new about those talks since then. Guitar Hero <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2024-video-game-hall-of-fame-finalists-include-metroid-resident-evil-and-guitar-hero/1100-6521847/" data-ref-id="1100-6521847">was also one of the finalists</a> to be added to 2024's class at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-game-in-the-video-game-hall-of-fame/2900-5170/" data-ref-id="2900-5170">Strong Museum's Video Game Hall of Fame</a>. However, the game wasn't among the titles selected for that year.</p>

                <p>The Warrior is a classic ARPG class that features some ground-shattering skills in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504817">Path of Exile 2.</a> However, in the beginning stages of early access, many players are already calling for buffs to the Warrior due to the sluggishness of its abilities and weaker attacks in the endgame. While the Warrior very well may get buffed in the future, its currently designed for more advanced Path of Exile players.</p><p>Of course, if you follow the right build guide, it won't matter how much time you have played in the series. Below, you'll find the only viable Warrior build in the current state of Path of Exile 2.</p><h2>Warrior Overview in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>As you might expect, the Warrior is the definition of a melee class in Path of Exile 2. The class' main damage dealers are two-handed weapons like mauls and maces, which each come with skills of their own. However, players are allowed to switch things up and make use of a one-handed weapon along with a shield if they're looking to play more defensively. Shields also has its own defensive skill that allows you to block attacks, but you won't deal as much damage with this kind of build.</p><p>Fortunately, Path of Exile 2 allows you to swap freely between two different builds. So, you can have a two-handed weapon on one build and a one-handed weapon/shield on another build. This allows you to easily change up your playstyle depending on whether offensive or defensive strategies are required for a certain fight. You can also dual-wield one-handed weapons and this does come into play with certain skills.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416247-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.03.47.20.png" data-ref-id="1300-4416247" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416247-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.03.47.20.png" data-ref-id="1300-4416247"></a><figcaption>A club and shield will be your starting weapons as a Warrior</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416247-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.03.47.20.png"></figure><p>Generally, though, the best build for a Warrior in Path of Exile 2 relies on dealing damage with two-handed weapons, as it's very easy to get overwhelmed by mobs or bosses if you try to get too defensive.</p><p>As a Warrior, you'll want to put as many attribute points as possible into Strength. The other two attributes, Dexterity and Intelligence, won't come into play too much unless you want to be a more nimble Warrior. In that case, putting some points into Dexterity could be a good idea for certain gear.</p><h2>Best Warrior Skills in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>With the overview of the Warrior out of the way, it's time to talk skills. The Warrior has access to a wide variety of powerful attacks, but the main downfall of a lot of them is their overall slowness. You'll find yourself mashing buttons trying to get attacks off quicker, but the Warrior is simply a sluggish class that takes plenty of patience.</p><p>For the most part, the Warrior relies on AoE damage to hurt and kill enemies. You'll want to stay as close as possible to enemies to inflict the most damage possible, but this also means you'll be taking more damage in return. This is where swapping back between different weapons and your shield can come into play. Using an AoE attack and then changing to a shield to survive enemies that weren't killed and repeating the process is an effective gameplay loop you'll find yourself using.</p><p>Below, you can find the skills we recommend for the Warrior in Path of Exile 2:</p><ul><li>Mace Strike</li><li>Earthquake</li><li>Boneshatter</li><li>Shockwave Totem</li><li>Infernal Cry</li><li>Leap Slam</li><li>Sunder</li><li>Ancestral Warrior Totem</li><li>Hammer of the Gods</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416248-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.09.05.97.png" data-ref-id="1300-4416248" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416248-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.09.05.97.png" data-ref-id="1300-4416248"></a><figcaption>All skills for the Warrior in Path of Exile 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416248-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.09.05.97.png"></figure><p>The best Warrior build really can't come to fruition until you complete Act 3 on standard difficulty in Path of Exile 2. The build's best skills don't come until after you get into the acts again on Cruel difficulty. Skills like Sunder, Ancestral Warrior Totem, and Hammer of the Gods are quite effective for mobs and bosses but are unlocked late.</p><p>As such, using skills like Earthquake, Boneshatter, Shockwave Tote, and Infernal Cry is going to be your best bet for the early game in Acts 1-3. The build really picks up when you unlock Leap Slam, which pairs perfectly with Bone Shatter and a two-handed weapon. You can use these two skills in concert to deal massive damage and also avoid enemy attacks in the process. Also, using Infernal Cry before performing a combo will only boost the damage you deal, so make sure you're spamming that as much as possible.</p><p>In the early game, Mace Strike is an effective way to clear mobs, but it slowly gets out-paced by other skills. Earthquake, Boneshatter, and Shockwave Totem are decent skills that deal AoE damage, but they take a while to get off.</p><h2>Best Warrior Support and Spirit Gems</h2><p>Moving on with your build, your next task is to equip your <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-how-to-get-uncut-skill-gems/1100-6528278/" data-ref-id="1100-6528278">Skill Gems</a> with the right Support Gems as well as equip some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-how-to-get-uncut-spirit-gems/1100-6528331/" data-ref-id="1100-6528331">Spirit Gems</a> to grant you persistent buffs during combat.</p><p>Here are some Support Gems we recommend for a few skills, as well as the best Spirit Gems to use:</p><p><strong>Support Gems</strong></p><ul><li>Martial Tempo (all skills, but Leap Slam specifically)</li><li>Momentum (Leap Slam)</li><li>Holy Descent (Leap Slam)</li><li>Magnified Effect (all skills, but Earthquake/Shockwave Totem specifically)</li><li>Impact Shockwave (Boneshatter)</li><li>Brutality</li><li>Fist of War (Hammer of the Gods)</li><li>Primal Armament (Hammer of the Gods)</li><li>Supercritical (Sunder)</li><li>Concentrated Effect (Sunder)</li><li>Premeditation (Infernal Cry)</li><li>Raging Cry (Infernal Cry)</li><li>Rage</li><li>Deep Cuts (Mace Strike)</li><li>Heft (Mace Strike/Hammer of the Gods)</li><li>Font of Rage (Ancestral Warrior Totem)</li><li>Splinter (Ancestral Warrior Totem)</li></ul><p><strong>Spirit Gems</strong></p><ul><li>Overwhelming Presence</li><li>Scavenged Plating</li></ul><h2>Best Warrior Passive Skills</h2><p>As you level up with the Warrior, you'll gain one Passive Point to allocate to the Passive Ability Skill Tree. The Warrior's skill tree is fairly straightforward, as you want to mainly put points toward Strength, physical damage, and AoE damage.</p><p>Here are some Passive Abilities we suggest for the Warrior:</p><ul><li>Brutal</li><li>Sturdy Metal</li><li>Smash</li><li>Unstoppable Barrier</li><li>Blade Catcher</li><li>Beef</li><li>Sudden Infuriation</li><li>Lasting Trauma</li><li>Skullcrusher</li><li>Split the Earth</li><li>Resolute Technique</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416249-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.06.22.45.png" data-ref-id="1300-4416249" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416249-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.06.22.45.png" data-ref-id="1300-4416249"></a><figcaption>The Warrior's Passive Ability Skill Tree.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4416249-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.16-13.06.22.45.png"></figure><p>You'll also want to put points into different Strength attribute nodes wherever you can, as the Warrior can never have too much of it.</p><h2>Best Warrior Ascendancy in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>Finally, we've arrived at the Warrior's Ascendancy, which you can choose after slogging through the leveling process with the class. There are two choices for the Warrior's Ascendancy, which are: The Titan and Warbringer.</p><p>The key difference between the two Ascendancies is what you want to prioritize. The Titan is more about dealing damage while the Warbringer has some more defensive-minded abilities that help you survive against large mobs and bosses. With the current state of the Warrior being a little weaker, we recommend the Warbringer. You can take advantage of abilities like the Jade Heritage skill to absorb damage without it affecting your HP, making boss fights much more bearable.</p><p>However, in the future, the Titan Ascendancy will likely be the stronger pick after some buffs to the Warrior as a whole.</p>
