<p>I'm looking for someone to share in an adventure</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Atari has announced that its new retro-inspired metroidvania <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/adventure_of_samsara">Adventure of Samsara</a> will launch on the Switch next month on <strong>4th September 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Loosely based on the 2600 title <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/atari2600/adventure">Adventure</a> from creator Warren Robinett, Adventure of Samsara looks pretty awesome and we're really digging the whole retro vibe. But to be honest, we're still struggling somewhat to see the connection to the 1980 original beyond a couple of dragons and whatnot.</p>
<p>Though to be fair, Adventure's visuals were so basic at the time, you could interpret the presentation in a number of different ways, so we're going to hold off on our final judgement until next month. To reiterate, it does look really cool; lots of neat little abilities to discover and boss characters to vanquish.</p>
<p>Let's remind ourselves of the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>- Metroidvania Exploration</strong> – Explore 10 unique biomes, from frozen wastes to industrial labs, each filled with distinct enemies, hazards and hidden upgrades.<br>
<strong>- Classic Gameplay Feel</strong> – With classic gameplay and twisted 2D pixel art, <em>Adventure of Samsara</em> evokes the timeless feel of games like <em>Prince of Persia</em> (1989) while offering something entirely new.<br>
<strong>- Original Worldbuilding</strong> – Immerse yourself in an expansive, interdimensional fantasy world with a deep, spiritual lore.<br>
<strong>- Adventure Easter Eggs</strong> – The game features nods to the original <em>Adventure</em>, with familiar structures, enemies, and references that reward both new and returning players.<br>
<strong>- Collectibles</strong> – Hidden collectibles boost health, mana, damage, and flasks, while dozens of augments let players customize their playstyle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Atari is also cooking up a revival of <strong>Fatal Run</strong> with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fatal_run_2089">Fatal Run 2089</a>, a combat-focused racer due to launch on the Switch later this year. Digital Eclipse, a subsidiary of Atari, is working on the final touches to the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a> on Switch and Switch 2, which looks absolutely awesome.</p>

        <p>Blade joins the roster just in time for some comp balancing changes</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Techno-loving hollowtooth Blade has joined the playable cast of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, but he's not what I find most interesting about the free-to-play shooter's latest update. Developers NetEase Games have introduced a new system of penalties for ragequitters, keyboard-away-frommers, and other craven scumbags who abandon a competitive mode match early on because the dishwasher's overflowing, or similar.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
I find all this interesting simply because it's trying to automate Justice and determine a disconnecting player's good or bad faith, based on a bunch of dumb numbers. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2767030/view/541112753868243356?l=english">read about the update in full on Steam</a>, but here's a quick overview with fewer number tables and fewer intervening remarks about *squints* "Panther &amp; Wolverine's Sneaky Sounds".
</p>
<p>
If a player disconnects during match loading, the ban/pick phase, hero selection, or within the first 70 seconds of the match, the whole match will be deemed invalid, and the disconnecting player will receive a points penalty that scales with repeat offences.
</p>
<p>
If a player disconnects after 70 seconds, and doesn't reconnect before the match ends, they'll be Naughty Stepped as follows: 1) If the match ends within 90 seconds of their disconnection, there's no points penalty 2) If their team loses 90-150 seconds after they disconnect, they get a points penalty and competitive matchmaking ban, which both scale with repeat offences, while other players on the losing team get ranked point compensation. 3) If the match ends over 150 seconds after they quit, they'll get a larger point penalty and comp matchmaking ban. 
</p>
<p>
If the player who quit does reconnect before the match ends, and their team wins, they won't be penalised. But if they reconnect and the team loses, they'll get a points penalty... but no competitive matchmaking ban. Fickle and winding are the conduits of karma.
</p>
<p>
Similar rules apply for players who are detected as being AFK in the first 70 seconds of a match. Softer wrist-slaps are being doled out to those who pull the plug early during quickmatch multiplayer.</p>
<p>The most severe punishments are reserved for those who both go AFK and disconnect early during competitive. Damned souls indeed. But what if, what if that player was only AFK because they had to go administer the kiss of life to a postman, after the latter keeled over while delivering a crateload of community service awards, and what if that player then quit the game because they had to google appropriate post-resuscitation care? How are you going to distinguish a virtuous soul like that from somebody who came back from the kitchen with a plate of pickles and decided they'd rather watch Grand Designs anyway?
</p>
<p>
I'd love to know what kind of audience or playtesting informs the time windows, here. Why is 70 seconds the cut-off point for distinguishing between a player who noped out because their house has caught fire, and a player who has yanked out the router in fury because they got sneakishly dog-piled by Wolverine and Panther?</p>
<p>I imagine one consideration is how long it takes players to reach certain objectives or chokepoints on average. Another consideration is possibly how long it takes them to charge their Ultimate abilities - heroes passively gain 12 points of Ultimate energy a second, with different Ultimates requiring different amounts of energy. Fiddly stuff. Anyway, you are welcome to disagree with me that all of this is more interesting than Blade.

              <p>Will global warming kill your Switch 2? Is EA really never going to make a sequel to <em>The Sims 4</em>? Why is <em>Dynasty Warriors 3</em> objectively the best one in the series? These and more questions might get answered as we at <em>Kotaku</em> experiment with reviving our <a href="https://kotaku.com/culture/morning-checkpoint">old Morning Checkpoint roundup series</a> that used to run on the weekends. The idea is to briefly round up all the news and conversations that we might not otherwise have a chance to hit as individual breakout news stories but are otherwise worth knowing or fun to talk about, like the first <em>Call of Duty</em> developer union winning its first collective bargaining agreement. Here we go!</p> <h2><em>The Sims 5</em> wouldn’t be ‘player friendly’</h2> <p>That’s what EA entertainment president Laura Miele (she’s been at the company almost 30 years) <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/battlefield-6-release-date-sims-movie-ea-laura-miele-interview-1236475794/">told <em>Variety</em></a> when explaining why the hit life sim franchise has gone more than a decade without a direct sequel. “What I wouldn’t want to have happen is you to have to start from day zero and start from scratch and give up all of the things that you have created, give up all of the content that you’ve purchased over the years,” she said. “We put out over 85 content packs over the last 10 years on <em>The Sims 4</em>, and so resetting that is not player friendly and not a good idea for our community.” What fans are getting is a <em>Sims</em> movie <a href="https://kotaku.com/sims-movie-margot-robbie-barbie-ea-1851355482">with help from <em>Barbie</em>‘s Margot Robbie</a>. Which other EA franchises might get in on the current Hollywood gaming goldrush next? Miele currently has her eyes set on <em>Apex Legends</em>.</p> <h2>One sequel we are getting is <em>Darksiders 4</em></h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Darksiders 4 - Announce Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T_Wx2qlbdOM?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>  <h2><em>Call of Duty</em> testers win second Microsoft gaming union contract</h2> <p>Quality assurance devs at <em>Call of Duty</em> support studio Raven Software were the first Activision Blizzard staff to organize a union <a href="https://kotaku.com/activision-blizzard-employees-plan-walkout-wednesday-to-1847362030">amid the 2021 workplace fallout,</a> but then saw negotiations drag on for years as they accused the publisher of bad-faith bargaining tactics. Shannon Liao at <em>Updater</em> <a href="https://shannonliao.substack.com/p/3-years-later-they-won?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=155iz&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">now reports</a> that the Game Workers Alliance has finally ratified its contract, which among things “guarantees a 10 percent wage increase over two years.” It’s the second team at a Microsoft-owned studio to do so, with ZeniMax staff ratifying a contract in June just weeks before they were hit with mass layoffs. “If our unit of 19 people can do this, anybody can, as long as you’re committed to actually just doing the work and seeing it through to the end,” Erin Hall told Liao.</p>

 <h2>Global warming will make it harder to play Switch 2 outside</h2> <p>Tomorrow it’s going to basically be 100 degrees in Kyoto, Japan, where Nintendo is headquartered. After a July that was the hottest month on record ever for Japan, the country is <a href="https://www.channelnewsasia.com/east-asia/heat-records-broken-japan-heatwave-climate-change-5275641">continuing to blaze through temperature records</a>. Nintendo recently took the opportunity to remind fans that playing the Switch 2 in temperatures above 95 degrees is, uh, not great. “When using a Nintendo Switch or Nintendo Switch 2 in a high-temperature environment, the device’s temperature may rise,” the company <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs/status/1951116935409860651">posted</a>. “This could potentially cause malfunctions, so please use it in a location between 5–35°C.” This isn’t the first time the company has had to issue a warning like this. It did a summertime PSA for the original Switch <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-climate-change-temperature-handheld-1849168252">back in 2022</a>. Everything is <a href="https://kotaku.com/it-s-too-hot-to-play-video-games-1847410462">going great</a>, folks.</p> <h2><em>Dynasty Warriors</em> is getting a super, secret remaster</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="DYNASTY WARRIORS 25th Anniversary Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-qlDkMLMoSg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Koei Tecmo indicated that a game in the <em>Dynasty Warriors&nbsp;</em>series is getting remastered (but not which game) in a new trailer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-qlDkMLMoSg">celebrating the series’ 25th anniversary</a>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/dynasty-warriors-origins-beginner-tips-upgrade-skirmish-1851744251"><em>Dynasty Warriors Origins</em></a>, the entry that came out earlier this year, is also getting more DLC, the company revealed. But longtime fans are more interested in which games from the franchise’s past will get modern updates. <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> <em>3</em>, 4, and 5 are all top of mind for most, though a compilation of all three would probably be ideal. Hell, why not do the whole first six games?</p> <h2>Fight censorship, get free games</h2> <p>Over 1 million people claimed the <a href="https://freedomtobuy.games/">FreedomToBuy bundle</a> from GOG in its 48 hours of being available, <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1951999439024869715">the storefront reports</a>. It included <em>Postal 2</em>, <em>Agon</em>y, <em>Fetish Locator Week One</em>, and a bunch of even weirder stuff, “because if a game is legal, you should be free to buy it.” The bundle was in response to the recent crackdown on NSFW games on Steam and itch.io <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-itch-io-sex-game-nsfw-censor-visa-mastercard-1851787281">due to payment processors</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> isn’t getting delayed</h2> <p>The year is more than half over and we still don’t know when<em> Metroid Prime 4</em> is coming out. Some fans feared the game could slip to 2026 after it was a no-show during a recent Nintendo Partner Direct. But the company recently announced it will be playable at the Fan Expo Canada <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/whatsnew/fan-expo-canada-attendees-will-have-access-to-play-the-latest-and-upcoming-titles-on-nintendo-switch-2/">near the end of August</a>. A November release date is feeling more and more likely.</p> <h2>Happy 40th Birthday Rare</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000614509" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000614509"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000614509">8bitdo</figcaption></figure> <p>Someone on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Controller/comments/1mh6aho/new_wireless_8bitdo_xbox_controller_leaked_on/">found a leaked Amazon listing</a> for an 8bitdo Xbox controller commemorating <a href="https://x.com/RareLtd/status/1952327433010491560">the 40th anniversary</a> of Rare, the studio best known for<em> Donkey Kong Country</em>, <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em>, and <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, among other iconic classics. It’s $90 and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Controller-Gaming-Console/dp/B0FHQ6P7TQ?tag=kotaku01-20">looks very nice</a>. There’s also a vinyl soundtrack collection and <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/04/rare-40th-anniversary-rewards-sea-of-thieves/">Evercade cartridges for old Rare games</a>.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/mastercard-denies-pressuring-steam-to-censor-nsfw-games-2000614393">Valve and Mastercard are feuding over who’s to blame for sex game censorship</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-4-delay-cloud-chamber-2k-take-two-remake-2000614413">A <em>Bioshock</em> remake was shelved and <em>Bioshock 4</em> is in trouble</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384">After 4 Hours With <em>Battlefield</em> 6 I’m Convinced It Has The Juice</a></strong></li> </ul>

Nintendo has once again assured Metroid fans that the game will be out this year for Switch 2 and Switch, allaying fears that it might be delayed.</p><p>Ahead of its appearance at Fan Expo Canada later this month, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/whatsnew/fan-expo-canada-attendees-will-have-access-to-play-the-latest-and-upcoming-titles-on-nintendo-switch-2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo says</a> that Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will be playable and will be "available later in 2025" alongside other games on Switch 2. This isn't the first time that the public has been able to go hands-on with Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, and Nintendo's statement confirms that the game will still launch within the next five months.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p><em>When </em>it will launch in this period still remains uncertain. Nintendo has been spacing out first-party releases for the Switch 2, starting with Mario Kart World as a Switch 2 launch game in June, Donkey Kong Bananza in July, Drag x Drive in August, and Pokemon Legends: Z-A is scheduled to arrive on October 15. If the pattern holds up, it's not unlikely that Metroid Prime 4: Beyond could arrive during the lucrative holiday season as a must-have Switch 2 game, considering that the console already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/">has an install base of 6 million users and counting</a>.</p><p>This will bring a lengthy development cycle to a close for Nintendo, following the company's decision to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4s-development-restarted-with-retro-/1100-6464593/">restart development in 2019</a> after it failed to reach the standards that the company expected of it, under Bandai Namco. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-re-revealed-with-impressive-trailer-and-2025-release-date/1100-6524332/">The game was re-revealed in 2024</a>, and since then, we've seen a trickle of new gameplay showing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-on-switch-2-will-let-you-swap-to-mouse-controls-on-the-fly/1100-6530602/">off action and mouse controls</a>.</p>

              <p><span>After 10 years, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/critical-role-marquet-third-campaign-asian-cultures-col-1848500055"><i><span>Critical Role</span></i><span>‘s</span></a><span> fourth campaign will be the webseries’ first without </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-cassidy-critical-role-matthew-mercer-twitch-1850538440"><span>Matthew Mercer</span></a><span> serving as game master. The actual play show (and, now, multimedia franchise) began in 2015, and since then Mercer has led all three campaigns, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/critical-role-subscription-beacon-twitch-youtube-1851469461"><span>which you can listen to</span></a><span> on the group’s </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@criticalrole/podcasts"><span>YouTube channel</span></a><span>. Campaign IV, however, will be led by Brennan Lee Mulligan, a frequent collaborator with the group and the dungeon master of another actual play series called </span><i><span>Dimension 20</span></i><span>. Mulligan’s years of experience and familiarity with </span><i><span>Critical Role </span></i><span>make him one of the most well-suited candidates to take the reins of a new campaign. Fans erupted into thunderous applause when Mulligan was brought on stage during the group’s Indianapolis live show over the weekend, but this is still a big change, and the </span><i><span>Critical Role </span></i><span>community has feelings on the matter.</span></p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Critical Role Direct: Campaign 4 Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mEuwZbNde2s?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p><span>Mulligan was broadly welcomed with open arms, but many </span><i><span>Critical Role</span></i><span> fans noted they were sad to see Mercer step down from the GM role, even if he will be a part of the campaign as a player. Fans were also taken aback by the announcement that Campaign IV will take place in a new setting, rather than returning to Exandria, the setting in which the first three campaigns took place. While diehards are mourning a fantasy setting they’ve been invested in for a decade along with Mercer’s shift out of the GM’s chair, this likely will make Campaign IV a better entry point for newcomers, as they won’t have to catch up on years of lore to jump in and watch.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'll watch, continue subscribing, etc. But would be lying if I didn't say it breaks my heart that Matt isn't GM'ing and some of the core cast isn't returning.</p> <p>If anyone could succeed Matt it's Brennan, but man.</p> <p>— Jolly Roger (@JollyRogX) <a href="https://twitter.com/JollyRogX/status/1951835783054360659?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I know I’m in the minority, but I’m not excited about the “new world.” Was really looking forward to how things would unfold on Exandria given how the last campaign ended.</p> <p>— Nicholas Fondacaro (@NickFondacaro) <a href="https://twitter.com/NickFondacaro/status/1951851585316720645?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Don’t know how I feel about this… Excited for a new story and world tho.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>I have to admit, I’ve got mixed feelings when it comes to the Demon Slayer franchise. I’ve never really enjoyed Shonen battle series, save for the ones I grew up with, like Naruto and Bleach. I appreciate that Demon Slayer has become a similar entry-point for countless fledgling anime fans across the world, but as someone with no real passion for the series, seeing some of my favourite animation and game studios working in the mines pumping out content for it has me feeling jaded. I’m a massive fan of the CyberConnect2 developed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/02/04/naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-4-review/">Naruto Ninja Storm</a> series, but it’s an interesting feeling to play a game without also having a personal attachment to the source material. I don’t feel like Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles 2 is a bad experience at all, but I also don’t know if it’s an entirely necessary or groundbreaking one.</p>
<p><iframe title="Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles 2 | Pre-Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BvmW5nm11ro?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The first Demon Slayer -Kimetsu no Yaiba- The Hinokami Chronicles closely adapted the anime up to the end of its Mugen Train arc, and this sequel sees you playing through a lengthy, detailed rendition of the Red Light District and the Hashira Training arc. I’ve known the names of these arcs but very little about their content – a prologue mode is available in The Hinokami Chronicles 2 that catches you up on the events of the first game if needed, but they do so by rushing you through just six incredibly brief battles. The proper story mode, thankfully, is much more dense in detail and even activities.</p>


<p>On the label, this is another anime arena fighter. The fundamentals here haven’t changed much compared to the last game – your standard attacks are on one button, while your specials are on the other. You’ve got a meter to build up that will either let you call in an assist from your second character, swap them in entirely, have them snatch you away from an incoming attack, or bust out your current character’s ultimate attacks. It’s basic, but it’s fun, and with a beefy roster of nearly 40 characters I was pleasantly surprised by how much variety there was to each demon and demon slayer’s movesets.</p>


<p>You do so much more than just standard arena battles in the story mode, though. Your enemies aren’t always just CPU controlled versions of the playable cast, but can be unique demon beasts that only show up for the story mode, incredibly detailed multi-phase boss battles, or even hordes of enemies you tackle all at once musou-style. In-between those battles, you’ve got varied environments to explore, like quiet forest paths or the bustling Red Light district. There are side-quests to discover, rhythm mini-games to participate in, and you’ll even frequently be busting out the special abilities of your playable heroes to track down clues and hints for your next objective. I was so impressed by how much fun it was to just exist in these spaces and explore them between the main battles of the story.</p>
<p>At no point did I feel like the story mode in The Hinokami Chronicles 2 was glossing over things or skipping around. There are so many cutscenes, presenting a mix of quiet moments, silly moments, and tense hot-blooded encounters. The boss fights are full of immaculate detail, special animations, and jaw-dropping cutscenes too. This is all a staple of CyberConnect2 anime fighters, yet experiencing them in this game leaves me with a weird feeling. For the Naruto series, it felt groundbreaking to see the iconic battles of that series re-imagined with sharp 3D models, fluid animations, and massively upgraded choreography.</p>

<p>Demon Slayer is already known for being a visual feast, though – it’s the anime with arguably the most budget and most visual flashiness ever put to screen. This game perfectly matches the art style, tone, and sensory overload of those animated moments, but because of that, these flashy boss battles and anime-accurate cutscenes aren’t a massive upgrade or shocking new approach to what they’re adapting. In some cases, the anime even handles these flashy fights a bit better.</p>
<p>What the anime doesn’t have, though, is a roguelike mode. When you’re done diving through the main The Hinokami Chronicles 2, the Hashira Training mode lets you dig into randomised battles as you follow a path to victory. It isn’t nearly as varied of a mode as something like Balatro or Slay The Spire, though. Your upgrades are pretty simple and your goal is just to reach the Hashira that you’re training with to beat them so you can earn a bunch of points to use in the gallery mode. Still, it’s a pretty fun alternative to a standard Arcade mode and adds an extra layer of engagement that kept me interested in sticking with the game just a bit longer.</p>

<p>Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles 2 is an incredibly solid game. It isn’t something that has converted me into being a fan of the series, though. I also don’t think the story content contained in it does anything groundbreaking or surprisingly different compared to the source material. An existing fan of the franchise will eat this up, but you shouldn’t try to use this game as the gateway to get your friends invested in the franchise.</p>

            <p>As Rare - known for the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>, Banjo-Kazooie and  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country">Donkey Kong Country</a> - gets ready to celebrate its 40th anniversary, a third-party licensed controller themed around the developer's legacy has leaked online.</p>
<p>The controller itself has been built by gaming peripherals manufacturer 8BitDo, and officially licensed with Rare and Xbox. It features Hall Effect sticks, 'Pro Back Buttons' and has an integrated charging dock (via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1mh6981/new_wireless_8bitdo_controller_leaked_on_amazon/">reddit</a>). </p>
<p>The controller is compatible with Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PC, Android and iOS, and - according to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/8Bitdo-Controller-Gaming-Console/dp/B0FHQ6P7TQ">Amazon listing</a>, which has gone live prior to any official announcement from the studio itself - this release will mark 8BitDo's first 2.4G wireless Xbox controller.</p>

<p>"A legendary collaboration for a legendary milestone," reads the controller's Amazon page. "Wrapped in signature blue and gold, this special edition features symbolic patterns, game-inspired silhouettes and playful Easter eggs - a tribute to the legacy Rare brought to life."</p>
<p>Those aforementioned silhouettes include bananas (a nod to Donkey Kong), feathers ( Banjo-Kazooie), tentacles (Sea of Thieves) and more. You can see how it looks via the images below.</p>
<p>Amazon's sales page has the controller listed for $89.99, and at the time of writing it appears it will be only available across the pond in the US. Eurogamer has asked Microsoft for comment.</p>

<p>"From devoted Rare gamers to single-series stalwarts, we want to show our appreciation for anyone who's visited even just one of our worlds," <a href="https://x.com/RareLtd/status/1952327433010491560">it wrote</a>, with an accompanying piece of art showing characters from Rare's games all gathered together in a theatre (see below).</p>
<p>"For keeping an assorted ragtag of creatives working magic in the Midlands, only two words will do: THANK YOU."</p>

<p>Of course, it has not been an easy time for Rare recently. Just last month, the studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">fantasy adventure Everwild was cancelled following layoffs at Xbox</a>. Everwild was first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rare-announces-everwild-its-next-big-new-ip">revealed in late 2019</a>. At this time, the game was said to be the next "large" project from Rare, and one that would co-exist with the ongoing development of Sea of Thieves.</p>
<p>Soon after Everwild's cancellation, it was revealed Rare's most seasoned creator Gregg Mayles - known for directing the likes of Banjo-Kazooie and Sea of Thieves, as well as his work on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-64">Donkey Kong 64</a> and many more games - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-and-banjo-kazooie-director-gregg-mayles-reportedly-leaving-rare-after-35-years">had left the studio after more than 35 years</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/its-been-a-rough-year-for-rare-but-at-least-xbox-is-celebrating-its-40th-anniversary-with-a-licensed-controller]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Koei Tecmo has announced two major&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors&nbsp;</em>projects as part of the celebrations for the series' 25th anniversary, and if you're a fan of old-school entries in the series, it looks like you're in luck.</p>

<p>First up, as revealed on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2384580/view/527601954987180354" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>, a "large-scale" DLC expansion is in development for&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>. Koei Tecmo is remaining relatively tight-lipped about what that DLC pack might entail, but it's a "major" expansion, according to an accompanying trailer.</p>

<p>Not only is the DLC coming, but a remastered version of one of the series' past entries is also in the works. Again, we don't know which game is up for the remaster treatment, but given that titles like&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>5&nbsp;</em>are fan favorites, it's likely one of these is the subject of Koei Tecmo's nostalgic attentions.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dynasty-warriors-origins-dlc-remaster-battlefield.jpg?itok=wuy-U073 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dynasty-warriors-origins-dlc-remaster-battlefield.jpg?itok=LyZitU7B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins&nbsp;</em>is getting new DLC soon.</figcaption></figure><p>News of&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>' upcoming DLC comes a few months after Koei Tecmo revealed that the latest game in the large-scale hack-and-slash franchise has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dynasty-warriors-origins-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">hit a million sales worldwide</a>. Since that announcement was back in February, it's likely the game has picked up even more sales for itself in the interim.</p>

<p><em>Origins&nbsp;</em>revolves around a "nameless hero in the Three Kingdoms", who will experience the "magnificent and alluring" story of this historical period (albeit through the lens of&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors</em>' characteristic over-the-top action) as he hacks and slashes his way through legions of enemies.</p>

<p>The game offers a new spin on the usual blend of action and strategy that characterizes&nbsp;<em>Dynasty Warriors</em>, as well as a fresh take on the narrative that the series has revolved around since its inception in 2000.</p>

<p>You can check out the <i>Dynasty Warriors&nbsp;</i>25th-anniversary trailer right here. It's pretty short, but it should spark a few memories if you've been with the series since the start.</p>




<p><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2384580/DYNASTY_WARRIORS_ORIGINS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dynasty-warriors-origins/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dynasty-warriors-origins/9p5hjqnx53xj" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>I was munching crisps while watching a showcase of upcoming games from THQ Nordic last week, letting the likes of a new Spongebob Squarepants game and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gothic-remake">Gothic Remake</a> wash over me like barely flavoured fizzy water, when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fatekeeper">Fatekeeper</a> showed up. I straightened up, just a little. It is a fancy looking first-person RPG made with all the hyper detail and vivid lighting you might expect of a game developed in Unreal Engine 5. It is also conjuring a game worth conjuring: the heavy hitting fantasy brawlabout <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-messiah-of-might-and-magic">Dark Messiah Of Might And Magic</a>. As I watched the below trailer, I became more and more cautiously hopeful. Looks slick, but where's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-dark-messiah-might-magic">the kick</a>?</p>
<!--more--> <figure>

<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</figure>
<p>It's being made by Paraglacial, a small THQ-owned studio made up of a few former Spellforce developers. And it isn't the first game to try capture the magical bootfoolery of Dark Messiah. A fantasy sword swinger called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hellraid">Hellraid</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hellraid-development-on-hold">cancelled by Techland</a> some years ago, and it was while discussing that piteous loss that the studio began to plot their own take on first-person sword-slamming.</p>
<p>"We thought that this is a type of game that you don't see that often," said creative director Raphael Lubke during the showcase. "You have these huge awesome open world titles like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>, but you barely ever see like dedicated, more linear story-driven games with this nice focus on the combat mechanics of melee in a first-person game."</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>THQ Nordic</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That combat does look weighty from what we were shown during a demo. Your two-handed sword is wielded with hefty swings, sometimes donking crankily off enemy shields, sometimes piercing their necks and entering a bottled animation that ends in a swift decapitation. You can take dashing sidesteps and swig health vials. It reminds me of the movement in Chivalry II, if your opponents were snarling singleplayer orc-a-likes in opulent armour, rather than screeching multiplayer knights. </p>
<p>We also get some hints as to other more magical powers you'll use, aside from the windy push powers and object-hurling telekinesis you can see in the above trailer. "You might be able to freeze a lake, lure enemies onto it, and then melt the ice with the fireball, for example," said Lubke. </p>
<p>But for now the focus seems to be on getting some chunky hits in with that massive claymore. At one point in the playthrough, the player coated a sword with poison and we watched as the heavy bruiser he was fighting slowly succumbed to the toxins, eventually keeling over. I will admit, even without that pivotal bootheel, there were some very entertaining ragdoll physics, not to mention some lovely vanishing screams as sharp-toothed foes tumbled into the pits below.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>THQ Nordic</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>And these were some sheer drops. Paraglacial, the studio, is located in the German Alps, and it's a locale that has partly inspired the high-altitude terrain of the game's fantasy landscape (if not the ornate temple architecture). </p>
<p>"I always said this dream of founding is team in an area where you normally don't see game development teams, like remote rural areas like we are in the Alps," said Lubke. "And we also wanted to transport our love for this environment into the game and create a game world where the landscape, the environment is a part of the story itself. It's one of the main actors of the game.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>THQ Nordic</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"It's not an open world game, the maps are designed in a not extremely open way, but they allow for a lot of different trajectories. [It's] not a straight line where you feel like you're playing on rails. Linear, for us, means control over the narrative and the density of the experience, but it doesn't mean forcing the player down a shallow path."</p>
<p>We get a few other glances of the bruiser's innards. An item screen that looks like a mash-up of the inventory management of Witcher 3 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>, for example. And an easy-to-solve puzzle tomb that the developer says won't be quite so simple in the full game. But otherwise it's a short but enticing glimpse of some promising battering. Still, I want to see that conspicuously absent kick. After loving the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deathloop-chose-to-boot-its-melee-system-in-favor-of-that-excellent-kick">strong booting</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deathloop">Deathloop</a> enough to record <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3gvwJ1xcjs">an entire video conversation about it</a> with Colm (RPS in peace), I am yearning for another equally powerful pair of shoes.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fatekeeper-looks-like-a-spiritual-successor-to-dark-messiah-but-wheres-the-kick]]></content:encoded>

              <p>In one of GameStop’s many scrambles to stay alive beyond its memestock status, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-gme-pokemon-card-trade-ins-psa-charizard-1851470574">the stores began buying graded <em>Pokémon TCG</em> cards last year</a>. Now the company has found a way to sell them back to you, but in a wildly bad mystery box deal.</p> <p>GameStop’s attempt to behave like your local TCG store could only ever have been a bizarre corporate pastiche of the concept. When you go to your local independent card shop and trade in your pulls, they’ll usually give you a fair price that still leaves decent room for the store to resell them at a profit. When GameStop started doing it, it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-trade-in-gamestop-youtube-leonhart-1851489326">without providing the staff with the necessary training and expertise</a>, and naturally saw them paying woefully low prices, and of course without any of the individual stores having any independence over how it was carried out. The result of all that is now far more clear: for the last three months, GameStop has been selling graded cards back to customers in the form of mystery boxes, with the second phases of this initiative just launched. And wow, they’re not worth it.</p> <p>Three months ago, the incredibly popular Pokémon YouTuber PokeRev <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqGiE5hz7zI">opened the first wave of these mystery boxes</a>, called GameStop Power Packs. At that point, these $60 boxes contained three “random” booster packs plus one PSA-graded card, at a grade of 8 or higher. The boxes showed an image of a Lost Origin Giratina V alt-art in a grade 10, which <a href="https://www.pricecharting.com/game/pokemon-lost-origin/giratina-v-186?q=giratina+v+186">today would cost you over $1,600</a>. That’d sure be nice to find. But just like the infamously terrible Walmart equivalent MJ Holding mystery boxes which do the same daft trick of putting extraordinarily rare packs on their boxes, that’s not what you’re likely to discover inside.</p>

 <p>To be fair to GameStop, their presentation is at least a little nicer–Walmart’s mystery boxes are flimsy cardboard with the various items rattling loose inside. GameStop’s go the other way, with so much of the cost clearly going into the sturdy box, folding lid, and bespoke foam inset. But yeah, the chances of finding $60-worth of goodies inside seems incredibly slim.</p> <p>This second wave of Power Packs has maintained the $60 price, but now only have two booster packs instead of three! Those packs, as revealed in PokeRev’s latest video on the boxes, seem to be two of Surging Sparks, 151, or Journey Together. That’s about $10 to $15 worth. The graded cards then seem to come in around $15 to $30, meaning most boxes will get you contents worth from half to two-thirds of what you paid. Which…sucks! $60 for $30 of cards.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Gamestop's New Power Packs are Kinda Weird" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/irST4sbj3Yg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>There is, of course, the chance that the packs could contain a valuable card, but it’s not high, and no better than just buying the packs themselves for their actual price. The one positive I can find is that at least the PSA-graded cards aren’t just bulk. From watching plenty of those MJ Holding boxes getting opened that contain graded cards, those will very often feature a grade 7 generic card from a recent set, worth far, far less than it would have cost to grade it in the first place. Instead, what’s shown for GameStop’s seem to be at least some classic cards from the early 00s, both Japanese and English, even if they themselves aren’t worth more than small change.</p> <p>We don’t know if these PSA cards are solely sourced from what’s been sold to GameStop stores over the last year, or if the company is buying them in bulk from other suppliers, but a combination of the two would make most sense. Either way, given the stores will have paid far less than they’re worth when they’re traded in, and are then being sold back in boxes that the majority of the time charge twice as much as the contents are worth, it’s clearly a very profitable venture for the company. But it’s definitely not one worth spending your money on. You’re far better off visiting your local independent store, or buying graded cards from trusted online marketplaces, so you can be sure you’re spending your money on the card you really want.</p>

<figure><a title="Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157837/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>To return to <strong>Ninja Gaiden</strong>’s 2D roots in 2025 is a wonderful thing. Dotemu, upon acquiring the license for a series reboot, approached Spanish indie developer The Game Kitchen to get the job done. Known for their remarkable <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a> titles, the project was overseen by Team Ninja, who have held the series mantle from 2004 to present. And, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ninja_gaiden_ragebound">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> is not strictly the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/ninja_gaiden">Ninja Gaiden</a> one recalls from its NES days, the task here has been carried off with all the panache modern technology can afford, resulting in a blisteringly gorgeous action-platformer.</p>
<p>For those old enough, Ninja Gaiden was once a formidable 8-Bit challenge that either destroyed a child’s willpower or forged them eternal gaming mastery. It was, and still is, brutally hard. While Ragebound echoes this, in that it gets seriously challenging after its first third, its format is far less aggressive. You don’t have lives, you have checkpoints, and respawns come in an infinite flavour. You don’t have entirely linear progression, but a world map where you can return to any substage to earn higher ranks, complete mini challenges, or recover Golden Scarabs. If you're not well equipped and your reflexes suck, however, the Pirate Stage boss will have you spitting teeth.</p>
<figure><a title="Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157842/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ragebound’s plotting is heavy compared to the games of old, with regular cutscenes and dialogue exchanges between an incredibly broad cast of characters. It takes place in parallel to 1988's Ninja Gaiden, with an opening prologue where you play Jō Hayabusa - Ryu Hayabusa’s father - who is defeated in battle by its end. Ryu, forced to cut the training of a young Kenji Mozu short, heads to America to avenge his father’s death, concurrent with the events of the original NES game. Kenji, the new protagonist, is left behind to defend the village from a demonic invasion, and a new adventure is on.</p>
<p>Visually, Ragebound is stunning. The locations are varied; not content with idling in the mountains of Japan, it moves with its plot, expanding into cities, subways and multi-tiered construction sites. The colour casting is exceptional, the detail incredible, and the animations fluid and sharp. Your demon adversaries, punched through in bursts of blood and an occasional decapitation, lie dispatched on the ground while severed limbs of the opposing clan spin through the air. While most sprites are relatively small, they come imbued with bags of visual personality and an undying coolness.</p>
<figure><a title="Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157840/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The aesthetic is cartoonier than Sega’s forthcoming Shinobi: Art of Vengeance, but well suits the series canon. Fire rages, waterfalls cascade, rain patters, and sunsets set. The entire thing, from end to end, is a feast for the eyes, roaming across glades, through pitfall-filled caverns, ominous bio-factories, and decorated corporate headquarters. Complimenting the visuals is a terrific score, its rock-cinematic soundtrack oft recalling historical Ninja Gaiden motifs.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it plays fantastically, too, thanks to limber mechanics and finely crafted stage designs. The combat doesn’t feel overburdened, even when your options extend during the game. Combining simplicity with depth, you have a straightforward slash and a “Guillotine Slash”, which is performed in the air by tapping the jump button a second time, encircling Kenji. The Guillotine Slash not only kills or damages an enemy, but allows you to spring off of them, effectively a double jump. You can ping off of almost anything that can hurt you, chaining hops across Shuriken, fireballs, and thick enemy skulls; and the added height will boost you toward overhead platform apparatus. Depending on your prowess, you can make Ragebound look incredibly good, snapping about the scenery and dispatching enemies with a variety of imaginative mixups.</p>
<figure><a title="Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157839/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Kenji can power-up at will by using a moderate portion of health, affording him a hyper strike that cuts through armoured enemies. Alternatively, this same single-use power-up is carried by certain demons, denoted by a glowing aura, who are almost always paired on-screen with larger, shielded foes. This creates a nice cadence where you bounce and strike for the aura, power-up, and then violently cut through the bigger foe like butter. Additionally, Kenji can slide-strike from a dash by using the shoulder button in tandem, and, crucially, roll safely through incoming dangers.</p>
<p>Checkpoints litter the fairly large stages, which are split down into substages, and act as respawn points for dishonourable defeat. During your travels you collect Golden Scarabs that can be traded at the shop for Talismans, granting you new abilities. Only two can be equipped at a time, adding a strategic but flexible dimension to the gameplay; and with useful properties like replenishing your health whenever you pass a checkpoint, or increasing your attack power when close to death, they’re indispensable.</p>
<p>Bosses are brilliantly done; often giant, monstrous things that not only look superb, but deploy proper, sequenced attack patterns. Here, your skills - rolling, guillotine slashing, and powering up - are exercised in clever ways, and it feels rewarding to flex Kenji's skill catalogue. Slaying twin serpents over a river of blood is a wonderfully intense skirmish, and requires absolute pattern memorisation and all of your attributes to best.</p>
<figure><a title="Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound Review - Screenshot 5 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157843/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound is anywhere between three to six hours in length depending on your ability, but it’s not until around the hour mark that things fundamentally shift, switching characters from Kenji to Kumori, a Black Spider Clan Kunoichi. A ranged character, she throws blades in four directions and is incredibly fun to play. Neater still, she ends up not just siding with Kenji, making for interestingly hostile banter, but combines with his body. For the remainder of the game you are graced with both character’s properties, long and short range powers combined. This adds several new quirks, requiring you to use each character's abilities to tag specific colour-coded, aura-wielding enemies, and a new Rage Meter that can destroy every on-screen adversary or bat chunks from a boss’s health bar.</p>
<p>From this point, things get really inventive. There are junctures where Kenji must give over control to Kumori, who in spirit form has a brief window to execute a series of movements, skipping and teleporting, to reach a hidden item, switch, or trigger to allow you to continue through the stage. Her energy meter ticks down rapidly, meaning she can make scant few errors in completing the task. Failure doesn’t result in death, but a return to Kenji’s body to start over. It’s not an entirely novel device, but does add new definition to an already well-thought-out game; and, along with arcade-like motorbike chases down subway tunnels, infiltrating Pirate Caves, and hitching rides on helicopters, it’s impressive how much variety The Game Kitchen have crammed into the adventure.</p>

<p>So where's the rub? Sadly, the frame rate just isn’t holding 30fps on the Switch 1, even when docked, with judders when there are as few as three on-screen enemies. It’s a shame, since the Switch can ably handle this. It's no dealbreaker, but it's irritating, and hopefully it will be rectified in a future update.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound is the kind of game that makes you want improve. Chaining death with balletic grace feels so liberating that you don’t want to be interrupted in your flow. The way it implements all of its mechanics, along with increasingly interesting, beautiful, and ever-taut stage design, is a treat, and a truly linear arcade-style DLC would be a blessing should one ever transpire. While some Talismans can be purchased to actually make the game harder, the base challenge will certainly test you. It's a real shame about that frame-rate judder, but in terms of seductive 2D Ninja action, it lands squarely on catlike feet. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance</a>, you have been challenged to a duel.</p></section>

<p>Naturally, as is customary in the corporate world, Yuke's is looking to leverage Aquaplus' expertise in the visual novel area in order to reach a new audience, and it'll be putting some of its own development heft behind the studio's ongoing projects.</p>

<p>The aforementioned&nbsp;<em>White Album&nbsp;</em>was unavailable outside of Japan between its original 1998 release and 2023, when it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legendary-visual-novel-white-album-finally-coming-to-steam-with-official-english" rel="nofollow">released for PC via Steam in the West</a>, complete with an all-new official localization.</p>

<p><em>ToHeart</em>, meanwhile, was remade earlier this year for PC and Switch, and the new version boasts all-new 3D scenes, improved visuals and gameplay, and a new set of voiceovers, although you can also choose to switch to the original cast if you prefer.</p>

<p>As for Yuke's, you probably know the studio's name best from the&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K&nbsp;</em>series, for which it was responsible between its inception in 2000 through to 2018, at which point 2K subsidiary Visual Concepts took over the series (with what can best be described as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wwe-2k20-ps4-refunds-being-issued-to-unhappy-customers" rel="nofollow">mixed results to start with</a>).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wwe-2k18-yukes-aquaplus.jpg?itok=TTV6fN4N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wwe-2k18-yukes-aquaplus.jpg?itok=7_Y1SvRD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yuke's stewarded the&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K&nbsp;</em>franchise until 2018.</figcaption></figure><p>Following the&nbsp;<em>WWE 2K&nbsp;</em>franchise switching to Visual Concepts, Yuke's worked on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/aew-game-reveals-2-new-wrestlers-officially-named-aew-fight-forever" rel="nofollow">the official AEW tie-in game&nbsp;<em>AEW: Fight Forever</em></a>, and the studio is also responsible for this year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/double-dragon-revive-announcement" rel="nofollow">upcoming beat-'em-up&nbsp;<em>Double Dragon Revive</em></a>.</p>

<p>You may also know Yuke's from its work on the&nbsp;<em>Earth Defense Force&nbsp;</em>franchise; the developer worked on spinoffs like the&nbsp;<em>World Brothers&nbsp;</em>sub-series and 2019's&nbsp;<em>Iron Rain</em>.</p>

<p>Whether or not the acquisition of Aquaplus by Yuke's results in a change in either studio's operations remains to be seen, but I'd imagine it'll be business as usual. Stay tuned for more.</p>

              <p>Nintendo <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-hike-nintendo-inflation-tariffs-2000614220">quietly raised the price</a> of almost every piece of gaming hardware and accessory it sells over the weekend, with the Switch 2 itself being one of the few exceptions. <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1951281524642386119">Some experts</a> believe it’s only a matter of time before the <em>Mario Kart World</em> machine gets more expensive too, thanks to <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-preorder-tariff-price-trump-nintendo-1851775491">ongoing tariffs</a>, but for now here’s the full list of all of Nintendo’s latest price hikes on 8-year-old consoles and more that went into effect starting August 3.</p> <h2>Consoles</h2> <ul> <li>Switch Lite: $230 (was $200)</li> <li>Switch Standard: $340 (was $300)</li> <li>Switch OLED: $400 (was $350)</li> </ul> <h2>Controllers</h2> <ul> <li>NES Switch Online: $70 (was $60)</li> <li>SNES Switch Online: $30 (was $35</li> <li>Genesis Switch Online: $55 (was $50)</li> <li>N64 Switch Online: $55 (was $50)</li> <li>GameCube Switch Online: $70 (was $65)</li> <li>Switch 1 Joy-Con: $90 (was $80)</li> <li>Switch 1 Pro: $80 (was $70)</li> <li>Switch 2 Joy-Con: $95 (was $90)</li> <li>Switch 2 Pro: $90 (was $85)</li> </ul> <h2>Other accessories</h2> <ul> <li>Amiibo: $20 (was $16)</li> <li>Switch 2 Dock: $125 (was $120)</li> </ul> <p>The Switch 2 has escaped the latest round of price increases for now and still sits at $450. If anything, the latest move should help spur more people to upgrade now that the older consoles are closer in price and the Switch 2 is only likely to go up in price rather than down as was common in previous console generations. The impact of <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-trump-tariffs-china-nintendo-sony-1851704901">President Trump’s trade war tariffs</a> on accessories, however, is particularly rough. Controllers tend to break more quickly than the consoles themselves (especially if you have small kids). This is already the second price hike the Switch 2 Joy-Con and controller have received this year. Both are now more expensive than even the Switch 2’s priciest games. I’ll be taking extra special care of mine.</p>

			<p>Out of all the promising indie horror games both in the works and recently released, Heartworm stands out due to taking influence from Fatal Frame alongside the more usual Silent Hill and Resident Evil inspirations. This stems in part from the use of a camera as your main weapon, but also from the sense of unease and spectral enemies. Having enjoyed the demo last year, the full game is another stellar indie horror to add to the growing pantheon.</p>
<p><iframe title="Heartworm | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t-ckqEK89Ws?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Unlike the usual viral incident or plague of horrors, Heartworm features a far more individual and internalised narrative. Sam, mourning the loss of her grandfather, is thrust into a static-filled TV in a classic ‘isekai’ story and finds herself confronting traumatic memories and environments constructed from her worst fears and insecurities. This all adds up to a horror that is concerned with trauma and grief rather than conspiracies and secretive institutions – another way in which Heartworm is far closer to Silent Hill than Resident Evil.</p>


<p>The aesthetic of Heartworm is clearly inspired by the crunchy polygons of the original PlayStation and that graphical style is absolutely perfectly suited to both the survival horror genre and the nostalgic tone of this game in particular. There is an option to activate a graphical smoother, but this feels like a betrayal of the developer’s visual intention to my eyes. Backgrounds are often atmospherically indistinct, but there is a good variety of locations from abandoned schools and hospitals to a disorientating hedge maze.</p>


<p>Sam is far from the usual survival horror protagonist. Neither a highly trained special forces operative nor a depressed divorced dad, instead she is a smart and witty character who takes incredible events in her stride but is clearly working through some difficult memories. Her hipster appearance makes her ideally suited to a game that is in and of itself a meta study of nostalgia and the toxic way in which unresolved traumas can fester and become dangerously all-consuming.</p>
<p>Your camera is the only weapon at your disposal and is used to fend off enemies, but fighting is mostly a last resort outside of boss encounters and certain foes that trap you in a ring of rocks. Instead you’ll mostly find that running from monsters is the most effective and efficient approach – theres are the traditional limitations on ammo and resources here. There is a burst mod accessory you can attach to your camera, though it feels as if more should have been included to vary your offence. When using your camera, the perspective switches to an over-the-shoulder one which makes aiming more accurate and contrasts nicely with the traditional fixed camera perspective of the rest of the game.</p>

<p>The fixed camera perspective works in setting the mood and tone whilst traditional tank controls work perfectly – although modern options are available for those with an aversion to them. My only real complaint with the camera is that the view is a little too zoomed out and it can be difficult to make out what is happening at times. This was exacerbated when playing on Steam Deck; it works fin, but I found navigation easier on the larger screen, especially in some of the darker environments.</p>
<p>Exploring the various areas in the game involves the usual mixture of puzzles, locked doors, and riddles to solve. Whilst many of these are very traditional they are all well judged and offer the right amount of challenge and difficulty. Making sure that you collect all notes is essential as clues are hidden throughout them, from keywords to number combinations and even, in one memorable case, a sequence of keys to play on a piano. Navigating each zone is helped by an easily read map, which also features a welcome visual cue as to whether a room is completed, but I did find the wilderness level with its similar looking routes more difficult to navigate than the more contained urban environments.</p>

<p>The most memorable moments in Heartworm are some thrilling boss battles against horrific foes ranging from giant spiders (thankfully there is an arachnophobia toggle) and mutated deer to a nightmarish being made entirely of unspooled VHS tapes. These battles will test your reactions and movement as well as involving some puzzle elements. As resources are limited you’ll find it useful to hoard some healing items for these encounters in particular. Whilst there is a limited inventory I never found this to be an issue as items are usually picked up and used relatively close together. The exceptions here are some items that I never found a use for, which may well be linked to a secret ending.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Heartworm is another top notch indie horror to add to the collection and one that perhaps feels the closest to the games that clearly influence it. The mixture of Fatal Frame combat and Silent Hill gameplay is perfectly judged and the end result is a game that not only pays homage to the classics but deserves to be considered amongst them.	</p></div>

			<p>A new Stellar Blade patch is now available on PC, introducing Photo Mode improvements as well as gameplay, cutscenes, and AMD FSR fixes and changes.</p>



<p>The 1.3.0 patch, which has gone live today, focuses on further polishing the PC version of the game released in June, and thus doesn't introduce any significant new features. Among the changes introduced by the patch is a Photo Mode improvement which displays a logo control indicator when selecting a logo, fixes for a variety of issues, including an issue that prevented players from exiting the shop after purchasing the Polarized Sunglasses from Clyde's shop, an issues where Eve's hair would not appear during the final Elder Naytibe cutscene when wearing the Fluffy Bear or Pink Bear outfits, Korean voice acting issues in a specific conversation with Clyde in the Great Desert and more. The new patch also changes AMD FSR so that players now need to restart the game to enable frame generation, and improves the save timestamp system so that the time since the last save is accurately displayed based on successful saves and not attempted saves. You can head over <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3489700/view/535482242423588652?l=english">here</a> to check out the full patch notes.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade made its debut on PC one year after its launch on PlayStation 5 and it was, by all accounts, a rather successful launch, thanks to a solid port that runs well on many different system configurations. Though the port didn't need any major fixes, Shift Up supported the PC version wellafter launch with a few patches, including patch <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc-1-20-patch-hard-mode-improves-vram/">1.2.0</a>, which introduced plenty of improvements and unlocked Hard Mode without completing the game first.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the solid action RPG developed by Shift Up by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>According to a new report, a&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>remake that was in development at publisher 2K has been canceled, and the long-awaited&nbsp;<em>BioShock 4&nbsp;</em>is currently struggling due to problems with its story.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-01/next-bioshock-game-changes-leaders-after-development-turmoil" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, a remake of the original&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>was being developed at 2K Games, although which development subsidiary was to handle the project is unclear. That's moot now, though, of course, since the project has been shut down.</p>

<p>Not only that, but <i>BioShock 4</i>, which was announced all the way back in late 2019 (and which has been rumored to take place in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioshock-4-rumored-to-be-set-in-1960s-antarctica" rel="nofollow">Antarctica in the 1960s</a>), has run into its own spot of bother, with senior 2K executives reportedly unhappy with the direction of the game's story.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bioshock-remake-canceled-big-daddy.jpg?itok=gPy7-qSH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bioshock-remake-canceled-big-daddy.jpg?itok=_5EMe5sX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>An in-development&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>remake has apparently been canceled.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Schreier's report, a recent internal review concerning&nbsp;<em>BioShock 4&nbsp;</em>at 2K resulted in executives expressing dismay with the narrative chosen by developer Cloud Chamber, although it's not clear exactly what they were displeased with.</p>

<p>As a result of that review, however, Kelley Gilmore was ousted from her role at the top of Cloud Chamber, and Hogarth de la Plante, who was previously serving as&nbsp;<em>BioShock 4</em>'s creative director, will now serve in what Schreier calls "a publishing role".</p>

<p>Additionally, Cloud Chamber staffers were reportedly told by 2K that their studio needs to become "more agile and efficient" (that's Bloomberg's wording), which sounds like prime corporate speak for impending staff cuts.</p>

<p>2K told Bloomberg that while the current iteration of&nbsp;<em>BioShock 4&nbsp;</em>is "good", the publisher is "committed to delivering a great [game]", and that it's currently "working closely with [Cloud Chamber] leadership" to achieve this goal.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bioshock-remake-canceled-infinite.jpg?itok=v2_teEk0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bioshock-remake-canceled-infinite.jpg?itok=oTFgO7BY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>BioShock Infinite&nbsp;</em>remains the last mainline entry in the&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>series for now.</figcaption></figure><p>Since&nbsp;<em>BioShock 4&nbsp;</em>is struggling and the&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>remake has been canned, it looks like&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>fans' next great hope is&nbsp;<em>Judas</em>, Ken Levine and Ghost Story Games' upcoming narrative FPS.</p>

<p>Sadly, that game doesn't have a release date yet, so for now, it seems as though you'll have to content yourself with replaying the existing&nbsp;<em>BioShock&nbsp;</em>games. Stay tuned for more.</p>
