<p>The Halo Championship Series’ Salt Lake City Major is here and the best teams in the world are fighting for the lion’s share of a $250,000 prize pool. It’s the final Major before the Halo World Championship takes place in Seattle, and some of the biggest names in gaming have taken to the stage.</p>



<p>As the Pool Play round unravels, the likes of Spacestation and Complexity are skyrocketing up the charts, closely followed by Shopify Rebellion and FaZe Clan. It’s the usual suspects, of course – but OpTic Gaming, ITB, and Pure aren’t far behind.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-underdog-spirit">Underdog Spirit</h2>



<p>Surprisingly, it isn’t just the big players that are aiming for the top spot in Salt Lake City. There’s an underdog force in the form of Alpha Esports, a South American squad with nothing but the most minor wins under its belt. The squad came up through the Open Bracket, which consisted of 64 teams whittled down to just four.</p>



<p>In Pool A, Alpha Esports has already beaten Ascending Baseline and Sentinels, losing only against a dominant Spacestation side. That’s enough to give the team qualification to the next stage.</p>



<p>This short-form tournament wraps up tomorrow, but there’s enough action being packed into that tight schedule to keep Halo fans the world over entertained.</p>



<p>At this point, the top eight teams remaining in the competition will land qualification for the Halo World Championship, and the top team will net 100,000 HCS points <strong>and </strong>the $100,000 grand prize. </p>



<p>In July, Spacestation claimed the win at the Atlanta Major, beating OpTic Gaming in a tense grand final, and before that, FaZe hit the top spot in London, again beating OpTic in the grand final. In March, Spacestation secured yet another trophy, beating… You guessed it – OpTic Gaming in the grand final.</p>



<p>OpTic Gaming hasn’t secured a win in the HCS since last September, so this event marks a year since the team picked up a victory. In October, it’ll be a year since FaZe Clan won the Halo World Championship, leaving OpTic Gaming in… Second place.</p>



<p>Will OpTic Gaming finally lift a trophy in Salt Lake City?</p>



<p>Will Alpha Esports defy the odds and produce a win?</p>



<p>Or will Spacestation continue a dominant spree and win for the third time this season?</p>



<p>Stay tuned to Insider Gaming for all the latest.</p>

<p>Astro Bot is taking the PlayStation world by storm. It provides a fun experience from the start that capitalizes on what we love most about video games. But as of right now, it’s only available on PS5. Many people are out there anxiously watching everyone else have fun, waiting for their turn. So, will Astro Bot come to PC?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-astro-bot-launching-on-pc">Is Astro Bot Launching on PC?</h2>



<p>As of right now, there is no official word on whether Astro Bot will launch on PC. If you look back at Astro’s Playroom, it remained a PlayStation-exclusive title, never released on PC like many other Sony titles. However, in recent years, we’ve seen PlayStation making a massive push to capitalize on the PC gaming market by launching its titles on Steam. They’ve had immense success in doing so, too.</p>



<p>One of the most significant selling points of the Astro titles is in its DualSense functionality, but that’s no longer an issue on PC, as you can connect a PS5 controller and play PlayStation titles via Steam without any problem. There’s really nothing holding the team back from launching on PC besides a push to sell systems.</p>



<p>Furthermore, regarding hype from PC players, studio director Nicolas Doucet said, “We want to hear from you. Absolutely. We want to hear from you.” It’s entirely possible that Astro Bot comes to PC in the near future!</p>







<h2 id="h-could-high-astro-bot-sales-lead-to-a-pc-launch">Could High Astro Bot Sales Lead to a PC Launch?</h2>



<p>It’s entirely possible, and highly likely, that if Astro Bot sales continue to skyrocket, PlayStation may wish to push into additional markets and systems by launching the game on Steam. However, they typically launch on Valve’s digital storefront many months, if not years, after the initial release on PlayStation systems. </p>



<p>Just recently, it came to light that Astro Bot sales were so high that it’s the best-selling retail game on Amazon and completely sold out on Amazon Japan!</p>

The platformer pays tribute to PlayStation’s past with cute little robot cameos representing nearly every video game hero from every era remotely associated with the brand. It was more or less a guided tour through the legacy of one of the big three, and after the PS4 solidified Sony as top dog in the console landscape, I was certainly in the mood to look back at how we got here when the PS5 launched in 2020.

<p>Popular creators and Fortnite competitors, Sommerset and BlakePS shared their thoughts just before the beginning of the Fortnite Global Championship 2024. With the best Fortnite players in the world competing against each other in Texas, both of the popular creators gave some valuable insight heading into the tournament.</p>



<h2 id="h-blakeps-gives-his-insight-on-what-competing-in-person-is-like">BlakePS Gives His Insight On What Competing In-Person Is Like</h2>



<p>If you have been a part of the Fortnite scene for a while, you understand that BlakePS is one of the G.O.A.T.S. The player has been around for quite some time now, cementing himself as a top competitor in Fortnite history. Now, sitting back and taking on the role of a spectator, Blake gave his insight into what it is like to compete in person.</p>



<p>“Most of these pros on this stage are experienced,” said Blake when being interviewed by popular Fortnite-personality, Leven2k. “I don’t think the nerves are really affecting them.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Blake, in the past, has competed in various LAN events, giving him the experience many gamers long for going into large tournaments as such.</p>



<p>“And for the new-timers, like the one-time LAN qualifiers, they are going to feel it for the first game dropping in, but once they land on that map, they are going to be good. The nerves are gone. They’re locked in. They are ready to win.”</p>



<p>With Fortnite having one of the youngest competitor bases out there, many of these newcomers are still in their mid-teens, making this easily the biggest event they have ever presented themselves in front of others for.</p>



<h2 id="h-sommerset-exclaims-her-excitement-for-globals-and-her-own-upcoming-fortnite-event">Sommerset Exclaims her Excitement For Globals And Her Own Upcoming Fortnite Event</h2>



<p>Alongside BlakePS was the popular Fortnite streamer, Sommerset, who shared her excitement going into Fortnite Globals and talked a bit about her own event coming up.</p>



<p>“Stressed, happy, excited; I don’t know. All of those emotions, I guess,” said Sommerset when discussing Globals and her very own upcoming Fortnite tournament.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>But aside from the stress, Sommerset made sure to talk about how ecstatic she has been about the current Globals event. </p>



<p>“It’s been amazing. Meeting the fans at the event has been a surreal experience. I couldn’t expect anything more.”</p>



<p>With the event being underway, many more creators are in attendance, such as SypherPK, Lachlan and more. </p>

            <p>The developer behind NetEase's survival free-to-play horror, Once Human, says the feedback it's received about the game's second season has been "quite demoralising".</p>
<p>In a statement posted to the team's Discord server, the team said that it "value[s players'] opinions" and hopes to "fulfil all [player] requests in future updates" but stopped short of detailing what these may be.</p>

<p>The team did, however, address two immediate issues.</p>
<p>"Since the start of Season 2, we've received a lot of feedback," the team admitted. "Some of it has been quite demoralising, but what's important is that it's made us aware of how your experience has been affected by the changes we've made. We want to discuss some of these issues today.</p>
<p>"We value your opinions and hope that we'll be able to fulfil all of your requests in future updates. Our development team is making optimisations in response to two major issues that players have raised, which we'd like your feedback on as well!"</p>
<p>The two issues Starry Studio indentifies concern weapon builds and scenario tags, acknowledging that some players thought they were "designed poorly" whilst others complain that there weren't enough high-difficulty tags in the first place.</p>
<p>To combat the former, the team is introducing a blueprint conversion system that essentially permits players to switch armour and weapon ratings, enabling them to better tailor their loadout to their playstyles.</p>
<p>The latter requires a little more thought, however, which is why Starry Studio is inviting players to complete yet another survey to help them better ascertain what players are after.</p>
<p>I gave <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/once-human-review">Once Human a modest three out of five stars when I reviewed it last month for Eurogamer</a>, saying it offers a deeply moreish open world scavenge-em-up, but weak action and generic clutter hold it back. Since launch, however, NetEase has ramped up its premium in-game offerings, including cosmetic loot crates.</p>
<p>"Not for one moment did I expect a F2P live service offering to be anything other than an unmitigated slog stuffed with the pitfalls and unforced errors of every other game I started and stopped playing, so wildly over-saturated is this genre. But here I am, late at night again, fashioning myself a Slippery When Wet sign to put beside my water tank."</p>
<p>In related news, the Once Human team is set to begin testing its mobile port on 19th September. It's unclear if the mobile version supports crossplay, but it seems unlikely given <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/once-humans-latest-patch-is-here-but-controller-support-still-isnt">Once Human doesn't even support controllers</a> or Steam cloud yet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/forever-winter-solo/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Whenever there’s a new extraction shooter on the horizon, there’s a single question that many ask. Can you play solo? Despite the core concept of most extraction shooters revolving around squad play, a rather large and growing number of players don’t want to deal with a teammate. It’s an additional risk. Will they shoot you in the back for your loot? Will they hold you back? So, can you play The Forever Winter solo?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-solo-play-viable-in-the-forever-winter">Is Solo Play Viable in The Forever Winter?</h2>



<p>Unlike many of the more hardcore extraction shooters, which either force you to play with a squad or deter you from going at it solo, The Forever Winter hopes to capitalize on numerous play styles and preferences. Playing solo in The Forever Winter from day one will be entirely viable, with players able to tackle all of the game’s missions and objectives without needing a human party.</p>



<p>In fact, during a recent AMA on Discord, developer Fun Dog Studios said that you can play the entire game solo, and sometimes you can get away with tackling a raid without ever firing a single shot. It’s a viable play style and one some of the developers in the studio often utilize.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-hire-ai-companions-in-the-forever-winter">Can You Hire AI Companions in The Forever Winter?</h2>



<p>To ensure you’re not at a severe disadvantage when playing The Forever Winter alone, a mechanic in-game on day one allows solo players to hire recruits. These recruits are companion NPCs that follow your orders. You can command them to defend a specific spot, follow you, stay in place, or attack an enemy. </p>



<p>They stated that these “AI buddies” would be available <em>from time to time</em> when you cannot or don’t want to match with other players. I’m curious to see if this is a mechanic you can utilize every raid or if there’s a cooldown.</p>



<hr>



<p>Now that you know you can play the game solo, is The Forever Winter on your radar? If it is, you might want to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-forever-winter-system-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out the game’s system requirements</a> first!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24237778/astro-bot-review-ps5-game-of-the-year<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>It is 9PM, and all I want to do is sleep. I barely have the energy to speak, let alone play a video game. But I have a job to do, and it’s reviewing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24167370/astro-bot-ps5-sequel-trailer-date"><em>Astro Bot</em> by its release date</a>, so I make a deal with myself to play just two levels, then go to bed…</p><p>Five hours later, my face burns from smiling. I’m convinced I could build, then run through, a brick wall. That’s the type of way <em>Astro Bot</em> will make you feel.</p><p><em>Astro Bot</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/5/24237166/astro-bots-roll-out">out now on PlayStation 5</a>, is a collect-a-thon platformer. You play as the robot Astro adventuring in space in his PS5-shaped mothership with 300 of his friends — some of them simple bots, others robot-ified versions of famous video game characters. Suddenly, he’s attacked by an unsubtle-as-hell Xbox-green alien monster who trashes his ship and scatters its parts and his 300 friends to far corners of the universe.</p><p><em>Astro Bot</em> is filled with standard platformer tropes, but it pulls off a sense of wonder in their presentation. As you explore galaxies to find your fellow robots and unlock new parts of the game, you’ll find a lot of familiar elements, only to see them executed in quirky and delightful ways. Just about every platformer has an ability that lets you shoot across longer distances, but none of them let you do it by strapping a bulldog to your back.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>The bulldog power-up acts like a rocket to propel you across big gaps.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Team Asobi</cite></p></div><p>The different levels Astro explores have themes that you’d expect. There’s a jungle planet, a volcano planet, and worlds of pirates, ghosts, and gardeners. Some worlds require special powers to navigate, and those, too, are pretty standard in function if not in form. The monkey power-up lets you scale walls, while the mouse ability shrinks you down to access tiny spaces. There’s even a <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>-esque F.L.U.D.D power that uses liquid to move Astro around.</p><div><p>I’m convinced I could build, then run through, a brick wall. That’s the type of way <em>Astro Bot</em> will make you feel</p></div><p>The developers at Team Asobi didn’t reinvent the platforming wheel here, but like any good platformer, it’s the unique ways the powers are used that make them special. Instead of water, that F.L.U.D.D. power-up sucks up a green goo it then spits out to create platforms of grass. I giggled like a toddler using it to defeat a special enemy by literally sucking its green, goopy brains out.&nbsp;</p><p>One power-up —&nbsp;which I won’t describe beyond saying it’s <em>really cute</em> since figuring it out is a big part of the fun here —&nbsp;truly captures the essence of <em>Astro Bot</em>. When I first found it, I could not understand it at all. It seemed useless; I felt silly for getting stumped by what had been, up until that point, an incredibly simple game. And unlike with most of my pickups, the game wouldn’t help me. <em>Astro Bot</em> typically displays a little tutorial box for how to use it, but this time, it deliberately left me hanging. Playing a game is like being in a conversation with its developers without the ability to speak directly, and it felt like communication had broken down.</p><p>But then I remembered that communication between player and developer is not only what to do but also what to <em>feel. </em>And<em> </em>suddenly, it felt like they were hovering just over my shoulder, holding back their laughter as a dear friend would while they waited for me to get a joke. They’d intentionally held back an explanation because they wanted me to experience the feeling of figuring it out for myself. They wanted me to laugh, like I suspect they did when designing it.</p><p>And when I finally got it, the jolt of understanding was so friggin’ powerful that I laughed myself into spontaneous sobbing saying aloud to no one, “<em>Astro Bo</em>t, I would <em>die</em> for you.”&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>He gets by with a little help from his PlayStation friends.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Team Asobi</cite></p></div><p>There are so many moments exactly like that. I thought bots you rescued were simply currency used to advance to the next level, only to realize that in the game’s hub world, they’re your friends putting their very bodies on the line to help you access even more collectibles. Some distinctive PlayStation-themed bots —&nbsp;think one wearing Aloy’s red hair or Kratos’ beard — serve a more special purpose. When you rescue them, they can give you that character’s power and take you to a special level modeled on a game like <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> or <em>Uncharted</em>, so detailed that they’ll even include side quests from the original. And I defy you to feel something other than the warmest nostalgia during the final boss fight and credits sequence — I didn’t know just how much emotion a PlayStation Move controller could make me feel.</p><p>From my <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/19/24180304/summer-game-fest-2024-best-games">two-hour demo at Summer Game Fest</a> earlier this year, I knew <em>Astro Bot</em> would be something special. It was a simple, joyous little platformer crafted as a celebration of PlayStation’s past. And if that’s all it was, it’d make for a great little pit stop on the 2024 game calendar as we travel toward the bigger, more anticipated releases like <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard, Echoes of Wisdom</em>, and <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>.</p><p>But <em>Astro Bot</em> is so much more than a mascot platformer plucked from the late ’90s and retooled for modern audiences and hardware. It is the kind of game that reminds us why video games exist in the first place: love. (Yeah, I know that sounds corny — but I’m serious.) <em>Astro Bot</em> exemplifies the great love that compels us to play, make, write about, and share video games with our friends and family. Even if it will keep you up way past your bedtime.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>EVERSPACE 2 developer ROCKFISH Games, being headquartered in Hamburg, couldn't very well pass up on the Cologne-based Gamescom, especially since they've got the Titans DLC coming up soon. Due to launch on September 16 across all platforms (PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X) for a price tag of $15, this is the first story DLC for the space combat game that was fully <a href="https://wccftech.com/everspace-2-1-0-release-date-post-launch-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> in 2023.</p>
<p>I caught up with ROCKFISH Games CEO and Co-Founder Michael Schade and Communications Manager Lee Guille to learn more about EVERSPACE 2: Titans and to discuss various aspects of the industry, from their experience upgrading to Unreal Engine 5 to Game Pass and Early Access.</p>
<p><iframe title="EVERSPACE 2 | TITANS DLC Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bvnx2lp7sik?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Can you give us an overview of the upcoming DLC?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lee Guille: </strong>Sure. EVERSPACE 2: Titans is our first story and gameplay DLC. This is going to be approximately an 8-hour experience with two different storylines. One features the Dreadnought, where players will chase this capital ship, which they will attack multiple times as they progress through the storyline. The second part is Leviathan. In the base game, we teased this creature many times with these bones found in planetary and orbital locations, so we have a new storyline that involves tracking down this creature and then getting swallowed.</p>
<p>This is also going to play into the ongoing storyline with the Redeemers, these cultists that exist in one part of space. You're going to be chasing down sightings of this creature alongside a new character. You'll have to blow up some of these cloud grades or creatures, which are one of the creature types that the Leviathan feeds on.</p>
<p>The idea here is to get yourself covered in this gross musk that the Redeemers are also harvesting, so during these experiences, you'll be fighting them off, too. There's meant to be quite a few of them out there so that every time you have an encounter with them, it's going to be different. The innards are procedurally generated. These biological environments are something that our players have never seen before. We've always been very space, very tech, very ruins-heavy. With the Leviathan, you're going to be flying inside. Each time is going to be different because it's a series of combat encounters, puzzle rooms, etc.</p>
<p>The first time you go through, it's a bit of a guided encounter through the story where you'll be fighting parasites, sometimes these drones left behind by the Redeemer cultists, and all sorts of other scary creatures down there. The objective is to go down, find lots of loot on the way, but also harvest a pearl that is at the end of the Leviathan. This kind of encounter is really appealing to players because they'll be able to do it different ways at different times and also find new resources and loot, so craftables, new consumables, new resources and all sorts of cool stuff. This puzzle here, for example, is you have to find the perfect shot and then take out all the living strands to be able to to open the door.</p>
<p><strong>Do you fight any enemies inside them?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lee Guille:</strong> Absolutely. you'll be encountering all sorts of things. In addition to more mechanical enemies like the Redeemer drones, there's parasites, they're these armored barnacle-type creatures. Then there are these worms that players have seen before that sort of stick a tongue out, grab your ship, and then drag it in. As you venture inside, you'll find these imperfect pearls which will have different types of loot inside that's all randomized. Also, when you're outside of the tutorial experience, you have an agitation bar, so it pushes the players to move through the Leviathan experience quickly and also shoot accurately because if you're hitting everything, the Leviathan will want to vomit you up, and if that happens you have to begin again.</p>
<p><strong>Are these two storylines connected in any way?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lee Guille:</strong> They're actually separate. At no point will you have the Leviathan fighting Dreadnought, although that would be super cool. I did ask the team if we could do it, and they said no, maybe in the future. Probably not.</p>
<p>They're like two different episodes. Both of these occur midway through the main storyline of EVERSPACE 2, so it's not postgame content; it's midgame content. Players who have finished the game can go back and find the storyline, start them, play through them, or start a new story and go from there.</p>
<p><strong>How much is EVERSPACE 2 Titans going to cost players?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lee Guille: </strong>The DLC will cost $15. We are sensitive to the costs of players around the world. We typically use the Steam recommended prices, but we also do manual shifts. This is all coming out on September 16, so it's very soon.</p>
<p><strong>I believe that the game was recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/dlss-3-and-unreal-engine-5s-lumen-gi-added-to-everspace-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">upgraded</a> to Unreal Engine 5. Was it hard to do that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade:</strong> Yeah, it took us about six months or so. If you do such a major step from one engine to another, a lot of things break. Everything is fixable, of course, but you have to go into it. On the plus side, we didn't expect that Lumen is pretty much flipping a switch, changing some parameters, and it works right out of the box. That was great and it definitely looks better, especially if you have these bouncing light effects, so that was a big plus.</p>
<p>We saw a performance hit, so we had to go back into the performance optimization, some things that otherwise we might not have done. Now, we are pretty much where we left off, although not on all systems. It's just that the way Unreal Engine 5 handles these things is slightly different than Unreal Engine 4. This is why you see a performance hit. But other than that, the strategy was, since we have so much more content coming to EVERSPACE 2 down the line and possibly new platforms are coming. That's why we said we want the game on the latest engine to make it future-proof.</p>
<p><strong>Lee Guille:</strong> To speak to Lumen for a moment, we did work very closely with the Unreal Epic team to try and make sure that everything could work. Initially, our team said nah, Lumen's too hard, but as Michael said, it was just the flick of a switch and then going back and making sure that everything looks good again. The team has optimization at the top of their minds. It's very important to them, and we realized, as Michael said, we had a bit of a performance hit. So we're continuing to update, and hopefully, when Titans comes out, we will have an update that will help out some of our players across all the platforms.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade:</strong> That being said, we don't have that many complaints about slightly lesser performance, to be honest. The vast majority of our users understand why we made the change. They'd rather take more content than worry about maybe 10% less performance. We actually had a pretty long blog post on the game's website about this whole porting process, the things that it broke, and how we fixed them. But overall, we're really pleased about how it went, and it's also preparation for whatever you do afterward. You make yourself familiar with the new tech; that's always a good thing.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We didn't expect that Lumen is pretty much flipping a switch, changing some parameters, and it works right out of the box. That was great and it definitely looks better, especially if you have these bouncing light effects.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You said there was a performance hit when you brought EVERSPACE 2 to Unreal Engine 5. Was it more noticeable on certain platforms? Is it more of an issue on consoles?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade: </strong>It's more on weaker systems. I just talked to the people from Engine Software who did the console ports for us, and they said that there are certain things that allow better visuals, but they come at a price. That shows, in particular, on the systems on the lower end of the hardware spectrum. If you have a mid-to-high-end PC, then you don't see it. In fact, on some systems, we saw even better performance. If you crank up all the effects with Unreal Engine 5, it runs better than on Unreal Engine 4.</p>
<p><strong>Perhaps it scales better to powerful hardware. Anyway, Lumen also offers the option to augment quality by taking advantage of hardware ray tracing. Is that something you might enable?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade: </strong>The thing is, we tested hardware ray tracing when the game was on Unreal Engine 4 and found it didn't do much for us because if you fly through space and something reflects on the spaceship, you don't really see if it's super accurate or using screen space global illumination, and the reflections are so convincing. We rather take the cheaper, less performance-heavy technology.</p>
<p>It still looks amazing. I think it would be different if you have a first-person shooter where you walk inside of a building; then, you can tell if these reflections are really accurate if there's a water surface. But we don't have this in many places, so this is one of the reasons why we don't use ray tracing. And then the other is, since we're using volumetric fog for gameplay (we're hiding things in the fog), at least back then, ray tracing didn't work in conjunction with volumetric clouds.</p>
<p><strong>You plan to do more DLCs for EVERSPACE 2 after Titans, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade: </strong>Yeah, there's one more coming out for this one next year. We will share more info in 2025.</p>
<p><strong>Lee Guille: </strong>I think the only thing we can say right now is that it's going to be more story-driven and much, much bigger than what Titans is.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade: </strong>We did say there would be new star systems and stories. We will also add a new player ship and a new campaign.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Next year's DLC will be much bigger than Titans, adding new star systems, a new player ship, and a new campaign.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>EVERSPACE 2: Titans is more about side content, as I understand it. Will the next big story DLC move the campaign forward?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade: </strong>Could be. I can't say now.</p>
<p><strong>Lee Guille: </strong>Yep, if we share too much, our creative director will skin me alive because he pays the bill. But Titans is also going to introduce new set items, new consumables, more legendaries, and a couple of new types of weapons. There's a lot of hints in there, a lot of Easter eggs to some of ROCKFISH's past, so I think that longtime fans of the EVERSPACE series and other space games are going to enjoy this.</p>
<p><strong>EVERSPACE 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/everspace-2-is-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-for-pc-on-october-21-full-release-delayed-to-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has been on Game Pass</a> for a while, right? There is a bit of a debate in that some developers are pro-Game Pass, while others are not so favorable on the subscription service. What was your experience with it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade: </strong>We love Game Pass. It helped us achieve one of our best years ever and it really allowed us, because of the way Game Pass works (if you're in Game Preview, you get a chunk of money for game preview, and then we get some kind of money for a 1.0), the first chunk really allowed us in combination with revenue from Steam and other platforms to continue working on the base game for another year and make a better game. Game Pass is good for everybody. Even people on PlayStation got a better game because of our deal with Microsoft.</p>
<p><strong>So you don't think it hurt full-game sales in your case?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade: </strong>This is what you get the money for, right? It's not like it sits in a subscription and you sell the same amount of copies as if it's not. But this is why Microsoft pays you, and we were very happy with the deal. It was fantastic. If Microsoft is interested in future content, we're very open to having a continued discussion. In fact, I analyzed when EVERSPACE 2 went on Game Pass for PC. We didn't see a decline in Steam sales. This is what those developers are worried about, but we don't see any sign of slowing down sales; it's rather the opposite. Because of the extra visibility from Game Pass, more people picked it up on Steam, and we saw a spike in sales.</p>
<p><strong>Lee Guille: </strong>I do want to echo what Michael said there about visibility. It would be very hard to get that same level of marketing because the Xbox team was fantastic in showing the game, making sure that we were represented on their platforms and just making whole new fans of EVERSPACE.</p>
<p><strong>It's a win-win.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade: </strong>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Lee Guille: </strong>In our situation, absolutely.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade: </strong>For us, it's a perfect combination. Early access first with our early adopters who want to be part of the journey and help us make the best game we can possibly do. We make some money off that, substantially, actually, and then we add Game Pass, and on PlayStation, we just sell the game with the classic model. So it works. It is very different, but they work together, it's not like those business models cannibalize each other.</p>
<p><strong>EVERSPACE 2 was in early access for quite a while, as you just noted. Of course, you said there will be more DLCs after Titans, but eventually, you will make another game. Do you plan to keep using the early access model, or would you rather go with a full launch immediately?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade: </strong>Well, I've been on record saying I will never do a game without going through early access. We're so happy with this model because, honestly, locking yourself in for five years (this is how long it takes to make a really high-end AA game), you just don't know if you are making the right game and what the fans say about it. The financial component is one thing, but the most important part of early access for us is whether we are making the right game. Is the community excited about it, are there any things that we really need to address and need to change? With EVERSPACE 2, there are a couple of things that we changed for the better because of community feedback, and this helped us have a really solid 1.0 release because, after being tested for more than two years by some 200K pilots, you get the feedback you need.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned other systems coming in the future. One of these is a Nintendo platform. Are you potentially looking to port EVERSPACE 2 to the so-called Switch 2?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade: </strong>We will absolutely look at it. I wish we knew more. It's so hard to get any info.</p>
<p><strong>It shouldn't be long now, I reckon.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade: </strong>Yeah, we're waiting to hear more about it. Talking with the companies that specialize in porting, even they don't have the specs, so it's all a mystery to us so far. If the hardware is powerful enough, we're definitely interested, but we have to wait and see.</p>
<p><strong>Is EVERSPACE 2 verified for the Steam Deck?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade: </strong>It is not, and I think there are only one or two things that are holding us back. One is that the UI, it's not scalable, and it's really hard for us, because it is such a complex UI. At this point, we might end up in a state where we support the Steam Deck, but it's never going to be verified because reworking the UI would be a huge pain point and might not be worth the hassle. So far, people are happy with how it is, but to get that verified button for such a complex game... If we had designed it from the very beginning, it would have been different, but obviously, when we were making EVERSPACE 2, there was no sign of Steam Deck, and we had to support 720P. It was not in the cards. Now, going back is really hard, so I don't want to make any promises.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We will absolutely look at the Nintendo Switch 2. If the hardware is powerful enough, we're definitely interested, but we have to wait and see. It's so hard to get any info.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What do you think about this trend of PC handhelds? Beyond the Steam Deck, several big manufacturers have entered the market lately.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade: </strong>We love it. My previous studio was a mobile gaming studio. We also made games on mobile, and we love that. We also see other devices, such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-portal-remote-play-device/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Portal</a>, that you just hang out with because your family is playing something else or watching something else on the big screen and you still want to enjoy your game.</p>
<p>I think that's a good use case. The Steam Deck and the Switch are doing great, and I wouldn't be surprised to see more handhelds on both consoles and PCs.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think the game is a good fit for the handheld experience?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Schade: </strong>I think it is because, given our background of making addicting space games on mobile devices, we have a very accessible space combat. Our promise is that when you pick up the game, within a minute, you have an explosion on the screen. The controls are also designed to bring it closer to a shooter experience rather than a space simulator experience. So yeah, I think it's a great fit.</p>
<p><strong>Lee Guille: </strong>To double up on that, there are more than a hundred handcrafted locations in EVERSPACE 2 and most of those more sidey ones you can play through and explore everything in about 20 minutes to half an hour, so it's a great pick up and play type of game.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-has-playstation-finally-found-its-mascot-character<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><em><strong>Spoiler: We mention a few cameos that appear in Astro Bot.</strong></em></p><p>While today PlayStation’s headquarters may be located in San Mateo, California, the history of Sony’s beloved video game console brand started in the early 1990s in Tokyo, Japan. Ken Kutaragi – who would later become known as the father of PlayStation – had been working together with Nintendo on a CD-ROM add-on for the Super Nintendo. When this got canceled, Kutaragi went to Norio Ohga (Sony’s CEO at the time) with the proposal of making Sony’s own console. </p><p>“Do it!” Ohga famously said. As a result, in December 1994 the original PlayStation hit store shelves in Japan.</p><p>While Kutaragi is no longer involved with the PlayStation brand today, his legacy has not been forgotten. At Team Asobi – Sony’s inhouse development studio best known for the Astro Bot series – artwork along the walls depicts PlayStation’s 30-year journey.</p><p>“Do it! Go and make PlayStation. That was the order given to Kutaragi,” says Team Asobi studio director Nicolas Doucet as he shows us around his studio. “Here you can see Kutaragi walking around near Tokyo Tower as he gets struck by an amazing idea of making a 32-bit machine. The rest is history.” </p><p>Needless to say, the original PlayStation was an instant hit. With over 100 million units sold, it won the console war by a large margin against industry veterans Nintendo and Sega. Sony’s PlayStation has been an almost unbeatable brand since, launching some of the most successful consoles of all time. However, there is one department that Sony could never really compete in: coming up with a brand-defining mascot character. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Astro Bot Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><h3>Finding a Mascot</h3><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-doesnt-have-enough-original-franchises-built-from-the-ground-up-executive-says">Sony just never seemed to have an answer</a> to Nintendo’s Mario or Sega’s Sonic the Hedgehog. Crash Bandicoot was an iconic character that was exclusive to the PlayStation at the time, but he belonged to a third-party studio. And while Toro from the Doko Demo Issho series reached mascot-like status in Japan, the cute feline character was hardly known outside of PlayStation’s home country.</p><p>But maybe the PlayStation didn’t need an answer to Nintendo and Sega’s beloved mascots. Games were entering an era in which more realistic human characters like Cloud Strife, Solid Snake and Lara Croft were becoming the new industry icons. As this more mature stream of gaming culture evolved, cutesy mascot characters and the 3D platformers they called home became less and less common. When Microsoft entered the industry with the Xbox in 2001, Halo’s Master Chief instantly shaped the console’s image. Microsoft’s purchase of Rare, a studio that had created platformers with mascot-like characters for Nintendo, almost seemed like an afterthought.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We have to be aware of what makes our platform special, and iterate on that in our games.”</p></div><p>For Nintendo, however, platformers and mascot characters continue to be an essential part of its business and identity. While fans feared that Nintendo could no longer compete during the GameCube era and later the Wii U era, the house of Mario’s inventive spirit allowed it to make multiple comebacks. The combination of beloved characters and playful technology set it apart.</p><p>Today, PlayStation’s cinematic blockbuster titles still mostly cater to a mature audience, but Team Asobi is taking a different approach.  The studio’s roster of delightful robots and the inventive gameplay with which they and players interact    have been compared with the Nintendo way.</p><p>“Given Nintendo’s pop-culture standards, it’s always a nice compliment to be compared with Nintendo, but we don’t think about it too much,” Doucet says.</p><p>In the same way that Nintendo marries inventive hardware with its iconic characters, Doucet says they’re working on highlighting the PlayStation’s unique power. “PlayStation makes very high-spec machines, so we can do more advanced physics as they require a lot of calculation. We have to be aware of what makes our platform special, and iterate on that in our games.”</p><p>But utilizing the uniqueness of hardware is something that Team Asobi has always been good at – arguably more than any other PlayStation studio.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/06/img-20240829-143504-1725657372617.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>At Team Asobi's studio, they love Astro Bot. Credit: Esra Krabbe, IGN Japan</figcaption></figure></output><p>“Originally, we didn’t think that we would go back into making games. We thought that we were going to be a unit that only does R&amp;D,” recalls Doucet. “However, some of our prototypes were received positively internally and we were asked to compile them as a preloaded game on the PS4 for people that have a PlayStation Camera.”</p><p>This became The Playroom, Team Asobi’s first game.The Playroom came preloaded with the PS4 when it launched back in 2013 and functioned as a showcase of what the PlayStation Camera and DualShock 4 controller could do. One of the mini games featured was AR Bots, a tech demo-like experience that made it seem as if 40 little robots were inside the DualShock 4. By swiping the touchpad you could throw them into the room and interact with them through the PlayStation Camera in AR, before sucking them back into the controller.</p><p>“The Playroom is now more than 10 years old, but it still makes people laugh. That’s a good sign, right?” says Doucet.</p><p>“These robots started out as bland white characters that we called AR men. When we were tasked to turn this prototype into an actual experience for players, we had to quickly come up with a character design. The fastest possible route was a robot with a simple nose, mouth and big LED eyes so that we had nothing complicated to animate.”</p><h3>Astro Bot is Born</h3><p>These were the early beginnings of what would one day become <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review">Team Asobi’s trademark character, Astro Bot</a>. While Shigeru Miyamoto designed Mario to match the technical limitations of the time, Astro’s simple design also came from limitations. Perhaps the simplicity of their character design is what makes both Mario and Astro so iconic and easy to recognize.</p><p>“On top of that, we wanted them to look futuristic, as the game was launching together with a new console,” says Doucet. “At the same time, we wanted these bots to have a bit of a belly so that they looked endearing and that you would want to protect them.”</p><p>It could be said that the combination of futurism with cuteness perfectly embodies the identity of the Japanese roots of the PlayStation brand that Kutaragi started. Characters like Toro, Parappa and Ape Escape’s monkeys share a somewhat similar blend of digital, cool and cute.</p><p>Team Asobi’s success with creating a game to showcase new PlayStation technology led to its next game, The Playroom VR. Similar to its predecessor, The Playroom VR was a free launch game for the PlayStation VR that functioned as a showcase for Sony’s venture into the world of virtual reality. While the team’s focus was on creating a collection of short multiplayer experiences, there was one exception.</p><p>“We had made a prototype of a 3D platformer in VR, and there was something special about it,” says Doucet. “We decided to break the rule of only including multiplayer experiences and added it to the package. It ended up being far more popular than any of the multiplayer games we focused on!”</p><p>That 3D platformer was named Robots Rescue. While no name was given to the robot you controlled, it was the first time that Astro could be seen in his final design. Robots Rescue was a short experience that consisted of just one stage, but it was so well received that Team Asobi decided to make their next game a full-fledged virtual reality 3D platformer. That became Astro Bot: Rescue Mission, released in 2018. It remains the highest rated PlayStation VR game on Metacritic to this day, with critics citing that it does for VR what Super Mario 64 did for 3D. Astro’s first full-fledged adventure instantly made both Team Asobi and Astro a force to be reckoned with.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“VR is great as it gives you a special card to play, but the audience is more limited”</p></div><p>“This is also when we came up with the name for Astro,” says Doucet. “We wanted to have a short, snappy name that is international and easy to pronounce in any language.”</p><p>Astro Bot: Rescue Mission was a huge critical success, but its exclusivity to PlayStation VR was a double-edged sword. Although VR allowed Team Asobi to differentiate its game from other 3D platformers, PS VR had a relatively small install base. For a family-friendly IP like Astro Bot, the fact that the PS VR was recommended for players over 12 also limited the game’s appeal.  </p><p>“VR is great as it gives you a special card to play, but the audience is more limited,” Doucet says. “We wanted to touch a wider audience, but that meant that we had to compete with developers that have been making 3D platformers for more than 20 or 30 years. It was a big test for us to see if we were capable of doing that or not.”</p><p>The result was Astro’s Playroom, a 3D platformer that was, once again, released as a free  game designed to showcase a new piece of hardware. It came pre-installed on the PlayStation 5 when it went on sale in 2020. It was easily one of the best games available on the system at launch. To this day, its creative use of the DualSense controller’s haptic feedback and adaptive triggers showcase what the controller can do better than pretty much any other game. Doucet tells us that while Team Asobi learned from Guerilla Games (Horizon Zero Dawn) and Santa Monica Studio (God of War), those same studios, in turn,  asked Team Asobi for advice on how to utilize  the DualSense’s haptic feedback and adaptive triggers.</p><p>One of the key reasons behind Astro’s Playroom’s creative use of the DualSense was Team Asobi’s close collaboration with Sony’s hardware division.</p><p>“Team Asobi’s studio is just across the street from our building, so they were always the first  to prototype with our hardware,” says Senior Principal Product Manager Toshi Aoki, product director for the DualSense controller.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/06/img-20240829-143648-1725657541729.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The history of PlayStation affects Team Asobi's work deeply. Credit: Esra Krabbe, IGN Japan</figcaption></figure></output><p>“Whenever we had something ready at the hardware team, we would just call Team Asobi and hand it to them,” Aoki explains. “A few days later they would call us back to show us something. With this quick loop, they could give us feedback on what they wanted added to or removed from the hardware.”</p><p>Aoki continues, “For our hardware, we want to give the player a new experience rather than just a piece of technology. In that regard, working closely with Team Asobi really helped us.”</p><p>The ever-growing install base of the PS5 has allowed many players around the world to enjoy Astro’s Playroom. Filled with references to hardware throughout PlayStation’s history and boasting an abundance of cameo appearances from popular characters, Astro’s Playroom celebrated PlayStation’s history in a unique way. This made Astro not just the new kid on the block, but established the bot as a character integral  to the PlayStation brand. </p><h3>Gaining Icon Status</h3><p>As the PS5 is still a platform with a relatively mature audience, Sony likely doesn’t have the intention to cement Astro as the system’s one and only mascot. But maybe they should? A new iconic character representing your brand through top-quality games couldn’t possibly be a bad thing. Especially since a family-friendly 3D platformer like Astro Bot is also the type of game that the PlayStation’s library has been lacking.</p><p>“For Astro’s Playroom, there have mainly been two types of audiences,” says Doucet. “First, there are the people who actually are gamers. You hear more from them because they are generally more vocal. They’re mostly the type who crave more colorful games and want to go back to 3D platformers. These players are also happy to see how we treat the PlayStation heritage. </p><p>“But then, there’s a whole different type of audience that we hear from through more intimate communication,” Doucet reveals. “People come and tell us it became their kid’s first game or that they played it with their daughter or son. Many people buy a PS5 for themselves, but play Astro’s Playroom with their younger children.”</p><p>The fact that Team Asobi’s games have the potential to become someone’s first game is something that Doucet takes seriously.</p><p>“I grew up playing games like Mega Man and Castlevania. From music to gameplay and even the package art, these games will stay in my heart forever. The hard work and care of the creators has become a part of many people’s lives. We have the same opportunity with Astro, which is something we do not take lightly.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Astro’s Playroom’s success allowed Team Asobi to get the green light for a full-scale 3D platformer. Releasing on September 6, Team Asobi’s newest game is simply titled Astro Bot. While Astro Bot: Rescue Mission and Astro’s Playroom both benefited from the marvel of new technology (VR and DualSense respectively), Astro Bot feels more like a direct evolution of Astro’s Playroom.</p><p>“We made a lot of prototypes at the time, but the game was too small to put all our ideas in,” says Principal gameplay Programming Lead Masayuki Yamada. “Our newest game has all of the best ideas we had to leave out at the time, as well as plenty of new creative ideas. In that sense it has much more volume, and what we can do with the haptic feedback has evolved a lot as well. On top of that, we're doubling down on showcasing PlayStation’s heritage through hardware references and cameos of beloved characters in new ways, too.”</p><p>According to Jamie Smith, Team Asobi’s Principle Animation Director, the animations of Astro and other characters in the game have been drastically increased. While animation in Astro’s Playroom was simple and limited, this time around the team has gone the extra mile by adding significantly more detail through a wider variation of walk and run motions, swimming underwater, climbing vertical cables and ladders, tons of idle animations and much more. These additions enrich the gameplay while further establishing Astro as a character. Seeing Astro take out and play his PS One or being frightened to death in a horror-themed stage adds to his charm in classic mascot character fashion.</p><p>Cameos have more detailed animations too. Smith named Trico and the boy from The Last Guardian as an example.</p><p>“If you hit Trico, it will wake up and go back to sleep; but if you hit the boy, Trico will wake up and be protective over the boy like in The Last Guardian. We really wanted to go deeper and depict the relationship between characters.”</p><p>The biggest evolution of the cameo characters, however, is that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-every-playstation-character-easter-eggs">four of them will actually lend you their weapons,</a> which Astro needs to use in stages specifically designed for each one.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“People come and tell us it became their kid’s first game or that they played it with their daughter or son."</p></div><p>“We call these characters PlayStation heroes. They are trapped in boss battles, so you need to defeat the boss to save them,” Doucet explains. “For these PlayStation heroes, we wanted to have a mix of characters from blockbusters and more classic fantasy characters. Since Astro is designed as a family-friendly game that anyone can pick up and play, we wanted these special stages to have simplified game design when compared to the franchise they are based on. Another thing is that we wanted there to be humor. For example, we tried to make [God of War’s] Kratos angry and cute at the same time.”</p><p>While more of an extension of its previous titles than something all-new, it sounds like Team Asobi has cooked another stellar game. With over 80 stages and more than 15 power ups, players that wanted more of Astro’s Playroom will unlikely be dissatisfied. It will also be interesting to see what kind of new experiences Team Asobi can deliver with its deep knowledge of the DualSense controller. By paying respect to PlayStation’s heritage in new interactive ways, Astro Bot also seems like the perfect game to mark PlayStation’s 30th anniversary. </p><p>“I was at [Tokyo electronics store] Yodobashi Camera last Sunday and saw a father and his son preorder Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Astro Bot,” says Doucet. “Clearly, he bought Call of Duty for himself, while Astro Bot was probably for his son. It was the first time I saw someone buy Astro Bot with my own eyes.”</p><p>Like Astro’s Playroom, Astro Bot is not just a game that PS5 owners can play themselves, but also one that they can share with their less-experienced loved ones. Will this new adventure bring Astro even <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-dev-apparently-thinking-about-a-sequel-already">closer to mascot character status?</a> If the father and son Doucet saw at Yodobashi Camera is an indication, Astro could very well be on his way to familiarize a younger audience with the PlayStation brand.</p><p><em></em><a href="https://twitter.com/RineD1987" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>Esra Krabbe</em></u></a><em> is an editor at IGN Japan.

<p>A couple of hours later, however, ModDB and mod.io founder Scott Reismanis popped up in Vincke's <a href="https://x.com/scottreismanis/status/1832379012179751132">mentions</a> to say, "just ticked over 3m installs and accelerating".</p>
<p>Patch 7 adds new evil endings, the studio's own Mod Manager, wherein you can browse, install, and use mods created by the community, and some revamped split-screen gameplay.</p> <div>

<p>"Our goal is to do cross-platform modding support, which is not the easiest thing in the world because we have to make it work on consoles and on PC," Vincke recently explained.</p>
<p>"We'll start with the PC version. The console version will come a bit later because it has to go through a bunch of submission processes. It also gives us the time to see whatever goes wrong and fix it."</p>
