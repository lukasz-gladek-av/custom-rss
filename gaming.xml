			<p>Let us cut to the chase. If you are expecting a major overhaul and update in FC 25 compared to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/25/ea-sports-fc-24-review/">FC 24</a>, you will be disappointed. There are some changes and a brand new game mode, but when it comes down to it, FC 25 is going to be very familiar to FC 24, from the presentation to the on the pitch action. The big change, and in my opinion a change for the better, is that Volta is gone and Rush is in.</p>
<p><iframe title="EA SPORTS FC 25 Official Launch Trailer | For The Club" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RefXbk1_taI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For many people, the first port of call in FC 25 will still be the career modes, whether that’s player or manager. In player career, you can create your own professional, or pick a player and rewrite their story to create an alternate history for them. I chose to create a player and to mix things up I decided to pick a team that I am sure very few will: Punjab FC. I chose them partly because getting the chance to play as any team from my own cultural background is rare, and partly because it would be easier for my new player to breakthrough into the first team here compared to a big team in the major European leagues.</p>


<p>At the start of your career, your agent will also give you the option to pick a target club that you want to eventually sign for, but you need to perform on the pitch to get there. Once you finally start, it is obvious that the career mode is the same as FC 24, except the starting rating for my player was 75 and not 70 as it was in last year’s game. Just like FC 24, you pick your position and personality type – Maverick, Heartbeat or Virtuoso. Again, your player is set objectives and you play training drills to unlock abilities and improve your player rating, and you have the option to play as just your pro during matches or as the whole team. Down the road, Live Start Points will be added to player and career modes, taking moments from the 2024/25 season, and letting you replay them, but they are not available yet.</p>


<p>Manager mode is similar to player career, and just like last year you can create your own or choose a real life manager to take control of. I made my own, and went to Punjab FC again. Rush mode is part of career mode as well, at least for the youth team, where you can play as some of your club’s up and coming stars in a small Rush tournament. This is a decent addition as it focuses you on players that could eventually break into the first team, and lets you really focus on their development. Other than that, manager career is very similar to FC 24 in terms of layout and objectives. The coaching rating system returns too, in which coaches are rated on their effectiveness of training players in different areas of the field.</p>
<p>On to the multiplayer, and Rush is very front and centre to get eyes on it. It is part of Ultimate Team, and in it you pick one of your Ultimate Team players to control as part of the five player squad, though not the keeper who is controlled by the computer. Rush has potential if players learn to remember that this is a team sport, and not a place to always show off individual skills or ball hog. You can play with friends, but I jumped into random squads, which were a mixed bag in this regard. Getting a group of players together who played as team really displays how Rush comes together, but play with selfish players and it sucks any fun out of the mode. You can also play Rush in kick off mode where you control the whole team yourself, which is fun too.</p>

<p>Rush, as implied by the name, is fast paced and moves end to end very quickly, as you are playing on a smaller pitch. The commentary is very repetitive though and only one arena could make the mode feel stale quickly. Rush features the same rules as a normal match, but also adds the blue card where a player is removed from the pitch for a minute before being allowed back on.</p>
<p>Aside from the addition of Rush, the other online modes are very familiar. Ultimate Team is still the same where you play to climb the ranks, play in tournaments, and earn/buy coins to buy packs or buy specific players in the transfer market. Chemistry is still key to how a team operates together, with those sharing the same nation, club, or league having a better chemistry with each other than those that do not. Your enjoyment of the mode will really come down to how your team shapes up against other players, and if you are good enough to climb the ladder.</p>

<p>On the pitch, there have been some changes with the key addition being FC IQ. This adds Player Roles to FC 25, making players much more like their real life counterparts in terms of what they do on the pitch, and these roles do impact your tactics. Across the 11v11 modes, you can set up different tactics to rotate between, with the success of these being dependant on your players and how they will do in the positions your put them in.</p>
<p>Additionally, FC IQ will suggest tactical changes while in matches depending on the situation. If you are losing, it will suggest new formations or tactical approaches to counter your opponent, and if you are winning it will likely suggest tactics to defend that lead. It’s a good addition, but just like switching a team playstyle in matches the way to do so feels clunky and does not fit into the rest of the flow. There is also something noticeable in that players do not seem to react as well or quickly to any changes, and off the ball movement comes across as lacklustre, which does not change if you are playing as either a top tier team or a bottom rung club.</p>

<p>Where Rush is an arcade style fast paced mode, 11 vs 11 matches go further into simulating real life, and that is starting to remove some of the fun from older EA football games. The focus on real world simulation means, as the series has progressed you are less likely to go in for sliding tackles due to the high risk of being booked, for example. I’m old enough to remember running away from the referee in FIFA 94 on the Sega Mega Drive…</p>

			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro's increased specs over the base model will not bring any improvement to AMD FSR 2, as its biggest issues aren't caused by low base resolution.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry">Digital Foundry</a> replied to a fan question asking if the better specs of the PlayStation 5 Pro over the base model would bring image quality improvements to games using AMD FSR 2. The tech experts have no doubt that the new system will be able to do little to improve some of the upscaler's issues, which have very little to do with base resolution, but rather with the way it reconstructs the image, leading to the known visual issues in motion. These issues may only become less noticeable with a higher base resolution but will still be very much present. PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, from the available footage, looks like a considerable step up in terms of image quality, as showcased recently in <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-vast-improvement-playstation-5-pro/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, so, at the very least, PS5 Pro owners will be able to enjoy much better visual quality in games.</p>
<p>Speaking about the PlayStation 5 Pro's PSSR, which will be the first AI-powered upscaler in the console space, Digital Foundry also highlighted how similar upscalers are not going to bring the cost of future consoles down. While they could have, as manufacturers could have saved on manufacturing costs with smaller chips and better efficiency of dedicated hardware, manufacturing costs for specialized SoCs are likely going to continue being high. So, it seems more and more likely that the PS5 Pro's high cost may just be the beginning of a general price increase for consoles in the future.</p>

<p>A Louisiana-based film production company, Stellarblade, has just filed a case against the developers of Stellar Blade, Shift Up and the publisher, PlayStation.&nbsp;</p>



<div><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellarblade-trademark-lawsuit-sony-shift-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Griffith Chambers Mehaffey, the owner of the film company, has filed a trademark infringement case against PlayStation, Shift Up, and an unnamed insurance company for using the trademark “Stellar Blade”. Mehaffey’s complaint adds that his business was damaged due to the similarity in names and logos.</p><p>&nbsp;Mehaffey’s complaint states that he has owned stellarblade.com since 2006 and has offered “multimedia entertainment services” since 2010. The complaint also discusses how the game was announced as Project Eve in 2019 and later changed to Stellar Blade in 2022.&nbsp;Shift Up registered Stellar Blade as a video-game-related trademark in January 2023, and Mehaffey registered Stellarblade in June 2023. He followed this up by sending a cease and desist to Shift Up in July.&nbsp;</p></div>



<p>Regarding the business, the owner of the film company has claimed that his customers could easily find details about his business on the internet. However, since the game was released, his business has been overshadowed by Shift Up’s Stellar Blade in the searches. Mehaffey has also claimed that both trademarks are “confusingly similar”, pointing out the colour schemes and how both logos have a stylised S.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Mehaffey’s demands are clear: he wants Shift Up and PlayStation to cease using the name ‘Stellar Blade’, hand over all materials bearing the name for destruction, and compensation for the damages and attorney fees.</p>

Earlier this year, we established an ambitious goal for our future as a publisher—to make Behaviour synonymous with horror, and surround <em>Dead by Daylight</em> with a library of similarly exceptional <a title="Genres > Horror [488 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror games</a>. Our acquisition of Red Hook is another emphatic step towards this objective, with more to come.”</p><p><strong>Stephen Mulrooney, Behaviour Interactive Chief Product and Technical Officer</strong> </p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>“<em>Darkest Dungeon</em> offers a natural complement to <em>Dead by Daylight</em>. Both franchises occupy unique points on the horror spectrum, and both offer their players deep, innovative gameplay and original, eldritch worlds. We’re so excited to add Darkest Dungeon to Behaviour’s horror portfolio. Not just because we’re huge fans of the games, but also because of the unparalleled creativity and passion demonstrated by Chris, Tyler, and every member of the Red Hook team.”</p><p><strong>Chris Bourassa, Red Hook Studios Co-Founder</strong></p><p>“We’ve found kindred spirits in the Behaviour team. Both studios are Canadian, independent, and devoted to fantastic horror games. Where we differ is scale, which opens the door to new possibilities. Behaviour’s support will help us pursue our vision for Red Hook’s future, and focus fully on transforming <em>Darkest Dungeon</em> into an absolute juggernaut of the dark fantasy genre.”</p><p><strong>Tyler Sigman, Red Hook Studios Co-Founder</strong></p><p>“Joining forces with Behaviour is exciting on multiple levels. They have demonstrated a commitment to allowing our team to continue developing Darkest Dungeon in the manner we know best, but with the benefit of their considerable knowledge and resources. We are stronger together than apart. Critically, there is a shared love of Darkest Dungeon, and with Behaviour’s help we can delve even deeper into the franchise.”</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Don't Nod has high hopes for Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, after Jusant and Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden failed to reach company expectations.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases?ID=ACTUS-0-87839">financial report</a>, the French developer and publisher said it will now "partially write down, in the amount of €24m, the assets of Jusant and Banishers: Ghost of New Eden, given the inability to demonstrate future cash flows commensurate with the value of these assets".</p>
<p>It will also turn its attention to games currently in production, such as Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, which the Don't Nod said "received a particularly positive reception" after being played by press at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, Don't Nod also has two in-house, yet-to-be-named projects in the works, which are scheduled to release by the end of 2027. The company is also supporting two external publishing projects, which are due to release next year.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Don't Nod has temporarily paused two projects currently "in the design phase". The company said this will allow it to "prioritise resources and maximise the chances of success of the titles with the greatest potential" at the current time.</p>
<p>"We are obviously disappointed by our recent performance in an extremely competitive and selective market," chairman and CEO of Don't Nod Oskar Guilbert said.</p>
<p>"Despite an excellent critical reception, Jusant and Banishers: Ghosts of new Eden unfortunately did not achieve the commercial results we had hoped for, resulting in a deterioration in our 2024 half-year results and leading us to consider all possible options regarding our roadmap."</p>

			<p>As reported <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellarblade-trademark-lawsuit-sony-shift-up" target="_blank" rel="noopener">by IGN</a>, Sony and Stellar Blade developer Shift Up have been sued in the United States for trademark infringement. The plaintiff is Griffith Chambers Mehaffey, owner of a multimedia company named Stellarblade LLC whose officials website is available <a href="https://www.stellarblade.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>. Mehaffey's lawyer sent the following statement to IGN:</p>
<p><em>Mr. Mehaffey registered the stellarblade.com domain in 2006 and has used the STELLARBLADE name for his business for nearly 15 years. Given this long-standing and public use, it's difficult to imagine that Shift Up and Sony were unaware of Mr. Mehaffey's established rights before adopting their identical mark. We believe in fair competition, but when larger companies disregard the established rights of smaller businesses, it's our responsibility to stand up and protect our brand. The defendants’ far superior resources have effectively monopolized online search results for STELLARBLADE, pushing Mr. Mehaffey's long-established business into digital obscurity and threatening the livelihood he's built over more than a decade.</em></p>
<p>In all likelihood, none of this would have happened if Stellar Blade had not become a major success. The game <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-has-sold-over-one-million-units-since-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became a million-seller</a> very quickly, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-developer-is-now-worth-as-much-as-koei-tecmo-in-market-capitalization-following-huge-ipo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">boosting Shift Up's evaluation</a> right before the Korean company went public. Shift Up is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/stellar-blade-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">working</a> on DLC and a PC port.</p>
<p>We rated Stellar Blade 9 out of 10. Here's the excerpt from Kai Tatsumoto's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>:</p>
<p><em>No butts about it, Stellar Blade is a marvelous feast for the eyes and a technically impressive action RPG. Those who find the hyper-sexualized Eve offputting will find little redemption in finding some modesty for the playable heroine, but at the same time, those already accustomed to the years following Bayonetta’s release and 2Booty memes will find the character designs enjoyable, to say the least. Stellar Blade is a fantastic action title and one PlayStation exclusive you’ll have to play after the kids go to bed.</em></p>

			<p>A Nintendo Switch Lite OLED mod is being released this week, and a new trailer was shared online to showcase the gorgeous screen that users will be able to install on the system in just a few days.</p>
<p>The SUPER5 OLED mod for the Nintendo Switch Lite, created by Taki Udon, will go <a href="https://retroremake.co/pages/super5" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on sale</a> in multiple variants on September 26th at 10 a.m. Hong Kong time. The new screen boasts significantly higher brightness, contrast ratio, and color gamut compared to the vanilla screen, resulting in a much more pleasing experience that is more in line with the one that regular Switch OLED users can have on their system. A trailer was also shared to showcase the gorgeous screen, and you can check it out below.</p>

<p>The SUPER5 OLED kits will go on sale on September 26th at 10 am Hong Kong Time (GMT +8). We have promo coupons for the first two days while supplies last. An install guide for the base package will go up this week.</p>

<p>— Taki Udon (@TakiUdon_) <a href="https://twitter.com/TakiUdon_/status/1838275690405523554?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>With the Nintendo Switch 2 right around the corner, it's unlikely the Japanese company will ever offer an official Nintendo Switch Lite OLED, so getting the modification by Taki Udon is the only way to enhance the portable-only experience the system offers. An OLED screen also doesn't seem to be in the cards for Nintendo's next generation system as well, at least at launch, although the console is still going to offer a good portable experience, thanks to its low power consumption, which will grant it great battery life. The portable experience seems to have been a focus for Nintendo from the very beginning of development, as AMD's bid to create the system didn't go through due to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-amd-performance/">performance and power consumption issues in handheld mode.</a></p>

<p>God of War Ragnarok PC now has a mod that allows players to play the game without linking their PSN and Steam accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>God of War Ragnarok was released for PC on September 19, 2024. However, the players didn’t receive the game well. Within hours of release, the new PC port experienced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pc-players-psn-ragnarok-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a surge in negative reviews</a>, with most players complaining about the PSN account linking requirement. Interestingly, one modder has released a solution for this problem.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/someone-made-a-mod-to-bypass-the-psn-login-for-god-of-war-ragnarok-and-it-works/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, iArtorias has released a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/22?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NOPSSDK</a> mod, available through Nexus Mods and GitHub. Through NOPSSDK, a tiny library will strip the PlayStation PC SDK runtime requirement for God of War Ragnarok entirely. After installing this mod, players can rampage all over the Norse realms without worrying about having a PSN account.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-install-god-of-war-ragnarok-nopssdk-mod">How to Install God of War Ragnarok NOPSSDK Mod?</h2>



<p>Players can head to <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/22?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nexus Mods</a> or <a href="https://github.com/iArtorias/nopssdk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GitHub</a> to install NOPSSDK for God of War Ragnarok PC. Download the latest release, and copy the “version.dll and PsPcSdk.dll” files to the game folder. After that, players can select “No” when the game asks them to link their Steam and PSN accounts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The creator has also provided some troubleshooting methods if the mod doesn’t work correctly. If players encounter a login screen error, they should remove this file, “C:\Users[Username]\Saved Games\God of War Ragnarök[AccountID]\userpreferences”. Then, when the game asks you to link your Steam and PSN accounts, press “No”.&nbsp;</p>

And the game looks f***ing great. But when I play on the PS5, I play performance.”</p><p>Space Marine 2 has two display modes for PS5 and Xbox Series X: 'Quality' offers higher resolution, a stable 30 frames per second, and better graphics, whereas 'Speed' drops the resolution in a bid to hit 60fps.</p><p>However, Space Marine 2 has performance issues on PS5 relative to the Xbox Series X version. According to the tech experts at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-impresses-on-xbox-series-x-s-but-flags-on-ps5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry</a>, Space Marine 2 impresses on Xbox Series X and S, but “flags” on PS5. Here’s DF’s analysis:</p><blockquote>“In testing Space Marine 2 on PC, it's clear that the game's encounters with alien swarms pushes the CPU hard - and at least as of patch 1.02, that results in lop-sided performance on consoles in the 60fps speed mode. Series X typically outperforms PS5 by around 10 to 15fps, despite both machines using the same settings and resolution targets. The lowest drops come when taking a flamethrower to the encroaching horde, where PS5 drops to the mid-30s while Xbox Series X is in the mid-40s.”</blockquote><p>Willits’ “hope” — he admits he’s not a technical person — is that Space Marine 2 in Speed Mode on PS5 Pro will look better than Quality Mode does on the base PS5.</p><p>“So what I hope — and it's just me, I don't know anything technical — but what I hope is with the PS5 Pro, with the AI upsampling, that players will be able to play Space Marine 2 in Performance [Speed] Mode, and it'll look better, hopefully — hopefully, I don't know — it'll look better than it does in Quality Mode now.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>It true, it means those who play Space Marine 2 in Speed mode on PS5 will benefit from its higher frame-rate (hopefully locked to 60fps this time, but no guarantees as the issue on the performance side — hitting 60fps — is the CPU limitation) <em>and</em> improved graphics. The game will have a higher resolution owing to the PS5 Pro's faster GPU (more pixels) and then PSSR upscaling (better upscaling of those more pixels).</p><p>But what about a PS5 Pro Enhanced patch for Space Marine 2? Sony has said several games will be patched with free software updates for gamers to take advantage of PS5 Pro’s features (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/every-game-enhanced-for-ps5-pro">IGN has a list of all the confirmed PS5 Pro Enhanced games so far</a>). These games can be identified with a PS5 Pro Enhanced label within their title.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We're actually in discussions with Sony to figure out what we want to do.</p></div><p>Willits said Saber has no plans right now for Space Marine 2 to join the PS5 Pro Enhanced list, but did confirm that the company’s engineers are in talks with Sony to work out if it’s something they want to support.</p><p>“So we're actually in discussions with Sony to figure out what we want to do,” Willits said. “Sony's really happy about the game. Microsoft is happy about the game too! But yes, our engineers are discussing what we can do. We have no plans right now. We're still trying to figure that out. Again, the PS5 Pro is brand new, our game, we're just trying to catch up. So we just have to be patient with our official plans.”</p><p>Sony is set to host a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-state-of-play-for-september-2024-officially-announced">State of Play broadcast</a> today, September 24, at 3pm PT / 6pm ET, with news on more than 20 upcoming PS5 and PS VR2 games “from studios around the world.” Perhaps we’ll get a clearer idea of what to expect from the PS5 Pro at the show.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Game Enhanced for PS5 Pro So Far</h3></div></output><p>Meanwhile, we have plenty of Space Marine 2 coverage to check out, including Willits on the record-breaking success of the game and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3">what it means for a potential story DLC or even Space Marine 3</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/shadps4-playstation-4-emulator-version-0-3-0-download/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new version of the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator is now available for download, introducing a lot of improvements over the previous version.</p>
<p>Version 0.3.0 introduces cheating and patching, DLC, 26 more languages, additional controllers (DualShock and Xbox controllers), trophies support, GUI improvements, and much more. As a result of the many changes introduced in this new version of the emulator, old save files may no longer be compatible. A guide is available on the emulator's official Discord server on how to migrate and save files created with the previous version of the emulator without losing any progress.</p>
<p>The ShadPS4 emulator has been making incredible progress in the past few months, going from being able to play only simple 2D games such as Sonic Mania and barely booting up more complex titles to making Bloodborne playable on PC. These emulation improvements have also allowed modders like fromsoftserve to work mods that improve the game's visuals and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-fanmade-remaster-improved-models/">unofficial remastering projects</a> that will breathe new life into the haunting city of Yarnham.</p>
<p>More information on the ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator can be found on its <a href="https://shadps4.net/">official website</a>. The new version of the emulator can be downloaded right now for free from <a href="https://github.com/shadps4-emu/shadPS4/releases/tag/v.0.3.0">GitHub.</a></p>

            <p>The in thing when it comes to dinosaur conversations now is this: "Yeah but did you know that they weren't all like, lizardy, but covered in feathers". You might want to chuck in that chickens are basically dinosaurs, because their feet have a "Triassic Flange", a (made-up) term that will make you sound authoritative. If you really want to showcase your knowledge, though, you may want to mention that dinosaurs may have actually fought with large swords lodged between their teeth. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dinoblade">Dinoblade</a> demonstrates this! And no, they haven't discovered swords alongside dinosaur fossils yet because palaeontologists have been unlucky thus far. "Soon", you tell them.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Jean Nguyen, a senior gameplay animator at Sucker Punch, started working on side project Dinoblade in 2023. And I am thankful, because it looks like a right laugh. Obviously, much of it is still a work in progress, but the premise is this: you are a dinosaur, you have a sword, and you must fight another dinosaur who also has a sword. But the fights don't look like when two giraffes fight, with necks and heads flailing at each other. Oh no. There's dodge-rolling, power slams, and blades that blast spectral missiles.</p>
<p>Much of the footage lies on Nguyen's Xwitter, which showcases little tangoes between dinos worked on by Nguyen himself, together with fellow animator Randy Nguyen and composer Samuele Vona. Have a gander at these:</p>

Not that Mushiking is Soulsy like Dinoblade, being more of a rock-paper-scissors fighter, but I dunno. It's stirred up some memories of two beasties going at it, and that's nice.</p>

            <p>
We <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jusant-review">liked</a> Jusant, Don't Nod's clamber-upper masterpiece, and we also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-review">liked</a> Banishers, their colonial ghost-busting action-adventure, but it seems that not enough people did. The company have posted a profit warning, reflecting an 11% decline in operating revenue for the first half of 2024. They've also "paused" two unannounced games in development, and altered other unannounced games to be more appealing to a "wider audience". Beyond that, they're considering "all possible options regarding our roadmap", which sounds just a touch ominous.  
</p><!--more-->
<p>
 "Despite an excellent critical reception, Jusant and Banishers: Ghosts Of New Eden unfortunately did not achieve the commercial results we had hoped for, resulting in a deterioration in our 2024 half-year results and leading us to consider all possible options regarding our roadmap," chairman and CEO Oskar Guilbert explains in <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases?ID=ACTUS-0-87839">a press release</a> published yesterday. He adds that Ghost Of New Eden and Jusant "performed well below expectations". They're expecting to make a loss for the first half of 2024 of around €1 million.
</p>
<p>
To compensate for this, Don't Nod are writing down the assets of Jusant and Banishers: Ghost of New Eden (i.e. lowering their value on company books, to match what the market says they're worth) and making some sweeping changes to their line-up of games in development. 
</p>
<p>
These include two unannounced in-house projects, codenamed P10 and P14, which are pencilled in for release before end of 2027. "In order to bolster sales potential and increase partnership opportunities with industry leaders, project design has been refocused to reach a wider audience, which involves scrapping certain developments (P10)", the press release notes. It's not wholly clear from the wording whether this means that P10 has been entirely cancelled.
</p>
<p>
They're also  "temporarily pausing two projects in the design phase in Paris", codenamed P12 and P13, for a write-down of €7.6 million. "This decision will enable us to prioritize resources and maximize the chances of success of the titles with the greatest potential at present," the press release adds.
</p>
<p>
Don't Nod's big hope right now is Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage from their Montreal team, which is being created by some of the people behind Life Is Strange. The press release hails the game's "particulary positive reception" from press - "I'm well up for this one," Alice0 (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-is-strange-studio-return-to-teen-mysteries-with-lost-records-bloom-rage">wrote back in December 2023</a> - but adds that "at the same time, discussions are continuing with industry leaders to secure economic benefits". Again, all rather open-ended.
</p>
<p>
These in-house games sit alongside two unspecified external publishing projects that are due for release in 2025. The press release doesn't mention whether Don't Nod are revising their approach to these projects as well.</p>
<p>If you are thinking "this seems like a lot of things in dev for a team with (reportedly as of 2022) 320 people on the books across two studios", then congratulations, you share the opinion of the French video game union workers who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-union-report-alleges-mismanagement-at-life-is-strange-developer-dont-nod">expressed misgivings about Don't Nod's management in February</a>. They painted the picture of a studio with "no long-term vision" for staff welfare, where deadlines change "frequently" and projects move in "contradictory" directions.
</p>
<p>While Jusant's fortunes are perhaps predictable, going by stereotypes about which games tend to be big hits, the underwhelming returns on Banishers are more worrisome. Don't Nod had it vaguely pegged as a spiritual follow-up to Vampyr, which remains their biggest seller for all its middling reviews, as Don’t Nod’s head of creative Phillipe Moreau <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-wants-to-be-a-thoughtful-blockbuster-on-a-budget">told me in December</a>. Still, there's a difference between "game that is popular" and "game that sells what the company in question needs it to sell".</p>
<p>As ever, best of luck to the rank-and-file developers caught up in these machinations.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/banishers-and-jusant-underperformed-dont-nod-admits/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>French game developer DON'T NOD reported its financial results for the first half of 2024, and the news is not good, as both Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden and Jusant have underperformed. Oskar Guilbert, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer at DON'T NOD, said:</p>
<p><em>We are obviously disappointed by our recent performance in an extremely competitive and selective market. Despite an excellent critical reception, Jusant and Banishers: Ghosts of new Eden unfortunately did not achieve the commercial results we had hoped for, resulting in a deterioration in our 2024 half-year results and leading us to consider all possible options regarding our roadmap.</em></p>
<p>It's a damn shame. Both were great games, and I have particularly enjoyed Banishers, as explained in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-dont-nods-finest-action-game-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my review of the action RPG</a>:</p>
<p><em>There's little doubt Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden is Don't Nod's finest action game yet. I would also venture to say it's one of their best games, period, not to mention a great action RPG in its own right thanks to enjoyable combat, a big world with lots of content to explore and interesting stories to experience, and particularly for the amazing couple of lover protagonists.</em></p>
<p>The two games' underperformance forced DON'T NOD to partially write down their assets for €24 million and temporarily suspend two projects in the design phase in Paris (P12 and P13) for another €7.6 million write-down. The developer will focus on completing <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-records-bloom-rage-interview-discussing-the-setting-inspirations-multiple-timelines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a>, the spiritual successor to Life is Strange. Moreover, it will support two external publishing projects due to launch next year.</p>
<p>DON'T NOD is also exploring other options to be implemented as soon as possible to secure its operations and enhance value creation. The purpose of this review is to give DON'T NOD the ability to compete more successfully in a constantly evolving industry, respond effectively to the expectations of players and partners, and continue to offer innovative, high-quality experiences.</p>

The </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dead by Daylight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer/publisher </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/behaviour-interactive-acquires-darkest-dungeon-dev-red-hook">announced today</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that it is acquiring Red Hook Studios, the company behind </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Darkest Dungeon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Darkest Dungeon II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's incredibly rare for a game studio to announce an acquisition like this so soon after a year of layoffs and studio closures. So rare, in fact, that the only comparable example feels like Activision Blizzard's establishment of the Polish game studio&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/activision-opens-new-studio-elsewhere-to-develop-triple-a-franchise">Elsewhere</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;in May 2024 while parent company Microsoft axed jobs across the company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The news may be bittersweet for plenty of the game development community. On the one hand, the Red Hook acquisition looks to be a coup for both companies. On the other hand, so many other developers lost work—and an entire studio was closed down—on the road here.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In an interview with Game Developer, Red Hook Studios co-founders Tyler Sigman and Chris Bourassa, joined by Behaviour Interactive CEO Rémi Racine, explained why both parties pursued this transaction. For Red Hook, it was a chance for stability that would fuel bigger and loftier dreams, and according to Racine, it's a move that helps Behaviour "reduce risk" as it finalizes its ongoing strategy shift.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/behaviour-interactive-acquires-darkest-dungeon-dev-red-hook" target="_self">Behaviour Interactive acquires Darkest Dungeon dev Red Hook Studios</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Reconciling Behaviour's studio closures and layoffs with a new acquisition">Reconciling Behaviour's studio closures and layoffs with a new acquisition</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Behaviour, it seems this was the culmination of a shift in its strategy, taking it away from publishing games like&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Islands of Insight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;and into a future where it solely focuses on the horror genre.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That strategy shift came with internal restructuring, driving the layoffs that took place earlier in the year. Behaviour Interactive chief product and technical officer Stephen Mulrooney told Game Developer that during that process, the company determined that it had "too many" employees to support that shift and that some of the affected workers didn't have the skills needed to support the new direction.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for the fate of Midwinter Entertainment, Racine repeated the explanation given by Behaviour last week, which was that "Project T," the game Midwinter was working on, didn't have a chance of succeeding in today's market. He said that canceling the game meant there was no other work for the studio as a whole to take on. Workers at Midwinter were offered relocation opportunities for matching roles at Behaviour's Canadian offices.</span></p><p>Image via Behaviour Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some might wonder if Racine and Behaviour management knew the Red Hook acquisition was impending, why not hold on to this team to support Red Hook in the future. "The transaction is today, Midwinter is yesterday," Racine replied, explaining that the timing of both decisions didn't offer a window for the Midwinter team to start supporting developers at Red Hook. He said Behaviour would have had to keep the studio running for a year or more without a dedicated project before any opportunity to bring the two teams together could have emerged.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Behaviour's planned publishing shift sent the company looking for what Racine called "great horror IPs," which is what brought it and the Red Hook Studios team together around March 2024. "We want to make horror gaming bigger," Mulrooney said. He expressed excitement about Red Hook Studios' experience with Early Access development, which may indicate Behaviour is planning to explore similar territory with its future games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's not just Behaviour that wants to go bigger and bolder with the blood-soaked genre—Bourassa and Sigman told Game Developer that they wanted Behaviour's backing to make Darkest Dungeon an even bigger franchise.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Red Hook Studios says acquisition provides &quot;stability&quot; for studio planning">Red Hook Studios says acquisition provides "stability" for studio planning</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Hearing about people losing jobs is never pleasant," Bourassa said when we asked how he and Sigman felt watching the layoffs and closures take place as the deal proceeded. But it was the stability that so many of their peers lacked that made them pursue it anyway.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We felt like this was a chance to build a strong runway for a future title, and provide stability," Bourassa explained to Game Developer. He and Sigman seemed eager to stress that this was not a purchase of "last resort" for the company, with the latter co-founder telling us that the company wasn't "actively shopping around" when Behaviour approached them earlier in the year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The two said it was a huge relief to tell their employees about the deal, as it was a rare moment where they couldn't be transparent with the Red Hook team about the company's future thanks to regulatory restrictions that come with acquisitions. They expressed frustration at how the game industry contraction of the last two years has ravaged studios they grew alongside in the 2010s—Bourassa namedropped </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Armello</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> developer League of Geeks as being one of the peer studios that has </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/solium-infernum-developer-league-of-geeks-enters-hibernation-months-after-layoffs">faced the greatest impacts</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Red Hook has stayed profitable during this time period ("We feel fortunate to have threaded that needle," said Bourassa). But Sigman explained being an independent studio left him and his co-founder weighing multiple options for what to do now that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Darkest Dungeon II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was out the door.</span></p><p>Image via Red Hook Studios.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Taking the deal would help narrow those options—and hopefully propel the studio to chase its most ambitious ideas. "What this does is set a clear path for the next X years," he said. The pair weren't eager to give up what those ambitions entailed, but when Bourassa raised the idea of making Darkest Dungeon a "franchise as big as Dragon Age," it helped put things in perspective.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What is the future for Behaviour and Red Hook Studios?">What is the future for Behaviour and Red Hook Studios?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While Red Hook Studios supports </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Darkest Dungeon II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and starts preparing for its grand vision (with little-to-no interference from Behaviour, apparently. Sigman said the publisher "doesn't want to change how we make games"), what can developers expect from Behaviour?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The answer is, of course, horror games...and apparently publishing even more horror games from external developers. In fact, Mulrooney pitched Game Developer readers working on horror games to reach out to the publisher to discuss future relationships.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite the canceling of Project T (itself a horror-themed game, leaving us wondering what exactly made it such an ill fit for the publisher's new plans), Behaviour still has other </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dead by Daylight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> spinoff projects in the works, and the company still sees it as a foundation for its horror ambitions—with Darkest Dungeon now shoring up that base. "Having a second original successful title is appealing," said Racine.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The CEO closed our conversation with what may have been a message for business partners or employees as much as it was for our readers. He said that reducing risk was an important goal for both Behaviour and Red Hook Studios, and that "buying [Red Hook Studios] is reducing risk for Behaviour."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">His explanation certainly adds context to what has been going on at Behaviour for the last year. It paints a picture of a studio that had embarked on one plan prior to the ongoing contraction, and only saw losses if it stuck with that strategy going forward.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's a contrast to many other layoffs we saw this year, where companies watched their coffers empty out due to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/rocksteady-cuts-staff-following-suicide-squad-s-underperformance">declining sales</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/support-studio-tose-posts-multiple-financial-losses-after-cancelled-projects">projects canceled</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by partners. Behaviour and Red Hook both seem to have stayed in command of their fates through this process, being proactive instead of reactive in a time of turmoil.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For many, the tragedy then is that Behaviour chose to lay off so many on its path to planting a bigger flag in the horror genre.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

            <p>If you are keen to play <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarök</a> on PC, but have been put off by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-next-sony-game-coming-to-pc">Sony's PSN linking requirement</a>, there is now a mod that will sort that out for you.</p>
<p>Nexus mods user iArtorias actually created the mod to strip "the PlayStation PC SDK runtime requirement for God of War Ragnarök", however it can also be used to negate PSN linking. The mod - known as <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/22?tab=description">NoPSSDK</a> - removes the PSN overlay, which allows players to bypass linking their Steam account to a PlayStation network account (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/someone-made-a-mod-to-bypass-the-psn-login-for-god-of-war-ragnarok-and-it-works/">PC Gamer</a>).</p>

<p>iArtorias said they created the mod as there are "a number of people that encountered various unexpected errors and issues, e.g. a sudden error message popup and more" when playing God of War Ragnarök on PC.</p>
<p>"This library attempts to resolve all the possible issues related to the PlayStation PC SDK," iArtorias explained. The creator added the mod doesn't make any changes to the original game code, and "is NOT intended to encourage the piracy".</p>
<p>The mod currently has 1764 total downloads.</p>

<p>Soon after its PC debut, God of War Ragnarök received a number of negative Steam reviews. Many of these reviews were taking aim at Sony's controversial requirement for PC users to link to a PSN account. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-ragnarok-is-being-review-bombed-on-steam">As Vikki reported at the weekend</a>, others also left negative reviews due to the "state of the game", reporting issues such as crashes and visual bugs.</p>
<p>While at that time, God of War Ragnarök was sitting with a "mixed" review average, the PC version of the game is now currently up to a "mostly positive" average on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2322010/God_of_War_Ragnark/">Steam</a>.</p>
<p>For more on God of War Ragnarök's PC release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-the-big-god-of-war-ragnorak-pc-tech-interview">Digital Foundry's Alex Battaglia recently spoke to Matt DeWald</a>, lead producer at original developer Sony Santa Monica, and Steve Tolin, technical director of PC port developer Jetpack Interactive.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-has-sim-like-base-building-where-you-manually-place-houses<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
There's more to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> than simply stabbing people through paper doors or charging like a samurai into battle. 
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft's historical adventure series has traditionally given players a home base, and Shadows is no different. Except it is different - in that you can now build said base yourself.
</p>
<p>
A developer diary video posted by <a href="https://www.ign.com.cn/assassins-creed-codename-red/51099/video/ci-ke-xin-tiao-ying-kai-fa-zhe-ri-zhi-di-er-ji">IGN China</a> (now removed, but re-uploaded <a href="https://streamable.com/c6u7v4">elsewhere</a>) has revealed that players will be given an acre of land that serves as a blank canvas on which to build. On it, you can drop down buildings and customise their looks, plus lay down paths and other smaller objects such as water wells.

<p>
This option looks like a sim game, and feels like an evolution of the Viking village you could grow and upgrade over time in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a> - though it remains to be seen how much time you'll spend here. 
</p>
<p>
Valhalla saw players regularly return home between separate story arcs, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Assassin's Creed Odyssey</a> - the last game built by Shadows developer Ubisoft Quebec - eschewed having a base as Kassandra stomped all over Ancient Greece. (Quebec's effort before that, the Victorian <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-syndicate">Assassin's Creed Syndicate</a>, memorably gave players a moving base on a train.)
</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is set to arrive on 15th November - now just seven weeks away. Last month, I sat down with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-developer-on-adapting-japanese-culture-social-media-pressures-and-ubisofts-controversial-apology">Assassin's Creed Shadows' art director to discuss Quebec's adaptation of Japanese culture, social media pressures and more</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>While I’ve been known to enjoy a few of them in my time, I tend to view a lot of more mundane <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulator games</a> in the same way I view sports games: Looks fine, but I could do this stuff in real life, were I inclined and also social and also vaguely limber instead of owning a spine with roughly the flexibility of a rib n’ saucy Nik Nak.</p>

<p>Similarly, the currently popping-off <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3070070/TCG_Card_Shop_Simulator/">on Steam</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tcg-card-shop-simulator">TCG Card Shop Simulator</a> - in its digitisation of a hobby-within-a-hobby-within-a-third-place - feels vaguely like the sort of thing that would have made Baudrillard violently shit himself to death. Still, as someone who frequently fantasises about having a.) a killer deck, b.) lots of mates and c.) a good enough understanding of maths to crush those mates into the dust so hard that they never know joy again, I was intrigued enough to give it a go. 20,000 concurrent players can’t be wrong! We, uh, we don’t <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fine-lets-write-about-the-stupid-banana-game">talk about the banana game</a>.</p>
<p>The basic idea here is that you run a collectible card shop selling a come-at-me-brotendo -branded TCG named Tetramon. You order in some boxes, enjoy a lovely ‘pop’ sound as you arrange booster packs on your shelf, set a price, then open doors. Customers come in, you check out their orders, and I have to say: I’m already starting to see why people dig this one. Every little action feels tuned just so, with everything from scanning packs to giving change accompanied by ear-tickling sound effects. Dinged point: you have to count out change individually, but trying to be a short-changing rapscallion isn’t an option, which would have been fun. What I can say: the music is so carefree and cheerful that it put me in the mood for crime!</p>
<p>I especially wanted to crime the header guy. Two packs?! Get outta here! You get out too!</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/tcg-sim-stinky-man.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

<p>The other side of the game is collecting the cards yourself. I love how this characterises your owner as a little card weasel, rapidly shooing off customers so you can get your grubby mitts on more shinies. My first card was a happy onion named ‘Sapoling’. He’s got 22 health and I’ve got no idea if that’s good yet, but I’m sure he deserves every point. I did notice a nightmarish little wrinkle, though: it tells you the monetary value of every card as you reveal it. Is this what we’ve been reduced to? Can we no longer derive joy from cracking packs for their own sake, but merely from the amount of currency they can be exchanged for? What happened to…</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/tcg-sim-shiny-nimblus.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>OPNeon/Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Wait shut up I got a shiny Nimblis! $5.73 baby! Honey, come quick: we’re eating the good cocoa pops tonight!</p>
<p>You get your own digital binder to collect your cards, and this works as a sort of sub-objective running in tandem to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">management</a> stuff, since you can only stock high-level boosters once you’ve upgraded your shop. As you go, you’ll also get more furnishings, play tables, things of that nature. And, yes, the game couldn’t help itself: some of your customers have giant green cartoon stink clouds that effect the experience of your other customers. Missed opportunity for a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator">Powerwash Simulator</a> minigame, imo.</p>
<p>There’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3103840/TCG_Card_Shop_Simulator_Prologue/">a prologue on Steam</a> if you want to try it out, and even from just a brief piss about, I’m starting to understand the attention it’s getting. It’s nicely made, pleasant, and nostalgic in all the right ways. You can even leave the shop and go for a wander, although there is an invisible wall that stops me going to buy cheap pizza, which I consider an act of violence.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>The protagonist of our story quits his job at an extremely toxic workplace and finds himself at a run-down maid cafe tucked away in a quiet part of Nipponbashi. There, he meets the maid Shiro. One thing leads to another, and he eventually gets appointed as the temporary cafe manager and put in charge of the <a title="Genres > Management [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a> of the maid cafe. As the new manager, his first task is to scout cute girls to work at the cafe. Time to explore Nipponbashi and all the otaku stuff it has to offer!</p><ul><li>Get to know the four unique main girls: Shiro, Miyu, Favna, and Honoka, all voiced.</li><li>Immerse yourself in lighthearted stories about everyday life with the cute maids.</li><li>Enjoy the modern and gorgeous pixel art graphics depicting even the finest details, including the meat buns next to the convenience store cashier and the figures on the shelves of an anime shop.</li><li>Go on fun dates at Nipponbashi, from anime shops to <a title="Platforms > Arcade [372 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/arcade">arcades</a> to the cinema!</li></ul><p><strong>The Four Main Girls of Fuwa Fuwa</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Shiro</strong> – <em>“Um, please be the new manager of the cafe!”</em> A maid who loves Fuwa Fuwa Cafe. A huge otaku for anime and video games, she talks really fast when she’s gushing about the things she loves, and often splurges on merch without thinking whenever she visits an anime shop. A little clumsy, but works hard every day to become the cute maid she’s always wanted to be.</li><li><strong>Miyu</strong> – <em>“Hey Mr. <a title="Series > Mana [15 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ger, thanks a bunch for hanging out with me today~☆”</em> A game otaku and gyaru with a big appetite. Loves both eating and <a title="Genres > Cooking [12 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">cooking</a>, and apparently really enjoys serving her cooking to customers at Fuwa Fuwa Cafe. Is actually Shiro’s friend on the online game Magic Angel, so they knew each other before actually meeting in real life.</li><li><strong>Favna</strong> – <em>“I am the Slayer of the False God, the Queen of the Kingdom of Darkness, the All-Seeing Oracle, the Guardian of the Dream of All Things—“</em> A mysterious girl dressed in gothic Lolita fashion. Speaks in riddles and demands the protagonist become her familiar. She sometimes accidentally drops the edgy act when she’s taken by surprise though, so maybe she’s just got a serious case of chuunibyou…?</li><li><strong>Honoka</strong> – <em>“Ya want a thrivin’ business? That there sounds like a job for our shrine!”</em> A girl with a Kansaiben dialect who works as a shrine maiden at her family shrine. Practically in charge of the shrine, she is reliable and very good at handling money, and has a strong sense of responsibility to boot. On top of that, she’s also the only glasses girl at Fuwa Fuwa Cafe!</li></ul><p><strong>Support Your Maid Cafe Employees as the Manager</strong></p><p>As the cafe manager, it’s your job to allocate work to your maids. Make sure to give the right girl the right job! For example, Shiro is always enthusiastic to serve customers, and Miyu is great in the kitchen.</p><p>Of course, you can’t just sit there while they work. During opening hours, you’ll also have to make coffee and help out on the floor, so it’s not as easy as it sounds!</p><p><strong>The Stunning Sights of Nipponbashi</strong></p><p>In order to recreate the atmosphere of the real Nipponbashi, the game features several real stores you can find there, such as Surugaya, Sofmap, Dragon Star, Super Potato, and Karaoke Rainbow, among many others. Don’t forget to pay them a visit when you’re shopping or taking one of your maids on a date!</p><p><strong>Collectable Capsule Toys</strong></p><p>If you’ve been to the real Nipponbashi, you’ll know that there are capsule toy machines all over the area. In this game, you can also try your hand at collecting your favorite capsule toy series and experience that unique gacha thrill of not knowing what you’re getting. As you collect more toys, you can even bring them up in conversations with the girls. Keep cranking those machines until you’ve collected them all!</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Once the toll of an ominous bell is heard, the village is soon threatened by a demon invasion.

This is rdein, creator of the <em>Momodora</em> series. Recently my team and I have announced the latest installment in the series, <em>Moonlit Farewell</em>. This is a concluding story, following through from the events of <em>Momodora III</em>. With this new tale, I also intend to close the book on many of the past games’ mysteries and questions.</p><p>I’m aware that many players are more familiar with the story of Kaho, which is set in a distant past. As such, I’m designing <em>Moonlit Farewell</em> to be as enjoyable as possible without prior knowledge of <em>Momodora I</em> to <em>III</em>‘s stories. Moreover, the series has always been focused on action and minimal stories. So please, don’t worry too much about “catching up”!</p><p>Lastly, we hope to bring you our best game with this new title, using all the knowledge we’ve learned in the past ten years. So please don’t forget to head over to the Steam page and hit that wishlist button, and stay tuned for the <em>Momodora: Moonlit Farewell</em>!</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
