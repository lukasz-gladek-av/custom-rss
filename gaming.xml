The game was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-games-showcase/2023/06/11/clockwork-revolution-is-a-time-bending-steampunk-rpg-from-the-makers">first announced</a> at this same Xbox Games Showcase back in 2023, but today’s presentation offered a much deeper look at what we can expect.&nbsp;</p><p>In Clockwork Revolution, players take on the role of a customized character named Morgan Vanette, who lives in a seemingly steampunk-inspired alternate history of 1895, in the city of Avalon in a neighborhood called The Tangle. Part of a gang known as the Rotten Row Hooligans, Morgan navigates a world populated both by people and clockwork individuals, and some that seem halfway between the two.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l421zRNnivo"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l421zRNnivo" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Gameplay shows off plenty of sneaking and combat, as well as some extensive customization tools for both character visuals and weapons. But the most intriguing gameplay shows off special time powers that let Morgan do things like rewind time, rebuild destroyed structures, slow down enemy bullets, and in a larger sense, rewrite the flow of history.</p><p>There’s no word yet on when we can expect Clockwork Revolution to arrive, but the game is targeting a launch on Xbox Series X/S and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
With its 11th July release date closing in, Activision has announced a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</a> demo, but it's a pre-order exclusive, making it the opposite of 'try before you buy'.
</p>
<p>
As we learned previously, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 is a ground-up remake of the beloved skating games, and brings a range of "modern upgrades" - including "new skaters, gnarlier tricks, an even sicker soundtrack", alongside new parks (a water park, pinball table, and movie studio are confirmed), plus cross-platform online multiplayer for up to eight skaters.
</p>
<p>
Multiplayer includes the new HAWK mode, which sees players dropping letters in hard-to-find spots then racing to find as many as they can within the time limit. There's also the sandbox-y Free Skate mode, plus a range of different activities within the Competitive playlist: Trick Attack, Score Challenge, Combo Mambo, Combo Challenge, and Graffiti.

Additionally, there's an appearance from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle's Michelangelo, who arrives as an unlockable "secret" skater.
</p>
<p>
Actvision has also confirmed the return of Create-A-Skater, alongside an upgraded version Create-A-Park, which introduces new props - including speed boost pads and musical notes - and the ability to add custom goals. Players fond of documenting their skating highlights can also make use of a new photo mode.
</p>
<p>
Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be available for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Switch, PC, and Game Pass when it launches on 11th July, with a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a> release date to be announced "later".
</p>
<p>
As for that demo, it's out today on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, and features the Foundry and College parks, skaters Tony Hawk and Rayssa Leal, plus a limited selection of songs. However, you'll need to pre-order the full game in order to access it.

		<p>The Sunday of not-E3 is renowned as Microsoft’s time to shine. It’s fair to say that recent years haven’t quite set hearts racing, no matter how good Xbox output like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Avowed have been, so it’s a welcome surprise to find that Xbox haven’t just rolled out a few smart-looking trailers, with the earth-shattering announcement that they’re set to release the very first Xbox handheld. It’s not even just one, with the ROG Xbox Ally and the ROG Xbox Ally X providing two different tiers of Xbox handheld. This is a great day for Xbox gamers.</p>
<p><iframe title="ROG Xbox Ally World Premiere Reveal Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FIVmyOIV1MQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The quickest among you will note that the ROG Ally is a thing that already exists. ROG’s Ally, and it’s more powerful follow-up the Ally X, are PC handhelds that have spent the last few years competing with Valve’s Steam Deck for portable PC gamers’ hearts. There’s a very strong argument to say that they’re the better option, though they’ve been hamstrung by Microsoft’s own Windows platform which was never made specifically for a handheld format. </p>
<p>The ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X are the best of both worlds, the partnership between the two companies giving you access to your entire Xbox library as well as opening up the world of PC gaming to you as well, including all of the PC based stores like Steam and the Epic Game Store. </p>
<p>The Xbox Ally and Ally X have had some obvious physical changes made to them over ROGs older versions of the Ally, most noticeably in the extended, and presumably far more ergonomic hand grips. The Steam Deck’s comfort levels were the last bastion of defence that Steam Deck owners had over Ally owners, and we can’t wait to see if the Xbox Ally and Ally X trounce them, becoming the most comfortable PC handheld out there. </p>


<p>They’ve got some pretty impressive specs under the hood. Both have AMD processors, with the Xbox Ally toting an AMD Ryzen Z2 A Processor, alongside 16GB of RAM and a 512GD SSD. The Xbox Ally X meanwhile has a Ryzen AI Z2 Extreme processor as well as a massive 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage. They’re both going to be serious gaming machines – the original Ally has been a fantastic option, with a less powerful chipset, so we can’t wait to see how the new pair will perform. </p>
<p>Both have 7″ 1080p full HD screens, with a 120Hz refresh rate, and Freesync Premium onboard, which should mean everything will look super smooth and bright.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ambrosia Sky Preview - Fighting Against Fungus]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/ambrosia-sky-preview-fighting-against-fungus</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ambrosia-sky-preview-fighting-against-fungus.1212537/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/ambrosia-sky-preview-fighting-against-fungus<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There's just something so satisfying about cleaning up a mess -- provided it's in a video game. Real-life messes are no fun, but for some reason, power-washing that house is just too satisfying. The upcoming&nbsp;<em>Ambrosia Sky</em>&nbsp;provides that same satisfaction, but with a deadly twist.</p>

<p>Indeed, usually nothing is fighting back against you as you clean, but in&nbsp;<em>Ambrosia Sky</em>, a deadly fungus seeks you out. A so-called first-person, immersive "clean 'em up" from developer Soft Rains,&nbsp;<em>Ambrosia Sky's&nbsp;</em>fungal foe is truly terrifying.</p>



<h2>It's Time for Cleanup&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Let's set the stage. It's far into the future and you're a "Scarab," essentially an undertaker that helps the deceased pass on. She's also something of a space "disaster specialist," armed with tools to clean up the contamination.</p>

<p>We begin the demo in a space station. The aim is to find a body and help it pass on, but this fungus is everywhere. Working our way through the space station, going past deadly fungus some of it is electric, and other variants literally&nbsp;<em>seek you out</em>.</p>



<p>This is where&nbsp;<em>Ambrosia Sky&nbsp;</em>really impressed me. This fungus is forming around you quickly, and it's so fast that you become surrounded. Just seeing this amalgamation build up around you is an impressive technical feat.</p>

<p>Not only that, it's how you can clean up this fungus that is equally impressive. Soft Rains has developed a technology called "Quantized Impact Field." It's a mouthful, but hey, it works quite well.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The fungus are voxels, but the tech hides it very well. Cleaning the fungus with various sprays at your disposal break it down; in other words, volumetric cleaning.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Spray it All Away</h2>

<p>The sprayer you have is a cool tool. Like I said, cleaning is satisfying, and so is spraying down the fungus and having it crumble away. There are various sprays, like the basic, which is great for cleaning, but also others like fire and electric.</p>

<p>Fire can spread, by the way, and I haven't found a good use for it yet. Electric spray, on the other hand, allows players to activate doors without a direct line to power. Shoot spray at the top of the door and keep spraying until it hits an active power source, and there you go, it's on!</p>

<p>You can also change the nozzle, so the spray can go straight, vertical, or horizontal. In one segment, the gravity in the space station is turned off. Because of that, the spray no longer arcs due to gravity and allows you to clean all the more effectively.</p>



<h2><em>Ambrosia Sky</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>It's also worth nothing, the developers aren't necessarily aiming for a highly detailed art style, but the Quantized Impact Field makes up for a lot of it. Combined with excellent use of lighting,&nbsp;<em>Ambrosia Sky</em>&nbsp;is a promising game.</p>

<p>While it'll likely take several more years to develop, a demo is available today on Steam, so if cleaning up some deadly shrooms tickles your fancy, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3716830/Ambrosia_Sky_Demo/" rel="nofollow">check it out</a>!</p>

            <p>Ubisoft are nowhere to be found during this year's not-E3 season, meaning there's no opportunity for the French publisher to announce six new games they'll never release. I still crave a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a> fix, however, and Mudang: Two Hearts delivered, kinda. It's Korean, it's got fast-moving rage zombies, but it's also got men shimmying up pipes, cinematic brawls, and a rapid-cut montage of knife crimes. You should watch the trailer.

<p>"In the not-too-distant future, the divided nations of South and North Korea are on the verge of reunification," begins the game's blurb. "On the day when the historic bill was set to pass, a mystery terrorist group attacks the South Korean National Assembly, throwing the entire nation into chaos. Sent to uncover the truth, a North Korean soldier stumbles upon a K-Pop star and is given a new mission: protect the girl who can unravel it all."
</p>
<p>Hard to say which part of that seems less realistic, but the important thing is it's described as a stealth action thriller. Whether I'm a Fisherlike or a K-pop star, all I want to do is shimmy along ledges and press some QTE prompts during hand-to-hand combat with a man whose head is magnetically drawn towards the nearest mirror.
</p>
<p>That's about all we know for now, but Mudang will apparently launch sometime in 2026.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A 3D sequel to the masochistic 2010 platformer Super Meat Boy was announced at the Xbox showcase. It's simply called Super Meat Boy 3D and it basically looks exactly how you'd expect in the trailer below.</p>

<p>Note to meat marketers: the green pipe fakeout only works for anyone watching the showcase live. Everyone else knows this is about the little bleedy guy by the time they click on the video. But good effort. </p>
<p>As you can see, the trailer shows a lot of bear traps, chainsaws, sawblades, lasers, slime blocks, molten steel, and angry robots. I can't really stand a 3D platformer, to be frank. Not since Gex. But I'm sure plenty of Super Meat Stans will get stuck in. </p>
<p>A sequel to the original platformer, Super Meat Boy Forever, was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/super-meat-boy-forever-is-out-now">released in 2020</a> but it was an auto-runner and maybe didn't hit the previous game's sweet spot of tough-but-fair fatality that some precision platforming nerds loved. This sequel is made by the same studio, Team Meat, but the original developer of the little red eejit, Edmund McMillen, is off making something else entirely: an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-trailer-for-the-binding-of-isaac-devs-next-game-mewgenics-answers-none-of-the-many-questions-i-have">"endless cat-breeding RPG"</a> called <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mewgenics">Mewgenics</a>.

While there was no footage to debut, the executive quietly let slip that a new <em>Forza </em>is coming next year as well as the “return of a classic” that’s been with Xbox from the beginning. It’s hard to imagine that’s anything other than the previously reported <em>Halo: Combat Evolved </em>remaster.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196915" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Halo’s Joseph Morgan On Playing Nuanced Characters And The Flaws of Season 1" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="158" data-playlist="196915,196917,197533" data-current="196915"><div><p>Halo’s Joseph Morgan On Playing Nuanced Characters And The Flaws of Season 1</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196915/196915_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196915/196915_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196915/196915_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196915/196915_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22479.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“As we think about bringing a new generation of players to these iconic franchises I’m excited to share that players will get to celebrate 25 years of Xbox with a new <em>Fable</em>, the next <em>Forza</em>, <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em>, and the return of a classic that’s been with us since the beginning,” Spencer said near the end of the livestream. </p><p>That tiny, innocuous-sounding snippet was full of news. The <em>Gears of War</em> prequel didn’t previously have a release window and the newest <em>Forza </em>hadn’t previously been mentioned at all (will it be <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> or something else?) But the detail most fans will be glomming onto is the hint at the original <em>Halo</em>’s return.</p><p>That game, previously reported by <em>The Verge</em>’s Tom Warren to be a remaster of <em>Halo: Combat Evolved </em>in Unreal Engine 5, will presumably follow in the footsteps of the recent remaster of<em> The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion,&nbsp;</em>which Microsoft shadow-dropped last month. If that ends up being the case, the <em>Halo</em> remaster will likely be the original game running with overhauled graphics and some tweaked systems, though unlike <em>Oblivion</em>, there is already an HD<em> Master Chief Collection</em> players can use to access Bungie’s hit 2001 shooter. We’ll have to wait to learn more to see if <em>Combat Evolved</em> gets a more fundamental reworking to make it stand out on modern platforms. </p><p>Whatever it ends up being, it’s almost a guaranteed thing that a <em>Halo </em>remaster will be coming to PlayStation 5 as well, potentially serving as the perfect starting point to bring the iconic Xbox exclusive to Sony’s console for the first time ever. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-playstation-xbox-fans-react-angry-1851752763&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/forza-horizon-5-ps5-playstation-xbox-fans-react-angry-1851752763">And while that multiplatform push has left some fans wondering</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-fans-content-creators-ps5-ports-starfield-rumors-1851230962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-fans-content-creators-ps5-ports-starfield-rumors-1851230962">why they bothered buying an Xbox console at all this generation</a></span>, Spencer’s last-minute sound-bite suggests next year will be full of nostalgia for those who have been with the platform for decades.

                <p>Season 17 of Rare's online pirate title Sea of Thieves was announced at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, and it'll add a mischievous new faction to the game's sandbox called The Smuggler's League. The upcoming season, titled Smugglers' Tide, begins in August and includes new Voyages and some of the most powerful explosives in the game.</p><p>Judging from the trailer, The Smuggler's League is all about, well, smuggling loot, salvaging treasure and other goodies from sunken ships or stealing them from other players. Some of the new loot showcased in the trailer includes crates filled with golden bottles and black gunpowder barrels, which will most certainly explode if mishandled, but players can weaponize their explosive capabilities.</p><p>Watch the trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GalWScU3-dU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GalWScU3-dU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The trailer showcases characters using harpoon guns to snag loot and employing stealth tactics to make off with explosive barrels. While the trailer doesn't go into detail about faction-specific rewards, expect to earn several exclusive cosmetics for completing Smuggler's Voyages and commendations.</p><p>The current season of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-should-have-copycats-by-now-heres-why-its-still-one-of-a-kind/1100-6531724/" data-ref-id="1100-6531724" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-should-have-copycats-by-now-heres-why-its-still-one-of-a-kind/1100-6531724/">one-of-a-kind Sea of Thieves</a>, titled Reapers Rule, began on May 22, adding new content for The Reaper's Bones faction. The season also added a new Voyage, the ability to summon NPC skeletons to assist your crew, and a portable cannon called the Cannon of Rage.</p><p>Rare is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-gives-update-on-missing-in-action-rare-game-everwild/1100-6529543/" data-ref-id="1100-6529543" data-mce-href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-gives-update-on-missing-in-action-rare-game-everwild/1100-6529543/">developing a title called Everwild</a>, but the game was a no-show at this year's Xbox Games Showcase.</p>

                <p>Keeper, the newest game from acclaimed adventure-game developers Double Fine and veteran designer Lee Petty, was revealed at the Xbox Games Showcase. As the name implies, the game involves a moving lighthouse--though whether you're playing and the lighthouse or a being managing it (a "keeper") isn't quite clear. A green bird appears frequently alongside the lighthouse, seeming to aid and guide the lighthouse as it travels through a variety of colorful environments including gemstone-adorned caves, treacherous cliffsides, ancient ruins, and a desolate plain. The bird also seems to be important for solving puzzles, as the trailer demonstrates.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AWAwVgTsFfk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/AWAwVgTsFfk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>We also get a brief look at some very large beings that could either be mechanical monstrosities or organic giants. How the lighthouse will deal with these obstacles, or if they're even threats at all, remains unclear. Keeper will release on Xbox Series X and PC on October 17, 2025.</p>

The game is fully 3D and looks every bit as challenging as the games that preceded it.

<p>
Beast of Reincarnation takes place in a post-apocalyptic Japan as players take the role of Emma the Sealer confronting the source of the world's corruption to save humanity.
</p>
<p>
The trailer for the action-adventure game showed plenty of third-person combat against giant beasts, as well as exploration and platforming. It certainly has a very unique and intriguing world mixing traditional and sci-fi aesthetics.
</p>
<p>
The game will be published by Fictions, a new game publisher founded by a collection of game developers.
</p>
<p>
"It's incredible to be working with game director Furushima-san and the renowned development team at Game Freak. We greatly value their continued collaboration and trust," said Mika Kurasawa, executive producer at Fictions. "We are so excited to show players a glimpse into the stunning world and intense combat of Beast of Reincarnation."

		<p>Coming from Lee Petty and Double Fine, Keeper is a wonderful looking narrative adventure where you play as a lighthouse come to life.</p>
<p><iframe title="Keeper - Official Announce Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AWAwVgTsFfk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“Keeper is a story told without words”, Double Fine writes in the trailer blurb, “in which a long-forgotten lighthouse is awakened and, joined by a spirited seabird, embarks upon a heartening tale of unlikely companionship and an unexpected journey into realms beyond understanding.”</p>
<p>It honestly looks delightful with all the charm that you would expect from Double Fine. The Lighthouse reassembles itself after falling over in a storm, forming legs for itself and then scrambling crab-like across the land. The rickety structure is full of personality, and can look and shine light from its top. It also makes friends with a seabird who wants to come along for the ride.</p>
<p>Keeper is in development for Xbox Series X|S, PC and will on Xbox Game Pass on day one, the game launching on 17th October.</p>

<p>This is the first game from Double Fine since Psychonauts 2, which I handed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/23/psychonauts-2-review/">a fantastic 9/10 back in 2021</a>. Is said, “A decade and a half on from the original, Psychonauts 2 is a worthy successor to Double Fine’s cult classic. The platforming and combat gameplay is tighter, the world design is as varied and inventive as ever, and while the story is full of twists, turns and comedic moment, there’s also a wonderful sense of empathy and tenderness throughout. Simply put, Psychonauts 2 has been worth the wait.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-will-arrive-later-in-2025-and-is-still-launching-on-last-gen-consoles/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Closing out the Xbox Games Showcase 2025 was the reveal of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, a sequel to last year's Black Ops 6, due out sometime later this year, set over four decades into the future after the events of the last campaign.</p>
<p>All we got was a teaser trailer and the reveal that this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2025-to-feature-six-fully-fledged-round-based-zombies-maps-rumor/">Call of Duty</a> is once again a new Black Ops title, but one notable fact missing in the teaser is that Call of Duty is, for at least another year, still launching on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Of course, it'll also launch on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>
<p>Black Ops 7 is also the latest Call of Duty to add some celebrity star-power to its cast, with Milo Ventimiglia as David Mason, the game's protagonist. While the teaser doesn't show any gameplay or reveal any hints as to what's changing in this year's Call of Duty game, it does make it clear that the campaign will lean more into the fantastical, similar to what players saw in Black Ops 6.</p>
<p>"<em>Our official teaser sets the tone for players to embrace the madness that's incoming with Black Ops 7's story,</em>" Activision's head of publishing and marketing, Tyler Bahl, told <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/call-duty-black-ops-7-reveal">Windows Central</a> in an interview.</p>
<p>"<em>Delivering consecutive Black Ops games also allows our teams the tremendous opportunity to tap not only into our own creativity but also embrace the shift from a '90s setting to the new 2035 future setting within our marketing</em>."</p>
<p>One interesting bit revealed in an<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/08/xbox-games-showcase-2025-recap-everything-announced/"> Xbox Wire</a> post following the showcase is that the campaign will be playable entirely in co-op, and that it's once again Raven Software behind the campaign mode.</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 - Official Teaser | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dZdRDyYGoQg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While Raven Software is leading up the campaign, the game's development is primarily being led by Treyarch. Though, as is the case with all Call of Duty games, several of the studios under Activision will be working on Black Ops 7.</p>
<p>This teaser was just the beginning of what will surely be a massive marketing campaign for Black Ops 7, with more to come later this summer. "<em>The full reveal of Black Ops 7 is coming later this summer, so the community should be on the lookout for teases, clues, and the surprises that the Black Ops series is known for,</em>" Bahl said in the same aforementioned interview. "<em>It's an exciting time as we prepare for a new Call of Duty reveal, and the next great experience to come</em>."</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-news-and-announcements.1212435/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, Xbox held its annual Xbox Games Showcase, and it contained glimpses of what lies in store for Xbox fans around the world. Here's everything that was announced during the show!</p>

<hr><h2><em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>release date revealed</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-release-date-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=fxeDrWTh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-release-date-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=KLBxjrb1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>arrives this October.</figcaption></figure><p>The show kicked off with a release date for&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, as well as a new look at the setting of Obsidian's new action RPG. It all looks very wacky and very satirical, just like the first game. This one's launching on October 29th.</p>

<h2><em>High on Life 2&nbsp;</em>has more crazy talking weapons and colorful action</h2>

<p>Next up, Squanch Games announced&nbsp;<em>High on Life 2</em>, a sequel to the 2022 shooter that looks to offer much of the same colorful, fast-paced action (and plenty of talking weapons, of course). It's coming this winter, and you'll be able to play it on day one with Game Pass.</p>

<h2><em>Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy&nbsp;</em>looks very odd indeed</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resonance-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=PBK85eCz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resonance-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=wh23j_R9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Believe it or not, this is a&nbsp;<em>Plague Tale&nbsp;</em>game.</figcaption></figure><p>From Asobo Studio and Focus Entertainment comes&nbsp;<em>Resonance: A Plague Tale Legacy</em>, which is presumably some kind of&nbsp;<em>Plague Tale&nbsp;</em>spinoff. We didn't get too much on this one; just a cinematic trailer, a 2026 release window, and a lot of questions. Day one on Game Pass again!</p>

<h2>A special Xbox ROG Ally is coming this holiday season</h2>

<p>Oh, Xbox, you cheeky monkeys. Next up is an announcement for a special ROG Xbox Ally handheld, with an X variant also available with superior specs. Both consoles prominently show&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>being played on them, because of course.</p>

<h2><em>The Blood of Dawnwalker&nbsp;</em>gets a spooky new trailer</h2>

<p>Next, Rebel Wolves and Bandai Namco showed off&nbsp;<em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em>, their upcoming vampiric action RPG. We got to see some suitably dark combat and traversal gameplay, but we didn't get a release date; just a 2026 release window.</p>

<h2>Meat Boy returns in a 3D platforming extravaganza</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/meat-boy-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=PSxQlTFx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/meat-boy-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=It14mbQ3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Super Meat Boy 3D&nbsp;</em>is pretty self-explanatory.</figcaption></figure><p>Iconic platforming blob Meat Boy made a return in the next trailer, which eschews his usual hyper-masocore 2D trappings in favor of a 3D environment. It is, as you might expect, called&nbsp;<em>Super Meat Boy 3D</em>, and it's coming early next year.</p>

<h2><em>Ninja Gaiden 4&nbsp;</em>gets a release date and an ultra-fast-paced trailer</h2>




<p>If you were worried&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4&nbsp;</em>wouldn't offer the same ridiculously fast-paced action for which the series is known, today's trailer should have put your fears to rest. It's coming on October 21st.</p>

<h2><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&nbsp;</em>is getting story DLC</h2>

<p>A brand new story expansion for&nbsp;<em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle&nbsp;</em>is on its way, and I for one am glad, because I can't get enough of that Troy Baker voice.&nbsp;<em>The Order of Giants&nbsp;</em>arrives on September 4th.</p>

<h2>Game Freak reveals&nbsp;<em>Beast of Reincarnation</em></h2>

<p><em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>studio Game Freak making a&nbsp;<em>Nier Automata</em>-style action RPG wasn't on my bingo card, but there it is.&nbsp;<em>Beast of Reincarnation&nbsp;</em>is coming sometime next year.</p>

<h2><em>Clockwork Revolution&nbsp;</em>is another intriguing-looking action RPG</h2>




<p>Next, inXile showed off its upcoming steampunk action RPG&nbsp;<em>Clockwork Revolution</em>, which looks like it'll combine the likes of&nbsp;<em>Dishonored</em>,&nbsp;<em>BioShock</em>, and Obsidian's own&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds</em>. You can play this one "in due time", so no release date, unfortunately.</p>

<h2>Obsidian announces&nbsp;<em>Grounded 2</em></h2>

<p>Miniaturized survival game&nbsp;<em>Grounded&nbsp;</em>is getting a followup, Obsidian revealed during today's show. It's a very vibrant-looking survival game that's coming to Game Preview on July 29th, which ain't too far off at all.</p>

<h2>Bloober Team's&nbsp;<em>Cronos: The New Dawn&nbsp;</em>scares up a storm this fall</h2>

<p>If, like anyone else with taste, you were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/callisto-protocol-review" rel="nofollow">disappointed by&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/callisto-protocol-review" rel="nofollow">The Callisto Protocol</a>&nbsp;</em>(sorry, fans), then&nbsp;<em>Cronos: The New Dawn&nbsp;</em>might be the antidote you've been waiting for. This Bloober Team survival horror game launches in fall.</p>

<h2><em>Aphelion&nbsp;</em>is a cinematic-looking adventure game from Don't Nod</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dont-nod-aphelion-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=d5uaPz5R 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dont-nod-aphelion-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=1x9_VOZB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Aphelion&nbsp;</em>almost feels like a throwback to games like&nbsp;<em>Uncharted</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Our next reveal was&nbsp;<em>Aphelion</em>, an adventure game from Don't Nod that looks like it owes more than a small debt to the likes of&nbsp;<em>Uncharted&nbsp;</em>and the newer&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>games. It's being made in collaboration with the European Space Agency, and it launches next year.</p>

<h2><em>No Ghosts at the Grand&nbsp;</em>is almost certainly lying to you</h2>




<p>Next, it's a frankly bizarre-looking game (and I say that as a compliment) that appears to be one part renovation sim to one part spooky horror game and another part...er, reggae musical? It's definitely not a no from me.&nbsp;<em>No Ghosts at the Grand&nbsp;</em>launches next year as a day one Game Pass title.</p>

<h2><em>Age of Mythology: Retold&nbsp;</em>is getting Japanese gods in fall</h2>

<p>More gods are on their way to&nbsp;<em>Age of Mythology: Retold&nbsp;</em>thanks to the&nbsp;<em>Heavenly Spear&nbsp;</em>DLC, which brings the ancient Japanese pantheon in fall. We got a glimpse of some iconic Japanese gods, like Yamata-no-Orochi, in the trailer.</p>

<h2><em>Mudang: Two Hearts&nbsp;</em>tackles a twisty-turny Korean story</h2>




<p>Next up, we got a look at a brand new game by the name of&nbsp;<em>Mudang: Two Hearts</em>, and it looks like a pretty original prospect. Gameplay looks to be split between open-ended stealthy shooting and setpieces, but we'll get to find out when it launches in 2026.</p>

<h2>Thunderful announces&nbsp;<em>Planet of Lana 2: Children of the Leaf</em></h2>

<p><em>Planet of Lana 2: Children of the Leaf&nbsp;</em>is a followup to the 2023 cinematic platformer, and it'll return to the story of Lana and Mui, utilizing a very similar-looking visual and gameplay style to the original. It's coming next year, because of course it is.</p>

<h2><em>Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive&nbsp;</em>brings the anime to life this year (and next)</h2>

<p>Next, we got to see some suitably anime-looking gameplay for the action RPG&nbsp;<em>Solo Leveling: Arise Overdrive</em>, which comes to PC this year and to Xbox next year. It adapts the popular anime, so if you're a fan, it's safe to start getting excited.</p>

<h2><em>Aniimo&nbsp;</em>has very strong&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>vibes, but without the guns</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aniimo-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=CunMeAA6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aniimo-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=27gE1gsL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Aniimo&nbsp;</em>feels like a more peaceful&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If you thought&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>was perhaps a touch too edgy for your tastes (as I did), then&nbsp;<em>Aniimo&nbsp;</em>looks like it might be the game for you. It's got similar open-world&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>-style vibes, but without the guns and forced labor. It's coming in 2026.</p>

<h2><em>Spiritfarer&nbsp;</em>studio Thunder Lotus announces&nbsp;<em>Fate's End</em></h2>

<p><em>Fate's End&nbsp;</em>is a brand new sidescroller from&nbsp;<em>Spiritfarer&nbsp;</em>studio Thunder Lotus, and it looks to marry that developer's love of hand-drawn art and storytelling with a more hands-on style reminiscent of&nbsp;<em>Jotunn</em>. This one launches...yup, you guessed it. Next year.</p>

<h2><em>Persona 4&nbsp;</em>is absolutely getting that remake we all knew about</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona-4-revival-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=UDzywbYe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona-4-revival-xbox-games-showcase-2025.jpg?itok=EfyUAK5b 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yeah, that&nbsp;<em>Persona 4&nbsp;</em>remake is real. Surprise surprise.</figcaption></figure><p>At this point, all that remained for Atlus was to make its&nbsp;<em>Persona 4&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-4-remake-domain-registration" rel="nofollow">remake</a> official given comments <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-4-remake-yuri-lowenthal" rel="nofollow">made by certain voice actors</a>, and the studio did exactly that in this show. It's called&nbsp;<em>Persona 4 Revival</em>, but we don't have a release date yet.</p>

<h2><em>Invincible VS&nbsp;</em>is a three-on-three tag fighter based on the comics</h2>

<p>Next up, we got to see Skybound Games and Quarter Up's&nbsp;<em>Invincible VS</em>, a fighting game based on the comics (and the popular animated show) coming next year. It looks exactly as bloodily brutal as you'd expect.</p>

<h2><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>XVI&nbsp;</em>are coming to Xbox</h2>

<p>Square Enix revealed that both&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>will make their way to Xbox, with&nbsp;<em>VII Remake&nbsp;</em>coming this winter and&nbsp;<em>XVI&nbsp;</em>coming...well, today! You can pick the latter up right now. I'm <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">not surprised the studio has made this decision</a>.</p>

<h2>Double Fine's next game lets you, er, play as a lighthouse</h2>




<p>Well, I can't say it's ever been done before, at any rate. Double Fine announced its next game during the show, and you get to play as a rather adorable combination of a lighthouse and a scraggly-looking bird.&nbsp;<em>Keeper&nbsp;</em>launches on October 17th.</p>

<h2><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7&nbsp;</em>is coming, and it looks trippy as heck</h2>




<p>The final announcement during today's show was, of course,&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>, and it concludes with a confrontation between&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 2&nbsp;</em>protagonist David Mason and Raul Menendez, with plenty of trippy-looking architecture and futuristic trappings to boot.</p>

            <p>'Weird' is one of those words I try to avoid because it usually just means "I'm not going to even attempt to understand or unpack the specific thing this is going for", but supernatural hotel renovator <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand">There Are No Ghosts At The Grand</a> really stood out to me this evening for a tone that felt pretty singular in a weekend weighed down by soulslikes and shooters. Broadly, it looks like your Powerwash Sims and House Flippers, but with the added wrinkle that neither of the games feature dapper old gents crooning ska ditties at you. Here's a trailer.</p>

<p>So, yeah: I'm into more or less everything here. The secrets and puzzles to solve between renovations. The ghostbustery multitool. The We Have The Specials At The Hotel soundtrack. The Wicker Man reference. The spiders stealing fire extinguishers and washing machines. It looks like a game with ideas, basically. And even if some those ideas are distinctly 'like that other thing', I dig the way they've been implemented. Also, one of those ideas is 'go for a motorbike ride with a cat'. Information's a bit scant on this one so far, but it's due for a release sometime next year.</p>

            <p>Double Fine's next game is called Keeper and it's about steering a four-legged lighthouse through a lush 3D world, with some puzzle-solving along the way. Its creation is being led by Lee Petty, who was previously project lead on Double Fine's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rad">RAD</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/headlander">Headlander</a>. There's a trailer below, which also brings news that it won't be long before it releases.

<p>Cor, it certainly looks nice, doesn't it? 
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/08/keeper-double-fine-xbox-games-showcase/">Xbox Wire post</a> doesn't contain too much more information about what you do in the game beyond what's shown in the trailer. It does mention that the initial inspiration lay in the pandemic, the isolation of lockdowns and the escape offered by walks in nature near where director Lee Petty lived. 
</p>
<p>Double Fine are most closely associated with company founder Tim Schafer, the creative lead behind their point-and-click adventures and more recently <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/psychonauts-2">Psychonauts 2</a>. There are plenty of other creative leads at the studio though, and Alec and Sin previously enjoyed both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/headlander-review">Headlander</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rad-review">RAD</a> in their respective reviews.
</p>
<p>I don't need to know more. If it's fairly straightforward cinematic platforming in a world that looks like that, I think I'd be happy enough. And the release date - October 17th - doesn't leave much time left to wait.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
