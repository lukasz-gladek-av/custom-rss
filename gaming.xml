			<p>Today, the 2025 roadmap for Once Human was revealed, and with it came some very exciting details for those who play the game. The team behind this horror survival game shared details today on the release date for the mobile version of Once Human, new scenarios coming soon, custom servers, and more. If you want to watch the broadcast for yourself, make sure to check out the video below, where you can watch all of the announcements.</p>

<p>Since its initial release in 2024, Once Human has been highly successful; it has ranked among the top sellers on Steam, and the game has seen <a href="https://wccftech.com/once-human-august-update-out-includes-animal-ranching/">consistent updates</a> that add new content, luring players back into the game and providing them with new ways to enjoy the post-apocalyptic world of Once Human. Below is the official roadmap for 2025, where you can see all of the major updates they have planned for the year.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Admittedly, the three new scenarios for Once Human won't be released until much later in the year, with a set release date during Q3 2025. However, the scenarios now have names, which are the following: Code: Purification, Code: Deviation, and Code: Broken. The details of the scenarios have also been announced so players can know what to expect from them when they are released.</p>
<p>Code: Purification is a scenario where the players must prevent pollution from taking over the environment by participating in dynamic events. Players will be tasked with teaming up to clear up the pollution and see the world clearly and unpolluted once more. This scenario has several endings that players can see, depending on the actions that they take during the scenario.</p>
<p>Code: Deviation revolves around the ally Deviations, who are the most popular characters in Once Human. In this scenario, players are tasked with hunting and capturing them, to then fuse them together to create new Deviations to battle against each other in a tournament.</p>
<p>Code: Broken is a PvP free-for-all, where players will get to battle over ten days with randomized events, resources, and apocalyptic superweapons that will cause absolute havoc on the battlefield. Much like Code: Purification, there are multiple endings for this event.</p>
<p>One of the other major announcements is that the mobile version of Once Human will be launching in April 2025. Currently, those who register their interest in the Once Human Mobile version <a href="https://tracking.us.nylas.com/l/6ce931d3de6e45e0ae0c615902ae457b/3/deaf88540e237b9a0062cc0ed5c4ad92a48dca5fd94a93e6393c76c69ba45504?cache_buster=1734626229" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via a link</a> will have the chance to win rewards, such as money, in-game rewards, or even an iPhone.</p>

			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is not getting a PlayStation 5 Pro patch likely due to the lack of a real path to improve image quality on the system.</p>
<p>Replying to a supporter's question during their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> highlighted how developer CD Projekt Red may have decided not to release a PlayStation 5 Pro patch for their latest game because there was no clear way to offer better image quality, beyond using the console's bigger GPU to enhance the game's Dynamic Resolution Scaling, which is already done via the system's Game Boost feature.</p>
<p>Improving Cyberpunk 2077 ray tracing features could have been among the possibilities on PlayStation 5 Pro, but having been developed with an older SDK, CD Projekt Red didn't have access to certain ray tracing and hardware optimization, and would have had to upgrade SDK first before being able to introduce features like ray-traced reflections or global illumination, something that would have opened more issues and require an engineering effort. Introducing PSSR support, additionally, may not have been worth it, as it may not have offered any substantial improvement over AMD FSR.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cyberpunk 2077: Why Isn't There A PS5 Pro Patch - And What Enhancements Are Possible?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lz5bowN_SLk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While Cyberpunk 2077 will not get a PlayStation 5 Pro update, CDPR still hasn't abandoned the game entirely. A new update was released <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-update-2-2-adds-several-new-customization-features-and-improved-photo-mode/">last week</a>, introducing new features and improvements, such as new customization options for V, new Photo Mode options and more.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phantom Liberty expansion</a> is also available, but only on PC and current generation systems.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-3-quarantine-2025-prelude-demo</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pathologic-3-quarantine-coming-in-2025-not-quite-a-demo.1066311/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-3-quarantine-2025-prelude-demo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Ice-Pick Lodge and publisher HypeTrain Digital have announced&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3: Quarantine</em>, a sort of prologue episode for the main game that you'll be able to play for free next year.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3199650/view/515196772511908425" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement post</a>, Ice-Pick Lodge describes&nbsp;<em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em>as a "free prelude" that's "not quite" a demo, although it has similarities to a demo. The studio compares&nbsp;<em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em>to&nbsp;<em>The Marble Nest</em>, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/505230/view/5156014950378312752" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">teaser</a> released prior to&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 2&nbsp;</em>that Ice-Pick described as a "mood piece".</p>

<p>Despite the similarities,&nbsp;<em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em>won't function in quite the same way as&nbsp;<em>The Marble Nest</em>; rather than being a self-contained story, it'll "showcase fragments of gameplay mechanics, set the stage for the story, and pull back the curtain a bit" with regards to&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>'s world.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathologic-3-quarantine-announced-street.jpg?itok=swgWRvEi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathologic-3-quarantine-announced-street.jpg?itok=XCjK9Yqw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pathologic 3: Quarantine&nbsp;</em>is designed to set up the main&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</em>experience.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em>will, according to Ice-Pick, tie into the events of the main game, and it'll "partially overlap" with&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>'s intro, but it'll also give you the chance to see unique scenes you won't see in the main game.</p>

<p>You'll also get the chance to get your first glimpse of the Capital, where the Bachelor's lab is located, and you'll get to discover what drove the Bachelor to leave his lab. Along the way, you'll be diagnosing patients and trying to figure out their secrets as you go.</p>

<p>We don't have a release date or even a more specific release window for&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3: Quarantine&nbsp;</em>yet, but it goes without saying that you can almost certainly expect this free teaser to arrive sometime before the game itself does.</p>




<p><em>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-3-announced-2025" rel="nofollow">announced back in October</a>, although technically speaking, it was actually <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pathologic-2-bachelors-scenario-announced" rel="nofollow">revealed in July 2020</a> as an expansion to&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 2&nbsp;</em>(which is itself both a remake of and sequel of sorts to the original&nbsp;<em>Pathologic</em>).</p>

<p>As such, in&nbsp;<em>Pathologic 3</em>, you'll play as&nbsp;Daniil Dankovsky, also known as the Bachelor. You arrive in a small town beset by the plague, and it's up to you to discover said plague's mysterious origins and see if you can put a stop to it.</p>

<p><em>Pathologic 3&nbsp;</em>is due to land on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3199650/Pathologic_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a> sometime next year. You can also wishlist the standalone prelude&nbsp;<em>Quarantine&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3199650/Pathologic_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via Steam</a> if you want to.</p>

But if you’re on an extended trip somewhere with no ability to charge it, you may want to try extending that life even further. Here are some tips for extending the battery life on your PlayStation Portal.</p><h2 id="h277"><a id="brightness"></a>Reduce screen brightness</h2><p>This one is a no-brainer. The brighter you keep your screen, the faster your battery will drain. If you’re in a dark room, you should be able to keep the brightness close to its lowest setting, but you may need to increase it again to see the screen in well-lit locations.</p><p>The brightness setting can be accessed on your quick settings tabs, or you can go into Settings &gt; Display and Brightness. You’ll want to do that anyway for the next trick.</p><h2 id="h278"><a id="light"></a>Turn off the light bar</h2><p>The light bar around the rim of the PlayStation Portal controller looks cool, but it can drain your battery a bit. Since the light doesn’t serve any purpose beyond proof that your device is on, it may be worth disabling altogether.</p><p>Go to Settings &gt; Display and Brightness to turn this feature off. While you’re there, you can also disable the mute button light, though I doubt that tiny light affects the battery much, if at all.</p><h2 id="h279"><a id="haptics"></a>Turn off the haptics and trigger effects</h2><p>It goes without saying that the PlayStation Portal’s haptic feedback and trigger effects are awesome, but they can also contribute to battery drain in games that frequently use it (this is also true of the PS5’s DualSense controllers). </p><p>If you head to Settings &gt; Controller, you adjust the intensity of these features. I’d recommend turning them all the way off if your goal is to save as much battery as possible, but even just reducing their intensity will help a little.</p><h2 id="h280"><a id="restmode"></a>Set a reasonable time for entering Rest Mode</h2><p>Lastly, make sure you set a reasonable time for the PlayStation Portal to enter Rest Mode, which will turn the screen off and reduce the amount of power it’s using when you’re not actively using it.</p><p>To adjust this feature, head into Settings &gt; System &gt; Battery. The best time setting would be 30 seconds, but even somewhere around 1-2 minutes should help you reduce battery drain when you’re away from the handheld. </p><p>With all of these settings changed, you should save some battery life on your PlayStation Portal. That means more time to play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-winter-wonderland-christmas-holiday-level-1851721615&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-winter-wonderland-christmas-holiday-level-1851721615"><em>Astro Bot</em>’s new Christmas level</a></span>!</p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Vessel of Hatred was released in October, adding the Spiritborn class and a new jungle region.</p>
<p>"A polished, bewitching upgrade that sinks its claws into you - featuring perhaps the best character class in Diablo's history," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-review">Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred review</a>.</p> <div>

<p>However, Diablo now has strong competition from Path of Exile 2, another ARPG that released into early access this month.</p>
<p>Ahead of its launch it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-director-warns-of-queues-this-weekend-due-to-over-a-million-early-access-players">reached one million early access redemptions</a>, and on Steam it quickly reached a peak <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2694490/charts/">concurrent player count</a> of 578,569.</p>
<p>"Soulslike thrills combine with sky-high production values to make Path of Exile 2 a hugely impressive package, even in early access," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-early-access-review">Path of Exile 2 early access review</a>.</p>
<p>Still, its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-not-rewarding-enough-its-developer-admits-amid-incoming-changes">developer admitted the game was "not rewarding enough"</a> as it addressed early feedback and laid out plans to alter its rewards.</p>
<p>Diablo 4 is also available on Xbox Game Pass.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/20/what-we-played-space-marine-2-behemoth-indiana-jones/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It will probably feel like you’ve got all the time in the world to play games over the next week or two, and my gaming the past seven days has been rather sparse. I’ve dabbled with a little bit of Space Marine 2 and more Darktide – a great one-two punch of big hordes and Warhammer 40K co-op – and dipped a toe back into Helldivers 2 to battle the Illuminate enemies. The definitely make for a good change of pace to the bugs and bots of old, and the new city maps are pretty neat as well.</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has played a handful of different games, with The Thaumaturge and Behemoth in for review, and there’s “the ever-present spectre” of Phasmophobia in his life these days. He also briefly gave TemTem a go –&nbsp;“The fact that Palworld is being sued by Nintendo whilst TemTem is out here untouched whilst being the clearest rip off of Pokémon is kinda silly.”</p>
<p>The Edge of Allegoria is on <strong>Aran’s</strong> plate for a review, which he describes as “a classic Game Boy RPG but with the adult themes turned way up.” He’s also played a bit more of Marvel Rivals with Punisher and Star Lord as his go-to characters, continued on with The Witcher 3 and is just leaving White Orchard, and some more Football Manager 2024, “where I’ve had my contract at Valencia renewed for another 3 years. Probably because I’ve consistently got them into European competitions over the last few seasons and won a couple of trophies. The league eludes me though because of Real Madrid and Barcelona.”</p>


<p><strong>Steve’s</strong> week has mostly featured a combination of Indiana Jones and Nine Sols – “both fantastic games with very different styles and level of challenge. It’s been nice to wander around the world of Indy in between bouts of swearing at difficult boss fights – although I do seem to be faring better in Nine Sols now that I’ve unlocked a few more abilities.”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> watched Secret Levels, which had him wanting to go back to finish off the campaign of Space Marine 2… so he did exactly that, and found it an enjoyable romp on the whole. However, most of his play time has been spent with Kingdom Come: Deliverance – “It’s a drastic change of pace compared to Space Marine 2 and one that immerses you in the life of a peasant looking to climb the ranks in medieval society. It’s a game best savoured slowly, and really isn’t for everyone. I’m hoping to roll credits ahead of the sequel’s release.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> got to check out if Alien: Rogue Incursion was the Alien: Isolation VR game that everyone’s been dreaming about since 2016, but <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/18/alien-rogue-incursion-review/">sadly found out that it isn’t</a>. I guess we hope that Alien: Isolation 2 has VR built in, now?</p>

<p>And we’ll round things out with <strong>Ade</strong>. He’s been playing Lego Horizon Adventures with his son, as a nice change of pace from Minecraft, and Sea of Stars in co-op with his partner. He “me” time has been completely consumed by Unicorn Overlord, though. He recommends that you play the demo and also get hopelessly addicted to it.</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played this week?</p>

That means stories from our reporters covering the most important or weird trends in tech and culture as well as roundups to help you navigate 2024’s many, many releases across game consoles and streaming services.</p><p>So, before we all head into 2025, take a moment to look back on the things you’ve forgotten about — or catch up on those that you missed altogether.</p></div><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article" id="stream-entry-2aea0b74-e2ce-4689-b686-03d57304cf52"></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-2d875479-e31f-457a-a05e-c8653be0edcb"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24305493/apple-arcade-best-games-2024-ios-iphone-ipad">8 great Apple Arcade games for your iPhone or iPad</a></h2><div><figure><span><span></span></span><p><cite>Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty Images</cite></p></figure></div><p>It was a bit of a weird year for Apple’s subscription gaming service. 2024 saw very few notable exclusives launch on Apple Arcade; instead, the service was fleshed out with a number of big games that you can already play on other platforms. It hasn’t been great for showcasing what makes Apple Arcade unique, but on the other hand, it’s hard to complain too much when it means your subscription now includes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame"><em>Balatro</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/23827123/vampire-survivors-news-announcements-updates-dlc-spinoffs"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a>. Here’s the best of what came out this year.</p><p>This poker game has been an unexpected hit ever since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">it launched on PC and consoles at the beginning of the year</a>. It’s sort of like a solo version of poker, only with the gameplay loop of a roguelike, which means that you’ll be collecting rare joker cards to augment your hands as you create a deck capable of turning out absolutely absurd scores. It takes a moment for it to click, but <em>Balatro</em> is particularly well suited to mobile, where you can squeeze in a few quick rounds wherever you are… or accidentally let a few hours go by while you try to complete a run.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24305493/apple-arcade-best-games-2024-ios-iphone-ipad">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-4f306230-c99f-45b7-93bf-108a650a43c7"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24305485/smart-rings-2024-smart-rings-oura-samsung-galaxy">2024 in wearables: the year of the smart ring</a></h2><div><figure><span><span></span></span><p><cite>Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty Images</cite></p></figure></div><p>When you say “wearables,” people generally think of smartwatches. But 2024 was a relatively quiet year for smartwatches, during which iterative updates reigned supreme. That happens in a maturing category. In exchange for polished products, you lose out on the weird frenetic energy — and sometimes ludicrously bad ideas — found when people are trying to figure out how to make a nascent gadget category work. Thankfully, it seems that energy is starting to bubble up with smart rings.</p><p>Smart rings are not new, but in 2024, there was a sort of renaissance for the category. I had an inkling that might be the case back in January, when several smart rings <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/12/24034978/smart-ring-oura-ring-evie-ring-zepp-helio-ces-2024">littered the CES show floor</a>. And then Samsung kicked the door wide open in February by announcing the long-rumored <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24205156/samsung-galaxy-ring-review-smart-ring-wearables">Galaxy Ring</a>. Samsung is a major player in the smartwatch space. For them to branch out into an entirely new wearable category? That’s <em>big</em>. It propels what’s thus far been a niche form factor into the mainstream.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24305485/smart-rings-2024-smart-rings-oura-samsung-galaxy">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-e6a573b8-736c-439b-b5c6-a0fe754d8c6b"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24305570/steam-deck-best-games-2024-verified-playable-valve">8 great games for your Steam Deck</a></h2><div><figure><span><span></span></span><p><cite>Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty Images</cite></p></figure></div><p>The Steam Deck gets better every year, and 2024 was no exception. It’s been my primary gaming device ever since I became a parent, and I love being able to access the humongous library of games available on Steam from wherever I want, whether it’s at home or while the baby is taking a nap at grandma’s house. Valve keeps adding great features via software updates, too, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24289138/steam-game-recording-now-available-all-users">like game recording</a>.</p><p>If you’re just setting up a Steam Deck for the first time — perhaps you’re lucky enough to get one of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/11/24294106/valve-white-steam-deck">limited-edition white models</a> — or you’re dusting off your Deck after a little break, I’ve put together some recommendations of great games from this year, along with one update to a classic.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24305570/steam-deck-best-games-2024-verified-playable-valve">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-45020bc3-a00f-4500-9488-d09e9dd3ed0f"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24314116/bluesky-threads-2024-social-media-networks-fediverse-twitter-x">Social networks in 2024: bless this mess</a></h2><div><figure><span><span></span></span><p><cite>Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge, Getty Images</cite></p></figure></div><p>If you had to pick <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23686584/twitter-alternative-social-media-platforms-mastodon-bluesky-activitypub-protocol">a social network winner</a>, it’s probably Threads. Two years ago, after Elon Musk acquired Twitter and announced his intention to ruin it forever, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg saw an opportunity to build a text-first social network. Now, barely 18 months after its launch, Threads has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/16/24322947/mark-zuckerberg-meta-threads-100-million-daily-active-users">more than 300 million users</a> and has been adding <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24306591/threads-35-million-signups-november-growth">a million more every day</a>.</p><p>But Threads isn’t Twitter, and it’s never going to be. Twitter was never the biggest or most successful social network — far from it —&nbsp;but Twitter was at the absolute epicenter of culture for years. It was where politicians went to talk to their constituents and emergency services went to tell people what was happening. It was where newsmakers dropped their scoops first. It was, by a mile, the place you were most likely to have your message actually read — or even replied to! — by an A-list celebrity or your favorite brand. It was a bad business and a frequently badly run company, but Twitter was the most <em>right now </em>place on the internet.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24314116/bluesky-threads-2024-social-media-networks-fediverse-twitter-x">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li></ul></section></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Which, on its face, sounds like someone fell over in the Ubisoft supply closet. But it doesn’t end there, because if you want to play, you have to have an NFT!</p><p>These take the form of Niji Warrior cards, which can be bought via the game’s website, where—like in all normal games—you then have to sign in to your “wallet.” This is where your pretend money and pictures are kept, and in this case it wants you to use something called Eden Online, Ubisoft’s own in-universe creation. (You can also sign into Coinbase or Walletconnect, but not being a crypto-bro, I have no such things.) So, because I actually <em>am</em> an incredible games journalist, I let the thing hook into my personal Gmail account. This apparently generated a wallet I could associate with the account, meaning I was able to “enter the photobooth.”</p><figure id="" data-id="a8d5542b1d8d1c780847c6b9e44fa5f7" data-recommend-id="image://a8d5542b1d8d1c780847c6b9e44fa5f7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1126" data-height="634" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A photobooth made of pixels and purple light, with Rayman's face on the side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A photobooth made of pixels and purple light, with Rayman's face on the side." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a8d5542b1d8d1c780847c6b9e44fa5f7" data-recommend-id="image://a8d5542b1d8d1c780847c6b9e44fa5f7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1126" data-height="634" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A photobooth made of pixels and purple light, with Rayman's face on the side." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Here, having repeatedly been told I could “reveal” my card, I was rerouted to a website called magiceden.io, a somehow-surviving NFT “marketplace,” where I discovered that all the 10,000 free options to “mint” a card had already been taken. But I need my Niji Warrior card to be able to play! So, as I read about how this “expanding the universe of the Netflix series” was “built on the Arbitrum blockchain,” and how these “10,000 AI-generated NFTs evolve based on your performance and involvement, unlocking exclusive access to in-game assets, governance rights, and perks tied to iconic Ubisoft franchises like Assassin’s Creed, Rayman and Splinter Cell,” I wondered if it was all too late.</p><p>Only here, on a non-Ubisoft site, written in small print within a section ironically entitled “Vision,” does it reveal that the “mint” is part of an “Early Access for Niji Warrior holders,” the “full launch” happening in 2025, despite the game being listed as out all over Ubisoft’s site and store. It seems we now have to click through to the “Collection” to buy one of them from someone else.

        <p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>The human heart is but a vessel for pain.</p><p>That’s what someone once whispered-a voice laced with loneliness, whispering directly into the soul. It’s an indescribable sadness, a love just beginning to bloom. It becomes an invisible pain that pierces the heart. And that’s what makes up life: a cyclical series of highs and lows.</p><p>Tachibana Sai was born without the ability to feel pain in his heart. He spends his days eliminating any seeds of malice that sneak up on his sister, the one person he treasures, without drawing attention to himself.</p><p>Sick of the never ending monotony he lives through, he chances upon a meeting with Benio Matsuri, a young girl whose aloof demeanor resembles that of a beautifully crafted doll.</p><p>For the first time in his life, he encounters a heart piercing sensation that of falling in love.</p><p>On the edge between day and night, in a twilight world where the dead and living mingle, stands an apartment building called Maison sans Nom, which is home to a group of boys and girls.</p><p>A ruthless boy who knows no pain in his heart. A lonely girl without any friends. A friendly girl who struggles to make connections. A prickly, ambitious girl who is keen to be of help. A boy who loves his own cute self above anything else. A mess of a woman who tries to solve everything through brute force. And a boy with a tender heart who knows no pain in his body.</p><p>This ill-assorted group of residents, hands stained with blood from battling the supernatural Maledicts, shall encounter the hearts they never knew and begin nurturing their souls.</p><p>The human heart is hut a vessel for pain.</p><p>To protect this pain akin to love… To gently break the world apart, piece by piece… Even if it means abandoning humanity. That’s why the heart is but a vessel for pain.</p><p>For life blazes brilliantly, while the heart goes around in an endless cycle.</p><p><strong>Characters</strong></p><ul><li><a href="https://hanakimi.frontwing.co.jp/en/character01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Benio Matsuri</strong></a> (voiced by <a title="Series > Mana [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/mana">Mana</a>ka Iwami) – A girl born into the Benio Family, a powerful family of Maledict Exorcists, who is tightly bound by her family’s curse. Due to an incident in the past, causing her to close off her heart, she doesn’t speak and barely shows any emotion. Her eyes remain closed at all times, as if she wishes to isolate herself from the cruel world she lives in. Since she only moves when someone pulls her along by the hand, her demeanor evokes the image of a beautifully crafted doll. She is a Curse Bearer with the ability to give Maledicts form and use their powers freely.</li><li><a href="https://hanakimi.frontwing.co.jp/en/character02/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Nobody</strong></a> (voiced by Manaka Iwami) – Another personality that dwells inside Benio Matsuri’s heart that appears when Matsuri is asleep. Nobody sees herself as a shield that protects Matsuri from the cruel world. She can be incredibly selfish, and her words, <a title="Genres > Action [2,386 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s, and strong attitude cause her to come across as a haughty, ill-mannered girl.</li><li><a href="https://hanakimi.frontwing.co.jp/en/character03/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Tachibana Sai</strong></a> (voiced by Yumiri Hanamori) – The protagonist of the story: A ruthless boy who cannot feel pain in his heart. His younger sister, his only family, is the one person he treasures, and anyone who torments her is met with a brutal end by his hands… Yet, yearning to understand the human heart, he often interrogates his victims, even though they cannot respond. Just as he begins to seek respite from his bleak life, his unexpected encounter with Benio Matsuri causes him to experience a kind of pain akin to love in his heart.</li><li><a href="https://hanakimi.frontwing.co.jp/en/character04/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Kanbara Tatsuki</strong></a> (voiced by Shuta Morishima) – An earnest and sincere boy who was born with a body that doesn’t feel any physical pain. Despite the unjust world around him, he wishes to keep on the straight and narrow, even if no one else does. He began training at a young age under a master who claimed to be invincible in order to become… well, a certain something. He has infiltrated the Benio Family and is biding his time for the chance to free Benio Matsuri, his first love, from their curse.</li><li><a href="https://hanakimi.frontwing.co.jp/en/character05/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Tsukahara Ao</strong></a> (voiced by Hitomi Sasaki) – A seemingly cheerful and sociable resident of Maison sans Nom. She’s especially close with her friend Ando Mémé. Born as a Curse Bearer, she works as one of the Benio Family’s mercenaries and exorcists. On top of her mischievous tendencies, she wants more than anything to be a housewife. Her <a title="Genres > Cooking [13 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/cooking">cooking</a> might not be up to par now, but she’s working on it.</li><li><a href="https://hanakimi.frontwing.co.jp/en/character06/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Ando Meme</strong></a> (voiced by Hika Tsukishiro) – A surly resident of Maison sans Nom and a Curse Bearer like Ao. Despite her ambitious and hard-working nature, she tends to scare people off due to her prickly attitude. However, she is keener than anyone when it comes to helping her friends, and Ao is especially reliant on her companionship. Her goal in life is to rake in the money as a top-grade exorcist.</li><li><a href="https://hanakimi.frontwing.co.jp/en/character07/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Kirishima Tsuyu</strong></a> (voiced by Yukina Shuto) – The landlord of Maison sans Nom. Tsuyu is obsessed with his own cuteness and habitually declares himself the cutest person in the world. He enjoys teasing the other residents, and while they get annoyed with Tsuyu’s antics sometimes, they still adore him. He often earns himself a spanking from Yozora. He is also a content creator who makes full use of his looks while livestreaming as “Chuyu.” He has a preference for strong-willed people and takes a particular liking to Tatsuki in this regard. A Curse Bearer like Ao and Mémé, he possesses a mysterious power.</li><li><a href="https://hanakimi.frontwing.co.jp/en/character08/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Kandori Yozora</strong></a> (voiced by Hana Kuga) – As the only grown-up resident of Maison sans Nom, Yozora acts as the guardian of the younger residents. She appears to be a beautiful, classy lady… until she opens her mouth. With her frank and outspoken attitude, as well as her tendency to drink cheap booze, gamble on horses, and “borrow” money from the kids without ever returning it, she’s not exactly what one would consider a responsible adult. Yozora does not possess any Maledict powers, but she prides herself on being the strongest martial artist in the world.</li><li><a href="https://hanakimi.frontwing.co.jp/en/character09/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Benio Tsui</strong></a> (voiced by Takako Tanaka) – The current head of the Benio Family and Matsuri’s younger sister. Contrary to her appearance as a young girl, she considers herself the matriarch of the family, referring to all its members as her “children,” regardless of blood relations. Inside her heart dwells three different personalities, each with their own quirks and caprices. All are cold, cruel, and ruthless by nature, although she sometimes displays a child-like innocence befitting her age.</li><li><a href="https://hanakimi.frontwing.co.jp/en/character10/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>Penguin</strong></a> (voiced by Reika Fujisawa) – A mysterious, smartly dressed penguin with the ability to understand and speak human language. However, it is painfully shy, so normally it pretends to be just a regular penguin. It works as a receptionist and bellhop at a hotel where the souls of the dead end up, so the younger residents of Maison sans Nom refer to it as “God.” It has a huge attitude for a cute little penguin and is extremely hard to please. The best way to buy its favor is with sweets and snacks.</li><li>…and others!</li></ul><p><strong>Main Staff</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Planning / Story:</strong> Yukito Urushibara</li><li><strong>Character Design / Art:</strong> Saine</li><li><strong>Developer:</strong> Frontwing</li><li><strong>Background Music:</strong> Fuminori Matsumoto, Hitoshi Fujima (Elements Garden)</li></ul><p><strong>Theme Song</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Title:</strong> “Anata no Kioku no Naka de” (“In Your Memories”)</li><li><strong>Vocals:</strong> Mao Uesugi</li><li><strong>Lyrics:</strong> Yoshikazu Kuwashima</li><li><strong>Composition and Arrangement:</strong> Hitoshi Fujima (Elements Garden)</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p><h2><span>Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="【PV】漆原雪人×さいね『花束を君に贈ろう-Kinsenka-』ビジュアルノベルゲーム2025年発売" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SHQekt3inMM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Others slowly accrue cult status over months and years. Some are finally released and quickly overlooked, cherished by a small coterie of early players and completely unknown to everyone else who might have fallen in love with them. Every year we try to give a handful of the most underappreciated games a quick plug in hopes that others will give them a much-deserved first or second look. Here are some of our favorite hidden gems from 2024.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tiny-terry-turbo-trip-review-simpsons-hit-run-steam-pc-1851517168&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tiny-terry-turbo-trip-review-simpsons-hit-run-steam-pc-1851517168"><em>Tiny Terry’s Turbo Trip</em></a></span><em> </em>is for <em>Simpsons: Hit and Run</em> sickos. You’re a kid who lies to his family to get a job with a taxi company completing jobs and collecting junk to upgrade your ride. It’s colorful, funny, and has the responsive-feeling controls to match its quirky world. — Ethan Gach </p></div><div><p><em>Crypt Custodian</em> is a top-down Metroidvania with <em>Hyper Light Drifter </em>vibes. You play a cat who’s the janitor of the afterlife. Lots of platforming and puzzling ensues. The art direction is top-notch, the music is calming, and the world is masterfully crafted for an alluring but not frustrating time exploring a gorgeous world. — Ethan Gach </p></div><div><p>If you want something that looks like <em>Pentiment</em> but plays like a <em>Darkest Dungeon</em>-style 2D tactics game, look no farther <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/inkulinati-pc-xbox-medieval-art-manuscript-impressions-1850205499?_gl=1*1m8y9w2*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDY0NjIwMy4xNTYuMC4xNzM0NjQ2MzkyLjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/inkulinati-pc-xbox-medieval-art-manuscript-impressions-1850205499?_gl=1*1m8y9w2*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNDY0NjIwMy4xNTYuMC4xNzM0NjQ2MzkyLjYwLjAuMA..">than <em>Inkulinati</em></a></span>. The game takes place inside a medieval manuscript and features plenty of challenging strategic scenarios and goofy animal humor. It came out of Early Access this year and offers a deep and engaging package despite the small scale and straightforward ideas. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p><em>Starstruck: Hands of Time</em> feels like the sort of bonkers genre mashup we don’t really get anymore. A time-traveling rhythm game, there’s elements of <em>Katamari</em> and <em>Guitar Hero </em>with an original art style borrowing from 3D sculpture and 2D collage. It doesn’t completely deliver on its ambitions, but swings for the fences like anything can happen. — Ethan Gach </p></div><div><p>A twin-stick shooter meets <em>Zelda </em>dungeoneering sounds like putting peanut butter on pickles and tastes just as good. <em>Minishoot’ Adventures</em> is like playing <em>The Legend of Zelda: A Link To The Past</em> as Star Fox. You explore a top-down map to unlock new paths and upgrades and take on bosses with punchy shooting that controls like a classic arcade game. It’s “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-twin-stick-shooter-minishoot-adventures-1851425765&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-twin-stick-shooter-minishoot-adventures-1851425765">just damned brilliant</a></span>.” — Ethan Gach </p></div><div><p>I was turned onto Mask Quest by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mask-quest-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mask-quest-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Rock, Paper, Shotgun</em>’s Edwin Evans-Thirlwell</a></span>. It’s a precision platformer about controlling your breath while navigating a modern city and all of its contemporary socio-political hazards. It’s short, thoughtful, and brutal. “The cleverness of the game’s level design is as double-edged as the humor,” writes Evans-Thirlwell. ”It gracefully weaponizes and politicizes the casual sadism of any game that defines itself as a series of goals and punishments.” — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p>What if<em> Hotline Miami </em>was more like <em>Silent Hill</em>? Enter <em>Conscript</em>, a WWI top-down horror stealth game about smashing enemy soldiers’ heads in while trying to escape the trenches. It’s slow, plodding, and at times tortuous. It’s all beautifully and hauntingly presented. It lures you into a sense of tedious exhaustion and then—BANG—you’re dead. — Ethan Gach </p></div><div><p>A cozy sandbox builder where you make shops and homes by the water, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/impressions/452276/tiny-glade-summerhouse-scene-building-games-trend-cozy&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/impressions/452276/tiny-glade-summerhouse-scene-building-games-trend-cozy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">playing <em>Summerhouse</em></a></span> is like inhabiting a postcard from a long-lost friend. It’s reminiscent of what <em>Kingdom</em> did for tower defense strategy games, imposing 2D pixel art constraints to bring the virtues into sharper relief. It’s chill, adorable, and breathtaking. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p><em>Dungeons of Dreadrock</em> was a sleeper hit in 2022 that now frequently appears in “best of” lists, a fantastically smart puzzle game in which you descended 100 floors of a tower to save your brother from a grisly sacrifice. Its sequel repeats the formula, but this time from a second perspective, a character you likely forgot meeting in the first game, going through her own 100-story challenge. And the result is an even smarter set of excellent puzzles and lovely dialogue that nimbly sets up the third and final part of the trilogy. — John Walker </p></div><div><p>If <em>Minit </em>were a slide puzzle game, it would look like <em>Slider</em>. You move pieces of the world around to rearrange, rebuild, and progress through it. It can be incredibly simple and devastatingly hard at the same time. It’s free and no one has an excuse not to give it a try. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p><em>Master Key</em> is another riff on<em> Zelda</em>. This one is is as monochromatic and stripped down as it gets, focusing on the items you collect and the obstacles they help you to overcome. It shares DNA with modern indie gems like <em>Animal Well</em> and <em>Tunic</em>, though it’s more rough around the edges. Do yourself a favor and play it on easy. —Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p>Too many games are mawkish, and not enough games are honestly sad. <em>The Night Is Grey</em>, with its wonderfully solemn and beautiful story, defies this trend. This point-and-click adventure is a tangle of haunted pasts, and one that is self-aware enough to avoid the traditionally silly puzzles of the genre, even coldly chastising the player when one such traditional, silly solution is tried. It’s a game about a man trying to protect a small child, but it rebels against the tropes of that formula in a way that’ll gut-punch you hard. — John Walker </p></div><div><p><em>Dread Delusion</em> is a <em>Morrowind</em>-inspired low-poly RPG that finally hit 1.0 this year and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dread-delusion-morrowind-inspired-horror-rpg-pc-1851484896&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dread-delusion-morrowind-inspired-horror-rpg-pc-1851484896">didn’t disappoint</a></span>. What it lacks in deep first-person combat, it makes up for with an incredible-looking world to explore and a mythical atmosphere suffused with whimsy and horror. The exploration, writing, and story deliver an experience unlike any other. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p><em>The Crimson Diamond</em> looks and plays like something from 1988, an adventure game with gorgeous, vibrant EGA graphics and a text parser interface. Yes, that means you must actually type things like “look” and “open door,” a thought which may have some potential players rolling their eyes, but it’s actually great! The game deftly pulls you into its early-20th-century murder mystery with its plucky heroine and colorful cast of suspects. The text parser, meanwhile, lets you engage with those suspects and the environment in delightful and engaging ways that, despite being nods to games from nearly 40 years ago, feel fresh and invigorating, and make me more optimistic about the state of the adventure game genre today. I’ll allow myself a pun here and just end by saying that this game is a real gem. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><p>If you like reading random internet pages about made-up things and then leveraging your new expertise in creepy, intimate scenarios with complete strangers, <em>Home Safety Hotline</em> is the game for you. It’s a <em>Papers, Please</em>-like that combines soul crushing call center work with a beautiful Windows 97 aesthetic and a Cryptid-infused riff on <em>Night Trap</em>. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p> There are plenty of city builders on Steam, but not many (if any) are all about creating bustling towns on the side of a giant mountain. <em>Laysara: Summit Kingdom</em>, out in Early Access, asks you to develop and grow thriving cities using tiny cliffs as you and your crew climb up a mountain. The game is a bit tricky at times, but at least the view is lovely up there. — Zack Zwiezen </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-5-3-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the release date for <i>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</i>Version 5.3, so if you're looking for a way to ring in the new year, then you're in luck.</p>

<p>Following hot on the heels of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-52-release-date" rel="nofollow">November's Version 5.2</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-51-release-date" rel="nofollow">previous month's Version 5.1</a>, Version 5.3 will arrive on January 1st. That's right: New Year's Day itself. It'll continue the storyline of Natlan's Archon Quest, in which the Traveler is about to awaken their Pyro power and the six heroes of Natlan have united.</p>

<p>Of course, it wouldn't be much of a HoYoverse game update without some new characters to enjoy, and Version 5.3 is bringing not one, but two 5-star characters for you to add to your roster.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.3-new-characters.jpg?itok=2NDpnDAb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.3-new-characters.jpg?itok=WJRn_3vL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.3 brings two new 5-star characters for your roster.</figcaption></figure><p>Your first new 5-star character is the Pyro claymore user Mavuika, who comes with two distinct fighting styles. She can either take enemies on with the aforementioned claymore or use her Flamestrider to crush enemies. Said Flamestrider can also be used to traverse the world.</p>

<p>The second 5-star character joining&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>in Version 5.3 is Citlali, also known as Granny Itztli. She's a Cryo-using catalyst wielder who can deploy shields and deal powerful area-of-effect damage. Both characters are joined by the intriguing-sounding multi-elemental Liyue fighter Lan Yan, who debuts in the second half of the update.</p>

<p>Of course, you can also expect reruns of existing characters in case you missed the chance to add them to your team. Characters returning as part of this update include Arlecchino, Clorinde, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/genshin-impact-ganyu-guide-builds-skills" rel="nofollow">Ganyu</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/genshin-impact-shenhe-build-guide" rel="nofollow">Shenhe</a>.</p>




<p>Plenty of other goodies are coming as part of Version 5.3 as well, including the return of the Lantern Rite event, the popular rhythm minigame becoming a permanent fixture, and optimizations to the character level up screen to make it a little easier to understand and parse.</p>

<p>As per usual, HoYoverse is also giving away some&nbsp;<em>Genshin&nbsp;</em>goodies for those who are looking to build their roster. Here are this update's codes!</p>

<ul><li>UAMPGJASECZH: 100 Primogems, 10 Mystic Enhancement Ore</li>
	<li>LT5NH2TTXUHM: 100 Primogems, 5 Hero's Wit</li>
	<li>4SLPH3BSFVH9: 100 Primogems, 50,000 Mora</li>
</ul><p><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>is available to play right now for free on <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation, Xbox Series X|S, and mobile devices</a>.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Two men on the board of directors for Epic Games have stepped down from their positions after the US Department of Justice investigated the board under antitrust laws. The pair of directors were originally appointed to Epic's board by Tencent (who slurp upon a minority stake in the Unreal Engine company) but the United States government took a look at this and said: ah-ah-ah, you're not allowed to have a director in your boardroom if they're already fingers-deep in the pie of a competing company. Naughty Tencent! Naughty Epic! And, yes, naughty Riot Games!</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The DoJ <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/tencent-removes-two-directors-epic-games-and-relinquishes-its-right-unilaterally-appoint">announced the resignations in a press release</a>, saying they're the result of an investigation into potential antitrust violations. The gist is: since Tencent are massive and own Riot Games outright, they aren't allowed to have boardroom sway over Epic Games, which technically remains their competitor in the video games industry. It'd be like letting a big suitwearer at Pepsi go to all the important meetings at Coca-cola. This is all law under the Clayton Act, which "prohibits directors and officers from serving simultaneously on the boards of competitors, subject to limited exceptions."</p>
<p>The two directors who've stepped down are Ben Feder and David Wallerstein, according to an <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/tech-and-telecom-law/tencent-relinquishes-epic-games-board-seats-on-antitrust-concern?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=TENW&amp;utm_campaign=00000193-dd05-d3f6-a1d7-dd27d5ec0004">email Bloomberg got</a> from Epic Games confirming the resignations. Ben Feder's job title at Tencent for years was the President of International Partnerships, and he was CEO of Take-Two Interactive before that, a big Tencent publisher. Wallerstein, meanwhile, was Senior Executive Vice President at Tencent until January this year, and is currently employed as a "senior advisor". Neither of them should have been on the board at Epic - at least that's what is implied by the DoJ's investigations. And they have now stepped down, it seems, to avoid Tencent and Epic any further heat.</p>
<p>"No company or individual has admitted to liability in connection with this investigation," say the DoJ with characteristic legal nous. They also add that Tencent has agreed to amend its shareholder agreement with Epic so that it can't appoint directors to the Epic board in future. No more boardroom naughtiness, corpoboys and corpogirls! </p><p>Antitrust laws exist to prevent huge companies from establishing monopolies and becoming even more powerful than they often already are. In video games, we've seen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/judge-rules-part-of-antitrust-suit-against-valve-can-continue">Valve hit with an antitrust lawsuit</a> in the past. And Microsoft was scrutinised with similar concerns by both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/us-ftc-considering-antitrust-lawsuit-against-microsoft-over-activision-blizzard-deal-sources-claim">the United States</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-eu-are-slapping-microsoft-with-an-antitrust-warning-over-their-activision-blizzard-buyout">the European Union</a> when it made its (<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-finally-buys-activision-blizzard-as-last-legal-hurdles-fall-away">ultimately successful</a>) move to buy Activision Blizzard. Big business gonna business big.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Over the 12 years since its crowdfunding drive began, Star Citizen has been called many things including a scam by those who wonder whether it will ever properly launch. Its virtual space ships, some of which cost hundreds of dollars, are often the focus of criticism.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Star Citizen has now raised an eye-watering $767 million, according to figures from CIG. The developer makes revenue publicly available on its <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/funding-goals" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>website</u></a>. CIG calls this money “funds raised.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In March this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-citizen-10-twinkles-on-the-horizon-dev-says-12-years-and-669-million-later"><u>CIG began talking about Star Citizen’s 1.0 launch being within sight</u></a>, although there’s still no release window for it. 1.0, Roberts has said, “is what we consider the features and content set to represent ‘commercial’ release.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/transmission/20371-Letter-From-The-Chairman" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">letter from the Chairman post</a>, Roberts said: “Long ago, lost in the mists of time before COVID, at CitizenCon 2949, we showcased the first in-game prototype of traveling from the Stanton System to the Pyro System via a Jump Point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"After a much longer than anticipated development process, what was teased in 2019 becomes a reality for all players when we launch Star Citizen Alpha 4.0 to the live servers, as part of what we are calling the 4.0 Preview.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Citizen Alpha 4.0 brings with it a full wipe and reset to all accounts. All players start fresh with their account hangars and wallets +20,000 aUEC (Alpha United Earth Credits, Star Citizen’s virtual currency used during the alpha stage). Headline additions include Pyro, the second Star System added to the Star Citizen Universe, the first jump point in the persistent universe, connecting the Stanton and Pyro systems together, an economy overhaul, and much more. Check out the patch notes over on the <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/comm-link/Patch-Notes/20360-Star-Citizen-Alpha-40" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Roberts Space Industries website</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In October, CIG said that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/squadron-42"><u>Squadron 42</u></a>, the standalone, single-player story game set in the Star Citizen universe, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-citizen-dev-confident-of-releasing-standalone-single-player-story-game-squadron-42-in-2026">launches at some point in 2026</a>, which, if it makes that release window, would be an incredible 14 years after CIG first launched Star Citizen's crowdfunding drive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roberts, known for creating the Wing Commander series, has said Squadron 42 will offer 30-40 hours of gameplay. It stars Gillian Anderson, Henry Cavill, Gary Oldman, and Mark Strong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

    <p><span>Mavuika and Citlali join the fray.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 5.3 update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [120 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “Incandescent Ode of Resurrection,” will launch on January 1, 2025, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [181 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-935765"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>This update will finally make Mavuika, the Pyro Archon, playable. The Traveler will join Mavuika and Natlan’s warriors in a fateful battle in the newest Archon Quest. In addition, players can revisit Liyue during Lantern Rite, celebrating Teyvat’s new year with bounteous rewards, including Intertwined Fates ×10, Primogems ×1,600, a free 4-star Liyue character and more.</p><p>The final battle tolls its bell, summoning Natlan’s warriors to rise in the new Act V of Natlan’s Archon Quest. In the previous main story, the six heroes of Natlan successfully united, and the sacred blessing of the Ode of Resurrection was extended to all Natlanese warriors. At long last, the Traveler is on the verge of awakening their Pyro power. Meanwhile, the Abyss will unleash a new evil into the world for the final showdown, the terrifying Abyssal Mimic Dragon, a Boss known as the “Lord of Eroded Primal Fire”.</p><p>Revered as Natlan’s most radiant protector during the Abyss wars, Mavuika, also known as the Pyro Archon Haborym, joins the battlefield with two unique combat styles: Fighting with her claymore, or crushing opponents while riding her Flamestrider. By tapping her Elemental Skill, the Ring of Searing Radiance manifests, following Mavuika or the active character and unleashing continuous Pyro attacks. By holding her Elemental Skill, Mavuika mounts her Flamestrider, allowing her to scale cliffs, drive across land and water alike, glide in mid-air, and charge into opponents in her path. By fighting alongside her teammates, Mavuika gains a unique resource called Fighting Spirit, used to activate her Elemental Burst. Her Elemental Burst unleashes a powerful AoE Pyro attack, and Mavuika will enter a special state with higher interruption resistance and enhanced combat power. Additionally, Mavuika can decrease the party’s Nightsoul Transmission Cooldown by 20%. Players can learn more about this stalwart warrior in her Story Quest, which unlocks after completing the latest Archon Quest.</p><p>In contrast to Mavuika’s blazing flames, “Granny Itztli,” otherwise known as Citlali from the Masters of the Night-Wind, brings a biting cold to the battlefield as a 5-star Cryo Catalyst user. A powerful Shaman revered by her tribe, Citlali is always accompanied by two little companions, Itzpapa and Citlalin. During exploration, they transform into cushions and pillows, allowing Citlali to comfortably float in mid-air. While in combat, Citlali can deploy Cryo shields and summon a powerful Cryo storm of AoE DMG with her little companions. While in her Nightsoul’s Blessing state, “Granny Itztli” lowers the Pyro and Hydro RES of opponents affected by Frozen or Melt reactions, even when Citlali is off-field. Both Mavuika and Citlali debut in the first half of Version 5.3’s Event Wishes, with reruns for Arlecchino and Clorinde arriving in the second half.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_935766"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>A new Liyue character, Lan Yan, debuts as a 4-star Anemo Catalyst user in the second half of Version 5.3. One of her inherited Qimen Arts is the Swallow-Wisp Shield that can convert its Element into Hydro, Pyro, Cryo or Electro to absorb corresponding Elemental DMG. After the conversion, she can also leap into the air to attack, dealing the same type of Elemental DMG to her opponents. In addition, more 5-star characters will return in another round of Chronicled Wish, including Ganyu and Shenhe.</p><p>Meanwhile, the bustling Liyue Harbor is once again aglow with the cheer of Lantern Rite. Players can share in the festive joy through various free rewards, including Primogems ×1,600 and the new glider “Wings of Fate’s Course Intertwined” via in-game mails, Intertwined Fate ×10 through a daily login event, a free 4-star Liyue character by completing the Lantern Rite event, and a new outfit for Xiangling by accumulating Festive Fever in the event.</p><p>Besides the joy of reaping rewards, mini-games and events will be adding another layer of excitement to the festivities. This year, players can share their customized gift envelopes with companions and other Travelers, weaving their best wishes and sentiments into their works. They can also play the block clearing mini-game, “Immortal Combat,” as well as a combat challenge with Stratagem buffs to accumulate fun and Festive Fever alike. Once Festive Fever reaches a certain level, players can claim Xiangling’s new outfit “New Year’s Cheer” and more celebratory bonuses for free. Meanwhile, Hu Tao’s new outfit “Cherries Snow-Laden” will be on sale in the Shop at a limited-time discount.</p><p>Version 5.3 continues to offer new features for different in-game modes. The popular rhythm game will become a permanent gameplay mode, allowing players to compose and share musical scores to showcase their talents. Additionally, Kazuha and Ganyu’s Echo cosmetics will be added to Envisaged Echoes in the Imaginarium Theater lobby, and can be obtained after completing the corresponding new challenges.</p><p>This version is also committed to further optimizing the character level-up process. The character interface now includes a button leading directly to the Training Guide.

        <p>The full game will feature seven zones and over 20 hours of gameplay.</p><p><strong>New Gameplay Teaser Reveals Two Zones</strong></p><p>The world of <em>ReSetna</em> is full of mysteries, and the latest reveal gives players a glimpse into the creation of the Darkness Zone, the desolate region of Acidia, and even some of the game’s bosses.</p><p>Acidia was once the home of Energetech Solutions, a company focused on renewable energy. Their experiments with Entropium, a powerful but unstable synthetic substance, caused massive damage to the environment.</p><p>These reckless tests tore holes in space and time, creating the Darkness Zone, a strange and chaotic dimension where the rules of reality are distorted.</p><p>Now, Acidia is a toxic and dangerous wasteland, filled with the remnants of advanced technology and the scars of Entropium’s devastating effects. </p><p><strong>Original Soundtrack That Mirrors a Decayed World</strong></p><p>Crafted by composer Nikola Jeremic, the <em>ReSetna</em> soundtrack fuses organic and synthetic sounds to reflect the post-apocalyptic setting. </p><p>Using real instruments like metal and wood, distorted to sound “dirty” and “decayed,” Jeremic’s score blends retro synthwave and ambientwave elements. </p><p>The result is a unique soundscape that breathes life into <em>ReSetna</em>‘s world of forgotten machines.</p><p><strong>All Game Art Elements Born Purely From Imagination</strong></p><p>Every character, enemy and environment in <em>ReSetna</em> has been meticulously crafted by Today’s Games’ art team.</p><p>“Each boss is unique, telling a dark story of the forgotten past. Through our art, we sought to let the visuals speak for themselves, embracing the power of visual storytelling,” the team explained. </p><p><strong>Great News for Players Worldwide</strong></p><p><em>ReSetna</em> features a unique Tetris Chip Upgrade System, allowing players to collect and customize upgrades for abilities and weapons. This flexible system encourages exploration and strategic play to overcome increasingly difficult challenges.</p><p><em>ReSetna</em> will be localized into English, Korean, Japanese, Simplified Chinese, Spanish (Latin), Portuguese (Latin), German, French, and Russian. This effort ensures that players across the globe can fully immerse themselves in the story and world of <em>ReSetna</em>.</p><p>This <a title="Genres > Metroidvania [179 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/metroidvania">Metroidvania</a> is set to launch worldwide on January 31, 2025 on Steam and <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,455 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Nintendo Switch</a>, with releases on other consoles following in Q1 2025.</p><p>For those eager to experience the gameplay, a demo is available now on Steam. The demo offers a polished introduction to <em>ReSetna</em>, featuring the entire first zone Polis13 and an intense boss fight. </p><p>However, the full game features six more zones, each boasting vibrant, colorful, and mystical art styles.</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>This weekend, the NFL game between the Kansas City Chiefs and the Houston Texans may play a role in determining the No. 1 seed in the AFC. It also has the distinction of being the first-ever EA Sports Madden NFL Cast, an alternate broadcast that will stream exclusively on Peacock.</p><p>The traditional broadcast of the game will remain on NBC, but Peacock's stream will incorporate elements from the Madden NFL video games. For example, Madden's signature passing routes and player ratings will be overlaid on the live-action footage, and the game may incorporate animations from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/madden-nfl-25-review-gridiron-grates/1900-6418271/" data-ref-id="1900-6418271">Madden NFL 25</a> as well. This altcast is being produced specifically with Madden gamers in mind, some of whom may not be traditional football fans.</p><p>"There are millions and millions of Madden fans, and I think we have to really serve them in this game and try to find that perfect blend between the video game and the real game and merge them together," said NBC Sports executive producer Fred Gaudelli in a statement.</p><p>The EA Sports Madden NFL Cast will begin on Saturday, December 21 at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET on Peacock. Paul Burmeister will provide the play-by-play commentary for the altcast, with former NFL quarterback Kurt Benkert placing the Madden graphic overlays to breakdown potential plays. Former wide receiver Chad Johnson will also contribute as he makes adjustments to players' Madden ratings in real-time. Ultimate Madden Bowl champion player Henry Leverette will take part in the production as well.</p><p>Madden's namesake, John Madden, was a former NFL coach-turned-broadcaster who announced games for all of the major broadcast networks, including NBC. The video game franchise that is synonymous with his name carries so much weight that a report this week suggested that New York Jets owner Woody Johnson vetoed a trade for Denver Broncos wide receiver Jerry Jeudy <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-york-jets-owner-torpedoed-trade-because-of-a-players-madden-rating-report/1100-6528565/" data-ref-id="1100-6528565">because he didn't like Jeudy's Madden player ratting</a>.</p><p>EA recently updated Madden NFL 25 with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saquon-barkleys-no-look-hurdle-has-been-added-to-madden-nfl-25/1100-6527917/" data-ref-id="1100-6527917">Saquon Barkley's unique no-look spin hurdle into the game</a>, although it can only be performed under specific circumstances. Last month, Amazon's Prime Video debuted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-trailer-for-its-in-the-game-shares-the-history-of-madden-nfl/1100-6527695/" data-ref-id="1100-6527695">It's in the Game</a>, a four-part documentary series about the history and development of the Madden NFL games.

In this blog I lay out key drivers behind the downturn in 2024, as well as the factors driving the assumed growth in 2026 and beyond.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="VR headset sales see two consecutive years of decline, following the pandemic-induced upswing">VR headset sales see two consecutive years of decline, following the pandemic-induced upswing</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The consumer VR market continues to face significant challenges, with several indicators highlighting a lack of momentum and adoption. The highly anticipated Apple Vision Pro debut has failed to deliver the resurgence the industry hoped for, with limited developer enthusiasm and fading momentum ten months post-launch. Meanwhile, Meta’s recent entry-level Quest 3S has yet to spark a notable sales boost, as evidenced by my analysis of Black Friday headset sales across eight countries, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://bsky.app/profile/giokinto.bsky.social/post/3lcnkdzfdhs2p">which shows a 16% decline</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. PC VR adoption also remains stagnant, with Valve’s latest Hardware Survey revealing that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/georgejijiashvili_vr-pcvr-vr-activity-7265701366692487168-Nb7h/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">only 1.5% of Steam users are engaging with VR</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> hardware. Adding to this, Omdia’s supply chain insights confirm earlier reports of Sony </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-18/sony-hits-pause-on-psvr2-production-as-unsold-inventory-piles-up">halting PlayStation VR2 production</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> due to unsold inventory, prompting the company to resort to heavy discounting to clear stock.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The challenges are further exacerbated in other markets and segments. VR headset sales in China have collapsed due to weak consumer demand, and the future of Pico remains uncertain following layoffs and restructuring by its parent company, ByteDance. The TikTok owner, which acquired Pico in 2021, appears to be losing interest in the segment. On the content side, developers are increasingly questioning the return on investment for VR games, with a recent Game Developer Collective survey revealing that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/survey-says-half-of-developers-consider-vr-market-on-decline-or-stagnation">half of respondents perceive the VR market as either stagnant or in decline</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The number of VR headsets in active use fell by 8% in 2024 to 21.9 million. This was primarily due to a low share of Quest 2 owners upgrading, over 20 million of which have been sold since 2020. Meanwhile, $904 million was spent on VR content in 2024; for context, games console content spend will generate $37.4 billion in 2024, highlighting the nascent nature of the consumer VR market. The current state of the VR market is characterized by waning consumer interest post-pandemic, a sluggish inflow of compelling new content, and growing skepticism among developers about the viability of VR as a profitable platform.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Growth is predicted to resume by 2026, but mass adoption of VR headsets in their current form remains unlikely">Growth is predicted to resume by 2026, but mass adoption of VR headsets in their current form remains unlikely</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The expected return to growth in the VR market is heavily reliant on the anticipated launch of a more affordable Apple Vision Pro model in 2026, which is projected to drive the market expansion through 2029. Meta is also expected to remain a key player in the space, though its headset sales are likely to remain flat. Meta’s recent move to open its Horizon OS to third-party manufacturers underscores its continued commitment to VR, but the company faces an uphill battle. Meanwhile, Google’s announcement of the Android XR platform last week represents a much-needed competition in this space, but its history of launching and shortly shuttering new projects tempers expectations. Developer and manufacturer approach to these initiatives will be cautious, therefore, only incremental progress is anticipated in the short-term.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The form factor of current VR and passthrough mixed reality headsets remains a barrier to mass adoption. Consumer and manufacturer interest is shifting toward lightweight glasses, promising all-day, anywhere access to multimodal AI – as exemplified by Meta Ray-Ban glasses, which is seeing early signs of success. Companies in this space hope that this approach will help normalize face-based spatial computing, which could ultimately spur mass-market VR adoption. However, the progress towards achieving this will be slow, and isn’t expected to happen within this decade. In the near term, VR is likely to remain a niche market, constrained by its existing limitations and the growing industry focus on AR as the future of immersive technology.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Principal Analyst, Games, Omdia</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">George is a regular contributor to Game Developer and a principal analyst at Omdia, leading research into games and AR/VR markets.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-amd-fsr-3-mod-released-by-puredark/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this week, renowned modder PureDark <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/indiana-jones-01-118058876" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> an AMD FSR 3 mod for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. As usual, the mod is locked behind being a subscriber on his Patreon, and even PureDark told his community:</p>
<p><em>Note that the devs have announced that future updates will include official FSR3 implementation. Think twice before subscribing!</em></p>
<p>Indeed, developer MachineGames confirmed alongside the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-enables-path-tracing-on-nvidia-rtx-gpus-amd-fsr-to-be-added-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">second title update</a> that AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution would be added in a future patch. However, they didn't specifically state whether that would also include the frame generation component, which is indeed available in PureDark's mod and makes a big difference.</p>
<p>Not only that, it even works on portable devices like Valve's Steam Deck. YouTuber Grown Up Gaming tested it and noticed that the performance went from 20-25 frames per second to around 40 frames per second with the upscaling set to Quality. Lowering that to Performance mode provides another 10 frames or so, but at that point, the game doesn't look very good.</p>
<p><iframe title="Steam Deck Indiana Jones and the Great Circle FSR 3 Frame Generation Mod #steamdeck #fsr3" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4BE40VHIbs0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Granted, it is a miracle Indiana Jones and the Great Circle even works on the Steam Deck. The game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-the-first-game-to-require-hardware-ray-tracing-support-full-specs-released/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">system requirements</a> technically include hardware ray tracing support, and we all know that the Deck's ray tracing performance is not its strongest suit, to say the least.</p>
<p>It's certainly not like I would like to play this game. If I absolutely had to do it on the go, I'd prefer using GeForce NOW to stream it via cloud and still get ray tracing features and smooth performance. PureDark's mod will probably be more useful to all those desktop users who do not own an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 GPU, providing a way to essentially double the frame rate for free.</p>
<p>Whether you plan to use it or not, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is absolutely worth playing, as I explained in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>:</p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an excellent adventure/action game that features one of the best Indiana Jones stories, great level design that rewards exploration, and awesome ray traced visuals. This might just be the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton we've ever seen.</em></p>
<p>At least one story DLC titled The Order of the Giants is on its way, though there's no release window yet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-engineers-2-early-access-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Keen Software House has announced the&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>Early Access release date, as well as unveiling the game's first full trailer in anticipation of that date.</p>

<p><em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-engineers-2-announced" rel="nofollow">revealed last week</a>, and as part of that reveal, Keen Software House (not to be confused with&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/enshrouded" rel="nofollow">Enshrouded</a>&nbsp;</em>studio Keen Games) promised an Early Access release date the following week.</p>

<p>Now, that time has come;&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>will officially arrive in Early Access on January 27th, so make sure to mark that date on your calendar if you're looking forward to some co-op space engineering fun.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/space-engineers-2-early-access-release-date-space-base.jpg?itok=j35s3ikz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/space-engineers-2-early-access-release-date-space-base.jpg?itok=JlJin-fH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>is coming to Early Access in January.</figcaption></figure><p>In an announcement post revealing the Early Access date, Keen Software House says that rather than being a small update to the formula,&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>represents a "complete reimagining of the space engineering experience".</p>

<p>Plenty of new systems and gameplay mechanics will be introduced in&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2</em>, including new creative tools, a brand new engine with "better performance and future optimization potential", and improved visuals, among many other changes.</p>

<p>If you pick up&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>in Early Access, you'll gain, erm, access to what Keen Software House calls the "first vertical slice" of the game, which will consist of its Creative Mode. This mode will show off many of the game's new tools and features, so if you're looking to get an idea of what&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>will be capable of in the future, the Early Access release is the place to go.</p>




<p>In future, Keen Software House says it'll keep updating&nbsp;<em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>with new "vertical slices", each of which will expand the game's "features and content". In essence, it sounds like they'll work just like most Early Access game updates do.</p>

<p><em>Space Engineers 2&nbsp;</em>is coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1133870/Space_Engineers_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on January 27th.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/11-bit-studios">11 Bit Studios</a> has laid off an unknown number of staff following the cancellation of its console game codenamed Project 8.</p>
<p>Project 8 kicked off in 2018 and at least 37 people were working on it by the end of September 2024. The studio has invested "more than" 48.4m PLN in the game over that time, the equivalent of around £9.4m or $11.8m.</p>

<p>However, the studio said in a <a href="https://ir.11bitstudios.com/en/news/11-bit-studios-ends-development-of-project-8">statement</a> that although it achieved "noticeable quality improvements in certain areas", "several critical aspects of the game and its development process remained problematic despite multiple iterations". This caused delays, and "with each milestone", the project's budget grew.</p><p>The decision to shut it down finally came after 11 Bit reviewed Project 8's progress and found "unresolved issues and challenges that would require further extensions of the production timeline and corresponding budget increases to address. This, coupled with revised sales forecasts, largely reflecting the changing market environment, raised significant doubts about the project’s overall profitability".</p>
<p>This meant management lost confidence in the project and its "quality level", resulting in the termination.</p>
<p>"Our vision for Project 8, which was intended to be our first title designed specifically for console gamers, was bold and exciting," said Przemysław Marszał, president of the management board of 11 Bit studios. "However, it was conceived under very different market conditions, when narrative-driven, story-rich games held stronger appeal.</p>
<p>"With Project 8, we experienced both breakthroughs and setbacks. During the COVID-19 pandemic, stabilising the development team proved particularly difficult, yet progress continued. While we achieved noticeable quality improvements in certain areas, several critical aspects of the game and its development process remained problematic despite multiple iterations. Over time, delays accumulated, and with each milestone, the project's budget grew."</p><p>Although "more than half" of the current Project 8 team have been reassigned to other internal projects, Project 8's closure would result in a "reduction of staff involved in its development" with those impacted receiving unspecified severance packages and "psychological counselling and assistance in finding new employment".</p>
<p>The studio said it was still commitment to "several key projects", including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a> and The Alters.</p>
<p>The number of game developers impacted by job losses in 2024 alone now stands at around <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">14,600 people</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
