            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24173763/msi-claw-7-lunar-lake-roadmap-claw-2-claw-3-claw-4<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re still under the impression that an original MSI Claw might be a worthy purchase, I beg you to reconsider. MSI has now announced <em>not one but two </em>successors to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24105991/msi-claw-review">the embarrassing handheld</a> that are coming this fall — and hinting it might show off <em>yet another one</em> at CES in January.</p><p>MSI already revealed an eight-inch Lunar Lake version <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/3/24170904/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-lunar-lake-battery-computex">dubbed the MSI Claw 8 AI Plus</a> at Computex this week, but the company will put Intel’s Lunar Lake into a new seven-inch version at the same time<em>. </em>MSI Claw product management director Clifford Chun revealed the existence of that handheld <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dj3AZcoA-vCY">in an interview with <em>PCWorld</em></a> and explained that should arrive with the launch of Intel’s more efficient Lunar Lake chips this fall.</p><p>Lunar Lake not only has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23933156">up to 50 percent more GPU performance</a> than the current Meteor Lake — it requires substantially less power for the same performance. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/23935783">One early demo showed it drawing 10 fewer watts</a>, which could translate to a notable increase in battery life. Plus, the Claw 8 can fit a far larger battery pack at 80 watt-hours vs. the 53-watt-hour pack of the original. </p><p>Every Claw 8 in the US will come with that 80-watt-hour pack, says Chun, though he says it’s optional elsewhere.</p><p>Both the new Claw 8 and Claw 7 will have revised bumpers, more responsive versions of their drift-resistant Hall effect joysticks, two Thunderbolt 4 ports, and an easier-to-replace SSD, says Chun — still the small M.2 2230 type, but they’ve been moved out from under the fan. Chun says they’ll ship with better Intel drivers this time around. Chun did not clarify whether the new seven-incher will have the larger 80Wh battery as well.</p><div><p>“We’re already planning Claw 2, Claw 3, Claw 4.”</p></div><p>Both will cost a similar amount to the current MSI Claw, says Chun, so expect them around $700–800.</p><p>MSI is completely committed to handheld gaming PCs, says Chun. “We’re already planning Claw 2, Claw 3, Claw 4. We have a long two-year roadmap down already. We’ll continue pushing new form factors, new ideas, maybe even new CPUs.” </p><p>But not necessarily AMD: “We’re not aiming to go to AMD yet, but you know, maybe in Claw 3, Claw 4?” He hints that future handhelds are likely to be a similar size or larger: it tried five-inch and 10-inch handhelds but found them too small and too heavy respectively, though a 6-inch is possible. “Six-inch, seven-inch — you can’t really tell the difference,” he told <em>PCWorld</em>. </p><p>Weirdly, Chun suggests the poor showing of the original Claw came as a surprise. “We thought the seven was perfect at launch,” he says, talking about how it was a surprisingly “steep learning curve.” But he says MSI is listening and wants to rapidly fix things.</p><p>“We really believe in handheld devices. Keep coming, keep letting us know, we listen, and we’ll improve.” That’s not much comfort to the original buyers who picked up a Claw mere months ago, but maybe it’ll mean good competition in the future.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I’ll be away from home, but I’m thinking of bringing my console with me expressly so I can play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/destiny-2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/destiny-2"><em>Destiny 2</em></a></span><em> </em>and finish this fight. The road here has been difficult, both for fans of the series and its developers, so it’s a big moment for one of gaming’s biggest communities. I’m glad to be here and be a part of it.</p><p>I’ve been playing <em>Destiny </em>since the first game’s alpha test dropped us into the remnants of Old Russia and I fought my first Fallen Shank. I remember taking on <em>Destiny</em>’s first strike, the Devil’s Lair, and thinking it was the pinnacle of gaming. I came back for the beta, and was there on September 9, 2014 when <em>Destiny </em>launched. I still remember the week that Vault of Glass was introduced to the game. Me and my high school friends took on the challenge of our first raid and slammed our heads against the game’s byzantine leveling system as we squeezed our builds for any extra damage we could in order to overcome Atheon’s DPS check. We’d talk strategies in the back of our geometry class and run home to test them out. Some of those fireteam members are still some of my closest friends to this day, and that clunky, unpolished game remains a core memory of a defining era of my life.</p><p><em>Destiny</em>’s come a long way since then, and dammit, so have I. I’ve fought back the Fallen time and time again and eventually turned them into allies. I’ve gained the respect of a celebrated Cabal leader. I killed the fucking Taken King, his stupid-ass son Crota, and the rest of his godforsaken lineage. I lost the Light, got it back, and embraced the Darkness. I spent the later part of my teenage years and all of my adult life playing <em>Destiny. </em>This game has endured the most crushing defeats of my life, and it’s also been there to complement some of my greatest victories. For fuck’s sake, I cover this game for <em>Kotaku </em>now. This was <em>the </em>dream when I started playing it ten years ago. I’ve shared it with countless of my favorite people, and I can’t wait to share it with even more folks down the line. I don’t know what’s in store for either of our futures beyond this point, but I’m sure we’ll figure it out. — Moises Taveras</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2ad3436a34244aecea552bddd74315f3" data-recommend-id="image://2ad3436a34244aecea552bddd74315f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Soldiers stand in the middle of a power plant." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Soldiers stand in the middle of a power plant." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2ad3436a34244aecea552bddd74315f3" data-recommend-id="image://2ad3436a34244aecea552bddd74315f3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Soldiers stand in the middle of a power plant." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows (Steam Deck: YMMV)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Be gay, get killstreaks</p><p>The problem with preferring to play multiplayer shooters is that it’s really hard to consistently play more than one of them at a time.

That’s me right now, plugging away at <em>A Realm Reborn </em>because I’ve just heard <em>so</em> <em>much</em> good stuff about what lies beyond, and at times, it does feel like a bit of a slog. </p><p>Still, even if the narrative isn’t sweeping me away, I can see it all serving as necessary set-up for things that might pay off in big ways in the expansions that await me. And I’m enjoying the lovely and varied world, maybe the game’s greatest asset. I hope the talented and hardworking artists and visual designers who created the architecture, the objects, and the environments that give each region such a rich and distinctive feel were paid very well for their work, because that, more than anything else, is what’s keeping me playing right now. I particularly love being in the forests of Gridania when dusk falls; the vibes, as they say, are immaculate. Also, I just ran a dungeon set in a haunted manor, which made for a wonderful change of pace from the more “dungeon-y” dungeons I’d done up to this point. So I don’t intend to be like the man in the meme and turn back any time soon, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t really eager to get to the better stuff (or so everyone says) that awaits. — Carolyn Petit</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4ebdab21d1a53ad2742483849e253f29" data-recommend-id="image://4ebdab21d1a53ad2742483849e253f29" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A composite image shows a spartan from Halo and a guardian from Destiny 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A composite image shows a spartan from Halo and a guardian from Destiny 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->343 Industries / Bungie / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4ebdab21d1a53ad2742483849e253f29" data-recommend-id="image://4ebdab21d1a53ad2742483849e253f29" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A composite image shows a spartan from Halo and a guardian from Destiny 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> <em>Halo</em>: Xbox Series X/S, Windows (Steam Deck YMMV), <em>Destiny 2</em>: PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Windows (Steam Deck Nope)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Shoot things!

I also sat down with game director, Naoki Yoshida, to chat about the team’s goals in representing other cultures.</p><div data-video-id="195905" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo " data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="121" data-playlist="195905,191558,192610" data-current="195905"><div><p>Three Things We Learned From The Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth Demo </p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195905/195905_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21419.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>Though I remain wary of how <em>Final Fantasy 14 </em>might handle the thornier aspects of depicting cultures close to my own Dominican heritage, much of what I was shown does at least indicate that <em>Dawntrail </em>will make for yet another exciting and deep expansion to everyone’s favorite critically acclaimed MMO.</p><h2 id="h312344"><a id=""></a><strong>Grab your floaties y’all, it’s summer vacation</strong></h2><p>It’s a running joke in <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> that just as things seem to be settling down and characters implore the Warrior of Light (your player character) to rest after saving the world <em>again</em>, another conflict arises that keeps them from getting their well-deserved break. The same seems to be true of <em>Dawntrail</em>, which pulls them to a whole new land to tK TK WHY,. But this latest important mission hasn’t stopped <em>FF14 </em>director Naoki Yoshida from telling players to envision <em>Dawntrail</em> as the Warrior of Light’s summer vacation. </p><p>Tural, the new land featured in <em>Dawntrail</em>, seems as appropriate a place as any to spend a summer break. It’s tropical and looks warm as hell, and many of the cultural touchstones that Tural takes inspiration from originated in Mesoamerican countries, like Mexico, where white people are known to vacation. The team has also promised a ton of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-raids-field-operations-1851512773&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-raids-field-operations-1851512773">fun new arcs</a></span>, including a tournament storyline that I’m sure folks will enjoy and more. Though the preview build that was made available to us was limited in how much of Tural (and its people) we could see and interact with, it looked and felt like a true slice of Central America, rather than a cheap caricature.</p><p>This was a specific concern of mine, as well as my joint interviewer and colleague <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/OhMyMithrandir&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/OhMyMithrandir" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kate Sanchez</a></span> of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://butwhytho.net/2024/06/ffxiv-dawntrail-yoshi-p-interview/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://butwhytho.net/2024/06/ffxiv-dawntrail-yoshi-p-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>But Why Tho</em></a></span>. As Latinos, we’re used to our cultures getting bastardized by dishonest lenses or lazy writing, which often reduce us to tropes and mechanisms rather than see us as diverse and distinct people. Each of us are radically different versions of what a person might call a <em>latino</em>, and we always hope that we’re acknowledged and understood as part of a much larger and richer tapestry than our two individual (and different) backgrounds. </p><p><em>Final Fantasy 14</em>, and Yoshida himself, have faced tremendous backlash in the past over the perceived whitening of previously dark-skinned characters, as well as the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ffxvi-square-enix-naoki-yoshida-ff16-release-date-1849744847&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ffxvi-square-enix-naoki-yoshida-ff16-release-date-1849744847">conspicuous lack of diverse characters</a></span> in both <em>14</em> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/review-final-fantasy-16-ffxvi-ps5-rpg-release-date-1850558485&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/review-final-fantasy-16-ffxvi-ps5-rpg-release-date-1850558485"><em>Final Fantasy 16</em></a></span>, which Yoshida produced. It made his answers to our questions refreshing, and a little relieving, even if the game still has to prove itself.</p><h2 id="h312345"><a id=""></a><strong>Weaving a tapestry</strong></h2><p>During our interview, Sanchez asked Yoshida about<em> Dawntrail</em>’s specific inspirations, considering the lengths of the Latin Diaspora, which saw Latin American people spread across the world, forming their own cultures and dialects. <em>Dawntrail </em>and Tural feel shaped by two distinct forces: the team’s desire to explore someplace new and different from what it’s always known, and the feedback that it’s received over the curious absences of other perspectives and kinds of people in <em>FF14</em>. According to Yoshida, the team had already been doing exhaustive research into Latin American regions of the world, but as he also jokes, “I’m sure a lot of players have wanted to see tacos being featured in the game.” With cultural touchstones like food in mind, and a narrative that supposedly centers “understanding,” the team set about creating a world that tries to honor Latino culture and its multitudes.</p><figure id="" data-id="59c85a358c214cdfbecb3903c4276d56" data-recommend-id="image://59c85a358c214cdfbecb3903c4276d56" data-format="jpg" data-width="1728" data-height="972" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of a town in Tural, Dawntrail's new land.

A temple can be seen above the village with a shining light coming from it, and the environment is warm, and filled with tropical trees." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When I asked Yoshida about his and his team’s excitement for exploring a culture so outside of their respective purviews, he stepped back a bit and stressed that the team doesn’t view <em>FF14</em>’s expansion into Tural as some completion of an objective or quota. “I don’t think we want to specifically target this culture,” Yoshida answered via translator, suggesting that he and his team are not scooping up diverse cultures to satisfy some type of quota.<br></p><p>Instead, Yoshida, who’s often viewed by <em>FF14</em>’s fandom with reverence for his devotion to the <em>FF </em>universe, thinks of himself and his team as conductors of the kind of fantasy the players want to see. When he tells us that he wants to gauge fan reactions and continue to tell the kind of stories that they want, or when he mentions earlier in the interview that player feedback about implementing Latin American perspectives helped shape <em>Dawntrail</em>, I believe him. He’s molded <em>FF14 </em>to its audience time and time again, sometimes for the better and sometimes for the worse, and <em>Dawntrail </em>doesn’t seem particularly different in this regard. Question the efficacy of his efforts all you want (I will continue to), but he clearly places <em>FF14</em>’s community first. Because of that we now have tacos, female Hrothgars (Latina queens), the land of Tural, and what I hope will be an honest portrayal of cultures like my own.</p><p>It may come across as a joke, but Yoshida and his team are quite proud of how they’ve treated aspects like food, which are huge touchstones for any culture. Various towns and villages around Tural, such as the hub of Tuliyollal, will have their own respective foods that differ from each other, so don’t expect to find the same dishes or exports in Urgopacha that you would elsewhere., .There will be melting pots, but the team is also taking the time to make sure Tural is broadly representative of many of the real differences in Latino cultures. And for the record, those are some Latino-ass names for those locales, so on first whiff at least, <em>Dawntrail</em>’s passing the smell test.</p><h2 id="h312346"><a id=""></a><strong>Time for a summer job</strong></h2><p>As is par for the course, <em>Dawntrail </em>not only adds a whole new section of the world to explore but entirely new jobs for players to adopt as they tackle Tural’s new challenges. These jobs are the melee-focused DPS Viper and the ranged-DPS Pictomancer, which are so visually and tonally distinct from one another that it’s hard picturing them as a part of the same expansion.</p><p>The Viper has a rogue, swashbuckling pirate vibe to them. If you’ve seen the promotional materials for <em>Dawntrail</em>, then you’ve seen the stand-in for the Warrior of Light in the Viper’s garb. The Viper’s gimmick is <em>complicated</em>, and so is making the most of the Viper’s extensive kit and skillset. Their weapon has two shapes, beginning in a one-handed form before one of your weapon skills transforms it into dual blades more fitting of an archetypal RPG rogue.</p><p>Whereas most jobs quickly settle into familiar skill rotations that can churn out the most damage, the Viper’s rotations are complex and branching. You can wail on the same command and get a satisfying combo going, but changing even one step of it for an alternative attack might generate an entirely different buff and subsequent effect. For most classes, this could be confused for a dropped rotation, but Viper feels infinitely more improvisational in the way that most of its individual skills still feed into its deeper capabilities. It will certainly require someone with a deep understanding of how to maximize DPS to wring everything from the Viper class.</p><figure id="" data-id="84ea2323db736e54442ac03246b7f6e9" data-recommend-id="image://84ea2323db736e54442ac03246b7f6e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1728" data-height="972" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of a Viper, one of Dawntrail's new jobs, using their weapon in its single-blade form." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of a Viper, one of Dawntrail's new jobs, using their weapon in its single-blade form." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="84ea2323db736e54442ac03246b7f6e9" data-recommend-id="image://84ea2323db736e54442ac03246b7f6e9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1728" data-height="972" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of a Viper, one of Dawntrail's new jobs, using their weapon in its single-blade form." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The entire time that you’re attacking as a Viper, you’re also building two gauges. One allows them to generate and store three charges of the aforementioned weaponskill that transforms the singular blade into dual swords, unlocking a whole new set of abilities that can generate even further combos. By the time that I got comfortable with the Viper, I was able to maintain lengthy combos without any dropped inputs that featured various weapon transformations. The job’s second gauge keeps track of something called Serpent’s Ire, which generates a certain amount of meter based on the rotations that you pull off. Getting to 50 (or half of the gauge) allows the Viper to go into a high-powered state that transforms most of their existing abilities into moves called generations and legacies. You’ll see skills labeled first through fourth generation, and you’ll want to do them in order, but every use of a generation move will also unlock a complimentary follow up legacy technique. In this situation, I fell back on a combo that executed the current generation and its accompanying legacy before moving onto the next until I had an eight-step combo which culminated in a pure burst of energy and a hefty chunk of damage to whoever was on the receiving end.<br></p><p>Viper is easily the most involved DPS I’ve ever played, especially considering the fact that I’m so used to jobs like Samurai where I’m able to just check out for the most part. It certainly runs the risk of alienating folks who were hoping for something flashy and immediately accessible, but I think if you’re looking for a deep job that requires an immense amount of thought and micromanaging, Viper will do the trick.</p><p>Pictomancer isn’t a straightforward gig either, but it’s at least a few difficulty notches below Viper’s branching combos. Pictomancer’s skills are all colors that are approximations of spells and elements seen in <em>FF14</em>, such as the color red and fire. The execution of a combo ending in blue will generate charges that can be used to deploy Holy, otherwise known as white here, and players can also use area-of-effect variants of the same colors to also generate the same charges while taking out multiple creatures.</p><p>Pictomancer can completely swap their palette though, allowing for entirely different elements which generate a darker charge used to deploy Comet instead of holy. While players can bounce between the palettes, Pictomancer’s most wild gimmick allows it to draw aspects of monsters and make them real, such as a damaging gale from a monster’s wings or the sting of its bite. First the player has to draw the aspect to unlock its skill, which adds the drawing to a series of canvases on screen. For example, the Pictomancer can draw a comically large hammer, which they then expressively swing like a cartoon character. Filling every canvas eventually allows the Pictomancer to deploy a high-damage attack that combines them all, but upon its use, the canvases are cleared to begin the cycle again. And this is only just scratching the surface of the Pictomancer’s intimidating range of abilities.</p><h2 id="h312347"><a id=""></a><strong>Business as usual</strong></h2><p>For all of its extravagances and new jobs to play with, the main content of the preview, a lone dungeon, was the most familiar part of the whole <em>Dawntrail </em>affair. Beginning in the midst of a chase along a river, the dungeon moved through much of the same motions of dungeons I’ve encountered before, and players shouldn’t expect much to be different here, though it was still an exciting mission by all accounts.</p><figure id="" data-id="6b72ac39eaaa7d04446baff9d3e8f4dd" data-recommend-id="image://6b72ac39eaaa7d04446baff9d3e8f4dd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1728" data-height="972" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the dungeon I was able to play, Ihuykatumu.

You begin the dungeon chasing another ship on the river." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You are routed through a series of three boss fights, and each has their own set of mechanics that need mastery for you to survive. The first fight was pretty standard, attacking with large AoE techniques that needed to be dodged while simultaneously doing damage. The second fight featured a monster that would summon large vines from underground and risked flattening players.Without the usual ground markers telegraphing their attacks until the last minute, you had to actually size up the vines and the directions they were facing in order to avoid heavy damage or being reset if you were playing solo. The final fight featured my favorite mechanic of the entire dungeon, which was a moving tornado that also then shot out AoE techniques in a star like pattern around it, which called for precision to avoid.</p><p>I had a blast playing through it numerous times over, and its last fight was a particularly delightful, dizzying dance, making <em>Dawntrail</em>’s dungeons about up to snuff with the exemplary stuff you’ve come to expect from the game by now.<br></p><p>Elsewhere, I got to see some of 7.0’s other shiny new features, such as the overhaul of <em>FF14</em>’s graphics. Though I’ve never found the game to be anything short of pretty, MMOs aren’t often known for their visual fidelity, especially as far as character models and environments. But <em>FF14</em> has taken some mighty big steps with 7.0, which renders Tural’s countryside with stunning vivacity. Fields are much more lush as well and even just the detail on my beautiful female Hrothgar character (also new to <em>Dawntrail</em>) was several notches above the models currently in the game. Fidelity isn’t usually a point of emphasis for me, but I can’t deny that <em>FF14 </em>has successfully glowed up, and even more changes will continue to roll out over the course of the next few years.</p><p>All in all, <em>Dawntrail </em>is shaping up to be a promising expansion. Though Yoshida’s warned that it may not necessarily mark the start of <em>FF14</em>’s next sweeping saga, it is still a big step for the game and its team, which appears to be stepping out of its comfort zone with Tural. I will be watching it carefully, but if our conversations have illuminated anything, it’s that the team’s aware of what a big deal it’ll be to get this right. So much else about the expansion, including its intense new jobs and vibrant locale, that this team knows what it’s doing.

<p data-characters="116" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>EA FC 24</em> Euro Attackers Evolution is now live in Ultimate Team, and it’s a rather strange set of upgrades.</p> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="296" data-injectable="false">Unlike previous evolutions, the <em>EA FC 24</em> Euro Attackers Evolution only applies to four cards.

Hence, this guide will focus on who can be the best choice for the evolution and why you should consider the choice over the rest.</p> <h2 id="h-ea-fc-24-euro-attackers-evolution-requirements" data-injectable="false">EA FC 24 Euro Attackers Evolution requirements</h2> <p data-characters="193" data-current-count="489" data-injectable="true">There’s not much to discuss about this evolution’s requirements.

Here are the following names (do note that the options could increase in the days to come – something similar happened with Future Stars Academy evolutions)</p>
 <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="160" data-injectable="false"> <li>Karim Adeyemi</li> <li>Ciro Immobile</li> <li>Raheem Sterling</li> <li>Michael Olise</li> </ul> <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="421" data-injectable="false">Karim Adeyemi appears as the best choice, as he gets one extra playstyle+ compared to Immobile and Sterling. While Olise has slightly better dribbling and finishing, Adeyemi’s evolved item has better work rates and can operate in four different positions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-summer-game-fest-price<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new <a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a61006534/summer-game-fest-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report from Esquire</a> – <a href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-sgf-prices-trailer-cost-e3-keighley-1851523472" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">corroborated by Kotaku</a> – has laid out the pricing structure of Summer Game Fest, and it ain’t cheap. Beginning at $250,000 for one minute of trailer time, Keigh-3 Keigh-sees some developers and publishers pay up to $550,000 for 2.5 minutes. Is it worth the steep price of entry? On this week’s episode of Aftermath Hours, we discuss that.</p><p>This week, we begin by talking about Summer Game Fest’s significance in the wider landscape of video games and how, on one hand, it acts as a flashpoint that briefly gets multiple gaming subcultures on the same page, but on the other, it’s no E3. That in mind, should developers spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to be part of it? Opinions are predictably divided. Then we talk about SGF-adjacent announcements like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-dreadwolf-dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dragon Age</em>’s puzzling name change</a> and <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s long-awaited <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/we-had-3-writers-play-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-here-are-9-things-one-of-us-found-but-the-others-didnt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay reveal</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, we move on to a discussion of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg’s report on<em> Suicide Squad</em>’s fraught development</a>, which culminates in the birth of a new segment: These Guys Should Not Be In Charge. Speaking of, we then segue elegantly into a conversation about <a href="https://aftermath.site/variety-gaming-coverage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Variety’s pivot (back) into games coverage</a>, which mirrors <a href="https://aftermath.site/rolling-stone-glixel-savvy-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone’s recent games renaissance</a> – albeit with less Saudi money involved. Finally, we talk about <a href="https://aftermath.site/valve-team-fortress-2-fixtf2-bots-botspam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Valve’s continued mishandling of <em>Team Fortress 2</em>’s bot crisis</a>, a story that resurfaces about once per year because, well, Valve still hasn’t solved the problem! And if that’s not enough for you, we close out by getting mad about trains.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can buy a Summer Game Fest slot and use it to advertise blogs.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Kotaku reported that some smaller indies and also the big companies get in for free?</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yeah, so the big companies get in for free for a pretty obvious reason: They bring the eyeballs. What companies that are mid-tier and smaller are paying for is the ability to siphon off some of that attention and be part of something where people will remember their game alongside this major announcement from Big Company X. It will always be intertwined. People will always be like “What’s going on with that game that I remember, that stands out from the crowd, because it was part of this major showcase?” That part at least makes sense to me even if, from a cost-benefit analysis standpoint, I’m like, I don’t know about that, man. That’s a lot of money for a few minutes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> What it makes me wonder is, if the big companies don’t have to pay, who is paying $550,000. What company is that?</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Probably the double-A companies, the Saber Interactives of the world.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Is that a good use of your money?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I saw some PR people talking online, and they seemed to think it was. On one hand, yeah, it’s a lot of money; on the other, this could be a singularly defining moment for the narrative surrounding your game. It could be the thing that puts it on the map and keeps it on the map for years to come. For some games that never end up in that place – that never get a chance to be on the map – yeah, [it’s an appealing proposition].&nbsp;</p><p>I think it’s a roll of the dice, though. There’s also a chance that based on the way the show is organized and everything like that, you could have your game get shown and then it gets stomped by a much more significant trailer. People immediately forget that your game was ever there. I saw people online talking about how longer segments tend to do better. Like, if you’ve got a little short trailer that gets sandwiched between two longer ones, it probably gets forgotten. But if you take up some actual screen real estate, people are not gonna forget, for better or for worse.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Yeah, you’re paying a lot in this era of booming development costs. It’s a lot of money. But I guess we don’t know what it costs to be in the Game Awards.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>We do. These are similar to the prices that Keighley charges for The Game Awards.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Esquire also pointed out that Keighley is the only person officially on paper on The Game Awards LLC or whatever it’s called. But surely, obviously other people paid and involved in the show must cost a great deal of money too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Yeah, and he hires production crews, rents out these massive theaters. I doubt that the show itself is cheap to produce.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Yeah, I don’t think he’s rolling around in a vault full of money.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I mean, I do think he’s rich, but I don’t think he’s pocketing most of this.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>People were talking about this in the comments to my blog – and the Esquire piece pointed this out, too – about how little we know about him as a person. He doesn’t even have a “personal life” Wikipedia section. And I’m tainted with this disease where I want to understand what everybody is like and think the best about them, and so I respect that for him. I respect that he has strong boundaries around his private and public lives, and he deserves that, and I admire that, and I want him to have that. But is he real? Does he live in LA? What is his life? What does he do? What is one fact about him as a guy?</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Is he Canadian? These are very basic questions you can probably just ask somebody who knows him.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Who knows him?</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> But the idea of treating him like he’s a woodland creature or something like that [is funny].</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>It’s sort of admirable that he’s both the product and not the product. His blankness lets these games shine even though he is the focal point. It’s a very elegant dance. I respect that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>His parents were involved with IMAX. We knew that because he got put on an award show much earlier in his life – when he was, like, a teenager – so he’s always been in this scene.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Typical IMAX baby.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Somebody in chat said he doesn’t actually do anything. He just waits until the next award show. I imagine him like an RPG character, selecting the “wait” option in the menu and setting it to 180 days from now. And then he just sits down like Geralt from <em>The Witcher</em>, kind of kneels, and that’s it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>I don’t mean to be mean, but he does have a <em>Skyrim </em>NPC-like affect to his eyes. He does look like he’s going to say, “Fine greetings to you.” He’s got a flat affect. He’s so identified with his job that it’s hard for me to conceptualize him as a real person because I’ve never met him. It’s sort of like when you’re like “When I leave school, my teacher just lives under the desk.” You see them at the supermarket, and it’s fucking weird.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I’ve never seen his physical body [in person]. It’s like that time that I saw Jeff Bezos in The Washington Post office, and it was like, oh, he’s a real man with a body, and that body is in a space where my body is.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I saw Geoff on the sidewalk at… I wanna say GDC one year. Some event where he would be, but kind of in incognito mode. But it was funny because he walked by, and this is when he was still following me on Twitter – he’s since unfollowed me – but I said, “Hey Geoff!” and he sort of grunted and kept walking.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>And then he unfollowed you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Right then and there. It would’ve been great if he turned around, pulled out his phone, opened Twitter, went to my profile, and showed it to me as he unfollowed me. And then just walked away after that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>That would be nice, yeah.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I would dine out on that story for years.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> And he would deserve it. Good for him. &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The bundle includes 27 items from the Black Library, and there are some real gems here, as well as the start to several series. These books are in ePUB and MOBI format, which means that they can be read digitally on an ereader or browser.</p>
<p id="RnmYQw">The highlights include some anthologies from the Horus Heresy, a sprawling prequel series that takes place 10,000 years before the main 40K setting. <em>Lupercal’s War</em>, <em>Cthonia’s Reckoning</em>, and <em>Sons of the Emperor</em> all include tales from the Heresy.</p>
<p id="fuwXhC">If you prefer more modern stories, there’s some absolute bangers that take place in the dark millennium. <em>Fire Caste</em> by Peter Fehervari is one of my favorite 40K books; it’s <em>Apocalypse Now</em> through a grimdark, far future lens. <em>The Lords of Silence </em>by Chris Wraight<em> </em>follows the corrupted Death Guard, Chaos Space Marines in service to the Plague God Nurgle. You might think that’s an unrelatable point of view, but Wraight does a fantastic job at getting the reader invested in these characters. <em>Valedor</em> by Guy Haley is also considered to be one of the best novels about the Aeldari.</p>
<p id="2CRYQ1">In addition to these books I’d heartily recommend, there’s a wealth of literature I haven’t had the chance to pore through yet, like <em>Dark Apostle</em>, <em>Space Wolf</em>, <em>Lucius: The Faultless Blade</em>, <em>The Talon of Horus</em>, <em>Ice Guard</em>, <em>Avenging Son</em>, and <em>Titanicus</em>.</p>
<p id="kuUWCu">There’s also a selection of books from the <em>Age of Sigmar</em>, the wildly inventive and imaginative setting that was born out of the original Warhammer Fantasy Battles. I, for one, am looking forward to learning about history’s biggest hater in <em>Nagash: The Undying King</em>, by Josh Reynolds.</p>
<p id="h1VdRb">If you’re a fan of Warhammer, but aren’t sure where to start when it comes to the massive Black Library, this bundle is a great — and relatively inexpensive — option. The Bundle will end on June 27.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24100988/best-blu-rays-2024-4k-uhd<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>If you buy something from a Polygon link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pages/ethics-statement" target="_blank">ethics statement</a>.</p><div>
  <p id="Xl3fo9">Welcome to the one place your movies are safe: the land of physical media. </p>
<p id="dtyKpT">Perhaps you’ve lost faith in streaming companies to make your favorite movies easily available. Maybe you saw Max delete <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23297385/hbo-max-originals-best-list-where-to-watch-streaming">original films</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/23313193/hbo-max-infinity-train-summer-camp-island-ok-ko-watch">shows</a> from its platform. Perhaps you’re tired of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/21266801/best-movies-on-netflix">Netflix</a> cycling movies on and off the service. You could just be tired of having to Google where to find a particular movie, only to learn that what you found is already out of date. </p>
<p id="fcYW38">We make an effort to celebrate not just <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch">what’s new on streaming</a>, but what you can still own on Blu-ray or 4K UHD. Discs have better sound and image quality, but their real selling point is their permanence.</p>
<p id="6aVGLy">I had my own breaking point with streaming that launched my return trip to the shores of physical media. A couple of years ago, I began to notice many movies weren’t available to stream, neither on a subscription service nor VOD. In fact, some I could hardly even find on physical media, because the film got caught in a licensing dispute or its owners simply didn’t feel they’d make enough money off a restored release.</p>
<p id="lMaBe4">That’s why I’m so happy to share these recommendations, most of which come from medium and small labels, from big names like Criterion and Arrow to up-and-comers like Radiance and Severin. As retailers like <a href="https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/best-buy-ending-dvd-blu-ray-disc-sales-1235754919/">Best Buy scrap their Blu-ray aisles</a> and studios like Disney hand off distribution duties, these dedicated labels are keeping hundreds of films from falling off the face of the Earth.</p>
<p id="99ZJrd">What follows is our rolling list of the best Blu-ray and 4K UHD discs of 2024. We update the list regularly, so be sure to check back for the latest recommendations!</p>

<p id="P7PCJx">If you love Studio Ghibli films and yearn to take one step deeper into the ocean of anime, try the catalog of Makoto Shinkai. Though the director’s films haven’t hit cultural inescapability in the U.S. like <em>My Neighbor Totoro </em>and <em>Spirited Away</em>, they’re hardly niche. Films like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/4/7/15209584/your-name-love"><em>Your Name</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/19/21072640/weathering-with-you-review-makoto-shinkai-anime-gkids"><em>Weathering with You</em></a> have been phenomena among folks who pay close attention when they see the words “<a href="https://www.fathomevents.com/genre/anime/">Fathom Events</a>” or “<a href="https://www.cartoonbrew.com/distribution/crunchyroll-sony-and-wild-bunch-team-to-distribute-makoto-shinkais-suzume-no-tojimari-worldwide-216582.html">Crunchyroll Presents</a>.”</p>
<p id="I5cU8x">The director’s latest film, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23681072/makoto-shinkai-suzume-your-name-anime-romance"><em>Suzume</em></a>, tells the classic fairy tale of (checks notes) a man who turns into a chair and must partner with a teenage girl to save Japan from a gargantuan worm that embodies the anxiety of ecological collapse. Sorry, did I say classic? I meant batshit unpredictable. How did this get made? What good deeds did I do to deserve a gift of such joyous creativity?</p>
<p id="cNuCKP">Last year, the film took the 14th spot in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23597815/best-movies-2023">Polygon’s list</a> of the year’s best movies. This year, it’s one of our favorite Blu-rays. The special edition disc includes an abundance of extra features (including a beautiful art book) that will not only help viewers better appreciate the movie but also appreciate the broader work of Makoto Shinkai. The director provides a commentary, performs a stand-alone interview, and participates in a creative roundtable. Plus, the disc includes a behind-the-scenes documentary.</p>

<p id="z05Pca">Few films will flaunt (or shame) your home theater setup like <em>Crimson Peak</em>, Guillermo del Toro’s modern gothic horror romance. Set in the shadowy corridors of a decrepit English estate — lit by the moon, flickering candles, and supernatural glow — the film pleads for the pitch-black pixels and HDR brightness of an OLED TV.</p>
<p id="My1gDy">Can you enjoy this movie without a killer setup? If you like del Toro’s other movies, yes, you will probably love<em> Crimson Peak</em> even if you watch it on your smartphone. But there’s no getting around del Toro’s scope; he’s a director in the classical style, filling his scenes with handmade sets, detailed costumes, and general pizazz meant to be seen on the biggest and best screen available.</p>
<p id="v9atYF">The folks at Arrow have designed clever packaging to connect the film with its inspirations, presenting the case as a dusty old novel plucked from the shelves of a rare bookshop. The image lives up to the film’s visual ambitions. And for longtime fans, the package includes hours of supplemental material, including a commentary with del Toro, a 50-minute making-of video, a lengthy video essay, a deep dive into Gothic romance, and plenty more. </p>

<p id="Y4pcYQ">Announced roughly two years ago for home video release, <em>A Place Further Than the Universe</em> finally arrives on physical media in a spectacular special edition that more than makes up for the delays. For newcomers, the series (one of the best anime of the last decade) chronicles the Antarctica expedition of four high school girls. Its unique recipe mixes missing-person mystery, chill hangout comedy, and coming-of-age drama to immaculate effect. And as a 13-episode stand-alone series, you can enjoy the entire thing over a single weekend.</p>
<p id="ObvTzy">But we have to talk about what literally comes in the set: a poster (cool!), four art cards (nice!), and a 92-page journal (!!!) filled with character breakdowns, concept art, creator interviews, and more — all presented like a DIY scrapbook. I’m not much of a collector of pack-in knickknacks, but I adore this little book. </p>
<p id="zQtWrH">Not enough? The set also includes a making-of featurette and two soundtrack CDs. Shout Factory is handling the U.S. release, but if you’re in the U.K., Anime Limited is your source</p>

<p id="j2W5kv"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23473565/andor-season-1-review"><em>Andor</em></a><em> </em>rules. Hell, I’ll go so far as to say this new(ish) TV series gives the original Star Wars films <a href="https://www.polygon.com/star-wars/23352914/best-star-wars-movies-tv-shows-ranked">a run for their Imperial credits</a>. But unlike the movies, which have played on the biggest theatrical screens and received multiple home releases, <em>Andor </em>has spent its first years marooned in the Disney Plus solar system. This beautiful 4K set transports the series to the home theater, now with no internet (or streaming visual artifacts) required.</p>
<p id="N5rnP9">The SteelBook release also includes some tangible concept art cards and intangible bonuses, ranging from talent interviews to VFX breakdowns. However, they’re the definition of supplemental material. There’s one reason to grab this disc: to watch fresh, great Star Wars in the best format possible.</p>

<p id="Wcht1R"><em>Picnic at Hanging Rock</em> is like a ghost story about people who aren’t dead yet. Based on the 1967 novel of the same name, Peter Weir’s film (made only a few years after the book was published) begins like a traditional period piece, chronicling a field on Valentine’s Day of 1900. A group of schoolgirls, accompanied by their teachers, host a leisurely picnic at (where else) Victoria’s natural landmark, Hanging Rock.</p>
<p id="DbwGp1">But long before children go missing and a search begins, something is… off. About the kids. About the setting. About the actual texture of the film. Have you ever fallen asleep on the grass during a long summer day? You awake with blurry eyes, a festering sweat, and a heat exhaustion that makes everything feel as if it’s stuck in freshly poured tar on playground pavement. That’s how Weir captures the incident at Hanging Rock so that the viewer won’t notice when exhaustion turns into hallucination and then into something altogether phantasmagorical.</p>
<p id="UhhpLp">The first viewing makes for a killer mystery that blends horror elements with the Australian New Wave. But what’s special about the film, on repeated watches, is the comedown. Eventually, the other students and teachers must return to the school and society. And they must try to snap this psychedelic puzzle piece into the puzzle of their lives.</p>
<p id="Zgx50K">The Criterion release, now available in 4K, makes the most of HDR, the film looking as if it too is baking under a heat lamp. The disc includes an interview with Weir, a behind-the-scenes on-set documentary, and most interestingly for longtime fans, Weir’s early 52-minute short film,<em> Homesdale.</em></p>

<p id="1V32w1">I saw Satoshi Kon’s first film long before I was ready. I was one of those ’90s kids who rented <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/8/30/20836173/perfect-blue-satoshi-kon-explained"><em>Perfect Blue</em></a> as a dare and couldn’t emotionally process the traumatic moments that would later inspire some of the most eye-scrubbing scenes in Darren Aronofsky’s <em>Requiem for a Dream</em>. I was 14 or so. I barely had the stomach to handle the opening of <em>The Sixth Sense</em>. </p>
<p id="q06vfW">Since then, Kon’s work has become, for me, so much more than a provocative box at Blockbuster. The director followed <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/2022/10/18/23409442/scary-horror-movies-to-watch-psychological-thrillers-perfect-blue-wrong-turn-bad-milo"><em>Perfect Blue</em></a> with three films — <em>Millennium Actress</em>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/12/19/21029789/satoshi-kon-tokyo-godfathers-anime-gkids-re-release-4k-restoration"><em>Tokyo Godfathers</em></a>, and <em>Paprika</em>, along with one TV series, <em>Paranoia Agent</em> — before dying of pancreatic cancer in 2010 at the age of 46. </p>
<p id="qcgxTU">By college, I had the chance to catch up on the catalog and see <em>Paprika</em> when it arrived in U.S. theaters. And I knew, within minutes, I’d found one of my favorite artists. I cherish that journey, from being a kid who doesn’t know what he’s seeing and being terrified, to being an adult who <em>still </em>doesn’t always know what he’s seeing and finding that affecting.</p>
<p id="QRkKRP">Kon has become more popular in recent years with semi-regular showings of his films at rep houses and popular theater chains. Last month, the popular movie podcast <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/blank-check-with-griffin-david/id981330533"><em>Blank Check</em></a> completed an exhaustive and lovely reassessment, working from <em>Perfect Blue</em> to <em>Paprika</em>. My advice for newcomers? Go in reverse order. <em>Paprika</em> has inspired — to say the least — Christopher Nolan, particularly his mind-bending thriller <em>Inception</em>. From there, you can enjoy the criminally underappreciated Christmas film <em>Tokyo Godfathers</em>, then learn the history of Japanese cinema through<em> Millennium Actress</em>, and then, when you’re ready for it, <em>Perfect Blue </em>will be waiting.</p>
<p id="BLwuCO">This disc, presented in a stunning 4K transfer, includes interviews with many of Kon’s collaborators.</p>

<p id="3aCaMX">Arnold always had it. </p>
<p id="H03daA">In 1982’s <em>Conan the Barbarian</em> (released two years before the first Terminator film), the champion bodybuilder turned actor looks like he left the Gold’s Gym weight room and strolled onto set, yet he delivers a fearless performance that should be the envy of Juilliard grads. Don’t believe me? Focus on what Schwarzenegger does with his face. Though every other part of his body has been cut from a single slab of marble, his mouth and eyes twist and widen in ways that call to mind great silent film performances.</p>
<p id="9b2hNh">This new 4K release from Arrow is a shrine to these early days of Arnold, which would pour the foundation for the following decades of his R-rated popcorn masterpieces. The set includes an archival commentary with the man himself, along with a new commentary by Paul M. Sammon, the author of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Conan-Phenomenon-Paul-Sammon/dp/1616551887?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Conan-Phenomenon-Paul-Sammon/dp/1616551887?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23865029__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23865029__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}"><em>Conan: The Phenomenon</em></a>. A second disc includes a king’s bounty of documentaries, interviews, and on-set footage that provides juicy info on every aspect of the film, from its look to the killer score.  </p>
<p id="fYJVBU"><em>Conan the Barbarian</em> hasn’t had the lasting power of other Schwarzenegger classics, but that comes with its silver lining: The odds are high you haven’t seen this delightful epic full of elaborate sets and practical effects.</p>

<p id="edQwgD">Saul Bass is known as one of the great creators of <a href="https://www.bfi.org.uk/lists/celebrating-saul-basss-centenary-10-essential-title-sequences">opening credits</a>: <em>Psycho</em>, <em>Vertigo</em>, <em>The Man with the Golden Arm</em>, <em>Seconds</em>. Even if you haven’t seen those films, you’ve seen the work of Bass’ admirers. His work is still being parodied and pastiched by the likes of Steven Spielberg and Matthew Weiner, who borrowed liberally from Bass with the iconic opening credits of <em>Mad Men</em>.</p>
<p id="a8ERSb">Bass, however, is not known as a film director. He directed one feature film and it bombed so hard it got the <em>Mystery Science Theater 3000</em> treatment. What a shame. <em>Phase IV</em> is an ambitious and fearless sci-fi film that deserves reappraisal. This 4K restoration may be its best shot.</p>
<p id="dBowai">You’ll understand why this film benefits from a proper visual upgrade from the blurry depths of the home video bin. Bass spends an exceptional amount of the film’s run time with actual ants, shooting them with microlenses so that they look (and even behave) like characters. He doesn’t give them cheeky voice-over; he just lets our minds wonder what might be going through their heads. </p>
<p id="eCDLQA">Like I assume an actual global ant takeover would work, the movie stars very slow and small, the camera leisurely following a couple of ants through their daily activities. But in time, their efforts gain momentum, and suddenly ants are bringing down buildings and converting poisonous sludge into antlike weaponry.</p>
<p id="aPq43o">Bass took this project seriously, and Vinegar Syndrome has mirrored that approach with the three-disc set, including a Blu-ray disc featuring a reconstruction of an early version of the film, plus the original ending that really must be seen to be believed. We’re talking ending of <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> stuff. With ants!</p>

<p id="btO8TY">If you like horror, you’re familiar with <em>The Ring</em>, either in its original form from Hideo Nakata or its American adaptation by Gore Verbinski. It’s less likely you have seen its follow-up, <em>Dark Water</em>, in which Nakata once again adapts the work of author Koji Suzuki to terrifying effect.</p>
<p id="YCvXj8"><em>The Ring</em>’s central premise of a deadly videotape and ticking clock toward death is unforgettable. But for me, <em>Dark Water</em> is a stronger drama, one that spends equal time on scares as it does spelunking the interior lives of its single mother and child. As to be expected from an Arrow release, the package includes a grab bag of interviews, trailers, and even a short documentary on the making of the film.</p>

<p id="u6kHJj">Despite being a big-budget, Oscar-nominated sci-fi spectacle made by James Cameron, <em>The Abyss</em> has been unavailable (in high-quality formats) for decades. If you lived in New York or LA, you could pray for a repertory screening; otherwise, your best bet was making do with a 20-year-old DVD. </p>
<p id="93GMm7">Alongside 4K releases of <em>Aliens</em> and <em>True Lies</em>, James Cameron’s original sci-fi masterpiece finally gets the home video treatment. The final product is incredible — as if everyone involved in this release wondered, in the back of their heads, if it would be another 20 years before <em>The Abyss</em> gets some TLC.</p>
<p id="QsZf1U">The picture and the sound make the most of the 4K HDR disc, whether it’s a glowing alien spacecraft or the close-up of an exceedingly handsome Ed Harris shouting technical jargon about watercraft. Sure, the computer-animated special effects have aged since 1989, but they still fit comfortably within the film. Credit the art direction, along with what I have to imagine was a great deal of technical attention in the film’s long restoration process. </p>
<p id="k9mtoj">The set includes nearly two hours of additional documentaries and interviews. It’s nice gravy. But frankly, we’ve been waiting so long for the mashed potatoes that I would have been fine with them scooped right on my plate, simple and delicious.</p>

<p id="cZHjKQ">Released in 1939, only six years after the end of Prohibition, <em>The Roaring Twenties</em> was made by people who could remember that era — who <em>lived</em> it. For director Raoul Walsh, the Roaring ’20s were the years he cut his teeth as a director in Hollywood, putting out 14 films in 10 years. Considering the state of Los Angeles at that time, it’s safe to assume he was familiar with the world of bootleg liquor.</p>
<p id="SQgvBp">Perhaps that’s why Walsh imbues his criminals with such humanity, rather than treating them like the petty parodies with which so many other gangster movies indulge. That the cast is a murderers’ row of Golden Age talent, including James Cagney, Humphrey Bogart, and Priscilla Lane, certainly helps give each character a spark of life, too. </p>
<p id="bl1HUT">Why, though, is this movie on this list versus countless other old movies? Because it moves like a modern film. Spanning a decade in under two hours, the movie hurls forward like a Model T with nitrous boosters. </p>
<p id="qM0MQH">For some film history context, the disc includes a commentary with historian Lincoln Hurts and an interview with critic Gary Giddins, along with a handful of additional bonus features to sweeten the pot.</p>

<p id="f2fnNv">Radiance has become the Criterion Collection for movies I’ve never heard of. When a new disc arrives, it will most likely be a surprising delight, and at minimum, something that gets me thinking about what movies can and should be. This year, I can already recommend <em>Goodbye &amp; Amen</em> (an Italian spy thriller), <em>Allonsanfan</em> (a stately drama with a not-to-be-missed Ennio Morricone score), and as you’ve seen above, <em>Black Tight Killers</em>.</p>
<p id="cZnfc0">Forget story. With <em>Black Tight Killers</em>, you only need to know the ingredients. A gang of female assassins who wield deadly vinyl records. A bundle of lost World War II gold. A 1960s pop score that would make Austin Powers grin. You can feel director Yasuharu Hasebe having a blast with this film; the joy is contagious.</p>
<p id="IdGrtR">Radiance includes an archival interview with the director and a commentary track featuring critic Jasper Sharp, and while I’m grateful for the inclusions, the star of the show is the film itself: a quirky delight that speaks for itself with cool suits, audacious colors, and action sequences involving everything from a helicopter to an improvised flamethrower.</p>

<p id="7rVHN2">But reader, if you want a set so pretty that you can display it in your living room, there’s only one choice: the new limited-edition coffee table book collection. It technically is a book, the discs resting in sleeves between pages full of classic photos, posters, and original art. But the cover looks more like a poster, ready to be framed.</p>
<p id="qcraGm">The set includes tons of special features for every film, from <em>Frankenstein</em> to <em>Creature from the Black Lagoon</em>. One caveat: This set is limited to 4K. If you’re a hardcore collector, this set rules and you’ve probably already made the purchase. If you’re new to these exceptional horror standards, the other box sets are just as worthy as entry points.</p>

  <p id="tuO5o3">Two things can be true at the same time.</p>
<p id="AkwhLG">One: We’re halfway through 2024 and the AAA video game industry hasn’t had a single new, mainstream breakout hit. More damning: If we look at the months ahead, the biggest-budget release of this year may be <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24170532/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-preview-release-date">an expansion to the biggest game of 2022</a>. For folks who’ve spent decades filling their weekends with blockbuster games from name-brand publishers like EA and Activision, 2024 may feel like a wash. </p>
<p id="6vwWiQ">I suppose I could spend the next thousand words explaining the shortsighted failings of video game executives who <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24171899/xbox-showcase-2024-preview-analysis">steered well-intentioned productions into fickle trends</a> that would fade long before a game’s release. But today, I want to do something a bit different. Rather than bemoan poor business decisions, I’d like to celebrate the abundance of creative decisions outside AAA. Which brings us to…</p>

<p id="hYC5cm">Two: We’re living in an unprecedented moment of video game abundance. You just need to know where to look. (And you should probably consider <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/23941731/best-pc-games-windows-mac-steam-epic">a desktop PC</a> or <a href="https://www.polygon.com/best-games/22948034/steam-deck-best-games">a Steam Deck</a>.) </p>
<p id="dyMvkD">In May alone, we saw the release of 12 games that were at minimum good, mostly great, and in a couple of cases, earned spots on Polygon team members’ unwritten greatest-games-of-all-time lists. This weekend, as you take in the AAA pageantry of Summer Game Fest, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24167070/summer-game-fest-2024-schedule-sgf-e3">watching countless trailers</a> for games that won’t be available <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24171532/summer-game-fest-2024-e3-xbox-showcase-ubisoft-forward">for months or even years</a>, I urge you to try one of these delights. All of which, I remind you, are available <em>right now</em>!</p>
<p id="rUQQIl">To help you select the right fit, I’ve written a little elevator pitch for each option.</p>
<hr id="MQAcdg">
<h2 id="v4CKPa"><strong>12 incredible new games to play right now</strong></h2>
<div id="Q8fk5b"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bFI1QSd4T2g?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="lLzlCH"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/"><em><strong>Selaco</strong></em></a><strong>:</strong> A micro-indie studio built a new, narrative-rich sci-fi universe that blends <em>Half-Life</em> and <em>System Shock</em> without skimping on tight, brutal gunplay. And they constructed this magnificent Frankenstein’s monster on the ultra-upgraded skeleton of the tools that powered <em>Doom</em>.</p>
<p id="IbaLdo"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2238040/Tiny_Terrys_Turbo_Trip/"><em><strong>Tiny Terry’s Turbo Trip</strong></em></a><strong>: </strong>What if Double Fine (the creators of the Psychonauts and Monkey Island series) made a spiritual sequel to the PS2-era cult classic <em>The Simpsons: Hit &amp; Run</em>?</p>
<p id="UmbIUI"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1675830/1000xRESIST/"><em><strong>1000xResist</strong></em></a><strong>:</strong> Many critics have compared this narrative adventure to<em> 13 Sentinels </em>and <em>Nier: Automata</em>. I adore those games, but <em>1000xResist</em> has more in common with sci-fi literature, particularly the works of Ted Chiang. Where <em>13 Sentinels</em> explored the tropes and history of the sci-fi genre and<em> Nier: Automata</em> dug into the wavy line between gods, humans, and machines, <em>1000xResist </em>asks something more individual: what society would make of a teenage girl with immunity to a fatal pandemic — not just in the short term but the very, very, very long term. Unlike with <em>The Last of Us</em>, the answer doesn’t involve killing every character you meet. </p>
<div id="WMbi3K"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ISmiWUpiDs4?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="9ygZmb"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2882440/DEVIL_BLADE_REBOOT/"><em><strong>Devil Blade Reboot</strong></em></a><strong>:</strong> If you have enough imagination to buy into the thrills of an old-school pixelated shoot-’em-up (not everybody does!) then congratulations: You’ve just discovered the most high-octane action video game of 2024. Name any other game that lets you pilot a “not an X-Wing” and obliterate a “not a Star Destroyer” one colossal chunk of spacecraft at a time.</p>
<p id="kAXzUr"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2717880/The_Rogue_Prince_of_Persia/"><em><strong>The Rogue Prince of Persia</strong></em></a><strong>:</strong> For years, the team at Evil Empire expanded upon <em>Dead Cells </em>with its many decadent updates. With <em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em>, they had the opportunity to build their own thing from the ground up — incorporating lessons learned from their time on the iconic indie. (Weirdly, this isn’t the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24033589/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review-ubisoft-switch">only exciting Prince of Persia game</a> released this year. Words I never thought would be written without fear of humiliation.)</p>
<p id="tU7AhQ"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2763670/Arctic_Eggs/"><em><strong>Arctic Eggs</strong></em></a><strong>:</strong> A first-person shooter but instead of a gun you have a frying pan, and instead of shooting people in the face, you make them eggs. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158540/arctic-eggs-egg-frying-game-steam-release"><em>Arctic Eggs</em></a> looks like a PS1 horror and plays like a WarioWare minigame.</p>
<div id="z4ZLOJ"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hZfzqnvBntA?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="zrTQD0"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2008920/Lorelei_and_the_Laser_Eyes/"><em><strong>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</strong></em></a><strong>: </strong>I am neither smart enough nor patient enough to appreciate this game. But <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24156442/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-review-steam-pc-nintendo-switch">people smarter and more patient than me</a> adore the puzzle adventure that requires its players to take copious notes in a physical notebook.</p>
<p id="53qVZy"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1996010/Crow_Country/"><em><strong>Crow Country</strong></em></a><strong>: </strong><em>Crow Country</em> has been compared to the original <em>Resident Evil</em>, a horror throwback to the days of low-polygon models and cheeky environmental puzzles. It is that, to be clear. It’s also a loving, playable homage to the video game magazines of the ’90s. The aesthetic is both grimy and blurry, resembling the video game screenshots of that era — a very specific look. Back then, a moment on a TV screen would be captured by a photo, then digitized into a print layout, and lastly printed, each step degrading the original image’s quality in a unique (and now nostalgic) way. The game’s creators also stuffed the world with tips-and-tricks pages, like the guides that used to be found in the back of long-dead mags like GamePro and Nintendo Power.</p>
<p id="GXfFiC"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2417850/Yolk_Heroes_A_Long_Tamago/"><em><strong>Yolk Heroes: A Long Tamago</strong></em></a><strong>:</strong> Do you miss the days of Tamagotchi? <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24161871/yolk-heroes-a-long-tamago-pet-sim-idle-game"><em>Yolk Heroes</em></a> reimagines the “virtual pet” genre through the lens of idle games — those compulsion-nurturing time sucks mostly played on smartphones. Unlike its more nefarious contemporaries, <em>Yolk Heroes</em> includes a plethora of options to modify the game so it will take as much or little time as you feel comfortable with. </p>
<div id="5VLaQj"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jSw8UGZQezs?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="HVRykN"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1373960/INDIKA/"><em><strong>Indika</strong></em></a><strong>:</strong> A nun who may or may not have the devil in her head goes on a road trip with a mysterious man who may or may not have been divinely blessed in alternate-history 18th-century Russia. Is that not enough? The game is part of a growing movement to change <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24167443/indika-video-game-movies-cinematic">what makes a game cinematic</a>.</p>
<p id="2YRqLQ"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/813230/ANIMAL_WELL/"><em><strong>Animal Well</strong></em></a><strong>: </strong>Again, I tell you that I am neither smart enough or patient enough to appreciate this game. But my colleagues (and practically every other game critic) adore this game. A potential GOTY contender, they say. A strike against my tastes, they say. I’ll never be forgiven for watching the ending on YouTube rather than solving the puzzle on my own, they say.</p>
<p id="KwMhhU"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/"><em><strong>Hades 2</strong></em></a><strong>:</strong> This feels like cheating. But this <em>is</em> a game made by a small independent studio. And <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24151266/hades-2-early-access-content-hecate-scylla-bosses">it is awesome</a>. And it was released in May. Those are the metrics for this exercise! I can’t leave it off the list just because its predecessor happened to win <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22167819/hades-game-of-the-year-2020">Polygon’s Game of the Year in 2020</a>.</p>

<p id="Nr2UkW">May 2024 should be remembered as one of the greatest months of all time for smaller games from smaller studios, and yet, it might not be. Because this, perhaps, hints at a new normal. In April, we got <em>Minishoot Adventures</em>,<em> Another Crab’s Treasure</em>,<em> Felvidek</em>,<em> Snufkin</em>,<em> Maniac</em>,<em> Harold Halibut</em>,<em> </em>and <em>Children of the Sun</em>. Before that, we got games as small as <em>Balatro </em>and large as <em>Palworld</em>. </p>
<p id="MFctd6">More people are making more games than at any point in history. And for these smaller teams, game development is getting easier and cheaper, at the exact moment it’s becoming more difficult and expensive for their AAA peers.</p>
<p id="BnmqK5">The video game industry is changing. How it will shake out will take time to see. There is, however, hope to be found in a month like May, and a year like 2024, when so many artists put so much greatness into the world. Sometimes it’s a little difficult to notice, without big PR teams and expensive ad campaigns, but we’re living in a time of plenty. </p>

The BHF estimated it could bring upwards of $11,000 for the charity, which funds medical research of heart and circulatory diseases and aims to raise public awareness of these issues.</p><p>A collaboration between Xbox, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/05/24/hulk-review">the Hulk film</a>, and Pepsi saw 50 of the consoles made to give away to winners of a competition. UK residents tasked with watching Hulk at the cinema, who purchased a Pepsi and popcorn meal deal, received a scratchcard which offered a chance of winning the bright green hardware.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/07/hulk-1717774161011.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Only 50 of these Hulk-themed Xbox consoles were made.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Only 36 people actually won a console, and only around 20 of them are known to exist today, more than two decades later, according to the BHF. The Xbox bears resemblance to a limited edition Mountain Dew console released in the U.S., but as 5,000 of those were made, the Hulk version is much more rare.</p><p>The console was confirmed to be fully working by the BHF's Paul Smith, who is thankfully an avid gamer and noticed the console was particularly unusual.</p><p>"We test all the electrical donations we receive, and this one really caught my eye," he said. "I’m a games enthusiast myself but the rare green color combined with the Hulk and Pepsi logo really stood out. Whoever is lucky enough to snap this up will make their friends green with envy.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Whoever is lucky enough to snap this up will make their friends green with envy.</p></div><p>If this incredibly rare piece of bizarre Xbox history isn't enough to entice a bid out of fans, it even comes with five games: Tony Hawk's Underground, Tony Hawk's Underground 2, Marvel vs. Capcom 2, Peter Jackson's King Kong: The Official Game of the Movie, and a French version of Bilbo the Hobbit.</p><p>Microsoft is still a fan of releasing ridiculous limited edition consoles via competitions 21 years later, as its current Xbox Series X and S consoles have received myriad wild and wacky colorways.

You'll see a <strong>waterfall </strong>with the words <strong>AFK </strong>above it. Make your way over to this waterfall and, as you approach it, a text box will appear asking you if you want to go into the AFK chamber. Select yes and you'll reach the AFK screen. Here you can see how many Emeralds and how much Gold you've earned, as well as how long you have before your next supply of rewards comes in. When you're ready to leave or get back to the game, press the <strong>Claim </strong>button to add all of your accumulated rewards to your account.</p><p>Callum Williams is a  freelance media writer with years of experience as a game critic, news reporter, guides writer and features writer.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>2K Games is expected to show the first trailer footage of the upcoming <em>Civilization VII</em> as part of this weekend's Summer Games Fest marketing extravaganza after a logo for the game leaked on 2K's website this morning.</p>
<p>Eagle-eyed gamers at <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/civilization-vii-leaked-in-2k-games-website.892344/">ResetEra</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1da8hse/civilization_vii_banner_up_early_in_2k_website/">Reddit</a> both <a href="https://imgur.com/a/ZZHyNzS">noticed the <em>Civ VII</em> banner</a> atop the publisher's official site early this morning, alongside a "Coming Soon" label and inactive links to a trailer and wishlist page. The appearance comes just ahead of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pZzia5NrMuU">the trailer-filled Summer Games Fest livestream</a>, which will premiere at 5 pm Eastern Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>In May, the Summer Games Fest Twitter account <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1da8hse/civilization_vii_banner_up_early_in_2k_website/">teased</a> that 2K would be using the event "to reveal the next iteration in one of [its] biggest and most beloved franchises." <em>Civilization VII</em> now seems primed to fill that pre-announced slot, which may be unwelcome news for fans of 2K-owned franchises like <em>Borderlands</em>, <em>Bioshock</em>, and <em>NFL2K</em> (which was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/2ks-new-nfl-video-game-will-be-a-non-simulation-whatever-that-means/">first publicly mulled for a revival in 2020</a>).</p>
<p>Last year, developer Firaxis announced that it had started development on the "next mainline game in the world-famous <em>Sid Meier’s Civilization</em> franchise," under the guidance of <em>Civilization VI</em> Creative Director Ed Beach and newly promoted studio head Heather Hazen (who previously worked with Epic Games and Popcap). "We have plans to take the Civilization franchise to exciting new heights for our millions of players around the world," Hazen <a href="https://newsroom.2k.com/news/a-new-era-begins-at-firaxis-games">said in a statement</a> at the time.</p>                                            
                                                        
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/firaxicon39.png" data-height="683" data-width="1024" alt="<em>Civilization </em>namesake Sid Meier holds forth with fans at a Firaxicon fan gathering in 2014."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/firaxicon39.png" data-height="683" data-width="1024">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> <em>Civilization </em>namesake Sid Meier holds forth with fans at a Firaxicon fan gathering in 2014.</p><p>Kyle Orland</p></figcaption></figure>
<p><em>Civilization VII</em> will be the first entry in the storied strategy franchise in at least eight years, a historically long gap for a series that has seen a new numbered entry every four to six years since its debut in 1991. When <em>Civilization VI</em> hit in 2016, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/10/civilization-vi-impressions-more-than-500-turns-can-tell/">we praised the game</a> for its smoother, more easily accessible interface and focus on fraught decision-making.
</p><p>In <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/10/sid-meier-reflects-on-25-years-of-civilization/">an interview with Ars</a> just after the launch of <em>Civ VI</em>, series namesake Sid Meier said his official role as franchise director has evolved over the years into more of a support structure for younger designers. "I'm there to kind of represent the history of the game," Meier told Ars. "My role is just to be supportive. Designers have huge egos, and they're easily bruised. Making a game can be a painful process. Part of my role is to be encouraging—'that idea didn't work, try something else.'"
</p><p>Elsewhere in early Summer Games Fest leaks and announcements, we can expect more info about <a href="https://www.meta.com/quest/batman-arkham-shadow/">Meta Quest VR-exclusive <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em></a>, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-horizon-adventures/">Lego-fied version of Sony's <em>Horizon</em> series</a>, and new footage for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/">cinematic survival game <em>Dune Awakening</em></a>, among many other planned announcements.</p>

Here's where you can find Xur this week and what he has for sale.</p><p>This week you can find Xur in <strong>The Tower</strong>, inside the <strong>Hangar</strong>. For his weapons, Xur is offering the <strong>Sunshot</strong> and <strong>Jotunn</strong> catalysts. Hunters can pick up <strong>Raiju's Harness</strong>; Titans can grab <strong>Lion Rampant</strong>; and Warlocks can buy <strong>Verity's Brow</strong>.</p><h2>Xur Location</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4314878-destiny22024-06-0719-15-48.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314878" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4314878-destiny22024-06-0719-15-48.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314878"></a><figcaption>Xur's location--as indicated by the XI mark--in the Tower.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4314878-destiny22024-06-0719-15-48.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4314879-destiny22024-06-0719-17-15.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4314880-destiny22024-06-0719-17-23.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314879,1300-4314880" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4314879-destiny22024-06-0719-17-15.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4314880-destiny22024-06-0719-17-23.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4314879-destiny22024-06-0719-17-15.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4314880-destiny22024-06-0719-17-23.jpg"></figure><p>Instead of being in the hangar, Xur is now in the Bazaar area of the Tower. When you spawn in, go right, down the stairs, and into the main marketplace. Xur can be found in the corner, where Eva Levante used to set up shop during seasonal events like the Dawning.</p><h2>Xur Exotic and Legendary Items</h2><p>One of the big changes with Xur this year is that he only accepts Strange Coins, now that Legendary Shards have been sunset. This is a full circle moment, as back in the original Destiny, Exotics could also only be purchased from Xur with Strange Coins. Another big change is that Xur now has a vendor reputation rank, and some of his rewards include Exotic engrams, Enhancement Cores, and an Exotic Cipher.</p><p>The biggest change here?

Stare into an abyss for long enough and, as Nietzsche wrote, a mostly naked man will wobble out of the abyss and try to murder you with a mattock. Inasmuch as can be told in the absence of dialogue or a text preamble, the naked man wants to murder you because you, and not he, are in possession of a hat. The hat makes you look like an eraser pencil from Forbidden Planet. It's the kind of headgear worn by the kind of criminal Batman's too grown-up to fight anymore. But it has, nonetheless, roused in this under-dressed stranger a sense of Dionysian frenzy. He will do anything for that hat - hewing your arms off, ripping your intestines out, tearing the skin from your ribcage. And you, in turn, will do anything to rob him of that mattock, because by the gods, it looks a lot more dangerous than the candlestick you're trying to fend him off with.
</p>
<p>
There are many such lost souls in the bleak, midnight world of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2397300/Half_Sword/">the Half Sword demo</a> - all lurking near candle-lit piles of randomly spawned hammers, stools, barrels, axes and lengths of wood, all subject to unforgivably authentic physics and cursor-based attacks that conspire to transform every scuffle into a Monty Python blooper reel.

You begin the demo slumped over in a flat void that stretches away forever. You wander to the nearest weaponisable object - if you're lucky, a nice, solid pitchfork - then wander a bit further in search of people to stick that object into. Or at least, flail it at. In Half Sword, weapons are swung by jolting the cursor around or yanking the analog sticks. As such, it's rare even with practice that you land what feels like a clean blow. Instead, you sort of stroke and tickle each other with your implements of bloodshed until one of the participants ragdolls, screeching and blasting blood everywhere. People certainly do <em>yell</em> in Half Sword, though it's partly, again, that the controls and handling don't lend themselves to swift and merciful KOs. Knock somebody over and you're obliged to stand over them sort of massaging your weapon into them until they stop bellowing and cop it out of sheer irritation. 
</p>
<p>
It's possible, as you'd expect, that all this reflects my own ineptness, though the blundering and absurd inhumanity of it all is a fair representation of the IRL fights I have been involved in. Regardless, it's very funny. "Proper" physics-based melee combat systems have been a thing in games for years, but they never fail to make me cackle. There are some Gang Beasts-worthy moments in Half Sword, albeit with a lot more gore. At one point I managed to knock a guy down while dropping my axe, which clattered to a halt a few metres away. Rather than give the downed opponent time to get up while I fetched it, I seized his ankle and dragged him kicking and screaming towards the axe. Then I stepped on the axe and hurt myself, and he stood up and beat my head in with a footstool. Touché, good sir knight. I'll see you at the next Roundtable.
</p>
<p>
The full version of Half Sword promises to be "an immersive, physically simulated medieval combat game that offers players a unique experience of becoming a commoner-turned-knight, fighting brutal tournaments in 15th-century Europe". It'll feature a "meticulously crafted collection of historically accurate arms and armor", NPCs with quests, and many flourishes based on "the expertise and feedback of Historical European Martial Arts (HEMA) practitioners and sword fencers". Sounds decent, but I'd also love to play an expanded version of the demo that abstracts the rags-to-riches theme into a bunch of random, ignoble fights in the dark for possession of some truly awful hats.

The prolific studio behind works like <em>FLCL</em>, <em>Gurren Lagann</em>, and the legendary <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion </em>has been struggling financially for several years. On June 7, the company announced it’s filing for bankruptcy and closing down.<br></p><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>Despite the prestige associated with the studio, Gainax has been dealing with financial woes throughout its nearly 40-year history. As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/neon-genesis-evangelion-anime-studio-gainax-goes-bankrupt&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/neon-genesis-evangelion-anime-studio-gainax-goes-bankrupt" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em></a></span> lays out, the studio had been marred by production issues, tax fraud in the ‘90s, and multiple lawsuits —including some involving Studio Khara, which was founded by Gainax founder and <em>Evangelion</em> director Hideaki Anno. All of these issues snowballed over the decades until finally a debt collection company filed a lawsuit against Gainax this May, leading to a bankruptcy filing on May 29. A statement on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gainax.co.jp/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gainax.co.jp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the company’s official website</a></span> explains that the company had racked up a lot of debt, especially in the years since 2012. The studio lays the blame at the feet of company management, who operated the company as if it were their private property, according to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://automaton-media.com/en/news/gainax-the-studio-behind-the-evangelion-series-goes-bankrupt-amidst-unmanageable-debt/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/gainax-the-studio-behind-the-evangelion-series-goes-bankrupt-amidst-unmanageable-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Automaton</em>’s</a></span> translation.</p><p>The studio is closing, but the Gainax trademark has been transferred to Studio Khara.

Studio Khara will work to transfer IP rights to companies and creatives. The statement signs off expressing regret that Gainax’s work has ended on this note.</p><p>It is a shame that Gainax came crashing down like this, and even as someone who has watched all of <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em> and its movies, I didn’t realize just how fraught the studio’s situation had been over the years until I saw the bankruptcy news. Just another reminder that even companies that create some of the most beloved works in their medium can be a trainwreck internally. What a disaster.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">While it's nice to see an overt reference to Bloodborne, the fact that it comes alongside a skin for a "legacy" character that hasn't starred in a new game since 2002 doesn't exactly instill confidence. Still, it's a reminder that Sony is well-aware of the large contingent of Yharnamite fans out there, even if the company is content to leave those fans disappointed for now.</p><p dir="ltr">Rumors of a Bloodborne remake from Bluepoint (which co-developed the PS5 Demon's Souls remake) have swirled for years, but they've never been officially confirmed or denied. Earlier this year, game director Hidetaka Miyazaki told Eurogamer that any such remake or sequel would be up to Sony, and said that it's possible that Sony may wait until <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/theoretical-bloodborne-remake-could-receive-value-from-new-hardware-miyazaki-says/1100-6521268/">it releases new hardware</a> to remake the game.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/top-5-teams-to-pick-in-ea-fc-24-euro-2024-mode.892710/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/top-5-teams-ea-fc-24-euro-2024-mode/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=top-5-teams-ea-fc-24-euro-2024-mode<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="151" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Euro 2024 mode is a must-play for all <em>EA FC 24</em> players, and EA Sports has ensured that it can attract the interest of beginners and veterans alike.</p> <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="343" data-injectable="false">Like the World Cup 2022 mode in <em>FIFA 23</em>, the Euro content is exclusive and unlikely to appear in the next four games. The entire UEFA Euro mode is fully licensed, translating into authentic squads, historic moments, and many other things. Ultimately, the objective is to rewrite your history, and here are five teams that can help you do that.</p> <h2 id="h-5-best-teams-in-ea-fc-24-euro-2024-mode" data-injectable="false">5 best teams in EA FC 24 Euro 2024 mode</h2> <h2 id="h-france" data-injectable="false">France</h2> <figure data-current-count="643" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="598" data-current-count="598" data-injectable="true">The French national side has a wealth of talents all over the pitch. Kylian Mbappe alone is a handful for any defense in <em>EA FC 24</em>. He’s arguably the most meta attacker you can control in any game mode, including the Euro 2024 mode. He’s well supported by the likes of Griezmann, Coman, and company, all of whom are viable attackers in their own rights. The defense has stars like Upamecano, Kounde, and Theo Hernandez, while the midfield is well marshaled by the Real Madrid duo Camavinga and Tchouameni. Youngsters like Zaire-Emery and Bradley Barcola add an X-factor on top of it all.</p>
 <h2 id="h-netherlands" data-injectable="false">Netherlands</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="507" data-current-count="807" data-injectable="true">Whether the Netherlands is among the top five teams in the real-life tournament can be up for debate. However, the team is exceptionally strong in terms of the <em>EA FC 24</em> Euro 2024 mode. The defense has Virgil Van Dijk, the best defender in the game. Matthijs De Ligt and Nathan Ake have also proven themselves at club level. The midfield has the star power of Frenkie De Jong, and the duo of Koopmeiners and Simmons have had fantastic seasons. In attack, you get the services of Cody Gakpo and Memphis Depay.</p>
 <h2 id="h-portugal" data-injectable="false">Portugal</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="574" data-current-count="874" data-injectable="true">Portugal is full of players who perform well in the game’s meta. They’re led by <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-do-siuu-in-ea-fc-24/">Cristiano Ronaldo</a>, who, despite all the nerfs, continues to be a dominant performer in front of the goal. The duo of Joao Felix and Rafael Leao are efficient dribblers. The midfield offers you the duo of Bernardo Silva and Bruno Fernandes. They have their limitations, but you can’t find better football passers. The defense might appear weak initially, but Joao Cancelo, Nuno Mendes, and Ruben Dias are there. Portugal is a solid squad to pick in the <em>EA FC 24</em> Euro 2024 mode.</p>
 <h2 id="h-italy" data-injectable="false">Italy</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via EA</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="500" data-current-count="800" data-injectable="true">This new generation of Italians has a lot of strong performers in its ranks. Donnarumma is one of the best keepers in the game if not the best, and the defense has players like Di Lorenzo and Bastoni. Nicolo Barella can control the midfield well, while Chiesa is an excellent wide attacker. The squad also includes utility options like Lorenzo Pellegrini, Gianluca Mancini, and Giacomo Raspadori. This team might not have big stars, but there’s a solid defensive foundation and overall balance.</p>
 <h2 id="h-england" data-injectable="false">England</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="581" data-current-count="881" data-injectable="false">Both Spain and Germany are hard to turn down, but the latter lacks a solid striker, while the former could fit better in the game’s meta. This English side, present in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-perform-the-griddy-ea-fc-24/">EA FC 24</a></em> Euro 2024 tournament mode, has some unique talents. Who better than Jude Bellingham to boss your midfield? Bukayo Saka and Phil Foden offer a lot of creativity, while Declan Rice is a great defensive screen. Harry Kane might not be quick, but he has precise finishing skills. The defense has great wing backs and defensively robust center-backs, making England an excellent choice in the Euro mode.</p>

<p data-characters="133" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the impending release of Euro 2024 tournament mode in <em>FC Mobile</em>, EA Sports has ensured that mobile games will be well-supported.</p> <p data-characters="372" data-current-count="372" data-injectable="false"><em>EA FC 24</em> players can already dive into an exclusive tournament mode packed with plenty of content on their PC, Nintendo Switch, and consoles. Mobile players will need to wait as of writing, but that won’t be for long. In an official blog post, EA Sports has announced that Euro 2024 tournament mode will also be released for mobile devices, albeit with some changes.</p> <h2 id="h-fc-mobile-euro-2024-tournament-mode-release-date" data-injectable="false">FC Mobile Euro 2024 tournament mode release date</h2> <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true">First comes the release date, as the community will be anxious to try this new mode. In many ways, the upcoming tournament will resemble the FIFA World Cup mode, released in 2022. The Euro 2024 tournament is coming to mobile devices on June 11, 2024.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-how-to-play-fc-mobile-euro-2024-tournament-mode" data-injectable="false">How to play FC Mobile Euro 2024 tournament mode</h2> <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="627" data-injectable="true">The upcoming mode will feature all 24 qualified nations with authentic kits (Switzerland and Austria being the exceptions) and squads. Matches can be played at six different difficulties (you’ll have to select at first). You will also be able to edit the selected lineup, and change tactics as required to get more wins. </p>
 <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="269" data-injectable="false">The group stages are based on real-life fixtures, but knockouts depend on your in-game progression. Once you win the tournament, you can share it with the rest of the world on social media. EA Sports will also introduce two new stadiums inspired by real-life locations:</p> <ul data-found-items="2" data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false"> <li>Olympiastadion Berlin</li> <li>BVB Stadion Dortmund</li> </ul> <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="707" data-injectable="false">You’ll also earn different rewards after completing the tournament, but EA Sports has yet to share all the details. More information is expected to arrive in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-ultimate-tots-upgrade-sbc-solutions/">Ultimate Team</a> once the release date comes closer. With so many additional promo items coming soon, playing the <em>FC Mobile</em> Euro 2024 tournament mode should be on the priority list for many players</p>

<p data-characters="284" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">We’re moving towards the fifth expansion of <em>Final Fantasy XIV,</em> and players are chomping at the bit for more information about the <em>Dawntrail</em> debut. The MMO’s expansion and patch schedule maintains a rather predictable beat, but we’ve seen a few curveballs along the way. </p> <p data-characters="218" data-current-count="218" data-injectable="false">With that in mind, here’s a timeline of previous <em>FFXIV </em>expansions in order by release date, along with the official release date for Version 7.0, <em>Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail </em>on July 2, and its early access details. </p> <h2 id="h-a-realm-reborn" data-injectable="false">A Realm Reborn</h2> <figure data-current-count="518" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="268" data-injectable="false">When the original <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> 1.0 launched on September 30, 2010, it was immediately dubbed a failure. At least, that was until Yoshi P and his team stepped up to drag the game back from the dead, making it the incredibly successful MMO that we know today.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="116" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false"><strong><em>A Realm Reborn</em> was released on August 27, 2013, for PlayStation<strong> 3 and Windows</strong></strong>, replacing the previous version.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-heavensward" data-injectable="false">Heavensward</h2> <figure data-current-count="684" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="198" data-injectable="false"><em>Heavensward</em>, the first expansion of <em>Final Fantasy XIV,</em> was announced in October 2014 and was set to release in the Spring of 2015, though it saw a small delay.

Here’s the full timeline for the<em> Shadowbringers</em>:</p>

It was teased in a post on the Lodestone and officially announced during a showcase on February 5, 2021. Here’s the full rundown of dates for <em>Endwalker</em>:</p>
 <figure data-found-rows="5" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong><strong>Release Date Revealed: </strong></strong></td><td>May, 2021</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Was it delayed?</strong></td><td>Yes, by two weeks from November 23, 2021</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Pre-order began</strong></td><td>May 14, 2021</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Early Access Weekend began</strong></td><td>December 3, 2021&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Official launch date</strong></td><td>December 7, 2021</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <h2 id="h-dawntrail" data-injectable="false">Dawntrail</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true"><strong>Update:</strong> On March 23, Square Enix officially revealed that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/final-fantasy-dawntrail-lauches-july-reveals/"><em>FFXIV</em> will release its fifth expansion</a> of summer 2024, on July 2. As usual, <em>Dawntrail </em>will see an early access period beginning on June 28, but you’ll need to pre-order the expansion to register. As for what to expect, you can check out our preview from the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-dawntrail-media-tour-previews-new-zones-jobs-and-dungeon/">2024<em> Dawntrail </em>preview now</a> — including a peak at zones, Job changes, and more. </p>
 <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">The announcement for <em>FFXIV’s</em> next adventure was made at PAX East, breaking the game’s typical cycle of Fan Fest-related announcements. It’s no surprise after the <em>Shadowbringers</em> COVID delays, and the domino effect that had into future development with <em>Endwalker</em>. </p> <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="615" data-injectable="true"><strong>Original Guide:</strong> From everything above and the speculative release date of Summer 2024, we can hazard a guess that <em>Dawntrail</em> could possibly be released during June 2024, but that is not confirmed as of yet.&nbsp;Plus, Yoshi-P already stressed during the Las Vegas Fanfest that it’s just a window, and summer goes on until August. </p>
 <p data-characters="435" data-current-count="435" data-injectable="true">Unfortunately, all of the <em>Dawntrail </em>community events have wrapped up with no release date for the next <em>FFXIV</em> expansion. According to Yoshi-P, the summer timing is still <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-tokyo-fan-fest-reveals-include-pictomancer-6-55-date-and-dawntrail-timing/">part of the plan</a>, but they aren’t ready to nail down the exact date just yet. Part of that decision comes after the two-week Endwalker delay, which the team is still clearly frustrated by. On the subject, during his Tokyo Fan Fest presentation, Yoshida noted: </p>
 <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="268" data-injectable="false">“We will not be releasing on Square Enix time; we will be releasing on [Final Fantasy] XIV time, which means properly in summer. So we will work very hard to get you that info as soon as possible and will have it for you next time, so thank you for your patience.”</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-player-count-gta-5-sales</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablos-100m-players-cant-get-close-to-minecraft-or-gta-vs-sales.892680/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-player-count-gta-5-sales<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blizzard has revealed a new and rather impressive player count milestone for the&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>franchise as a whole, but it still pales in comparison to the sales figures for a single&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto&nbsp;</em>game.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Diablo/status/1798837275813691506" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>X (formerly Twitter) account, Blizzard reveals that the&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>franchise has hit more than 100 million players, with that figure counting across all four mainline&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>installments and mobile entry&nbsp;<em>Diablo Immortal</em>.</p>
<p>By contrast, however,&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 5&nbsp;</em>alone has sold <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-5-surpasses-200-million-units-sold" rel="noopener" target="_blank">over 200 million copies</a> at last count, which is double the entire&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>franchise's players. Even that number pales in comparison to the mighty&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>, which is sitting at a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-67105983" rel="noopener" target="_blank">jaw-dropping 300 million sales</a> at time of writing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/diablo-series-player-count-gta-5-combat.jpg?itok=qt1kmDmm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/diablo-series-player-count-gta-5-combat.jpg?itok=wnVBTjUP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The whole&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>series can't hold a candle to&nbsp;<em>GTA 5&nbsp;</em>alone in terms of sales.</figcaption></figure><p>Things get even more dire for&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>when you realize that the 100 million figure isn't sales, but player counts.</p>
<p>That's fine for games like the first three&nbsp;<em>Diablo</em>&nbsp;entries, but&nbsp;<em>Diablo Immortal&nbsp;</em>is a free-to-play mobile game, which presumably means that the many players who tried it for five minutes and then gave up to go do something else are included in that 100 million count.</p>
<p>Additionally, it's worth noting that&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>is available on Xbox Game Pass; in fact, it was the first Activision Blizzard game to be added to the service following Microsoft's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-activision-blizzard-merger-finalized">record-breaking acquisition</a> of the publisher.</p>
<p>Again, that means that presumably, anyone who gave&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>a try on Game Pass is also included in the 100 million figure. As a reminder, the&nbsp;<em>GTA&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>figures are cold, hard sales, not player counts, and the&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>figure is for an entire series.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/diablo-player-count-gta-5-michael.jpg?itok=9FlH5qoi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/diablo-player-count-gta-5-michael.jpg?itok=-tHryDwC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>"Hello, Take-Two? Yeah, I'd like to buy another gold-plated yacht, please."</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting here that the&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>series is still phenomenally successful. Within its first year of release,&nbsp;<em>Diablo Immortal&nbsp;</em>reportedly made Blizzard <a href="https://www.data.ai/en/insights/market-data/diablo-immortal-500-million/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">half a billion dollars</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>is apparently Blizzard's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-iv-is-blizzards-fastest-selling-game-ever-likely-surprising-no-one">fastest-selling game ever</a>.</p>
<p>This comparison simply proves the absolutely colossal presence that&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>GTA 5&nbsp;</em>still have in the gaming industry. When a series as popular and influential as&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>can't even hold a candle to the sales of a single game in a franchise, you know that franchise has taken over the world.</p>
<p>Rockstar is currently working on&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-released-early-following-leak-coming-in-2025">set for release next year</a>. The debut trailer for that game achieved <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-achieved-crazy-90-million-views-in-24-hours">a whopping 90 million views in just 24 hours</a>, so it looks like&nbsp;<em>GTA</em>'s dominance of the gaming world is set to continue. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>Slitterhead will release on 8th November 2024 for PC via Steam and Epic Games Store, PlayStation 4, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, according to a leaked gameplay trailer.</p>
<p>The two-minute teaser - which has since been pulled (but not before someone managed to download and re-share it, of course; you don't have to look very hard to it) - shows a mysterious, supernatural parasite jumping from host to host across a neon-soaked city.</p>
<p>It's likely the trailer leaked ahead of a formal reveal of Bokeh Game Studio's inaugural offering at this evening's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2024-conference-schedule">Summer Game Fest 2024</a> presentation.</p>

<p>Interestingly, we get our first peek at the horror's combat, too. While it looks like not all characters can fight back, those that can take on the enemies in a way not too dissimilar from that of Stellar Blade. Expect a range of weapons, including some supernatural touches, such as the ability to grow Krueger-esque claws from your own hands. Nice.</p>
<p>As you may well expect from famed composer Akira Yamaoka, the soundtrack is pretty impressive, and the transitions from everyday citizen to murderous hellbeast are suitably grim given Keiichiro Toyama's glorious - or should that be gory-ious? - pedigree, which includes creating celebrated horror franchises like Siren and Silent Hill.</p>

<p>It's been some time since we've seen anything from Slitterhead. Our last official look was this time last year, when a developer diary posted revealed new details about its inaugural title, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slitterheads-unique-mechanics-include-a-playable-dog">including a sneaky peek at some of the game's enemies, abilities</a>, and - surprise! - the ability to play as a dog... something reprised in today's surprise footage, too.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Access-Ability Summer Showcase featured the latest in accessible games]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/24172897/access-ability-showcase-best-games-trailers-2024</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-access-ability-summer-showcase-featured-the-latest-in-accessible-games.892674/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24172897/access-ability-showcase-best-games-trailers-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Running concurrently with Summer Game Fest, the <a href="https://access-ability.uk/">Access-Ability Summer Showcase</a> redresses what gaming events leave out. Organized by accessibility consultant and critic Laura Kate Dale, it’s a reaction to events designed to build hype and how disabled gamers too often have to temper excitement with caution over whether revealed games will be accessible. A frustration, Dale told <em>The Verge</em>, driven by “the industry’s unwillingness to be open and transparent about gaming accessibility.”&nbsp;</p><p>Now in its second year, the showcase continues to push back against a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/8/23754562/summer-game-fest-women-diversity-geoff-keighley">lack of inclusive gaming events</a> as it grows — it includes <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fcurator%2F45010171%2Fsale%2FAccess-AbilitySummerShowcase2024">a dedicated Steam page</a> this year. Already, developers are not only viewing it as an opportunity to show off their games, Dale said, but also as encouragement to implement accessibility earlier in development to be ready for the event. “The idea that a place to proudly promote their accessibility would help push developers to have more features ready at earlier milestones makes me feel like the show is having a tangible impact,” Dale added.</p><p>The showcase aired on Twitch and YouTube (with the latter including ASL, BSL, and audio description) on June 7th, which is available to watch <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DxU5mgSRVmH8">right here</a> if you missed it live. A rundown of everything we saw can be found below.</p><p><h4>Roguelikes continue to embrace accessibility</h4></p><p>The showcase began with a look at <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1515570%2FElsie%2F"><em>Elsie</em></a>, a “retro-inspired, bullet hell, action-platforming roguelike shooter” from Knight Shift Games. Despite its many categories, it will release in a crowded genre, where <em>Elsie </em>carries on the good work of <em>Dead Cells </em>in creating a roguelike that’s approachable for as many players as possible. <em>Elsie </em>includes a range of features to help parse fast-paced combat, like the ability to customize how the player character is highlighted, as well as ways to make combat more user-friendly.</p><p><h4>Increased accessibility for blind and visually impaired gamers </h4></p><p>At least half of the games highlighted at the showcase also demonstrated significant considerations for blind and visually impaired players.</p><p>The most unique of these was <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2121790%2FPeriphery_Synthetic%2F"><em>Periphery Synthetic</em></a>, a nonviolent, first-person Metroidvania from shiftBacktick that’s designed to be played entirely through audio cues. A startlingly robust soundscape supports this, and though it can be played completely unsighted, it includes curiously beguiling voxel visuals and is one of the most interesting blind-friendly games I’ve encountered. <em>Periphery Synthetic </em>is one to watch leading up to its release this summer.&nbsp;</p><p>Text-to-speech and narration are two features vital to blind and visually impaired accessibility, and two citybuilders were among the most prominent to include them at this year’s showcase. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2308630%2FDawnfolk%2F"><em>Dawnfolk</em></a>, from Darenn Keller, is envisioned as an entry point to the genre and driven by simplicity in both gameplay and visuals. <a href="https://cfdj.itch.io/cellular-city"><em>Cellular City</em></a>, introduced by Callum Deery, is a similarly interesting take on the genre that challenges the player to think about the relationship between certain structures and which can and cannot coexist. Both feature robust text-to-speech and narration systems.</p><p><h4>Accessibility that extends to narrative games</h4></p><p>As part of a wider showcase of Fiction Factory Games’ accessibility considerations, we had a brief look at <em>The Shadow over Cyberspace</em>, in which the Cthulhu mythos meets Y2K. As a text-driven game, it’s made playable by blind and visually impaired players through audio description, closed captions, and text-to-speech, while visual considerations make complex, moving imagery customizable for players who need it.</p><p>A love letter to the old internet, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2079180%2FVIDEOVERSE%2F"><em>Videoverse</em></a> builds on similar ideas with its varied soundscape but also includes clear, high-contrast, and readable interfaces, which, as Alex Leone’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2253300%2FUpheaval%2F"><em>Upheaval</em></a> demonstrated, is vital to text-based gameplay. <em>Upheaval</em> is a “text-based open-world” adventure and, along with <em>Videoverse</em>, eschews the current trend of absurdly small UI text with clear, customizable interfaces and large text. Something that stuck out in <em>Upheaval</em>’s showcase was its inclusion of text-to-speech functions <em>and </em>the ability to integrate existing, and preferred, external text-to-speech software.</p><p><h4>It’s not all 2D</h4></p><p>Whitethorn Games is a publisher that has established itself as an industry leader in accessibility. Its upcoming <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1511880%2FSlime_Heroes%2F"><em>Slime Heroes</em></a>, developed by Pancake Games, is another soulslike embracing making this genre more user-friendly. More akin to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24139208/another-crabs-treasure-review-xbox-switch-ps5"><em>Another Crab’s Treasure</em></a><em> </em>than <em>Dark Souls</em>, <em>Slime Heroes </em>offers welcome mitigations for movement — including a toggleable double-jump — and its soulslike combat. This is great for players who struggle with reaction times (like me) and mobility. But one of the most interesting features on display was the ability to toggle on visual representations of hitboxes, making it easier to avoid those soulslike whiffs.</p><p>Two other 3D third-person adventures followed. Siro Games’ <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1682290%2FWko_The_Mask_Gatherer%2F"><em>Wéko the Mask Gatherer</em></a><em> </em>bears a resemblance to <em>The Legend of Zelda, </em>and its major features appear to revolve around navigation, both in-world and in its menus. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1106830%2FRainbow_Billy_The_Curse_of_the_Leviathan%2F"><em>Rainbow Billy: The Curse of the Leviathan</em></a><em> </em>is an action-platformer about recoloring the world, which makes its focus on visual accessibility apt. It particularly focuses on colorblind accessibility, using multiple visual cues to clarify interactable elements, including colors, icons, and animation. It also deploys navigational features, including automatically focusing on objectives when returning to Billy’s ship, a major boon for those with cognitive disabilities.&nbsp;</p><p><h4>Mobility in focus</h4></p><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2231190%2FMagical_Delicacy%2F"><em>Magical Delicacy</em></a><em> </em>is another Whitethorn joint: a 2D adventure that feels like a mix of <em>Treasures of the Aegean </em>and <em>Howl’s Moving Castle</em>. For players with reduced mobility or who need to use one hand, <em>Magical Delicacy </em>can be played with no buttons at all. That’s a focus for detective narrative game <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1534720%2FSpace_Boat%2F"><em>Space Boat</em></a>, too, which has been designed from the ground up to be entirely playable with one hand.</p><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2058730%2FThe_Darkest_Files%2F"><em>The</em> <em>Darkest Files</em></a>, from Paintbucket Games, is another investigative game, this time based on true crime. Its first-person narrative loop can be controlled with a mouse alone — though it also allows for switching between input devices on the fly, which is great for adaptive controller users — and includes surprisingly discreet difficulty customizations outside of the usual presets to aid its detective gameplay.</p><p><h4>Taking your time is the most welcome trend of the year</h4></p><p>The most appreciated theme of the showcase was just how many games removed time constraints and fail states to better accommodate players’ ability to move at their own pace. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2407830%2FTrash_Goblin%2F"><em>Trash Goblin</em></a> is a medieval <em>American Pickers</em>. You take trash, chip away the dirt, and upsell it as treasure. It’s another game with no fail states or time limits, and this works in concert with ways to mitigate the game’s repeated inputs — a bane for players with chronic pain — to the point you can even make them automated.</p><p>One of the standouts of the entire showcase for me was <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1638070%2FFishbowl%2F"><em>Fishbowl</em></a>. Rhea Gupte walked us through this cozy slice-of-life sim from a two-person development team from India. While its non-stressful puzzles and chill story are emblematic of the value of designing an experience that’s accessible at its core, Gupte also highlighted <em>Fishbowl</em>’s accessibility options. There wasn’t a wide range on show, but it was heartening to see a host of features planned for the immediate future and the duo’s dedication to adding more. With how often well-resourced studios erroneously claim adding accessibility is impossible, it’s great to see a studio doing everything it can to make its game approachable.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-omnidirectional-movement/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-6-to-feature-%E2%80%98omnidirectional%E2%80%99-sliding-diving-and-sprinting.892668/</guid>

<p>Movement maniacs, fall in – Black Ops 6 is raising the bar regarding fast-paced mechanics that get you around the map in a rapid fashion. It was just reported by a leaker and corroborated by Insider Gaming that Black Ops 6 will feature a slew of fluid movement mechanics, including sliding, diving, and sprinting, all of which have been dubbed ‘Omnidirectional Movement’.</p>



<p>Could this be the most versatile and agile Call of Duty title in years?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-don-t-slow-down">Don’t Slow Down</h2>



<p>In a post on Twitter by BobNetworkUK, a reliable Call of Duty Leaker, it was explained that Black Ops 6 will allow players to dive, slide, and sprint in all directions. It was noted as being similar to Max Payne, in which players can press buttons to dive forward, backwards, or sideways, all while shooting their weapons. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>EXCLUSIVE:<br>Black Ops 6 will reportedly allow players to dive in all directions, similar to Max Payne. The game will also allow players to sprint in all directions. This combined functionality has been referred to several times as "Omnidirectional Movement."</p><p>Sliding returns too. <a href="https://t.co/JZ6s46rkyJ">pic.twitter.com/JZ6s46rkyJ</a></p></div>— bob. (@BobNetworkUK) <a href="https://twitter.com/BobNetworkUK/status/1799099632645206091?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 7, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>







<p>Traditionally, slide cancelling and diving in Call of Duty are ‘forward motion mechanics’ that allow players to dive into or behind cover at the press of a button. You can get pretty creative with these mechanics, but they’ve remained relatively unchanged for years. This latest claim suggests that Black Ops 6 will have more fluid movement mechanics than ever before in series history, allowing movement kings to truly take advantage of the versatility on offer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-unrealized-potential-of-cooking-in-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">Cooking is probably one of the last leisure activities that we can do for its own sake; firstly, cooking is something that most of us kind of need to do in order to, you know, eat, so it is kind of a necessity. But it can also be a creative exercise, and one that, exceeding the eventual domestic disaster, will always give a satisfying result; a result that will improve your skills and knowledge for the next round.</span></p><p><span data-testid="content-text">Once you know the basics, cooking can be a sandbox of experimentation, as you learn new methods, ingredients, spices, and so, it is not unlike a game. Maybe that’s why so many games use cooking systems in the first place, either as subsystems that give texture and flavor (heh) to a digital world, or transforming the act of cooking into a dextrous challenge of skill.</span></p></div><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">Cooking in videogames usually come in two forms; one is simply by combining the ingredients the player acquired while exploring the game world, which can then grant specific bonuses for the actual gameplay portions, like in Breath of the Wild and the Monster Hunter series; or can later be used for other gameplay purposes, like giving gifts based on specific characters tastes. like in Stardew Valley and its wholesome brethren of similars.</span></p><p><span data-testid="content-text">The other form is more involved, and is featured in games in which cooking is the main course (heh), and it is abstracted into a series of micro-interactions of timing and skill. The best example of this is the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooking_Mama">Cooking Mama</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> series, in which the preparations of each dish consists of a series of simple control motions, with some generous grading at the end.</span></p></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Often this involves the micro-management of several tasks at once, like in friendship-tester Overcooked or the OG casual king Dinner Dash; there is a almost neurotic zen to be found in keeping as the lots of plates spinning at once, hence is why the DD formula still spawns very successful clones in the mobile market to this day.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Other games are more involved in gamifying nitty-gritty of food preparation; the wonderful series </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/32041/The_Cook_Serve_Series_Bundle/">Cook, Serve, Delicious</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> combines strict time management with a large variety of micro-interactions to learn, and can be quite a challenge in the higher levels play; meanwhile </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/452570/Battle_Chef_Brigade_Deluxe/">Battle Chef Brigade</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> combines different genres into a stew (heh), like action platformer and match-3 puzzler, in order to abstract its core experience of anime Iron Chef, tough its individual mechanics falter due an excess of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbMQ7XrHp4s">complexity and jank</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">(I should also mention </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/641320/Cooking_Simulator/">Cooking Simulator</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> hyper-detailed facsimile of a professional cook experience, though like most of those PlayWay published sims, the game mechanics feel less abstract and “gamey” to be interesting to a design discussion; it's still pretty fun though, and can be even educational for people who don’t know their pots from pans)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a sucker for a videogame cooking system, I think I get the appeal of both approaches; while just combining ingredient to assemble a predetermined recipe can be tedious, I once did </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://starbounder.org/Food">every single available recipe</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in 2D sci-fi minecrafter Starbound, mainly because the gathering of ingredients complemented so well the game loop of exploration, even though that game had no end goal for that system beside the requisite stat buffs and rather easy achievement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In fact, a lot of cooking games tend to be repetitive; the Cooking Mama series lack of challenge and more concrete goals than cooking for its own sake feels like a waste of some rather intricate systems, which eventually doomed the series and tragically led to Mama getting in some </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/cooking-mama-cookstar-cryptocurrency-mining-blockchain-bitcoin-nintendo-cryptomining-explained-2020-4">shady bitcoin business</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. And as much as I love Cook Serve Delicious, doing the same micro-tasks over and over again is more like a light simulation of a taxing service job than lovingly elaborating a home meal.

Cooking is Venba feels more like a puzzle than a challenge, with little of the time pressure similar games have, but the act of following or diverging from a recipe highlight the cultural aspect of food in a way pretty much no other game does.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile classic PS1 RPG Suikoden 2 had a notorious </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KmVtU--qr8">cooking contest sidequest</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, one that made use of its large cast as judges; each with different, unique tastes that had to be accounted for when choosing the recipe. The gameplay consists of just selecting a recipe and mashing Circle, but this sidequest </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/ps/198844-suikoden-ii/faqs/6289">arcane ruleset</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and surprisingly emotional twist and turns made it a fan favorite.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GiabcFlVPV4">Order Up!</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a game for the Wii which made perhaps one of my favorite spins on the genre. It combines simple Mama-esque motions with the Wii Remote&nbsp; with DD-style time management; but the fun part is that you eventually get clients that have special tastes, like overdone, raw or spicy food. Cooking in that way only adds a bonus, so it's not obligatory,and integrates with the cooking mechanics in an interesting manner; for instance, an overdone dish needs to be removed just on the cusp of burning, which adds interesting wrinkles to the gameplay.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This last example highlights what I feel most cooking games lack; the creative element of preparing food. It’s rare that cooking games allow for the improvisation that is so satisfying when preparing food in real life, like swapping ingredients, improving the taste of a dish by choosing the right spices, or trying unusual ingredient combinations, like a pinch of salt in a dessert. In most of the examples we went through, the path to the final dish is usually a straight line with a binary win state; you either prepare or fail your dish, with no nuance in between.</span></p><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">Several games could be spiced up (heh) by having different sorts of goals, and allowing for player creativity in the same satisfying way as choosing the right build in an action game or RPG can be; what would be a dish that could satisfy the palates of a vegan and a meat-lover? Can you combine elements of dishes of different cultures without losing their essences? Where is the game that simulates the experience of making an accidental masterpiece with leftovers and gumption at 4AM?</span></p><p><span data-testid="content-text">Cooking is such an universal activity that it is no wonder why it is featured into so many games, and there is no shortage of interest in that intersection, considering the amounts of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLopY4n17t8RAQsF0jWSTVQI0sGPicQSQg">recipe videos</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and even </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://pixelatedprovisions.com/the-ultimate-final-fantasy-xiv-official-cookbook/">the</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://stardewvalleycookbook.com/">many</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://bungiestore.com/destiny-the-official-cookbook">cookbooks</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> dedicated to video game food; but&nbsp; it still feels like unexplored territory in many ways.&nbsp; Successful games like Diner Dash and Overcooked perfected influential yet very particular mechanical interpretations, but I feel that we still lack THE cooking videogame, one that could launch an entire new genre by itself, and even get some people off DoorDash by enticing their curiosity about real food.

What interested you about doing a cafe-style game set during this time period?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sipsop, creator of Cacao Cafe</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: I had always wanted to make a game to honor the main Mesoamerican cultures: Maya and Aztec. For one reason or the other, I had previously had no time or even inspiration to make it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cacao Cafe</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, many factors came together. There was a gamejam called "A Game By Its Cover" in 2020. We were in the middle of the pandemic and I had already participated in a previous version. This jam was about choosing a fictitious cartridge created by some artist somewhere in the world for "My Famicase Exhibition" and turn it into a real videogame. Among all the great creations, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://creativags.itch.io/cacaocafe">this one</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> appeared and caught my attention: a cover made by Raia that seemed like the perfect pretext to finally create a game about Mesoamerican culture.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The player will use very old cooking techniques and tools while making the food for their café. What thoughts went into turning traditional Mexica cooking techniques and tools into gameplay mechanics?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For me, the very basic part of a simulation game is that it is based on real situations, objects, and events that could exist in that period of time, although obviously, some creative license has been taken.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Initially, I wanted to make a simple game of setting up a coffee shop somewhere in pre-Hispanic Mexico, making products, improving the store, adding more furniture, decorating, etc. But in reality, those places didn't exist and I didn't want to go too far out of the real and cultural context. Plus, there were already many games like that, so it didn't seem to me that it added anything new. It just changed the aesthetics of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I thought: if I were a food merchant at that time, what would have been the actual process in that business? Fundamentally, it's the same way that actual people do food business in some traditional markets: they prepare their food at home, put it in baskets and go out to sell it in the streets around markets.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The objects still exist, the techniques are still valid... now the main question was: how do I turn it into a video game? That's when I thought the nicest way to show the techniques was to simulate the creation of the food, leaving the sales part like in the old games: where a random NPC comes and buys things based on your available stuff.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Can you walk us through the creation of one of the specific cooking techniques, from conception to completion, as a gameplay mechanic and how you took the various steps of the recipe and turned them into player interactions?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In principle, you must obtain the seeds, as there was no currency in ancient Mesoamerica. Everything was done based on a bartering system, so you must trade with what was considered a kind of currency at that time: the dry cocoa seeds. The barter part is the simplest, just exchanging values between variables in a basic store interface.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Later, with your seeds, you must return to your land and sow them. In this case, I decided to use a system like in a farm game: you take the seed, you plant it, you obtain the product, the growth lasts just a few seconds and you can collect the product, leaving the chinampa (the area you grow your crops) free again but unusable for this cycle and renewable the following cycle.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I wanted the player to have control of his raw material, so I created a permanent interface at the top indicating the cycle and day, in the upper right corner the cocoa beans that you are carrying, and at the bottom the cocoa seeds, corn, the product of cocoa and corn; and cocoa and corn powder.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The steps are as follows to create a drinkable product, for example chocolatl or atolli. The first step, once the product is obtained, is to pulverize it using the metlapilli, which the players already have in their inventory. The other tools must be purchased. Next, to create the flour, in real life the product seeds are placed on the metate and the metlapilli is passed numerous times until the grains are pulverized.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This part is where I wanted the player to have an experience closer to a real simulation of the preparation and not just clicking the buttons, so I decided to simulate the process: the player must take the seed, put it on the metate and then move the metlapilli back and forth (up and down in game) with the mouse or touch. With each movement, the metlapilli passes over the grains and grinds them until you obtain flour, whether cocoa or corn.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I also wanted that, if the user had a large inventory of grains, they could continue the process, so when they touched the gourd, the flour would go into the inventory and they could restart the process, just like in real life.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, for hot chocolate, you need a pot. Then you need to turn on the heat and then the powder, but you also need to stir constantly so that it has a pleasant texture (it’s the same process for atole). This is how I wanted the player to continue moving with the game, so the first thing was to blow on the fire to light the embers. I decided to emulate the process by shaking the fan horizontally until the fire was lit. Then, the water in the pot would begin to boil. Now, the player must add the corn or cocoa powder to the water, which is done with a simple click</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally, you must stir the pot using the grinder. In real life, this process produces foam in the chocolate or atole and is a slow process. To simulate it, I decided, as in the previous cases, to force the player to perform the stirring movement through the touch or the mouse vertically using the grinder right at the mouth of the pot.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In each process I had to make adjustments to the friction so that it felt more real. The fan, for example, moves with great agility, while the metatlapilli is difficult to control, I wanted the user to feel the weight of it. On the other hand, the grinder is lighter, however its collision is less precise, just as it should be in real life.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Perhaps the mechanic that I liked the least was that of creating the tortilla or the chocolate bar, which on the one hand requires passing the dough from one side to the other, but after trying several solutions it ended up like this moving the dough object from one hand to the other.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into choosing the recipes that you implemented into the game? Why were those recipes important to include?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At first I thought about making chocolate only since the game should be about cocoa, but in real life, people ate corn products more than chocolate, so I thought about integrating corn products, but because of the lack of time in a jam, I had to think about mechanics that could be shared by both grains to get more content with less programming. That's how I started selecting recipes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Grinding is a common process, and since it was the first part of all processes and the base of the raw material, it had to be chosen obligatorily. Additionally, as it is a traditional process, I approved of it immediately.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After that, traditionally, both tortillas and chocolate bars are created in much the same way, by kneading and heating. I did not think of this process immediately, but rather I had to research what the traditional way of creating chocolate bars was. Upon discovering that it was very similar, I decided to also add this recipe. In this case, the cultural part also had to do with it, since the tortilla is the basis of many stews in traditional and even modern Mexican cuisine.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the particular case of drinks, the process is also similar, as atole and chocolate differ very little in their preparation. So, I could add this process and it's funny to think that the first thing I should have selected for a coffee shop where they sell hot chocolate should be this one, but it was practically the last thing I chose and, in this case, it was definitely chosen because it had to be integrated, as it was implicit in the name of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For all these examples, the techniques and tools are the same, so you could have twice as many products, using the same techniques and only changing the seeds and images.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unlike chocolate, there are an infinite number of recipes that can be prepared with corn. I made a big list of dishes, however their preparation is more sophisticated or even unique, so adding these mechanics required creating many more interfaces, graphics, objects, ingredients, systems and processes, just to add one or perhaps two more products.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>You also capture several different elements of Mexica culture in the farming techniques, stories, music, calendar dates, and language of the game. What design ideas went into creating such a comprehensive snapshot of ancient Mexica culture?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">My intention was to transport the players, at least in their imagination, to that era. For the initial images, I decided to use a style similar to that of the codices, including some iconography from them. You see this, for example, in the text balloons.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For the scenarios, I was inspired by artistic conceptions from museums, especially archaeological zones. In the case of the characters, I looked for the most common typical costumes: not the most sophisticated ones, but those that could be seen on any morning at the flea market.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I wanted the game to have these cultural connotations. I wanted the players, through the game, to learn more about this culture. As I said before, I did not simply want to change the images of a café-running game, but make it an immersive experience. I think about the possibility that someone who plays it either already feels attracted to the Mexican culture or ends up wanting to know more.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To integrate this cultural part, I added the small tips that appear randomly and give the player some information about interesting facts related to culture, food, or both in each scene change. Researching and selecting these texts was a long process, but I really felt very happy to be able to include them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And since the game has a time cycle, I wanted to base it on the actual dates that were used at that time. What was celebrated? How was it done? How could that interfere with the game character's life? What was the process for a pochteca to become a successful merchant recognized even in the emperor's court?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Last but not least: music. I was looking for and selecting music that worked for me, both because of the simplicity of the instruments and the roots. I also added some background sounds, frequent and random drumming, bustle of people, some flutes, and many birds. The main idea was to integrate all of these elements so that the game, no matter how simple it was, would take the player by the hand and show them what things could be like on a nice, sunny day at that time, all cohesive through the manufacturing and marketing of cocoa and corn products, which was the premise of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What thoughts went into creating the visual style for the game? How did you work ancient Mexica culture into the game's art style alongside the various other mechanics and elements?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Mainly I wanted to capture the feel of an early console game, so I elected to pixelate and reduce the palette of the game. I really wanted the game to have that retro feel. I worked on experimenting with a reduced palette of colors, selecting the ones that best suited the experience. The game needed to have landscapes, blue skies, very green areas, and tones that would lend themselves to simulating corn and chocolate.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the same time, I wanted to help the player to perceive the different textures in the materials, in the recipes, in the people, and in the landscapes I had all drawn in pixel art because I love it. It feels so retro, and I made a lot of changes from conception to the end product. For the decorations between scenes, my initial intention was to put the staggered fretwork that represents water or air for the Mesoamerican people, but in the sketch, they did not look very good, so I reduced the patterns until I found the concentric squares of the different color schemes that adorn most of the changes of scene.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For the characters, I wanted to keep the main aesthetics of the original Famicase image, with the anime-style girl, but I also wanted to do it more in the style of early Mexican comic artists.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did it feel to explore your own culture so deeply with a game you created? What did it feel like to delve into the old cooking techniques of your culture?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When I was just a kid, we went to visit a town that still had many pre-Hispanic customs ingrained. For us kids from the city, it was very exciting to observe how our great-grandmother cooked. She had us shell the corn, and we all watched how she made the tortillas. It was a spectacle of color, heat, joy, and applause. Each tortilla must be kneaded between the hands by gently clapping and this produces a sound of applause. Taking one of those freshly made tortillas on a comal to your mouth was quite an experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Creating this game allowed me to remember those moments and by researching the holidays, the social classes, and the type of commerce, it made me feel great pride, but at the same time a desire to share with others, just like when you eat something delicious and you tell someone else: come try it, you'll like it!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's how it was for me to make this game. It was to say, "Look what a wonderful thing this culture was, how much richness it contains. Let me show you through my game some of the things that I loved."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Regarding the techniques, well, it is something traditional here that you could observe in any visit to a rural market. The utensils and the techniques are the same. I knew the name of some objects in Spanish and it was very enriching to learn their name in Nahuatl.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It is an experience that I would recommend to any developer: promoting their own culture in a world that is increasingly open to sharing and knowing how to share this treasure that enriches all of humanity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What do you hope the player takes away from steeping themselves in this culture and time period? From seeing the past and history of the Mexica culture, whether they already knew about it or not?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I would like it to be a mainly fun, relaxing experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A plus would be if the player could take away some curiosity to investigate or learn more about the culture and traditions of Mexico, not only from the past but current regional cultures all over the country. I hope that there is more curiosity to know those customs, social structures, religions, art, and, obviously, food. It is always a source of pride when other people are interested in your culture.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And perhaps, now that we have the almost free chance of seeing videos and images of archaeological and tourist sites without moving from your home, players can observe and have the possibility of marveling not only at the Mexica culture but at the richness that all the original peoples around the world have.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="241" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There are endless choices you’ll need to make when you journey through the adventure that is <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>. Who to fight, where to go, and what party to keep with you are just some of the decisions that you’ll be making. </p> <p data-characters="380" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false">You’ll also need to decide what characters you want to save from terrible fates. One of these characters is Duke Ravengard, Wyll’s father, who you’ll be given the quest to save in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/baldurs-gate-3-act-1-checklist-and-all-main-quests-explained/">Act 1</a>. However, it will be a while before you’re actually able to save him. If you’re wondering whether it’s worth it to save him, we’re here to let you know.</p> <h2 id="h-is-it-worth-saving-duke-ravengard-in-bg3" data-injectable="false">Is it worth saving Duke Ravengard in BG3?</h2> <p data-characters="356" data-current-count="736" data-injectable="true">If you’re interested in following Wyll’s story, then <strong>yes</strong>, you should save Duke Ulder Ravengard. This rescue won’t actually score you any useful items or anything, as it’s more for sentimentality and story. Reuniting Wyll with his father is a sweet moment, and if you want to get the best story you can, it’s worth the trouble.</p>
 <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false">That being said, if you’re only in it for the rewards, you’ll be disappointed. You’ll get nothing like the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/where-to-get-the-intransigent-warhammer-in-baldurs-gate-3/">Intransigent Warhammer</a>. Saving Duke Ravengard is also not an easy task, and it won’t be until <em>BG3’s </em>Act 3 that you’re able to rescue him. </p> <figure data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-save-duke-ravengard-in-bg3-act-3" data-injectable="false">How to save Duke Ravengard in BG3, Act 3</h2> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="true">In Act 3, you’ll be given the ability to save the Grand Duke in the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-save-the-iron-throne-prisoners-in-baldurs-gate-3-bg3/">Iron Throne Prison</a>. After Gortash’s coronation, he’ll disappear, and you’ll meet up with Mizora at your camp. She’ll offer Wyll a new contract: Wyll can break the contract immediately, but she won’t tell him where his father is. Or, he can forge an eternal contract with Mizora, and she’ll tell you where the Grand Duke is. </p>
 <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false">Regardless of what you choose, head to The Iron Throne by using the submersible, and Duke Ravengard is in the cell directly to the East of the ladder. You’ll only get six combat rounds to save him and others, so use your turns wisely.</p> <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="578" data-injectable="true">If you choose not to learn Duke Ravengard’s location from Mizora, she’ll appear when you get him out of his cell. She’ll try to kill him by summoning Combustion Belly Spiderlings. The Grand Duke will only have 35 HP when you find him, so before taking him out of his cell, heal him to have a better chance of saving him.</p>
 <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="289" data-injectable="false">Try using Telekinesis to move Duke Ravengard out of the way, or use the Dimension Door spell to teleport him out of the way. Whatever you decide to do, you need to move quickly since you only have six turns to save him. Once Duke Ravengard is in the submersible, he can’t be harmed. </p> <p data-characters="127" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve done it successfully, you can meet up with Duke Ravengard at the camp where he and Wyll have a nice reunion. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24173179/adata-xpg-gaming-handheld-modded-lpcamm2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Adata has become the latest company to join the hype surrounding PC gaming handhelds — but the <a href="https://www.adata.com/us/news/1136/">XPG Nia prototype it revealed</a> during Computex 2024 is completely different from what we’ve seen so far. The handheld is the first to come <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24151369/lpcamm2-laptop-memory-ram-lenovo-ifixit">with LPCAMM2 memory</a>, making it far easier to swap out and upgrade RAM. </p><p>As <a href="https://liliputing.com/adata-xpg-nia-handheld-gaming-pc-will-have-upgradeable-lpcamm2-memory-a-display-that-tilts-upward-and-a-focus-on-the-modding-community/">reported by <em>Liliputing</em></a>, you’ll be able to access the device’s storage beneath the kickstand on the back of the device. You can also remove and replace the device’s M.2 2230 SSD. These aren’t the only things you’ll be able to mod, either.</p><p>During an interview <a href="https://youtu.be/-wmj02v4I_8?si=q-90IrPlrs9w12t8&amp;t=440">with YouTuber GGF Events</a>, XPG product head Luca Di Fiore said the company is building the handheld for the “modding market” and will use a “circular computing platform.” This means that Adata will release 3D files and pinout information for the device so users can mod the device, 3D print their own accessories, or even repurpose its parts.</p><p>The XPG Nia features a seven-inch display that lifts up and away from the handheld’s chassis, along with four rear buttons, a USB-C port, and a 3.5mm headphone jack. It will also have a front-facing camera that enables real-time eye and head tracking for foveated rendering, <a href="https://www.anandtech.com/show/21432/xpg-demos-nia-handheld-gaming-pc-foveated-rendering-swappable-dram">as pointed out by <em>AnandTech</em></a>. We’ve seen foveated rendering <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23609901/gran-turismo-7-psvr-2-hands-on">used in some VR headsets</a>, which uses eye-tracking to determine where you’re looking, allowing it to display that area in full resolution while displaying the rest in a lower resolution.</p><p>XPG still hasn’t confirmed the chip that will power its handheld, but Di Fiore tells GGF Events that it has multiple prototypes based on <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/amds-hardware-ai-ryzen-phoenix-cpus-set-to-soar-in-razers-blade-14-laptop">AMD’s line of Phoenix chips</a>. The company is also shooting for a price between $500 and $600 but may launch the device through a Kickstarter campaign. Even though the XPG Nia is just a prototype for now, it holds a lot of promise and could be a refreshing addition to the growing handheld gaming market, which already has the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23513517/steam-deck-long-term-test-valve">Steam Deck</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23719210/asus-rog-ally-review">Asus Rog Ally,</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24088011/lenovo-legion-go-review">Lenovo Legion Go</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24105991/msi-claw-review">the MSI Claw</a>.</p><p><em><strong>Update, June 7th: </strong>Added details on foveated rendering.</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="268" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’re new to <em>Warzone</em> or first-person shooter games in general, there can be a lot of phrases and acronyms that won’t make sense to you at first. One of those is TTK, but don’t worry if you’re lost, as I’m here to give you the answer. </p> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="279" data-injectable="false">FPS games have dominated the gaming world for years, and <em>Call of Duty</em> is without question one of, if not the biggest of them all. It’s no surprise then that it has a huge community of players, and has essentially created its own language among those who regularly play it. </p> <p data-characters="147" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">If you’re new to the scene and see people talking about TTK, but just can’t figure out what it means, then I’ve got you covered. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>TTK is super important. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-what-does-ttk-stand" data-injectable="false">What does TTK stand?</h2> <p data-characters="80" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false"><strong>TTK in <em>Warzone</em> and other FPS games simply stands for “Time To Kill.”</strong></p> <h2 id="h-ttk-in-warzone-explained" data-injectable="false">TTK in <em>Warzone</em> explained</h2> <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="702" data-injectable="true">Knowing what it stands for is all well and good, but what does it actually mean? Well, Time To Kill is exactly what it sounds like—how long it takes to kill an enemy from the moment you fire your weapon. Therefore, you want to use guns that have a low TTK as they’ll be the quickest at eliminating your opponents. </p>
 <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="344" data-injectable="false">Now, it’s worth remembering that having the fastest fire rate doesn’t automatically mean it has a low TTK. You could use a gun with a high fire rate that deals very little damage, and its TTK would actually be slower than a gun with a low fire rate but high damage. Both fire rate and damage factor are included in the calculation. </p> <h2 id="h-what-gun-has-the-fastest-ttk-in-warzone-right-now" data-injectable="false">What gun has the fastest TTK in <em>Warzone</em> right now?</h2> <p data-characters="214" data-current-count="558" data-injectable="false">The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fastest-time-to-kill-weapons-in-warzone-season-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Warzone</em> gun with the fastest TTK</a> right now is the SOA Subverter at 688 milliseconds. This battle rifle does pack quite the punch, but if you can control the recoil, you’ll kill your enemies very quickly. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/every-missions-destiny-2-the-final-shape-listed/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=every-missions-destiny-2-the-final-shape-listed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="388" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Destiny 2’s The Final Shape</em> expansion will take you quite some time to work through. Given the price of the expansion, this makes sense since you’re paying the premium of a lot of bigger games. However, this also might leave you wondering just how far you have left until the main campaign is complete. Here are all the missions in <em>Destiny 2’s The Final Shape</em> expansion.</p> <h2 id="h-every-mission-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape-expansion" data-injectable="false">Every mission in Destiny 2: The Final Shape expansion</h2> <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="233" data-injectable="false">In total, there are <strong>eight main missions</strong> you must complete before completing the <em>Final Shape</em> campaign. There’s more to it than that, however, which we’ll discuss further below. For now, here’s every mission in order:</p> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="553" data-injectable="true"> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-complete-transmigration-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/">Transmigration</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-complete-temptation-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/">Temptation</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-complete-exegesis-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/">Exegesis</a></li> <li>Requiem</li> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-complete-ascent-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/">Ascent</a></li> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-complete-dissent-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/">Dissent</a></li> <li>Iconoclasm</li> <li>Final Mission (locked behind <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-salvations-edge-raid-schedule-and-details-for-the-final-shape-race/">the Salvation’s Edge raid</a>)</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false">The final mission is a little confusing since we’re currently unsure if this is referring to the World First clear of the raid, or if you’re required to complete the raid yourself to experience the final chapter in the story. Once we have more details on it, we’ll update this guide to reflect that.</p> <p data-characters="420" data-current-count="737" data-injectable="false">All in all, this <strong>should take around 10 hours</strong> for the average player to complete. Weaved in between each of the above missions are some added side activities, such as speaking with your Ghost, conversing with your fireteam, or completing open-world content like Lost Sectors and Strikes. If you’re playing in Normal mode, this may go by a little faster. It can also go a bit faster with a fire team of three people.</p>
