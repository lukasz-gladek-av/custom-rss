<p><em>“But... the future refused to change.”</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>For the most part, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger</a> is a chirpy, cheery game. It’s lightning in a bottle, a magical experience full of joy and excitement. Yet, there are few endings as gut-wrenching as Chrono Trigger’s 'Bad' ending.</p><div><figure data-videoid="I2fL0wP73Io" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I2fL0wP73Io?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytI2fL0wP73Io" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I2fL0wP73Io?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I2fL0wP73Io?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed58d513kxvtzy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>You’ve spent hours travelling between time periods, rescuing innocent people, gathering allies, and seeing firsthand the evolution of Lavos, the cause of the apocalypse in 1999 AD and the origin of evil throughout history - throughout millions of years of history.</p>
<p>Travelling to 1999 AD and taking on Lavos right before it causes the apocalypse, only to fail, is devastating. “The future refuses to change,” and Lavos takes all life, including yours. Life and the world collapse and grey out before your very eyes. This beautiful world you’ve become acquainted with — that you’ve seen in six different times and witnessed the spirit of humanity change, adapt, grow, and evolve — is <em>gone</em>.</p>
<p>But the future <em>refuses</em> to change; it’s not that it can’t. The words on the screen, in front of that greyed-out image of Earth and Lavos’ blood-curdling scream blaring out of the speakers, might feel like a gut punch, but it also serves as the fuel, the motivation, to get back in the fight to save the world.</p>
<figure data-uuid="0decd5dafb8dd"><a title="Chrono Trigger Lavos 1999 AD" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0decd5dafb8dd/chrono-trigger-lavos-1999-ad.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>But you already know that, right? In the 30 years since its release, everything that can be said about Chrono Trigger has been said. You don’t have to accept the world as it is. Pursue your dreams. Fight for change. You can’t change everything, but you can change some things.</p>
<p>Where many time travel stories are cautionary tales that preach the dangers of changing the course of history, Chrono Trigger throws caution to the wind and says, “Screw that: If you want to change the future for the sake of you, for the sake of the world, <em>change it</em>.”</p>
<p>Chrono Trigger’s message is poignant and, importantly, timeless. Things are crap right now, and I can’t really get through a day without feeling like the world is going to collapse in some way. If I had my own Epoch, I’d hop in it right now, travel through time, and do something to change the future. That’s what Crono, Marle, Lucca, and friends did. All because they love the world, and they love the people in it. And I do, too.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chrono Trigger throws caution to the wind and says, “Screw that: If you want to change the future for the sake of you, for the sake of the world, <em>change it</em>.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Chrono Trigger’s depiction of Earth is special, and it does something that very few RPGs manage to achieve – it makes its setting a character through its use of time travel. Over the course of millions of years, you get to: experience a <a href="https://www.snesmaps.com/maps/ChronoTrigger/ChronoTriggerMapSelect.html">world’s make-up physically changing</a>; spot similarities between continental shapes and town locations; see where certain islands have fused together, broken up, or even been completely wiped off of the map. The further you get through the game, the more similarities you’ll spot.</p>
<p>Sure, it’s obvious when you compare 600 AD and 1000 AD. The Middle Ages and Present Day only have a gap of 400 years to contend with, and many locations are in the exact same places. Truce, Guardia Forest, Porre, the Hero’s Grave, and a few other places have barely changed, and even where islands have merged, their locations match. The Sun Shrine is present in every single time period. Even the Tyranno Lair’s reappearance in the Middle Ages (as the Giant’s Claw), after millions of years, hammers home the importance of the world.</p>

<p>There are smaller details in all of the maps, too. The mountain range behind the Dactyl’s Nest in 65,000,000 BC remains all throughout history, even if it changes. Of course it would; rain, weather, and even human influence would erode the natural structures. The Ice Age alone seems to have created a more jagged range of mountains, compared to the lush green plateau of the nest millions of years ago.</p>
<p>Traditions have even survived Earth’s turbulent history, just as in real life. Ioka Village is home to a small festival where the people dance. Crono, upon visiting the village, is challenged to a soup-chugging contest by Ayla, the chief. This is in 65,000,000 BC. At the beginning of the game, in 1000 AD, Crono can take part in a prehistoric dancing game at the Millennial Fair. He can also imbibe in a drinking contest – not as safe as soup-chugging, kids, don’t try that one at home.</p>
<p>Chrono Trigger <em>loves</em> its world. And it loves its history. But it acknowledges history’s mistakes, too. The events of 12,000 BC and the collapse of Zeal more than amplify that message. Because of Queen Zeal and the (aptly named) Mammon Machine — because she tried to <em>use</em> Lavos — humanity’s innate ability to use magic was lost to time.</p>
<p>There are people that want to correct that mistake, like Melchior, one of the three Gurus and the architect behind the Mammon Machine. He warned Queen Zeal of the dangers of using Lavos’ power, but was thrust forward to 1000 AD. He <em>wants</em> to change 'history' – Antiquity’s future, the Present Day’s past, and the apocalyptic future of 2300 AD.</p>

<p>Even Chrono Trigger sets limits to what you can and can’t affect, though. You can destroy Lavos at the Ocean Palace in 12,000 BC – probably not until a second playthrough, mind you. But doing that doesn’t <em>change</em> the future, it just thrusts you back to the End of Time where Gaspar, another of the three Gurus, resides, and allows you to talk to the staff who worked on the game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chrono Trigger <em>loves</em> its world. And it loves its history. But it acknowledges history’s mistakes, too.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Defeating Lavos before killing the Black Tyranno doesn’t really change much besides two things: Lavos is dead, obviously; and, oh, everyone is a reptite now and forever – they never died out in this timeline. Otherwise, everything’s largely the same. In another ending, if you defeat Lavos while Crono is dead, then eventually Gaspar will intervene in the celebrations and insist that there’s still a way to revive Crono. There are many good and bad constants in <em>all</em> of these timelines, things that the party doesn’t have the power to change.</p>
<figure data-uuid="c7cc8fb14139c"><a title="Chrono Trigger Epoch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c7cc8fb14139c/chrono-trigger-epoch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>But it’s also not fair to call catastrophic events like the summoning of Lavos in 12,000 BC, or Magus’ attempt to summon the creature again in 600 AD, a blip in the timeline, because of the suffering those events inflict. History can be painful, and things that happen in the past ripple. We feel the after-effects of events from over one hundred years ago; they wound people, physically and mentally, and can alter paths. All we can do is bear the sins of the past and do something with that information, to change the future.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Despite everything, despite how bleak things are, there are things worth fighting for</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It’s that undercurrent of history's weight and the power of change that makes storylines like Fiona’s resonate so strongly. Despite only being a sidequest, how important it is to change the 'little' things has stuck with me, too. Restoring a forest might seem like nothing in the grand scheme, but to Fiona, it’s everything. And to you, who has seen firsthand what happens, you want to give that one person a spark of hope. You have to go back, convince someone to plant a seed, defeat the monsters in the Sunken Desert, then have Robo stay and water and care for the forest.</p>
<figure data-uuid="780c1d88c206e"><a title="Chrono Trigger Forest Camp" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/780c1d88c206e/chrono-trigger-forest-camp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the present day, you can see the fruits of your labour at Fiona’s Forest, a beautiful, lush woodland which is home to the game’s timeless campfire scene, and is an example of Crono, Robo, and the others giving back. It’s a small, positive change, and a beacon of hope. If we can do this one little thing, perhaps we can make a difference. Because we love this world, and we can make those ripples more beautiful, more positive. We <em>can</em> change the future.</p>
<p>Chrono Trigger’s world is what sets it apart from almost every other RPG. It’s small, but we become intimately familiar with it. Despite everything, despite how bleak things are, there are things worth fighting for: a better future.</p>
<p>Yet even in the face of the apocalypse, Chrono Trigger can make time for a joke or two. It stands as a beacon of light against tyranny and evil, and its message resonates now more than ever before. Instead of “The future refused to change”, consider the words of a random nun in the Middle Ages:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“In our world, every storm has an end. Every night has a new morning. What's important is to trust those you love, and never give up. We must all keep hope alive…”</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Insider Gaming’s Best Action-Adventure Game of the Year 2025]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Action-Adventure category gets more intense and serious year on year. With the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S capable of delivering high-end games that no one thought possible two decades ago, we’re seeing the best of the best in the genre. This year’s Insider Gaming Action-Adventure nominees are incredible, and one stands above the rest in 2025.</p>



<p>Combining exhilarating action you’d normally associate with a Hollywood blockbuster epic with the storytelling and nuances of an adventure movie, book, or game is a difficult duality to master. Masterfully succeeding at two genres means you’ve created the ultimate hybrid, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming</a> has picked out four key contenders for this award.</p>







<p>The breakdown begins with the winner.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-action-adventure-game-of-2025-winner-hollow-knight-silksong">Best Action-Adventure Game Of 2025 Winner—Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p>At Gamescom 2025, Insider Gaming got a chance to play Silksong before most, and claimed: “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The game you’ve been waiting for is worth the wait</a>.” Come release day, this statement aged very well. Silksong is an all-time Metroidvania great, and its intricate level design pairs up beautifully with the usual tropes of dropfeeding abilities and blocking your way with tough bosses.</p>







<p>Unusually, Silksong offers more freedom than the typical Metroidvania. There are multiple optional areas and bosses; you don’t have to go on the same path each time, and there are so many side quests and gambits to consider. Sometimes this is to get away from the game’s excessive difficulty, mind, as Silksong is certainly not an experience the casual gamer will enjoy. It requires a gut full of fortitude and patience to beat, but the alluring graphics and beautifully designed enemies and environments make it worth it.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong took longer than anyone would’ve liked to arrive, but it’s earned its place.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-action-adventure-game-of-2025-nominations">Best Action-Adventure Game of 2025 Nominations</h2>



<h3 id="h-ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Sucker Punch Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Ghost of Tsushima wasn’t perfect, but it sure was pretty and plentiful. Ghost of Yotei is an improvement in most areas, but still stumbles into the same pitfalls as its predecessor, and the story perhaps doesn’t quite live up to the first game. Still, this is a PlayStation 5 exclusive worth the money, and further flexes Sucker Punch’s creative muscles.</p>



<p>The studio has admitted it might move onto <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sucker-punch-could-make-new-sly-cooper-infamous-game-after-ghost-of-yotei/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sly, inFamous</a>, or something new entirely moving forward. If this happens, Ghost of Yotei is a good note to end on (or briefly put on hiatus) and was a strong contender for the Best Action-Adventure prize.</p>



<h3 id="h-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another in the ‘sequel to the original that basically does it better’ department. Hideo Kojima’s schedule is busy with OD and Physint, but Death Stranding 2 was always going to be the focus. With returning cast members and another glittering array of video game royalty joining the action, there’s no expense spared for Death Stranding 2.</p>



<p>As with any Kojima title, there’s an unbelievable sense of grandeur and pomp in DS2. The game sometimes crumbles under its own lofty premise and vision, but take nothing away from what Kojima Productions has achieved here. It’s a technical marvel and one worth the price of admission for <em>that </em>spinning lights section!</p>



<h3 id="h-split-fiction">Split Fiction</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hazelight Studios has quickly gained a reputation as a studio that can’t do any wrong. The new-ish studio already has A Way Out and It Takes Two under its belt. When you win Game of the Year in only your second try, every subsequent release comes with the unenviable burden of expectation. If there was one way to describe Split Fiction, it’s more of It Takes Two: Two-player-only gameplay, two different characters going through a host of mini-games and new and innovative mechanics, and a heartwarming story to pull them together through the adventure.</p>



<p>Split Fiction is near-enough on par with It Takes Two, but there might be an argument that it’s a trick we’ve already seen before—lessening its spectacle and impact. Hazelight’s newest work is still a GOTY contender—one <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insider-gamings-the-game-awards-2025-winner-predictions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming think was cruelly overlooked by The Game Awards 2025</a>—and needs to be played.</p>



<p>Was Hollow Knight: Silksong the clear and oustanding candidate in this category? Or has IG made a misfire on this list somehwere? There’s an ideal place to let us know: The free-to-join <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/google-pixel-10-and-10-pro-go-on-clearance-at-all-time-low-prices-to-close-out-2025-despite-being-the-latest-smartphones-2000655521</link>
            <guid>1392469</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="0" data-end="470">If you’ve been considering upgrading your smartphone, now is the perfect time to treat yourself to something fresh and exciting. Amazon has just made it even easier for you to do so, with the Google Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro being offered at some hefty discounts. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6590/">The Pixel 10, featuring 128GB of storage, has dropped from $799 to as low as $549</a>. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5783/">Meanwhile, the Pixel 10 Pro with 128GB of storage is now available for just $749, down from its original price of $999.</a></p>
<p data-start="472" data-end="1445">Both the Google Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro come equipped with a 6.3-inch display that boasts a resolution of 1280 x 2856. While this isn’t quite as large as the Pixel XL’s 6.8-inch screen, it still provides an optimal viewing experience, making it perfect for reading tex messages and watching videos alike. The display is bright, vibrant, and remains clear even under direct sunlight. Plus, it supports a smooth 120 Hz refresh rate, which makes gaming and general use feel fluid and responsive. The Pixel 10 Pro is available in a range of colors, and regardless of the option you choose, they are all part of the deal that brings the price down to just $749. For the standard Pixel 10, the frost and obsidian (white and black) colors are available for $599, while the funkier lemongrass and indigo options are discounted by an additional $50, bringing them down to $549. Though, you were likely planning to slap a case on it right away, so who needs to worry about color, right?</p>

<h2 data-start="1447" data-end="1481">Pro-Level Photography Features</h2>
<p data-start="1482" data-end="2068">When it comes to photography, the Pixel 10 Pro stands out with its impressive triple rear camera system. The 50 MP main camera is paired with a 48 MP telephoto lens, offering pro-grade zoom capabilities. You can now take photos or record videos at up to 100x Pro Res Zoom, which delivers the best zoom quality the Pixel series has seen to date. There’s also a 48 MP ultrawide camera that allows for macro focus, making it easy to capture incredibly detailed close-up shots of small subjects. On the front, a 42 MP camera ensures your selfies and video calls are crystal clear and sharp.</p>


<p data-start="2070" data-end="2427">The Pixel 10 Pro also comes with built-in Gemini, Google’s AI assistant, which seems to be getting baked into everything these days whether you want it or not — including in smartphones. Gemini is designed to help by doing things like creating group shots from multiple photos, generating images, summarizing unread emails, and other stuff of the like. It’s powered by Google’s next-gen chip, which enables the phone with the processing power needed to fully utilize AI.</p>
<p data-start="2429" data-end="2784" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">As for cellular service, the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro are both unlocked, meaning you can choose the carrier and data plan that best fits your needs—whether that’s Google Fi, Verizon, T-Mobile, AT&amp;T, or any other major carrier. Currently, you can save up to $250 on either the Google Pixel 10 or Pixel 10 Pro, making this an ideal time to upgrade your device.</p>

		<p>The days of video games playing second fiddle to films, comics and cartoons are far behind us. If anything, it’s often games that are now leading the way and providing source material to be adapted into anime, books and billion dollar films.</p>
<p>But what if you take a more holistic approach with a transmedia project planned from the off?</p>



<p>Umamusume: Pretty Derby took the world by storm earlier this year, when this free-to-play athlete-management &amp; deckbuilding hybrid experience about anime girls with horse ears finally got its global release. While the franchise is only just beginning to explode in popularity for English-speaking audiences this year, it’s been one of the hottest multi-media property in Japan for years, spawning manga and anime tie-ins galore.</p>
<p>One of those tie-ins, the currently airing Umamusume: Cinderella Gray, is a breath-taking blend of hot-blooded anime action, endearing horse girl silliness, and some of the sharpest animation you’ll ever see. It tones down the cutesy and silly vibes that usually drive most of the Umamusume experience, instead going for a cool, tense, and gripping origin story for one of the many characters in the series that ends up skewing closer to a traditional sports anime or even action classics like Fullmetal Alchemist Brotherhood or Naruto in terms of tone and pacing. It’s an incredible reflection of one of the many layers of the Umamusume franchise, and I’ve already got some new favorite characters to unlock and train in the game after watching this anime.</p>

<p><em>– MIguel</em></p>
<h3>Devil May Cry (Netflix) – Runner Up</h3>
<p>The streamers have been ravaging the gaming world for IPs they can turn into animations with mixed results, for every Arcane: League of Legends there is a Tomb Raider, and while Devil May Cry may not be the cream of the crop it is very enjoyable.</p>
<p>The Netflix series pulls storylines and details from almost every incarnation of DMC, including characters found in the DMC novels and Manga, and mixes them up to create a lighter version of DMC. There are still dark moments, especially when it comes to the main antagonist, Rabbit, but Dante is portrayed as rather young and goofy, with none of the brooding or trauma found in the games. There are some great needle drops throughout the series, all from the 2000’s when DMC was at it’s height, along with a few classic tracks from the games, and while the mix of 2D and CG animation can clash somewhat, there are some spectacular sequences.</p>
<p>Devil May Cry is gory, sweary, funny, and packed full of action, and while it may not be what you personally think DMC is, it’s a darn fun ride. Series 2 lands on Netflix in May 2026.</p>

<h3>A Minecraft Movie – Runner Up</h3>
<p>Is A Minecraft Movie a good movie? It probably depends on who you ask. If you’re a kid who’s grown up playing Minecraft, whose understanding of it is as deep and creative as any other physical building system, then the answer is likely a categorical ‘yes’.</p>
<p>The Minecraft movie is silly, irreverent, and often nonsensical, but it’s also playful, creative and built to specifically reference every aspect of the game that inspired it. Cinemas were filled with all sorts of crazy Minecraft-inspired behaviour, inspiring joy and fervour in a shared pop culture moment, although that occasionally spilt out into extremes, such as the fans who unleashed live chickens into a theatre in reaction to the Lava Chicken song.</p>
<p>Households, streets and school playgrounds were filled with the sound of that song, and it epitomised the union between the game and the movie. Nobody could have expected Jack Black’s shenanigans to hit the right notes with fans, but they absolutely did.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>With <strong>Grand Theft Auto 6</strong> being almost a year away, fans of the popular Rockstar Games series have no other option than playing older entries in the series, or GTA Online, to get their fix.</p>



<p>While many of the older games haven't aged too badly, some of them are starting to show their age, prompting fans to seek new ways besides <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition/"><strong>official remasters</strong></a> to enjoy some of these all-time classics with improved visuals and gameplay, such as <strong>an upcoming modding project that will bring the classic Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas experience to the latest iteration of the series' engine.</strong></p>



<p>Revolution Team, the modding team behind the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vice-city-nextgen-edition/"><strong>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nextgen Edition project</strong></a>, revealed Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - The Nextgen Edition, a Grand Theft Auto V overhaul mod that will bring <strong>the entirety of the game</strong> initially released on PlayStation 2 to the <strong>latest iteration of the RAGE engine</strong>. This means that all content, from main missions to side missions, will be playable within Grand Theft Auto V.</p>



<p>At this time, <strong>very little information is available</strong>, and for a good reason. <em>"This time, we will be sharing details more cautiously,"</em> the team stated, <strong>possibly to avoid what happened with their Vice City project</strong>, which faced significant legal pressure and social media takedowns from Take-Two Interactive earlier this year, eventually leading the mod to be released as a standalone package to ensure its survival. With the promise of <em>"something truly special"</em> in the works, however, <strong>there are definitely some exciting times ahead for fans of the series.</strong></p>

</p></figure>



<p>At this point, the question is: <strong>"Will Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas - The Nextgen Edition release <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">before Grand Theft Auto 6?</a>"</strong> Revolution Team did not say so, but there's no denying that fans of the series have a great 2026 to look forward to!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Marvel’s Blade development team has been hard at work, and they have called the title ‘a special game.’</p>



<p>The next big title that players are looking forward to from Arkane Lyon is Marvel’s Blade, and players have really been hoping to learn more details about the title. All we learned earlier this year was that the production phase of Marvel’s Blade commenced at the end of 2024 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvels-blade-survives-recent-xbox-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was not impacted by the layoffs</a>. Now, a developer has provided another minor update. </p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-s-blade-dev-provides-small-update">Marvel’s Blade Dev Provides Small Update</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/upcoming-xbox-games-blade-development-progress-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamerant</a>, an Arkane and Bethesda-focused content creator recently asked the developers for an update on Marvel’s Blade as a Christmas Gift. To everyone’s surprise, the studio/co-creative director, Dinga Bakaba, arrived with a minor update on Marvel’s Blade via a reply on <a href="https://x.com/DBakaba/status/2003458441139118463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), confirming that development is indeed progressing well. </p>



<p>Bakaba stated that the team is working hard to develop the title and that “everyone is super proud and outdoing themselves.” The developer also asked players to be patient, as this “will be a special game,” and hopes it will meet the “high standard” they have set for themselves and the players. </p>



<p>For those unaware of the title, Marvel’s Blade will be a single-player, third-person game set in the heart of Paris. Players will be able to embody the role of the legendary Daywalker, Eric Brooks, as they explore an original story set in a quarantined zone in Paris, where a supernatural emergency is unfolding. </p>



<p>In other news, Bethesda wants players to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-wants-play-fallout-5-600-hours-rookie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">play Fallout 5 for ‘600 hours’</a>. Also, the developers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-fallout-a-decade-to-feel-comfortable/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">needed a decade to ‘feel comfortable’</a> with creating ‘new stuff’ in Fallout.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Larian says that it isn’t necessary to play the older Divinity games before starting the upcoming game. </p>



<p>The Baldur’s Gate 3 developers have been in the news a couple of times lately, most recently for their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-larian-employees-fire-back-at-bosss-ai-comments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comments on AI</a> and the reveal of the new Divinity title at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-3-announcement-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a>. Since then, we have heard some new details about the upcoming title, and now the developers have revealed that we don’t need to prep by playing previous games in the series. </p>



<h2 id="h-players-should-play-the-older-divinity-games-only-for-the-lore">Players Should Play the Older Divinity Games Only for the Lore</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/theyre-a-bit-outdated-larian-boss-swen-vincke-doesnt-believe-you-should-play-the-older-divinity-games-before-the-new-one-unless-you-want-the-lore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>, Larain founder Swen Vincke elaborated on playing the older Divinity: Original Sin games. Vincke first spoke about how the upcoming title will reference events from the original games, including Ego Draconis, the same story, or The Dragon Knight Saga, and more. However, these events are now “just part of the history of what happened in this world, and it helped shape the world to the point where it is now.”</p>



<p>Vincke adds that players who tried Baldur’s Gate 3 for the cinematic experience shouldn’t try older Divinity games unless they “want to know the lore”. If the player likes “tactical combat, or co-op multiplayer, or really having lots of freedom,” then they should definitely try out Original Sin 2, as that title served as a blueprint for Baldur’s Gate 3. Vincke concluded, stating that players who want to know everything, “there are games that came before, but they’re a bit outdated by now, they are quite old.”</p>



<p>In other news, Divinity will follow the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/divinity-plans-to-follow-the-same-early-access-format-as-other-larian-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">same early access format</a> as previous Larian games. Additionally, the upcoming title will feature <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-divinity-will-feature-turn-based-and-co-op-gameplay-developers-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">turn-based and co-op gameplay</a>. Will you be playing the older Divinity or jump directly into the new one?

<section><p>The Hundred Line's developer almost went bankrupt making it, but the quality and success of the game fills me with hope.</p></section>

                <p>55 hours into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy/" data-ref-id="5000-632921">The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</a>, Too Kyo Games' visual novel turn-based strategy game, I encountered a particularly touching scene. Two characters, who a few days earlier learned something particularly shocking--one of several moments in the game that recontextualizes the whole experience--get up early and end up watching the sun rise together. It's a little moment of tranquility, of two people bonding over natural beauty amid a particularly rough string of days, and it landed beautifully. It felt like the game was tapping into something a little deeper, a little more melancholic, than what I'd seen before.</p><p>According to online estimates of the game's total length, at the point I saw this scene, I had another 90-120 hours to go until I could really say that I'd "finished" the game, depending on my speed and patience. The name The Hundred Line refers to the number of days the students of Last Defense Academy have to defend their school for as waves of invaders periodically force them into tactical combat. But the name actually has another meaning that you uncover once those 100 days pass for the first time, about 30 hours into the game: This game has 100 unlockable endings, and to get the full picture, you'll want to see all of them.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy-: Official Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The promise of 100 endings feels like the sort of marketing mistruth that pops up in a press release to play up how much the game is shaped by your choices. A game that claims to have 12 endings might actually mean four endings, each with a few minor potential variations. And yes, some of the endings in The Hundred Line are kind of cheating, or are very similar to each other--not every ending is created equal. But there really are 100 of them, consisting of 21 different "routes" that can all end at various different points.</p><p dir="ltr">At the point that these two characters took in the sunrise, I had seen eight endings; I was still a good five hours from getting my ninth (although endings 10-12 were all unlocked within an hour after that). Seeking out these endings had revealed new information about the game world: The paths leading to those endings had shown characters in a new light, and several of them had poked at new corners of this game world or revealed new lore. They'd been silly, sad, a little scary, and alternately funny and tragic. Different characters died each time, and the emotions I felt over each one were different. As I wrapped up the pathway that, I believe, is the closest thing the game has to a "canon" ending, I knew that I'd keep going, and that knowing everything I'd learned on my way to that ending would only deepen my understanding and appreciation of the many paths I still had to take.</p><p dir="ltr">The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy is co-directed by Kazutaka Kodaka and Kotaro Uchikoshi, best known, respectively, for the Danganronpa and Zero Escape games: two series known for their huge twists, hyperactive narratives, and penchant for killing off cast members. This new game has all of that too, and it throws in a pretty competent Fire Emblem-style combat system on top. That's not to mention the bonding stats with each individual student, the board-game-like "exploration" mode, or the RPG-style character stats and loadouts you can gradually tweak as the game progresses.</p><p dir="ltr">Usually, in games that promise a story shaped by the choices you've made, a major appeal is the notion of getting to the end and experiencing the conclusion of the story that you have co-authored with the game's writers and designers, finding the conclusion that represents the pathway you forged through the experience. Maybe you'll play again and make different choices to experience some different scenes; more likely you'll simply take it as a given that if you <em>did</em>, the story would be a little different next time.</p><p dir="ltr">The Hundred Line takes a different approach: It's a choose-your-own adventure story, but instead of needing to keep one finger back on the page where you made your last choice in case it doesn't pan out, you have a neat timeline that lets you revisit every single choice in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">The most empowering thing about this game is that your own choices don't really matter, because the best way to play the game is to make all of them and see every outcome. There are certainly some pathways that give you more information or a deeper story, endings that feel "good" or "bad" or some shade between, but there's no sense of punishment, or of being denied certain story beats because of your choices.</p><p dir="ltr">There's a rare, exciting feeling that I don't experience often with games of this scale: the sense that the developers were able to pursue their exact vision through to the end. The Hundred Line is the kind of game that no business strategist or market expert would advise a company to make and release in 2025. A game this huge, with no additional monetization, with a pointed focus on storytelling, with a $60 price tag and a lot of strange and challenging themes: It could be a potential recipe for disaster, especially when it relies on 3D models for its tactical combat system and numerous cutscenes. It's a game that many media and influencers are going to be a little scared to touch, too, since it's so lengthy and text-heavy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4626292-0494422003-ss_1f.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626292" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4626292-0494422003-ss_1f.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4626292"></a><figcaption>The Hundred Line</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4626292-0494422003-ss_1f.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><span>The Hundred Line took over five years to develop, and the script--which must contain something in the ballpark of one million words--would have made localization extraordinarily expensive, especially when you factor in voice acting. In a pre-release interview with </span><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/if-the-game-does-not-sell-well-we-may-be-done-its-do-or-die-for-too-kyo-games-and-the-hundred-line">Nintendo Life</a><span>, Kodaka admitted that if the game did not sell well, the studio "may be done" after taking out loans to fund development. A week after the game came out, in response to a fan on Bluesky, Kokoda </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kazkodaka.bsky.social/post/3loa6no5b2c2j" rel="nofollow ">stated</a><span> that the company was "still on the brink of going under."</span></p><p dir="ltr">And yet, The Hundred Line has been a success. By July, three months after launch, the game was selling well enough that Kodaka told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-11/-the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-nearly-bankrupted-too-kyo-games" rel="nofollow ">Bloomberg</a>, "I don't see bankruptcy as a serious future." Exact sales figures have not been released, but it seems that the risk Too Kyo Games took in spending so much time and effort on developing this behemoth paid off.</p><p dir="ltr">Part of it, I think, is that Kodaka and Uchikoshi have built up good will with their previous series: the Danganronpa and Zero Escape series amassed global fanbases over a long period. The Hundred Line is also audacious in a way that is undeniable and uncommon: the sheer size of the thing is exciting, more so than a game that offered, say, 30 different endings. It also helps that the tactical battles are quite enjoyable, with just enough depth and originality so that going into battle never feels tedious.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond all of that, though, the storytelling in The Hundred Line is--to boil down an immense quantity of work into a simplistic sentiment--very good, with excellent character dialogue, fantastic voice acting, and a great many "what if" scenarios you can explore. The characters are all interesting, developing and deepening over time, and seeing how they change and adapt to the vastly different stories you can explore is fascinating--it's impressive to see the game maintain consistency across different paths.</p><p dir="ltr">As reports continue to come in of developers tightening their belts as the industry shifts towards more conservative, proven tactics to turn a profit, seeing a company taking a huge risk to make something both enormous and unusual, and having it pay off, is heartening. Even without that context, though, The Hundred Line would still be my favorite game of 2025. It's a breathtaking achievement in narrative design, a truly wild example of just how much you can do with player choice, and one of the most ambitious visual novels ever made.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[GTA 6 Is The Insider Gaming Community’s Most Anticipated Game Of 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-insider-gaming-community-most-anticipated-game-2026/</link>
            <guid>1392271</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>While the games that are released bring the joy of being able to experience something new, there’s something about the build up to a game that can be just as, if not more, exciting as the release itself. In 2026, the gaming calendar is loading with titles like Marvel’s Wolverine, Resident Evil Requiem, and Phantom Blade Zero that could be in contention for Game of the Year. However, no game has the community talking and is more anticipated than Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6).</p>



<p>A poll hosted exclusively on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a> saw GTA 6 get 29.8% of the votes. That may be far less than the 87% it received last year, but that can be blamed, if you will, on the other games in development.</p>







<p>But why did GTA 6 win for the second year in a row? It’s kind of obvious, really. </p>



<p>It’s the first game in 13 years for the nearly 30-year-old franchise. It also sees the series return to Vice City and the state of Leonida as a whole in what looks, based on the information released so far, to be the largest region in the history of GTA. </p>



<p>Two trailers have been released so far, both doing well over 100 million views, showing just how excited players are to get this game. It’s expected to be the highest-grossing game in the series and could very well beat the sales numbers for GTA 5, which made $815 million in just 24 hours. </p>











<p>As mentioned, GTA 6 received 29.8% of the votes this year. Where things got interesting, though, is in the rankings that followed.</p>



<p>Second place saw a tie between a game confirmed for next year and one still a year or two away. Both Marvel’s Wolverine, which releases next fall, and The Witcher 4 received 18.2% of the vote. That was followed by another tie for fourth between Resident Evil Requiem and the Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake at 9.9%.</p>

<p><em>Over the holiday season, we're republishing some of the best articles from Nintendo Life writers and contributors from</em> <em><a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/best-of-2025" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/best-of-2025">2025</a></em><em>. This article was originally published in February. Enjoy!</em></p>
<hr>
<p>There’s no question that Nintendo makes some of the best video games in the world thanks to its incredibly skilled and passionate in-house and partner developers. But how often does the company let those developers speak freely about the games they make?</p>
<p>Last year we got the opportunity to chat with the legendary artist <strong>Takaya Imamura</strong>, famous for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/star_fox">Star Fox</a>, Captain Falcon and the many machines in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/f-zero">F-Zero</a>, and even <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/legend_of_zelda_majoras_mask">Majora’s Mask</a> itself. He was with Nintendo for over 30 years working on countless games until leaving the company in 2021 to pursue something different. So, naturally, we said 'Yes!' and flew thousands of miles to sit down with the man himself.</p>
<p>Imamura-san is now coming back to gaming with his new project <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/omega_6_the_triangle_stars">OMEGA 6: The Triangle Stars</a>, an adventure inspired by his own manga. In this interview, we speak about the upcoming game, his days working on games like Zelda, and why he left Nintendo after all those years...</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life (Zion Grassl): Omega 6 looks a lot like a long-lost Super Famicom game. How long have you had the idea for this game in your head?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Takaya Imamura:</strong> So it’s actually pretty new as a concept. It’s derived from the manga. The idea wasn’t there from the beginning. I wrote the manga, then the chance to create a game based on it came up.</p>

<p><strong>In that regard, what do you love about working outside of Nintendo and how is developing a game different now for you?</strong></p>
<p>Now I enjoy it. I’m happy.</p>
<p><strong>Did we hear correctly that you’re a professor as well? How do you juggle all of that?</strong></p>
<p>Simply put, as a professor I’m teaching students, they come to class at a certain time, there’s summer holidays and I know when I need to work and when I don’t. Like Indiana Jones. [makes whip-cracking sound]</p>
<p><strong>Are you a big Indiana Jones fan?</strong></p>
<p>Yea, yeah!</p>
<p><strong>Are you going to play <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/indiana_jones_and_the_great_circle">The Great Circle</a> when that comes out?</strong></p>
<p>Ahh, of course!</p>
<p><strong>What has it been like being a teacher and a famous game developer? Do you have students that know of and are fans of your work?</strong></p>
<p>There are some like that, but the majority don’t really know who I am.</p>
<p><strong>Wow! That’s so interesting! I feel if you were a teacher in the US or the UK people would react differently to you being their teacher.</strong></p>
<p>Even students who really look up to me tend to hold back during class. It’s when we go out for a meal or drinks then they ask if I’ll sign or draw something!</p>
<p><strong>It’s nice that there’s a time and place for that sort of thing. To get back to Omega 6, what was your biggest inspiration for the art direction?</strong></p>
<p>Once I left Nintendo, I was thinking, 'How can I do something on my own as a creative?' The easiest and first thing that came to mind was to make a comic since I can draw. I really wasn’t thinking of how I could sell the comic and make money, I just really wanted to draw this comic. If I can put it digitally on Kindle and a few people buy it? Great!</p>
<p><strong>The game itself has a massive roster of characters, and I love how there’s a list of them all that you can flip through. Are you sharing design duties with anyone else or are they all created by you?</strong></p>
<p>Thank you! Basically it was all me except there are four characters in there that my students designed. I did the pixel art for those few characters but my students came up with the original designs.</p>

<p><strong>That’s amazing! You directed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/steel_diver">Steel Diver</a> and have worked on plenty of other games with Nintendo over your many years there, but when’s the last time you’ve gotten to express yourself in this way?</strong></p>
<p>It’s the first time I’ve been this free, because there’s nobody to tell me 'No', or to tell me when to stop. I just do what I want as much as I want.</p>
<p>When I was at Nintendo, or when you’re doing something in a professional environment and the project has milestones that people have to check off, you get senior people like the producers and managers that say, “Alright, you need to reel this one in,” or, “Let's not do this.” Ya know, I really never liked that. I think for pretty much anybody who is a professional game developer, this is something they’ll go through. Of course, you know, when you’re at a company, the company has to make money!</p>
<p><strong>Do you remember what it was that made you want to leave Nintendo? You’d been there for many years, but it’s a dream for many to work there.</strong></p>
<p>It’s actually pretty simple. I quit when I was 65. This is the same for anybody, but life is short. We’ve only got a number of years on this earth and there’s a limit to the amount of things you can do with that time. I was kind of mulling over that and at the same time I got an invitation from the university to come and teach and I thought, 'Whoa, this is an opportunity to change things.'</p>
<p><strong>This was three or four years ago, right?</strong></p>
<p>I left in 2021!</p>
<figure data-uuid="4424d263ea05b"><a title="Takaya Imamura outside Nintendo HQ in Kyoto" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4424d263ea05b/takaya-imamura-outside-nintendo-hq-in-kyoto.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://x.com/ima_1966/status/1351786503815397376">Nintendo Life / @ima_1966</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What are a few things you miss working at Nintendo?</strong></p>
<p>For the first six months or so after leaving Nintendo, I kept dreaming I was still going to work. I’d start developing a game and then I’d wake up and go, “Oh, oh. Okay that’s weird.”</p>
<p>I actually met with Shigeru Miyamoto once after I left and I said, “Hey, long time no see!” But I actually didn’t feel like that was true since I was seeing him in my dreams all the time. He got a good laugh out of that.</p>
<p><strong>You were at Nintendo for such a long time, so were you pretty close with a lot of your colleagues?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I still keep in contact with all of them. For example, the director of Animal Crossing, Aya Kyogoku, is coming out to see me teach in the classroom in October.</p>
<p><strong>Wow, really?! Is she going to be speaking or just sitting in to observe?</strong></p>
<p>She’s just coming over for a chat! If I have her give a lecture or something like that, then she’s gotta ask Nintendo and it has to be approved.</p>
<p><strong>How does it feel for you to be able to pass on all the things you’ve learned to a newer generation?</strong></p>
<p>It’s very difficult because if I was to host a speech, lots of people would come and listen, I think. When we turn it into a formal lecture, then there’s people who are like, “Ughhh, I don’t wanna be here.” People sleep in class, so it’s like any lecture in school.</p>

<p><strong>So I know you’re very famous for creating Tingle - was there anything specific that really inspired you to make him?</strong></p>
<p>The background and the lore of the character was decided beforehand and I was only responsible for the visuals. Basically, I found a guy on the team and drew a caricature and there was Tingle!</p>
<p><strong>That seems to be a running theme for you, taking members of your team and putting them in the game! You did this with Star Fox, Falco and Slippy too, yeah?</strong></p>
<p>I’m pretty good at caricatures. With Star Fox, it wasn’t a direct caricature but instead I was taking inspiration from different people. But yeah, that is one of the ways I do it.</p>
<figure data-uuid="652e38f36eafb"><a title="Star Wolf characters" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/652e38f36eafb/star-wolf-characters.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>So you’re saying there’s a real-life Tingle roaming around in the world?</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>We know there were a lot of character designs that were carried over from The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time to Majora’s Mask but did you design any other characters in that game?</strong></p>
<p>The only real NPC I made was Tingle, but I designed the Moon and Majora’s Mask and that was kind of iconic. I was the art director, so I wasn’t designing the actual characters, more setting the overall theme and direction for the art.</p>
<p><strong>Do you remember why you were tasked with designing Tingle then? Did someone on the team want you to do it?</strong></p>
<p>It was just a coincidence really. Everyone else was busy so someone asked me, “Hey, could you do this one?” and I said, "Sure!"</p>
<p><strong>Majora’s Mask was developed in a very short amount of time, which sounds like it could be really stressful, but when you think back to that time making that game, is there anything that stands out? A funny moment, maybe the way you bonded with a coworker, or a way you made yourself proud?</strong></p>
<p>It was a really short project compared to general Nintendo timelines, so everybody was really focused on getting it done. So there really wasn’t much room for fun, games, and hijinks. But, near the end of development, I had a homepage at the time and I was drawing caricatures on it just for fun and a TV company got in contact. There’s a program in Japan where they get people on and they compete by drawing caricatures and they’re judged and everything, and I got invited to go on that!</p>
<p>And I thought, 'Huh, okay!' It’s a pretty famous program in Japan, so I thought I’d ask Nintendo and they said, “Yeah, go ahead, why not!” Nintendo said okay, but I was planning to go on without making a big deal about the fact I worked for Nintendo. Then I heard the date the program was going to go live, and it was the release date for Majora’s Mask in Japan!</p>
<p>So I thought, 'Well, in that case, I’ll go on and say who I was!' Then the program ended up coming down to the studio and filmed us developing the game a little bit, and there was me at my desk drawing some pictures. It was such a happy coincidence.</p>
<figure data-uuid="b88936f5a41cc"><a title="Tingle" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b88936f5a41cc/tingle.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Do you know if that is available online to watch?</strong></p>
<p>I haven’t been able to find it actually.</p>
<p><strong>Oh really?! I would personally do so much to see that!</strong></p>
<p>The program was called <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Champion">TV Champion</a></strong>. *<em>picks up phone and starts looking*</em> It’s a knockout competition and I made it through to the final!</p>
<p>By the way, are you a fan of Tingle?</p>
<p><strong>*shrugs and shakes head*</strong></p>
<p>[Laughs] I know there was a fan campaign to get rid of Tingle at one point, much like Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars!</p>
<p><strong>I was quite young when the game came out, I think I played it when I was eight. I remember wanting to be Link when I was a kid, so when I saw Tingle, I was like, “Oooo, who is this guy?” He doesn’t fit in the suit, flying around on balloons, letting out a funny scream when you shoot him down. I’ve grown to love him now, but as a kid I always wanted to be the 'cool guy.'</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 version of Stardew Valley is officially available, with a shadowdrop landing today, December 25th. It’s priced at just $14.99, but existing owners can take advantage of a <strong>free upgrade pack</strong>.</p>



<p>It boasts several innovations to boost the game up to spec on Nintendo’s latest flagship console, including ‘intuitive mouse controls’ and online multiplayer that supports up to eight players.</p>







<h2 id="h-stardew-valley-on-switch-but-2">Stardew Valley on Switch, But 2</h2>



<p>ConcernedApe has delivered everyone a neat Christmas gift and launched Stardew Valley’s Switch 2 edition without any warning. It’s available to download <strong>now </strong>through the Nintendo eShop, but if you already own Stardew Valley on the Switch, you can download a <strong>free upgrade pack</strong>.</p>



<p>This new version of the game introduces mouse controls, four-player split-screen co-operative multiplayer, and, as mentioned, eight-player online support. If you lean on GameShare, four friends can play together even if only <strong>one of them </strong>has the game.</p>



<p>While we knew about the version upgrade for Stardew Valley thanks to an announcement made months ago, a release date was never confirmed. It was given a <strong>window </strong>of Fall 2025, which it missed. Here’s the trailer that was published to announce the upgrade several months back:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Back in July, Stardew Valley shattered a record held by Portal 2 for <strong>14 years on Steam</strong>. It became the highest-rated game on the entire platform, out of tens of thousands of games. That’s nothing if not indicative of how universally beloved Stardew Valley is.</p>

<p>Here’s to raising a glass to RPG games that continue to bring deep, detailed worlds for everyone to lose hours in. 2025 delivered its fair share of world-class role-playing games, and Insider Gaming is celebrating these outstanding feats with the RPG Game of the Year 2025 award, and the winner might surprise you.</p>



<p>What another year it’s been for the RPG market—you’re simply spoiled at this point. It’s been so overwhelming that even remasters have been some of the most popular launches, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/oblivion-remastered-9-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> and Final&nbsp;Fantasy&nbsp;Tactics&nbsp;–&nbsp;The&nbsp;Ivalice&nbsp;Chronicles. Plenty of fresh meat has been thrown onto the market, and picking a winner for dinner was tricky.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-role-playing-game-of-2025-winner-kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Best Role-Playing Game Of 2025 Winner—Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>From a pure role-playing game standpoint, with a primary emphasis on quests, world-building, exploration, and deeper, meaningful RPG fundamentals and mechanics, it would be wrong not to award RPG of the year to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>.</p>



<p>Warhorse Studios is not here to placate casual users: This is a serious RPG requiring immersion, concentration, and attention to your actions, as one false step or bad choice can be the end of a quest or even your game! There’s so little bloat in KC2, and you have limitless paths to choose from in how you tailor your version of Henry to meet your needs.</p>



<p>The realistic gameplay won’t be for everyone, but who cares when the experience is this rich and full? This is years of hard work and dedication, making a unique RPG. Progression is a multi-layered cake of voluminous ingredients, and well over four million of you have been subjected to its unabashed brilliance. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is the RPG game of the year, and an all-time great role-playing game. </p>



<p>If you disagree, you might be branded.</p>

<h3 id="h-clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a superior, cleaner, and better-perfected game compared to Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, but it’s just <em>not </em>a better RPG. While Sandfall’s adventure doesn’t hold your hand, it simply doesn’t have the diverse range of freedom KC2 offers, not even close, to be honest.</p>



<p>That said, there’s no disputing how good Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is. It will forever go down as the game that took home a record <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-broke-all-time-the-game-awards-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nine The Game Awards 2025</a> honors. Its battle-to-battle scenarios and set-pieces are determined by your team and your build: How you invest skill points, your ability to attack an enemy’s weakness, and so forth. It’s a rightful GOTY contender, and will be talked about for decades, but it can’t be recognized as 2025’s best RPG from a genre standpoint.</p>



<h3 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s hard to argue against Monster Hunter Wilds being the most open and inviting release in the franchise yet. You might have the odd Monster Hunter purist disagree with some of the changes in Wilds, but the fact is that Capcom has done it again. Wilds and World have helped the series transcend the joy and satisfaction of slaying monsters for a select audience and opened the franchise up to the mainstream.</p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds switches to a living, breathing open-world design, you have a dedicated mount, there are tweaks to the combat and modes of attack, and if you invest now, expect a constant stream of updates between now and the end of the game’s lifecycle—look at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-free-title-update-4-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Update 4</a>, as an example.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p>Obsidian’s calendar has been exceptionally full in 2025, and it’s had another RPG to release and support—Avowed. However, the focal point of the company’s year was always likely to be The Outer Worlds 2. With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tim-cain-returns-to-obsidian-for-new-project/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tim Cain</a> helping, the developer has released the perfect follow-up to 2019’s The Outer Worlds.</p>



<p>Almost everything has been overhauled and improved in some capacity or another. There’s also a plethora of fun weapons—Wham-Bam!, take that—and even quests feel like you (the player) have been unshackled. You can approach missions and play them in different ways, and between its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-outer-worlds-2-trolls-players-who-buy-the-games-premium-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hilarious trolling Flaws</a> and progression trees, it’s a must-play RPG!</p>



<p>It’s your chance to go to the free-to-join <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> to tell everyone your favorite RPG game of 2025. You can also admonish us for not giving it to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33!</p>

Oh, and it lets Aska carry seven guns, ranging from sniper rifles to shotguns and more, that she deftly uses to mow down anything and anyone in her way. Her journey to defeat Moebius's massive Engineers, which hold the Cores she desperately needs to save the city, will take you through derelict factories, deserts, mining facilities, and into myriad arenas for some of the best first-person gunplay of 2025.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Metal Eden wears its Doom Eternal inspiration on its sleeve, turning wave-based arenas into coliseums of destruction, lest you stop moving. Using her jetpack, turbo boosts, ammo, armor, and health pickups scattered around the arena, you'll need to hold your breath and shoot everything in the room – it all wants to kill you, after all. Pause for a second, and it could spell certain doom. The resulting combat experience is a fast-paced, kinetic, on-the-go shooting gallery that I promise will send adrenaline surging through your veins.&nbsp;</p><p>That high-speed gunplay elasticity carries over into the Ghostrunner-like runs in between arenas, which task you with keeping momentum as you sprint on walls, grapple up to platforms, and jetpack double jump to safety, all while shooting down enemies that threaten your existence. The reward at the end of a linear run through Moebius' various locales is one of the aforementioned arenas, the perfect zones to try out your latest weapon upgrades.&nbsp;</p><p>There's more to Metal Eden, like some Metroid Prime-inspired sections and a voice-in-your-comms that's a bit too present, but ultimately, everything that happens when you aren't pulling the trigger gets in the way. Fortunately, these sections aren't as frequent as the parts of Metal Eden that shine, so rest assured, there's an excellent shootout just minutes away when things feel slow.&nbsp;</p><p>For more of my thoughts, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/metal-eden/shooting-through-the-noise">read my Metal Eden review here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZKgNK5coODM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZKgNK5coODM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/12/25/why-you-should-play-metal-eden]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Stray Children Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161280/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p><em>Stray Children launched on the Japanese eShop on 26th December 2024. We weren't able to review it back in October when it arrived in the West, but we've now managed to catch up with Onion Games' latest...</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Your dad’s missing and some weird “uncle” is at the door, claiming to know you. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stray_children">Stray Children</a> just chucks you straight into things with barely a title screen – but perhaps that sort of stylistic confidence is unsurprising coming from people behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/moon">Moon: Remix RPG Adventure</a>. Yoshihiro Kimura and Onion Games have delivered a compact, auteur-driven project, heading off on adventures into emotional storytelling rather than into sophisticated mechanics. And it uncovers some impressive treasures on its quest.</p>
<p>The story we’re told is that of a dog-faced kid venturing into a fantasy world through the screen of a video game. That world is surreal, funny, and sometimes very dark. In contrast to this unsettling tone, the graphics present charming, cute pixels, with a colour palette stirring memories of the Game Boy Advance. That soft presentation is the lens to show rather strange and uncomfortable things: <strong>Lord of the Flies</strong> orphans in a prison, for example, or a stalking frog paparazzo.</p>
<figure><a title="Stray Children Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161284/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The game takes its unexplained opening and runs with it, shunning straightforward exposition and trading instead on feelings and vague impressions. Nonetheless, the gist of it is that you are trapped in a trippy, sinister world populated by children who are abandoned and lost.</p>
<p>It is the world of a video game, and its heroic knight has been destroyed – your task is to put it back together. The children, meanwhile, are lacking clear figures of authority, yet subject to judgement, labelled “bad” and punished. You explore from a top-down perspective in the 16-bit style, talking to myriad inhabitants of this endlessly off-kilter world.</p>
<p>The themes of parental authority and a child’s perspective are taken further by the enemies in the lands you explore. You will face random encounters with the “Olders” – creatures based on adults, themselves failing to cope with hang-ups and demons. They inflict suffering and strict expectations while wrestling their own internal frustrations.</p>
<figure><a title="Stray Children Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161282/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In practice, this is represented by bullet-hell-style attacks dealt out in a turn-based structure. Kimura was reportedly inspired by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a>, which is no bad thing. The Olders can be defeated by attacking on your turn, which requires you to stop a spinning arrow on a segment of a circle. The size of the segment, its position, and the number of rotations you’re allowed before you have to press all get changed up. However, it’s not exactly the deepest mechanic – that’s just not what the game’s going for.</p>
<p>Instead of fighting, the Olders can instead be talked down from their fixations and freed, excluding them from further random encounters. This talking mechanic is a continuation of the inscrutable approach Onion Games has taken to the game. Various speech options need to be selected in the right order during combat, taking one turn per option, and resetting when mistakes are made.</p>
<p>Finding out the right order for your statements, however, is mysterious in the extreme. It’s very easy to miss out completely on freeing the Olders, and even the ones you get will still require some guesswork. Later, tougher bosses make trial and error pretty severe, too.</p>
<figure><a title="Stray Children Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161283/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>That experience of talking to the Olders is emblematic of the game’s general attitude to you as you play. There is plenty of friction here, but it’s so consistent from minute one that it’s clearly intentional. Experiencing the world as something confusing and unexplained — inexplicable perhaps — is alienating but childlike. This hammers home what the game’s about, but it doesn’t always feel good to engage with. There’s a tension between delivering on the theme and being fun to play, but that just makes the game interesting.</p>
<p>One thing that consistently delights, however, is the sound. The music sits perfectly with the game’s surreal world and its colours, which seem at once washed out and oversaturated. Eerie woodwinds, for example, make the perfect theme tune for tailing pigs along a train track, something like 2000s J-pop accompanies a lily pad gliding minigame, and a trilling harpsichord leads you around a grand palace.</p>
<p>The stand-out feature of the sound effects, meanwhile, has to be the character voices. These sit somewhere between the apparent sentences of Simlish and the one-dimensional jibber-jabber of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing</a>. They are clearly somehow composed from different languages, with some distinctly German snowmen being particularly memorable.</p>
<figure><a title="Stray Children Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161277/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite some frustrating repetition (unskippable dialogue right between a save point and a boss fight? Check!), Stray Children is not overlong, clocking in at about 12-15 hours. A lot of my time was spent wandering, searching for hidden items in every nook and cranny, and talking to every character I saw – sometimes a requirement for progression.</p>
<p>Again, though, the game gets away with the friction: the disorientation and lack of comfort create a sense of vulnerability – of being a stray. No doubt some players will find this opacity all a bit much. But for those feeling patient and intrigued by the art style and storytelling, it’s a joyful thing to play overall.</p>
<p>While I was in the latter camp — loving the surreal world despite the challenges — I was definitely grateful for the pick-up-and-play nature of the Switch. The pixel art looks great on the small screen, too. The hybrid console is still the best way to play the right kind of games, and this is one of them.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Stray Children is nothing if not opinionated. From its abrupt opening to its inscrutable mechanics, it outright refuses to hold your hand. This clarity of purpose builds a world that is totally captivating – <em>if</em> it gets its hooks into you.</p>
<p>If you don’t have the time and patience to explore and experiment while being labelled a “bad child”, this may not be for you. However, if you’re game for some surreal challenges, this is a memorable and ultimately optimistic adventure.</p></section>

<p>The holidays have finally kicked in, and players are ready to kick back and relax while trying some new games, warming up with a nice cup of hot chocolate.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During this holiday season, you might be thinking of introducing one of your non-gamer friends or family members to the world of gaming. There are some great picks out there where you can experience a whole new world along with your non-gamer friend.&nbsp;This Insider Gaming guide will help you pick the best game to play with your non-gamer friend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the same time, check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s Holiday 2025 hub</a> for the best deals on games and hardware across all platforms.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-it-takes-two">It Takes Two</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Starting with the game of the year for 2021, It Takes Two is a brilliant co-op game that will really get your non-gamer friend interested in this field of entertainment. It Takes Two has players exploring a couple’s clashes and how they make up while being turned into dolls and overcoming a series of obstacles. Each level features unique, interconnected abilities that must be used in coordination to get ahead. &nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction">Split Fiction</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Split Fiction is the latest title from the same people who introduced us to It Takes Two, but it’s a lot more recent and a great pick for non-gamers. The narrative follows two writers who are stuck in their own stories, trapped by a force trying to steal their creative ideas. One world is sci-fi, and the other is fantasy, and the things you will experience in this game are unlike any other.&nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-way-out">A Way Out</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Next, we have A Way Out, a premise that should interest a non-gamer friend who’s into prison escape movies. That’s right, in this title, you have to work in tandem with your friend to plan and execute a prison escape. There will be a variety of puzzles and obstacles to overcome through coordination and teamwork across areas that you would only have seen in the movies. Will you be able to break free?&nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The latest instalment to the iconic kart racing franchise is Mario Kart World, and it’s exclusively available on the Switch 2. Mario Kart World is a great introductory game for a non-gamer; some competitive fun across various levels is always fun. Moreover, the new entry introduces free exploration, increased 24-player lobbies, and much more.&nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-lego-marvel-super-heroes-2-nbsp">LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2&nbsp;</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>LEGO games are always good titles to get non-gamers inducted into gaming, and Marvel Super Heroes 2 helps if your friend is a fan of the MCU. Players can play as iconic heroes and superheroes from the Marvel universe from different eras and realities as you go head-to-head with the time-traveling Kang the Conqueror. Explore an expansive open world with areas inspired by Ancient Egypt to The Old West, Sakaar, and New York City in 2099, all built in LEGO.&nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga">LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>If your non-gamer is not a friend of Marvel, then Star Wars could be their thing. The Skywalker Saga lets you experience all nine films reimagined with LEGO humour and enables you to play the three trilogies in any order you want. There are over 300 characters to play as from this highly popular franchise, more than 100 vehicles, and 23 planets that you can spend time exploring.&nbsp;</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-ea-sports-fc-26">EA Sports FC 26</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Another way to get your non-gamer into gaming is to try out some sports titles. FC 26 is one of the most popular sports titles, with football being one of the biggest sports. FC 26 is wildly popular for its co-op play, and players can choose their favourite teams and try out a variety of game modes that suit their preferences.&nbsp;The series has also made some significant improvements over the last title, including more responsive dribbling, smarter AI positioning, sharper, more explosive movement, and much more.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-nba-2k26">NBA 2K26</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>If football isn’t your jam, then basketball might be a sport that your non-gamer friend is more inclined towards. The new instalment uses technology that “directly translates NBA footage into realistic gameplay.” NBA 2K26 also features a wide variety of teams and game modes you can choose from, either fight it out in an arena, or take it to the streets. The new title also makes you feel more connected to every dribble and crossover with revamped size-ups and experience fast-paced, dynamic movement with all-new ProPLAY features.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-wwe-2k25">WWE 2K25</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>WWE is an iconic franchise that almost everyone, gamer or non-gamer, has heard of. It’s a familiar, entertaining world where players have spent hours on end performing special moves in real life, and it’s never too late to get into it. There are a variety of modes that players can try out, play with, or against their non-gamer friends, and choose from one of the most prominent entertainment personalities from this world.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Button-mashing is always fun, and what better game for a non-gamer to be introduced to than Mortal Kombat?&nbsp;Mortal Kombat 1 is the rebirth of this universe, where things feel familiar but are drastically altered. Along with a stellar campaign, the game also features a multiplayer mode where you and your non-gamer friend can choose from a roster of characters, each having a unique set of abilities, and battle it out for hours on end. </p>

<p>I suspect many of my fellow parents can relate to this, but when you have your first child, a whole bevvy of problems that never existed before are suddenly thrust upon you.</p>

<p>Granted, a lot of these aren’t necessarily ‘problems’ as such, rather minor inconveniences that, along with frequent moments of unbridled joy, make up the weird and wonderful world of parenthood. I do, however, have a bit of a bone to pick with Nintendo, specifically with its approach to game difficulty in the last mainline Mario, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>.</p>
<p>Before having a child, the idea of lowering a game’s difficulty had honestly never really entered my mind. If anything, I would crank the difficulty up wherever I could in the hope that it would both extend my overall playtime and provide a unique sense of accomplishment. <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox/halo">Halo</a> on Legendary? No problem. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> on Climax? Is that all you've got?</p>
<p>This all changed, however, when my daughter expressed interest in playing Mario Wonder. She watched the <strong>Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong> and became somewhat obsessed with the characters – especially Princess Peach. She’s only three, so I knew immediately that if I’m going to let her play, I’d need to make sure it was as approachable as possible, despite my own proclivities.</p>
<p>As you might know, however, Super Mario Bros. Wonder essentially locks its lower difficulty setting to specific characters: Nabbit and four Yoshis. So when the character select screen came up, I gently tried to explain this to my daughter, knowing full well how the conversation would go.</p>
<p><em>“Now listen, if you go for one of <strong>these</strong> characters, the game will be a bit easier for you and you’ll have a lot more fun.”<br></em><em>“I want to be Princess Peach thoooough!”<br></em><em>“That might be a bit trickier. If you go for the purple rabbit, it’ll be better.”<br></em><em>“No, Princess Peach!”</em></p>
<figure data-uuid="d3b1fe9bd18f7"><a title="SSMBW - Nabbit 02" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d3b1fe9bd18f7/ssmbw-nabbit-02.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>"You'll play as Nabbit and you'll LIKE IT!"</figcaption></figure>
<p><em>Sigh.</em> Anyone who’s had the pleasure of raising a three-year-old knows that it’s borderline impossible to change their mind once their heart is set on something. In this case, Princess Peach is my daughter’s favourite character from the movie, so <em>of course</em> she’s going to want to play as her. This meant we'd have to do without the perks – including <em>invincibility</em> – that come with Yoshi or Nabbit.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wonder's Badge system would have potentially eased certain tricky scenarios, but they're not a comprehensive replacement for proper difficulty options</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So how did it go? Well, rather predictably, not well. The opening stage – Welcome to the Flower Kingdom – was doable, but it went rapidly downhill from there. I knew that changing to Yoshi or Nabbit wasn’t suddenly going to make the game a cakewalk; after all, while both characters boast unique abilities that would theoretically make most scenarios easier, there’s still the task of actually navigating the levels. Given my daughter’s age and inexperience, even that would no doubt prove quite the challenge.</p>
<p>Still, it seems baffling to me that Nintendo would create a game aimed at children and families and not offer any optional difficulty settings for the majority of its 12 playable characters. No offence to Nabbit, but no child wants to play him when the likes of Mario, Luigi, and Princess Peach are sitting right there; especially when the Illumination movie had such an immediate, profound influence on my daughter's perception and preferences.</p>
<p>And yes, I know Wonder's Badge system would have potentially eased certain tricky scenarios, but they're not a comprehensive replacement for proper difficulty options, in my eyes.</p>
<p>I wish I could say that I managed to convince her so she could enjoy the game, but she was exceptionally stubborn in her desire to play as Peach. And honestly? I'm quite proud of that. It makes me think that perhaps, way off in the future, she'll be playing her games on higher difficulties just like me... Or she just loves Peach and wants to play as her – yeah, that's probably it. In the end, though, she gave up and went back to playing with her Peach plushie.</p>
<figure data-uuid="585a5d013f786"><a title="SMBW - Peach" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/585a5d013f786/smbw-peach.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Yeah... She never got this far.</figcaption></figure>
<p>Games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/celeste">Celeste</a> have proven that even the most challenging of experiences can be accessible to almost anybody when it has the right options in place. Quite frankly, I think with invincibility turned on and unlimited stamina applied, my daughter could probably have more fun with Celeste than she did with Mario Wonder – and I consider the latter to be <em>much</em> easier on its default settings.</p>
<p>So come on, sort it out, Nintendo. You've made some strides with difficulty and accessibility options over the years, but you've clearly got a long way to go. Applying blanket difficulty settings to a tentpole Mario title seems like the most basic of tasks when your goal is to reach as many potential players as possible, but as ever, the company stubbornly does things its own way.</p>
<p>Forcing those who want a breezier time to play as a specific character, though..? Nah, that ain't it.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-my-daughter-made-me-realise-that-mario-wonders-difficulty-options-need-work]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Without a doubt, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024 was a solid year</a> for <strong>shooter games</strong> thanks to releases like Helldivers 2, Space Marine 2, STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, and Marvel Rivals, but 2025 can be argued to be even superior now that the calendar is wrapping up.</p>



<p>From medieval melee-infused demon slaying to post-apocalyptic extraction PvPvE mayhem, the shooter landscape has thrived with innovation, technical excellence, and heart-pounding gameplay that demands skill and strategy in equal measure, propelling the genre to new heights.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/DTDA_Key_Art-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-doom-the-dark-ages-8-5">DOOM: The Dark Ages (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-the-dark-ages-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8.5</a>)</h2>



<p>id Software has never been a studio content with resting on laurels, and DOOM: The Dark Ages proves that the legendary franchise still has a lot to offer. The Texas-based studio decided to take players back chronologically, with the events taking place before either 2016's reboot or 2020's DOOM Eternal. Moreover, the setting is vastly changed: the Slayer fights in the techno-medieval world of Argent D'Nur, so the developers reimagined him as a heavily armored warrior. This, in turn, led them to modify the pacing from the relentless, ever-forward-pushing gameplay of Eternal into a slower, more deliberate action experience that relies heavily on the new shield mechanics. </p>



<p>Players can deploy a Shield Saw to parry incoming demon attacks, then either riposte with a melee strike or unleash a charging bash attack to close distances. What makes this system brilliant is that, while inevitably slowing down the combat slightly compared to the previous entry, it remains balanced in a way that forces players to stay in constant motion, thus adhering to the franchise's core formula.</p>



<p>Melee combat also received a complete overhaul with three distinct options: brutal punch combos, a devastating hammer attack, and an armor-shattering flail. All these are genuine tactical choices: ammunition is obtained through successful melee executions, creating a direct link between close-quarters and ranged combat that highlights good decision-making throughout firefights. Finally, DOOM: The Dark Ages features more variety than the series' previous shooter games, thanks to the interspersed mech segments and dragon-riding sequences, which added some perfectly fitting epic setpieces to the game.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/battlefield-6-art-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-8-5">Battlefield 6 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8.5</a>)</h2>



<p>Battlefield 6 doesn't just return to the franchise's core identity; it doubles down on the philosophy that made the series legendary in the first place: player-driven destruction and large-scale environmental storytelling. After the mixed reception of Battlefield V and the sheer debacle of Battlefield 2042, Electronic Arts and the teams at Battlefield Studios desperately needed a win. To achieve it, they went back to basics and focused on what fans have always loved about this shooter games franchise. </p>



<p>It could be argued that Battlefield 6 doesn't really include any major innovations, but it didn't need to. The developers just had to bring their A-game to all areas of the game, which they did, starting with the saga's most refined gunplay mechanics to date. Overhauled weapon behavior, revised recoil patterns, and tactile feedback provide a highly satisfying shooting experience that rewards precision without being too hardcore. Every shot, every movement input feels intentional and responsive, especially when played with a DualSense Controller, where Haptic Feedback and Adaptive Triggers elevate immersion (though you might want to turn them off in the settings when playing in truly competitive matches).</p>



<p>The Tactical Destruction system is also back, allowing squads to weaponize their surroundings in ways that directly impact gameplay outcomes. Collapsing a ceiling onto an enemy squad, demolishing cover to create new attacking opportunities, or using vehicle-as-wrecking-ball tactics are all viable choices depending on the situation. Furthermore, the developers demonstrated <span><a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-why-battlefield-6-doesnt-have-levolution/" target="_blank">that they had learned their lesson from the limitless destruction featured in Battlefield 4's Levolution</a>, as letting players turn entire buildings to dust ultimately harms gameplay; therefore,</span> they removed that option in BF6.</p>



<p>Ultimately, fans vote with their wallets, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-battlefield-6-eu-launch-sales-and-black-ops-6-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there's no question that they chose Battlefield 6 this year over Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>. The former, <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-top-new-2025-games-by-players" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Alinea Analytics estimates</a>, is the most popular new game released in 2026, having registered over 23.8 million players across all platforms as of November 20.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/ARC-Raiders-Keyart-scaled-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-9">ARC Raiders (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/arc-raiders-review-speak-softly-and-carry-a-wolfpack/">9</a>)</h2>



<p>Whereas Battlefield 6 was by far the most hyped shooter game going into 2025, ARC Raiders didn't really have a similar level of anticipation, especially after the middling reception of the studio's first game release, the arena FPS The Finals. The launch of ARC Raiders was a veritable revelation in the already crowded subgenre of the extraction shooter. Originally, the game was supposed to be a free-to-play co-op (PvE only) shooter. However, Embark decided to change it to a premium PvPvE extraction shooter, even if that meant delaying the game. </p>



<p>This strategy change proved to be extremely effective. First of all, there aren't many third-person extraction shooters in the first place. The main distinction, though, is that ARC Raiders successfully straddles the line between PvP and PvE action, a key balancing act that many games in this subgenre struggle with. Rely too much on PvP, and you lose the cooperative soul that made early extractions appealing; focus too much on PvE, and the game suddenly lacks the unique unpredictability of human behavior.</p>



<p>The game features optional soloing (deliberately harder) but emphasizes 2-3 player squads, where communication is paramount for a team determined to extract with all the loot still in their pockets. The titular ARCs are machine invaders with individual behavioral profiles, weak points that matter, and physics-based destruction that affects their combat capability. Shooting a rotor off a drone causes momentum-dependent spin-outs; removing additional armor sends them careening into environmental hazards or other ARC units. </p>



<p>Like in all the best PvPvE games, the greatest moments in ARC Raiders occur when the two elements suddenly mix, such as when two teams engaged in firefights over loot suddenly face roaming ARC reinforcements. Do they push the engagement and risk mutual destruction, or is it better to coordinate a temporary ceasefire via voice chat against the common machine threat? These dynamic situations are the true reason players keep coming back to it. </p>



<p>ARC Raiders was a smash hit for Embark Studios and Nexon, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-reportedly-best-selling-game-on-steam-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">beating all other games this November on Steam's best-selling chart</a> and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-was-2025-most-searched-videogame-on-google-gta-vi-only-7th/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">becoming Google's most searched videogame of the year</a>. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/borderlands-4-14saz.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</h2>



<p>After the narrative missteps of Borderlands 3, Gearbox sought to return to its roots with grounded tone, apocalyptic humor, and mechanical depth. </p>



<p>Arguably, the game's most noticeable improvement is the movement overhaul. Traditional double-jumps, dashes, and weapon-swap speed have been replaced with an extensive traversal toolkit: gliding, mid-air hovering, grappling hooks for both exploration and combat, and dodge-rolls for evasion. Each traversal option serves specific tactical purposes: the hover enables mid-air shots while keeping momentum; the grapple accelerates repositioning; the dash provides split-second emergency maneuvers. Ahead of the launch, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-is-a-bigger-evolution-than-borderlands-3-says-gearbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">described this</a> as the most significant franchise evolution yet. It has never been more fun to move around in Borderlands, that's for damn sure, and the gunplay itself is still as brilliant as ever, ensuring that the new game can be considered among the best shooter games in this area.</p>



<p>The Licensed Parts System elevates the loot loop. Weapons are now composed of manufacturer-agnostic components, so that an assault rifle might sport Maliwan elemental parts, a Torgue magazine, and Hyperion shielding. Rarity directly correlates with component variety, making the hunt for specific part combinations as compelling as chasing rarity. </p>



<p>The four Vault Hunters feature ability sets that meaningfully diverge in playstyles. Vex, the Siren, conjures manifestations to aid in battle; Rafa, the Exo-Soldier, crafts on-the-fly tools like armor-piercing blades. Choosing and specializing the character is, however, only the beginning of build crafting. The existence of several secondary gear systems (Rep Kits offering revives/combat buffs, Ordnances providing cooldown heavy weapons, Enhancements replacing Artifacts) provides plenty of room for loadout variety.</p>



<p>Multiplayer has been significantly streamlined. The improved lobby system, crossplay infrastructure, the return of split-screen couch co-op (albeit only on consoles), and instance-based loot (meaning that every player receives their own drops) provided features that the community had long requested. The dynamic difficulty scaling lets friends play together even if their respective characters are at vastly different power levels. Finally, the ability to fast travel to a teammate eliminates the tedious "someone got lost" moments that plagued previous entries.</p>



<p>The main criticism levied at Borderlands 4 at launch was its performance, particularly on the PC platform, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-boss-borderlands-4-sales-softer-than-expected-poor-pc-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">led to 'slightly softer' sales</a> than the parent company, Take-Two, would have liked. However, the game has since received several patches <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-october-23-patch-performance-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to improve PC performance</a>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Metal-Eden-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>







<p>By far the smallest game on this shortlist in terms of budget, Metal Eden, the new game from Reikon Games (the studio behind 2017's <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/ruiner-you-played-yourself/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ruiner</a>), is a sci-fi FPS that weaponizes mobility, timing, and tactical resource management into something distinctly elegant. As an android named Aska in the artificial city of Moebius, players harvest Cores (consciousness containers) from mechanical enemies, then leverage those Cores for tactical advantage.</p>



<p>Core Ripping is the game's defining mechanic. Players charge their Multitool's Gravity Beam to extract Cores from unarmored enemies. Once extracted, Cores can either be consumed (providing temporary buffs to melee damage, mobility, or survivability) or thrown as explosives. This creates a feedback loop where killing efficiently generates resources that further enhance Aska's combat capability.</p>



<p>Beyond traditional movement, players unlock several traversal options: hovering via jet pack, grapple-rails for acceleration, wall-running, and eventually a "Ball Mode" that transforms Aska into a rolling projectile capable of dealing damage on its own. Combat, which also includes a bullet-time mechanic, is a thrilling experience that is never really frustrating, because enemy behavior is readable; telegraphed attacks provide decision windows for parries, dodges, or counterattacks. The excellent art direction drives Ruiner's aesthetics with neon-soaked environments, distinctive enemy designs, and visual clarity that never sacrifices style for utility.</p>



<p>With its average playthrough runtime of five and a half hours, Metal Eden is shorter than most recent single player shooter games, but it's also available at budget price. Moreover, every level is meaningful, teaching new mechanics or challenging the player's mastery of them. The boss encounters require an understanding of Aska's mobility toolkit and Core resource management, and the pacing is spot-on.</p>



<p>Metal Eden arrived without much fanfare, but it proved that a tight, focused shooter can succeed thanks to design clarity and innovation borne out of constraints.</p>
