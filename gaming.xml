            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-january-23-featuring-doom-south-of-midnight-and-a-surprise-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft just now <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1877354722916458694" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the date for this year's Xbox Developer Direct. The annual appointment to show some of this year's first-party games coming to PC and Xbox consoles will take place on January 23 at 10 AM Pacific Time / 1 PM Eastern Time / 6 PM UK / 7 PM Central European Time via the Xbox social channels.</p>
<p>Microsoft also unveiled the game lineup that fans can expect to see showcased at the event. By far the most anticipated of the bunch is id Software's DOOM: The Dark Ages. The eighth installment in the main series and the third following 2016's DOOM and 2020's DOOM Eternal will actually function as a prequel, demonstrating the origin story of the Slayer in a medieval inspired setting. PlayStation 5 users will want to tune in for this one, too, since it will be available on Sony's console as well from day one. The PC version will deliver the most advanced visuals, though, thanks to NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi-Frame Generation support and path traced graphics, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at CES 2025.</p>
<p>Another game featured in the Xbox Developer Direct is <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-compulsion-games-upcoming-deep-south-folktale-receives-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">South of Midnight</a>. This is a new IP from Compulsion Games, the Canadian studio behind Contrast and We Happy Few. South of Midnight features unique stop-motion-like graphics, a setting inspired by deep South folk tales, and an action/adventure framework that, however, puts the emphasis on narrative rather than gameplay. The game is <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-rumored-to-launch-in-march-2025-following-tga-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to launch in March, and if that's the case, it will definitely be announced during this broadcast.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Microsoft is also hosting a third-party game this year. It's the intriguing <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-launches-next-spring-with-an-incredible-voice-cast/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, a JRPG featuring a mix of turn-based combat and real-time elements in development at French studio Sandfall Interactive. The game will be available on Game Pass, which likely explains the inclusion here.</p>
<p>Last but not least, Microsoft has teased a 'visit to a surprise location to see another studio's brand new game'. It's really anyone's guess as to what it could be, but we're definitely intrigued.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/evo-2025-lineup-leaked</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/evo-2025-lineup-leaked-ahead-of-reveal-next-week.1077972/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/evo-2025-lineup-leaked<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The lineup for this year's Evo tournament appears to have been leaked just a week or so before the official announcement is due to take place.</p>

<p>Per a Nintendo Life <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/oops-evo-2025s-lineup-has-accidentally-been-revealed" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the official thumbnail for the upcoming livestream apparently gave away the games before seemingly being changed. It no longer features any of the participating games, instead simply depicting a plain "Evo Announcement Show" banner.</p>

<p>Obviously, this story will contain spoilers for the Evo 2025 lineup, so if you'd rather wait for the official broadcast, which is due to take place on January 14th at 8pm Eastern (that's 5pm Pacific), then make sure you don't read on. Here's an image of Evo 2024 so you can get out before it's too late!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/evo-2025-lineup-leaked-evo-2024.jpg?itok=_8bDRs1d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/evo-2025-lineup-leaked-evo-2024.jpg?itok=c8hKlVz8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is your last chance not to be spoiled on the Evo 2025 lineup.</figcaption></figure><p>Still here? Alright then. Here are the games that were apparently featured in the Evo 2025 livestream's thumbnail before they were hastily removed.</p>

<ul><li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/street-fighter-6" rel="nofollow"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a></li>
	<li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tekken-8" rel="nofollow"><em>Tekken 8</em></a></li>
	<li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/guilty-gear-strive" rel="nofollow"><em>Guilty Gear Strive</em></a></li>
	<li><em>Granblue Fantasy Versus: Rising</em></li>
	<li><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/under-night-in-birth-ii-sysceles" rel="nofollow"><em>Under Night In-Birth II Sys:Celes</em></a></li>
	<li><em>Mortal Kombat 1</em></li>
	<li><em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em></li>
	<li><em>Marvel vs. Capcom 2: New Age of Heroes</em></li>
</ul><p>After all that, it's a pretty straightforward lineup, featuring as it does several Evo mainstays; last year's competition also featured&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>, and a number of the other games on this list.</p>

<p>Two games have notably been subbed in, however:&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Marvel vs. Capcom 2&nbsp;</em>have been swapped in for&nbsp;<em>King of Fighters XV&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 3: 3rd Strike</em>.</p>

<p>While you should take this lineup with a small pinch of salt until the official announcement arrives, these games were featured in the Evo 2025 stream lineup before it was changed, so they're almost certainly the games in which you'll be watching competitors duke it out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339466/nintendo-switch-2-pc-gaming-handhelds-steamos<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The first Nintendo Switch basically had the road to itself, and Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/2/14787082/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review">instantly proved</a> just how awesome a hybrid console and handheld could be, leading to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150926/nintendo-expects-switch-to-become-its-best-selling-console-ever-this-year">massive success</a>. The next Switch is imminent, but it will launch into a world that’s packed with very capable handheld gaming PCs that could present an interesting challenge to Nintendo, especially following news from CES 2025.</p><p>Valve’s Steam Deck kicked off the handheld gaming PC push in large part because its Linux-based SteamOS makes playing your games just about as easy as it is on consoles. That’s why one of the biggest CES announcements is that Valve is going to let people install SteamOS on other handhelds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338405/valve-steamos-beta-other-handhelds-beyond-steam-deck">as soon as April</a>, potentially making the entire handheld PC gaming market a lot more appealing.</p><p>The first official non-Valve device with SteamOS is set to be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">Lenovo’s $499 Legion Go S</a>, which launches in May. But it’s not hard to imagine a near-term future where many other hardware makers announce their own SteamOS handhelds, meaning the magic of SteamOS might be available in all kinds of interesting devices very soon. (And, hopefully, the increased competition means Valve will make the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23884863/valve-steam-deck-2-refresh-upgrade-cpu-2025">eventual next Steam Deck</a> <em>really</em> good.)</p><div><figcaption><em>The Lenovo Legion Go S next to a Steam Deck OLED.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo by Antonio G. Di Benedetto / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>CES 2025 featured a bunch of other handheld gaming hardware, too, like the chonk that is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335423/acer-handheld-gaming-pc-nitro-blaze-8-11-specs-price">Acer’s Nitro Blaze 11</a>. It has a gigantic 10.95-inch screen, detachable controllers, and a kickstand. It’s huge! Intel and Tencent also made a handheld with an 11-inch screen, and theirs <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337860/intel-brought-a-big-honking-stereo-3d-handheld-gaming-pc-to-ces-2025">has stereo 3D</a>. My colleague Sean Hollister finally got to see <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338654/i-finally-touched-the-msi-claw-8-ai-plus">the MSI Claw 8 AI Plus</a>. Razer made <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24336841/razer-handheld-dock-chroma-pc-remote-play-price-availability">a docking station</a> that works with handheld gaming PCs. And in a CES panel, Microsoft promised news about changes to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming">the handheld Windows experience</a> for later this year, which could improve things for people who already own Windows-based hardware.</p><p>That’s a lot of cool stuff! But Nintendo is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donkey_Kong_(character)#:~:text=In%20a%20match%20against%20boxing,is%20given%20at%20800%20pounds.">800-pound gorilla</a> in the room, and as interesting as all of the PC gaming hardware is, the Switch’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24150891/nintendo-switch-2-console-announcement-earnings-q4-2024">imminent</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025">successor</a> will almost certainly be a very compelling upgrade. The original Switch was released <em>nearly eight years ago</em>, so the successor will likely be much more powerful and will probably have splashy new games in marquee franchises like <em>Super Mario</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>. (I’d bet already-announced Switch games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23768041/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-direct-trailer"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24083767/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2025-launch-date"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a> will get some kind of boost on the next Switch, too.)</p><p>Right out of the gate, Nintendo’s new console will also have an enormous library. The company already announced its next console will be compatible with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24284745/switch-2-backward-compatibility-nintendo-online-preservation">original Switch games</a> — a catalog that includes many of the indie hits that are also some of the best games on handheld PCs.</p><p>Back in 2017, when the original Switch launched, there wasn’t anything like it. The Switch’s successor will compete in a much more crowded field and one that’s getting even more crowded after CES 2025. Hopefully, the competition means everyone makes better hardware and better games. It’s a great time for handhelds.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Transformers Reactivate gameplay leaked online after Splash Damage announced the game would be canceled.</p>



<p>Uploading by the X (formerly Twitter) account <a href="https://x.com/DpzLuna" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@DpzLuna</a>, six and half minutes of footage reveal what the game would have been like. According to the watermarks, the footage was captured on March 28, 2023. You can watch the gameplay below:</p>







<p>The footage shows the player driving around in a car and seamessly transforming into a transformer to battle enemies.</p>



<p>Just yesterday, Splash Damage announced that Transformers Reactivate would be canceled and that a number of roles at the company are at risk of redundancy. Splash Damage said the company would “refocus” on some of its other projects.</p>



<p>“While not being able to see the game through to release is painful, having to say goodbye to friends and colleagues hurts even more,” they said. “We’re now focused on doing everything we can to support them through this tough period, just as we are committed to caring for those who will stay with us as we build a stronger Splash Damage for the future.”</p>



<p>Transformers Reactivate was first announced on December 8, 2022, and little about the game has been heard since then.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear how many roles at Splash Damage have been affected, but Insider Gaming has contacted Splash Damage for comment.</p>



<p>What do you think of the Transformers Reactivate gameplay? Let us know in the comment, or join the discussion on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

                <p>Actor Jennifer Hale, who voices Commander Shepard in the Mass Effect series, has spoken up to share her thoughts on the upcoming Mass Effect TV series. She said in an interview that she's excited to see Mass Effect become a TV show and would love to be a part of it. She also offered a piece of advice to the team making the show that she believes could make the show even better.</p><p>"I never suppose to tell creators what to do. The only thing I must say about that TV series is I want to play! Any capacity, I will be there with bells on!" Hale told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effects-original-cast-should-return-for-the-tv-series-shepard-voice-actor-jennifer-hale-says" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer.</a></p><p>She went on to say that the producers would be "really smart" to try to involve as many of the original cast members as possible in the Mass Effect TV series. Hale said she'd love to see her colleagues show up in "cameos and Easter eggs" or even recurring and regular roles.</p><p>"I think that would be an absolutely genius move," she said. "The voice acting community are some of the most brilliant performers I've ever met… they're the most gifted, hard working, adept, skilled people I've ever met in my life in the acting field. So I'm ready for the smart production company that stops overlooking that gold mine. I fully volunteer to be on the show."</p><p>The Mass Effect TV show was announced in 2021 but was not going anywhere until November 2024, which is when Amazon MGM Studios announced that it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-series-first-revealed-in-2021-is-apparently-back-on-with-a-key-update/1100-6527637/" data-ref-id="1100-6527637">"officially in development."</a> A show being "in development" doesn't mean it'll ever get made, though. Anything can happen in Hollywood.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-series-first-revealed-in-2021-is-apparently-back-on-with-a-key-update/1100-6527637/" data-ref-id="1100-6527637">A report said</a> Daniel Casey (Fast &amp; Furious 9) is writing and executive producing the show, while EA's Michael Gamble is an executive producer as well. Ari Arad (Iron Man, Uncharted, upcoming Zelda movie) is an executive producer, too.</p><p>There are no plot details available as of yet for the Mass Effect show, but the main series follows the spacefaring events of Commander Shepard. A movie version of Mass Effect was planned at one point, but it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioware-on-why-the-mass-effect-movie-stalled-and-how-a-tv-show-might-be-better/1100-6493310/" data-ref-id="1100-6493310">never got off the ground.</a></p><p>BioWare veteran Mac Walters, who has since left the company, said in 2021 that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioware-on-why-the-mass-effect-movie-stalled-and-how-a-tv-show-might-be-better/1100-6493310/" data-ref-id="1100-6493310">Mass Effect TV show makes more sense than a film</a>.

            <p>
Microsoft will once again hold a Xbox Developer Direct to kick off the new year, with deep dives into a small selection of upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> titles.
</p>
<p>
Xbox's next livestream will begin at 6pm UK time (that's 1pm Eastern or 10am Pacific) on Thursday, 23rd January - that's a fortnight from today.
</p>
<p>
On the schedule will be a detailed look at Doom: The Dark Ages, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a>, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and a mystery fourth game from an unknown studio. Mysterious! 
</p>
<p>
Doom: The Dark Ages has been dubbed as an origin story for the series' iconic Doom Slayer from veteran developer id Software, and is set to launch for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S at some point in 2025. Will we get a date? It seems likely.
</p><p>South of Midnight, meanwhile, is the stylish-looking action-adventure from We Happy Few developer Compulsion Games,  set in a gothic fantasy American Deep South. It looks a treat, though also currently lacks a release date beyond "2025". Here's hoping we find out when exactly it'll arrive for PC and Xbox Series X/S very soon.</p>
<p>Next up, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. This is the dark fantasy RPG from French outfit Sandfall Interactive that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-fresh-take-on-rpg-traditions-could-revitalise-the-genre">we reckon has shades of Persona and Final Fantasy</a>, plus the vocal talents of Andy Serkis and Charlie Cox. Clair Obscur isn't an Xbox Game Studios title and is coming to PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S at some point this year.</p>
<p>And then there's that fourth game. Microsoft still has plenty on its 2025 release schedule that this could be - Fable, The Outer Wilds, even Avowed - which will be just a month away. But the secretive nature here suggests something that hasn't yet publicly been confirmed. It'll be interesting to see if internet rumours of an Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake bear any fruit.</p>
<p>Join us in a couple of weeks for Xbox Developer Direct, right here on Eurogamer, when we'll be reporting live.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-network-test-coming-next-month-to-consoles-only/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bandai Namco has announced that a network test for the upcoming standalone multiplayer game Elden Ring Nightreign will take place next month. Sign-ups will begin tomorrow <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/elden-ring-nightreign/network-test" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on this page</a>, but the test is for consoles (PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X) only, so if you're a PC player, you're currently out of luck.</p>
<p>Here's the brief description provided for the network test:</p>
<p><em>The network test is a preliminary verification test in which the selected testers play a portion of the game prior to the full game launch. Various technical verifications of online systems will be examined by conducting large-scale network load tests.</em></p>
<p>Elden Ring Nightreign was among the most surprising announcements <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> during last month's The Game Awards 2024 event. FromSoftware is crafting something they've never attempted before. While the foundation is obviously the award-winning Elden Ring, it is being greatly tweaked to deliver a unique multiplayer experience that takes some elements from the survival and even battle royale genres. Here's the official description shared in the press release:</p>
<p><em>Players must choose from eight unique characters, each with their own unique abilities and powerful Ultimates. Their journeys take them to Limveld, where they will have to make split-second decisions when it comes to combat and exploration in the face of a night cycle that shrinks the map with the coming Night’s Tide. At the end of each night, they will face a powerful boss and, if victorious, awaken to bigger challenges. Each session will culminate on the third night, when they must face off against the chosen Nightlord. Individuals can fight the night alone, but strength will come in numbers. Nightfarers must learn to cooperate to take down these challenges, combining their unique abilities together for an unparalleled experience in the ELDEN RING universe. All is not lost for those who fall in defeat; unsuccessful runs will grant players relics to allow them to customize and upgrade their characters tailored to their personal play styles.</em></p>
<p><em>In this condensed action RPG, players will never experience the same journey twice as enemies, rewards and Limveld itself are all ever shifting and evolving each session in the realm of the Nightlord. Defeating greater enemies and venturing into the more dangerous parts of the map will uncover more powerful weapons and greater Rune rewards. Find Sites of Grace to give each hero a chance to level up and gain crucial power. With each session-based adventure being akin to playing through an open-air dungeon, every journey provides an opportunity to grow lasting stat bonuses. Successful runs against the night bring players ever closer to defeating the realm of the Nightlord and unraveling the story behind each Hero in this parallel world.</em></p>
<p>Are you excited about checking out Elden Ring Nightreign in February?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/robocraft-2-canceled-as-developer-freejam-shuts-down.1077912/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/robocraft-2-canceled-freejam-shuts-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Robocraft 2&nbsp;</em>developer Freejam has announced that ongoing development on the game is no longer sustainable, and that the studio itself will also be closing its doors and sunsetting its other titles.</p>

<p>In a message on&nbsp;<em>Robocraft</em>'s official Discord server, Freejam's Rawxas says that "the current market conditions and the server costs required" to keep&nbsp;<em>Robocraft 2&nbsp;</em>running mean that the studio is unable to launch the game's 1.0 version or continue development.</p>

<p>As such, Freejam says it'll spend "some time" sunsetting&nbsp;<em>Robocraft 2</em>, as well as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/301520/Robocraft/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">its predecessor</a>, "over the coming weeks". The studio's cardboard survival game&nbsp;<em>CardLife&nbsp;</em>will also be sunsetted along with the two&nbsp;<em>Robocraft&nbsp;</em>games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/robocraft-2-canceled-vehicle.jpg?itok=S4AgP3u4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/robocraft-2-canceled-vehicle.jpg?itok=UxzM1zeP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Robocraft 2&nbsp;</em>is no more as of today.</figcaption></figure><p>The dismantling of Freejam's work has already begun; it's no longer possible to buy&nbsp;<em>Robocraft 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1991140/Robocraft_2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on the Steam store</a>, although the original game, which is free-to-play, remains available, as does&nbsp;<em>CardLife&nbsp;</em>(at time of writing).</p>

<p>It may also not come as a surprise that&nbsp;<em>Robocraft 2&nbsp;</em>is being sunsetted if you've played the game; it's currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1991140/Robocraft_2/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sitting at a Mostly Negative review rating</a> on Steam, with 1,760 players weighing in with their opinions.</p>

<p>Some negative reviews point to technical issues like an <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199588571283/recommended/1991140/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">inability to log in</a> or difficulty getting the game to run <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199127398025/recommended/1991140/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on certain platforms</a>, but others offer more <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198135029860/recommended/1991140/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in-depth critiques</a> of the game, suggesting it's failed to strike the same kind of chord that the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/301520/Robocraft/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">original&nbsp;<em>Robocraft&nbsp;</em>did</a>.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Robocraft 2&nbsp;</em>is (or was), it's an online-focused vehicular combat game in which you can create and deploy your own custom-created vehicles. Freejam says its game's "construction systems" allow players to create "a multitude of shapes at any scale".</p>

<p>Just this week,&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em>developer Rocksteady <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-end-of-2024" rel="nofollow">was reported to have laid off a number of its staff</a> at the end of last year, and other companies such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/thunderful-layoffs-development" rel="nofollow">Thunderful</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-employees-strike" rel="nofollow">Don't Nod</a>, and many others have also been hit by layoffs.</p>

<p>Bigger companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Sony</a> have been affected too, although that hasn't stopped the C-suites at these companies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">raking in</a> frankly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">embarrassing amounts of money</a> while they hemorrhage staff.</p>

            <p>One for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/return-of-the-obra-dinn">Obra Dinn</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-case-of-the-golden-idol">Golden Idol</a> fans, this, although also for anyone who just loves a gorgeous map of an alien environment. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/locator">Locator</a> is a detective <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzler</a> where you play an interstellar cartographer tasked with tracking down a missing archeologist named Abigail Lidari on an alien world. It takes inspiration from browser geography game <a href="https://www.geoguessr.com/">Geoguessr</a>. You’ll be studying sets of photos and comparing them with notes from Abigail’s journal, then pinpointing her location on a series of lovely maps.</p>

<p>After you’ve placed three pins, you’ll find out whether you’re correct or not, then move on to the next set as you follow Abigail’s trail. It starts out as a simple game of identifying landmarks, but soon evolves into a case of cross-referencing cryptic notes in her journal. But it really feels like a game about considering perspectives; trying to place yourself in Abigail’s shoes, and seeing the world the way she did. An early puzzle has you locate specific cyclopean statues in a cavernous alien tomb. Abigail has given her favourites names like Milton and Orville and drawn moustaches and glasses on diary sketches, which feels like exactly the sort of thing you’d do when completely isolated on a strange planet.</p>
<p>"Locator combines the spatial reasoning of Geoguessr with the logical deduction of detective games," reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3388650/Locator_Demo/">Steam page</a>, which also houses a demo. "Use constellations, alien architecture, wildlife, cryptic symbols, and even temperature to pinpoint the location of photos."</p>
<p>I love a good map, though as much for their place in language and metaphor as their presence as physical objects. One of my favourite neologisms is the concept of the ‘cartographer’s folly’ - also called paper towns, or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fictitious_entry">fictitious entries</a>. Copyright traps, effectively - bits of geographical fakery that cartographers can use to mark their work. Then there’s the Alfred Korzybski quote “the map is not the territory” - an always cogent reminder to not confuse semantics with reality. I’d like to see how Locator explores our empathy for Abigail when we only really know her through a model of a journey we’ve put together ourselves. No release date as yet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Back in November, relaxed garden puzzle game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/botany-manor">Botany Manor</a> was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gorgeous-horticultural-puzzler-botany-manor-comes-to-playstation-in-december">announced</a> as getting a belated launch for PlayStation 4 and PS5.
</p>
<p>
An impressive indie 3D puzzling effort, Botany Manor had already shone on PC, Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series X - including Xbox Game Pass - earlier in 2024. 
</p>
<p>
But in December, publisher Whitethorn Games issued an <a href="https://x.com/WhitethornGames/status/1868687621217473001">update</a> to say Botany Manor had hit a snag, and would now launch in the new year. Well, here we are - and today brings a fresh (and hopefully final) PlayStation launch date for the game: 28th January.

<p>I can wholeheartedly recommend Botany Manor, as one of the few games I actually got around to fully completing last year. You're given the keys to a National Trust-style estate that slowly opens up over time as you uncover mysteries and grow long-lost blooms through increasingly brain-teasing ways.
</p>
<p>But things never get too taxing, the game is relentlessly chilled out, and the game's gentle story offers just enough of a glimpse at life within its Victorian-era surroundings to keep you intrigued.</p>
<p>
"Perhaps an afternoon in Botany Manor's company will inflame your own curiosity for nature," Matt wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/botany-manor-review">Eurogamer's Botany Manor review</a> last year. "Or perhaps you'll simply be content to explore its sun-dabbled corners, solve its few clever puzzles, and enjoy the timeless pleasures of an enchanting summer's day stroll."

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-renders-based-on-new-information-from-proven-tech-leaker-provide-updated-look-at-system%E2%80%99s-design-controllers.1077864/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-renders-tech-leaker/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new look at the yet-to-be-officially revealed Nintendo Switch 2 has come today, thanks to the renders put together by a well-known tech leaker.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/OnLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OnLeaks</a>, who has previously put together accurate renders for tech products before their official reveal, created these new renders on behalf of <a href="https://www.91mobiles.com/hub/nintendo-switch-2-design-renders-exclusive/">91mobiles</a> which are based on new data, including the supposed dimensions of the real console. A 360-degree video, which can be watched below, provides another great look at the system, the U-shaped kickstand, and the Joy-Con controllers.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 | First Look | 360 Degree Video | Exclusive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KAbXItlrUnQ?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Besides the new look at the console's design provided by OnLeaks' renders and 360-degree video, today we have learned that the Nintendo Switch 2 may indeed use the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-appears-to-be-using-microsd-express-format/">microSD Express format</a> as <a href="https://wccftech.com/switch-2-storage-samsung-sd-express-micrso-sd-cards-800-mb-s/">previously rumored</a>. This new standard can reach a sequential read speed of up to 800MB/s, four times faster than traditional UHS-1 memory cards, whose read speed is capped at 200 MB/s. The console adopting this new standard is hardly surprising, considering how multiplatform games are nowadays developed with the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S SSDs.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed, but with leaks coming in daily, there's no doubt that the reveal is imminent. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <p>In November last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-is-officially-getting-a-tv-adaptation-at-amazon">Amazon officially announced a Mass Effect TV show</a> is in development. Now, voice actor Jennifer Hale told Eurogamer she'd love to be part of it and believes the original cast should be involved too.</p>
<p>"You will always get a yes vote from me on Shepard coming back in any form," said Hale. "That was such a gift, and it's a gift I will always be extremely joyful to receive."</p>
<p>Of course, developing such a choice-driven narrative into a singular TV series would have consequences. For starters, would Shepard be male or female?</p>

<p>"I never suppose to tell creators what to do," said Hale. "The only thing I must say about that TV series is I want to play! Any capacity, I will be there with bells on!"</p>
<p>Hale confirmed she'd prefer FemShep to be canon in the show (obviously!), but she's also keen for the rest of the game's cast to join in some capacity.</p>
<p>"I think they'd be really smart to pull as much of the original cast into the show in cameos and Easter eggs and recurring and regular [roles] as possible," she said. "I think that would be an absolutely genius move."</p><p>She continued: "The voice acting community are some of the most brilliant performers I've ever met… they're the most gifted, hard working, adept, skilled people I've ever met in my life in the acting field. So I'm ready for the smart production company that stops overlooking that gold mine. I fully volunteer to be on the show."</p>
<p>What's more, there's a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> game in development that's set to continue the story of the original trilogy, with at least <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-development-proceeding-very-well-as-bioware-issues-fresh-tease">one fan-favourite character returning</a>. But would Hale like to see Shepard also return?</p>
<p>"I have no idea [what to expect]," she said, "except I'd love to be there. That's all I'm gonna say. Hey, team, hey, team, wherever you are in any capacity, I'd love to be there!"</p>
<p>Over the weekend, BioWare project director Michael Gamble responded to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-fans-think-this-official-image-hints-that-paragonrenegade-system-is-absolutely-returning">discussion of the Paragon/Renegade morality system</a>, with many fans speculating it will return in the next game.</p>
<p>For more from Jennifer Hale, Eurogamer discussed with her the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/negotiations-over-ai-are-still-holding-up-video-game-development-mass-effects-jennifer-hale-explains-why">SAG-AFTRA strike and risk of AI to performers</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-4k-improved-performance/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>New Monster Hunter Wilds footage was shared online, providing a new look at the upcoming entry in the series, which will launch next month on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>The new 4K resolution footage, which was shared online by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKy1dAqELo0zrOtPkf0eTMw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IGN</a>, focuses on Ajarakan and Rompopolo, which will be found in the Oilwell Basin, an area that was previously announced but that was never shown in any previous footage. Besides highlighting how these two monsters will challenge players, the new footage also shows considerably improved performance over the open beta conducted last October, although it hasn't been specified which version of the game was used to capture the footage.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds: 9 Minutes of Ajarakan Oilwell Basin Gameplay (4K)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aX0wxnX6WDI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Unfortunately, the performance improvements showcased in the new Monster Hunter Wilds footage will not be present in the<a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-getting-a-second-open-beta-test-soon/"> second open beta</a>, which will be held in two rounds in the first two weeks of February. This new testing version will essentially be identical to the first one, with the addition of some content, such as the returning monster Gypceros.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on February 28th. You can learn more about one of the most promising games launching this year in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gamescom-preview/">Gamescom 2024 hands-on preview</a>.</p>
<p><em>While Monster Hunter Wilds doesn't revolutionize the series' formula in any way, it competently continues to smooth out some of the formula's rough edges to present a more engaging experience. This little taste of the experience left me hungering for more, and I really cannot wait to see what surprises the game has in store for hunters when it launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S next year.</em></p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> Season 1 is about to begin, adding the Fantastic Four to the free-to-play hero shooter’s roster so that they can beat up Dracula, who has swamped the Earth in eternal night. It launches January 10th at 1 am PT / 4 am ET / 9 am GMT, and developers NetEase are paving the way in the traditional manner by rebalancing the character line-up so as to simultaneously win the adoration of certain player groups, while plunging others into apoplectic fury.</p>
<p>Do you like running rampage as Hela, goddess of death? Was that <em>you</em> who shot me full of crows on Klyntar last night? Well, how does 25 points off your base health suit you? Yeah, that’s what I thought. Screw you too.</p><!--more-->
<p>Hela is one of many who’ve succumbed to the nerf. NetEase’s Thanos-style fingersnap has also made the Incredible Hulk less incredible: according to the full patch notes, it drops the Indestructible Guard gamma shield value for Hero Hulk from 250 to 200. Somewhat counter-intuitively, HawkEye has undergone a rework to make him less effective with a bow - “decreasing the medium-long range damage capability, reducing the threatening combat radius, and slightly improving the close combat resistance for the avenging archer”.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-panther">Black Panther</a>’s survivability has also been cut: the patch reduces “the additional health provided to self after refreshing Vibranium Marks with Spirit Rend from 40 to 30, and the upper limit of additional health provided from 120 to 75.”</p>
<p>For every loser there is at least one winner, naturally. Black Widow “was very much in need of optimization when evaluating the release experience of her abilities as well as a slightly increase to the threat of her ultimate ability.” Her Edge Dancer, Fleet Foot and Electro-Plasma Explosion abilities have all been juiced up.</p><p>In other news, Sea king Namor is better at throwing eggs, and Squirrel Girl’s Squirrel Tsunami has undergone a sinister evolution. The tsunami’s component squirrels will now “rush towards the nearest enemy after bouncing instead of bouncing randomly”, though the tsunami’s overall health has been halved. No longer shall the laws of chance save you from being set upon by berserking nutcrackers. These are dreadful times indeed. </p>
<p>You can read the full patch notes <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20250108/41548_1205103.html">here</a>. Again, all this is a warm-up for Season 1, which introduces noble stretchyman Mr Fantastic, see-through lady Invisible Woman, prancing fireboy Human Torch, and grouchy rockdude The Thing. They’ll arrive as part of a season storyline in which Dr Doom and Dracula have conspired to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjdMYyjnmks">switch off the sun</a>, Mr Burns presumably being unavailable for recruitment at the time. Leaks further suggest that robonemesis Ultron is on the way to the line-up too.</p>
<p>Here’s a press release rundown:</p>
<blockquote><p>Darkness engulfs New York as the Timestream Entanglement leaves Doctor Strange trapped in the Entangled Astral Plane, scattering the Darkhold pages. Dracula and Doctor Doom disrupt the moon’s orbit, plunging the city into eternal night and unleashing an army of vampiric creatures. With the world on the brink, the Fantastic Four join forces with iconic Marvel heroes, standing together in the epic battle to break the mystical darkness with science. Ignite the battle against Dracula with the Fantastic Four in Marvel Rivals! </p></blockquote>
<p>Marvel Rivals continues to steam up Steam, ranking at 6th most played at the time of this article's publication. Our Ed Thorn was ambivalent in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvel-rivals-review">his season 0 launch review</a>, summarising it as “like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>, if Overwatch was overcomplex and frequented Comic Con”. He found much to like about the abilities and presentation, but argued that the spread of somewhat interchangeable hero designs transformed matches into “slightly formless blenders”. Are you still playing?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Over the Christmas break, I took a brief hiatus from reporting on every time a Total War developer breathes or spills tea on their shirt. The year ended, the world did not, and no Thanquol DLC was announced, but I did miss what I reckon is the strongest hint they’ve yet freely given that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer">Total War: Warhammer</a> 40,000 is both real and due an announcement very soon.

<p>(I want to use the phrase "here’s the skinny" more. I also want one of those little hats with the band for the card that says ‘press’ on it. These aren’t the same as ‘pressman’s hats’, which were made out of folded newspaper to protect print workers from detritus. <a href="https://deafprinters.com/files/fullsize/8f474c90d0294a96c4c9eb1efb1f11ee.jpg">Here’s some instructions on how to make one</a>. I wonder what the online media equivalent is? Tinfoil lined with redundancy letters, probably. Speaking of tinfoil…)</p>
<blockquote><p>If a future Total War game, thematically, requires blood then we will include it within the base game without the need for a separate purchase. This might mean an increase in our age ratings for future titles and how we potentially market our games, but we want the franchise to be as thrilling, immersive and authentic as possible.</p></blockquote>
<p>For context, Total War games have long shipped without blood effects, dismemberment, and other such violences, instead selling optional DLC ‘blood packs’ for a few pounds or dollars. The company line on this has always been that it’s to ensure a lower age rating, although much of the community has maintained it’s a case of squeezing out some extra revenue. Personally, I’ve always been torn. Extra animation work is naturally development work, but the line between what development work counts as ‘extra’ enough to merit charging separately seems mainly a matter of good faith: a case of ‘we’ll know where the line is when someone crosses it’.</p><p>Anyway, the blog statement feels to me about as close as you can get to saying “We’re making 40k” without actually saying it, although I understand how that might sound spurious if you don’t follow the company closely. The first thing I’d point to is that if CA have made the decision to potentially lose customers or otherwise limit sales by accepting a higher age rating, then they’ve likely got a game on their hands they’re confident will sell gangbusters regardless. Between the comparatively mainstream success of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-and-amazon-finalize-deal-for-henry-cavills-warhammer-40000-cinematic-universe-but-production-may-take-a-number-of-years">Henry Cavill’s 40k project with Amazon</a>, 40k currently feels like a safer, more culturally relevant bet, more so than even Lord Of The Rings or Star Wars - settings largely coasting on nostalgia rather than recent successes, outliers like Andor aside.</p>
<p>To me, CA dangling the prospect of bloodier Total War games that are marketed to an older audience is about as close as you can get to saying "We’re making 40k" without actually saying it. Historical Total Wars can reasonably exist in a sort of sterile quasi-documentary framing, suitable for hogging good, Christian CPUs and basing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Commanders">old British game shows</a> around. But the idea of a game <em>thematically requiring</em> blood feels like a strong hint. It doesn’t rule out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rumours-point-to-total-war-star-wars-in-the-works-at-creative-assembly">Total Star Wars</a> as the next fantasy offering, but I don’t think it's referring to Star Wars either, a setting largely able to get by on laser burns and characters dramatically falling off things. Lord Of The Rings gets by on characters dramatically climbing up things, and also needs a good dose of gore if they go with Peter Jackson’s lingering splatter tendencies. But I’d say the only setting that is both a likely contender for an entry at all, and absolutely requires gore to even be recognisable, is 40k.</p>
<p>Not that the blog would be enough to go on in isolation, but it does feel significant in the context of CA’s increasingly collaborative relationship with Games Workshop. The Khorne section of the latest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a> DLC marked the first appearance of units from Warhammer Fantasy’s End Times period in the series, but even as far back as the the Vampire Coast DLC, we got an original character - not to mention Kislev and Grand Cathay. I think it’s fair to say that GW view CA’s work as not just an interpretation of their own worlds, but an extension, and that they'd trust this developer with the keys to the 41st Millennium - not that they've been incredibly picky in the past.</p>
<p>Also, Total Warhammer 40k will make all the money in the world. I’m not a business analyst but I did get out a tenner from the cash machine several months ago for emergencies and it’s still in my wallet, so I think I know a thing or two about finance. After <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyenas">Hyenas</a>, I reckon Creative Assembly would quite like all the money in the world.</p><p>So that’s the making of the thing, how about the timeline? Well, it does sound like we’ll see a couple of bigger announcements this year. "We hope to unveil some new projects too - we’ll share more when we’re ready at the tail-end of next year," reads the blog.</p>
<p>So, there’s my reasoning, pick it apart at your leisure. Elsewhere in the blog, vice president of Total War (banger title) Roger Collum also announces that Shadows Of Change will be getting divided into three parts to match the subsequent expansions, and that Total War will be ditching the launcher. This last point sounds superfluous or maybe even just a bad idea, since it works well as a mod manager, but this does follow the trend of companies like Ubisoft no longer pushing their own storefronts and such in favour of offering a seamless, Steam-ful experience. Oh, and there’s a bloody Kislev rework coming too. Huzzah!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> creator Ken Levine wanted developer Irrational Games to continue, and didn't expect publisher Take-Two to shut it down.</p>
<p>In 2014 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ken-levine-steps-away-from-bioshock-to-create-something-new">Levine announced he was "winding down" the studio</a> to focus on a "different kind of game", meaning all but 15 Irrational employees were laid off.</p>
<p>Now, in an interview with Edge Magazine (thanks <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/bioshock-infinite-may-not-have-been-the-thing-i-wanted-but-that-doesnt-necessarily-mean-it-wasnt-the-thing-the-audience-wanted-ken-levine-talks-edge-through-his-collected-works/">GamesRadar</a>), Levine has stated his intention was for Irrational to continue but the decision to close was "made at a corporate level".</p>

<p>Levine discussed his time at Irrational following the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a> and how this led to him parting ways with the studio.</p>
<p>"The closure of Irrational was complicated," he said. "I felt out of my depth in the role. You're this creative person, and all of a sudden, as your vision increases of what you want to do, you have to become a manager, in a way that you don't necessarily have any training or skill in. My mental health was a mess during Infinite. I was stressed out, a lot of personal things were going on in my life at the time, and then my parents both died. I just couldn't do it any more, and I didn't think I had the team's confidence."</p>
<p>That's when he left, leaving the studio in the hands of Take-Two.</p>
<p>"So my intention was to go and say, 'Look, I just need to go start a new thing, and Irrational should continue'," he said. "That's why I didn't maintain the name Irrational. I thought they were going to continue. But it wasn't my company - I sold the company, so I worked for Take-Two, and the studio was theirs.</p><p>"The decision was made at a corporate level that they didn't think they should continue with the studio as a going concern. My feeling was that it probably would have made sense. Take-Two did a BioShock remaster - that would have been a good title for Irrational to get their head around, build a new creative director structure, and then build off of that once they had the confidence to do the next BioShock game. I don't think I was in any state to be a good leader for the team."</p>
<p>Levine described trying to make the studio closure "the least painful layoff we could possibly do", but he didn't feel comfortable leading the team when his next project would have a long period of research and development. "The problem is - and you see this problem with big studios - what do you do with 300 people when you're going to have a multiple-year R&amp;D project?" he said.</p>
<p>Still, a "good chunk" of laid off developers returned to work on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-bioshock-developer-ramping-up">yet-to-be-revealed next BioShock game</a>.</p>
<p>Levine, meanwhile, will this year release Judas with his new studio Ghost Story Games, which he previously described as being <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-finally-explains-judas-narrative-lego-concept">built from "narrative Lego"</a>.</p>
<p>Levine also discussed with Edge the development of BioShock Infinite, which he pushed to make more action-oriented. That led to the Sky-Lines - something he would have developed further in a potential sequel.</p>
<p>"The problem was that the Sky-Lines were so expensive to build that we couldn't build enough space to support the feature," he said. "The team did a great job of bringing that feature to life - there was just not enough of it in the game for it to really land.</p><p>"If we had done a sequel to Infinite, I think I would have spent more time on that. That thing was built on Unreal Engine 3, which is not an outdoor engine. Sky-Lines were a lot of spit and chewing gum and prayers. Players would be surprised how much of games are put together with spit and chewing gum - even the best ones that have worked really well."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creator-ken-levines-judas-glimpsed-again">Judas was last seen at Sony's PlayStation State of Play this time last year</a> and is yet to receive a firm release date beyond 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-appears-to-be-using-microsd-express-format/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, the daily Nintendo Switch 2 rumor mill is focused on a screenshot reportedly grabbed by a GameStop employee from the internal list of upcoming product releases. The screen grab, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1hx0wge/switch_2_skus_found_in_system_today/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> a few hours ago on the Switch subreddit, shows a JoyCon Charger Grip for the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>The most interesting tidbit is, however, the confirmation that the new console will use Samsung's microSD Express format. As you can see in the screenshot, the internal SKU list shows Switch 2 microSD cards of 256GB and 512GB cuts, priced at $49.99 and $84.99, respectively.</p>
<blockquote><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1hx0wge/switch_2_skus_found_in_system_today/">Switch 2 SKU’s found in system today!!</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Opposite-Chemistry96/">u/Opposite-Chemistry96</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/">Switch</a></p></blockquote>

<p>We first&nbsp;<span><a href="https://wccftech.com/switch-2-storage-samsung-sd-express-micrso-sd-cards-800-mb-s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported in February 2024</a> that the Nintendo Switch 2 might use the microSD Express format. Back then, Samsung boasted that this was an industry-first product whose development resulted from</span> a collaboration with a mysterious 'customer' to create a custom product. That product might very well be the Nintendo Switch 2 game cards.</p>
<p>Hangu Sohn, Vice President of the Memory Brand Product Biz Team at Samsung Electronics, said at the time:</p>
<p><em>With our two new microSD cards, Samsung has provided effective solutions to address the growing demands of mobile computing and on-device AI. Despite their tiny size, these memory cards deliver powerful SSD-like performance and capacity to help users get more out of demanding modern and future applications.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, Samsung's microSD Express cards can reach a sequential read speed of up to 800MB/s, or 1.4 times faster than SATA SSDs (which can reach up to 560 MB/s) and more than four times faster compared to traditional UHS-1 memory cards (capped at 200 MB/s).</p>
<p>Nowadays, games require an SSD, whether on consoles or PCs, due to the high data streaming needs of large virtual worlds. While the Nintendo Switch 2 won't focus on high-end technical advancements, it couldn't be left behind if it wanted to get as many ports as possible from third-party developers.</p>
<p>It's another small piece in the Switch 2 puzzle. Nintendo is still holding off on the official reveal, but they promised it will happen within this quarter.</p>

            <p>
Disastrous fires burning across multiple districts of Los Angeles have shut down production across Hollywood, impacting the filming of Fallout season 2 and a raft of other projects.
</p>
<p>
Five people have so far been confirmed to have died and more than 130,000 have been evacuated as the city's worst ever wildfires continue to spread.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/c5y81zyp1ext">BBC News</a> reported today that the famous Sunset Boulevard now lies "in ruins", as flames approach the city's iconic Hollywood sign.
</p>
<p>
Last night, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/la-fires-halt-production-fallout-greys-anatomy-1236269978/">Variety</a> reported on the impact of the fires on LA's production industry, with all major studios suspending work. 
</p>
<p>
Amazon's Fallout season 2 had been due to film within the Santa Clarita area this week.
</p>
<p>
NBCUniversal, CBS, Disney and Warner Bros. have also shut down their studios, impacting the filming of other shows such as Hacks, Ted, Suits: LA, NCIS, Grey's Anatomy and the Jimmy Kimmel Live show.
</p>
<p>
While in most cases there is no immediate threat to the studios themselves, the LA Fire Department has revoked all filming permits due to air quality being deemed dangerous to health, and the need to keep roads open for emergency vehicles. 
</p>
<p>
This week's disaster has prompted criticism of LA's mayor Karen Bass, who recent cut the city's fire department budget, and renewed calls for a greater focus on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-were-turning-our-attention-to-gaming-and-the-climate-crisis">impacts of climate change</a>.
</p>
<p>
Production on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-filming-begins-a-lot-sooner-than-expected">Fallout's second season began in November</a>, and was due to resume this week after a filming break over Christmas. 
</p>
<p>
Fallout's first season was a huge hit when it aired last year, with more than 65 million viewers in its first 16 days - Amazon's second-biggest launch ever, behind The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power. A week after its debut, Amazon quickly announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-show-officially-renewed-for-second-season">the series would return for more episodes</a>.
