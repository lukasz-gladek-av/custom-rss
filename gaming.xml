            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/descenders-next-2025-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher No More Robots and developer RageSquid have announced&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next</em>, a followup to 2019's&nbsp;<em>Descenders&nbsp;</em>that's aiming to be "the only extreme sports game you'll ever need".</p>
<p>Set to launch in 2025 on PC and as a day-one Game Pass release,&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>won't just revolve around mountain biking like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/descenders">its predecessor</a>. Instead, it'll start with "a couple of deeply-crafted sports", with the developers adding more sports for as long as players stick around.</p>
<p>Initially, the focus in&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>will be on boarding sports, so you'll be able to indulge in some snowboarding and mountainboarding action. RageSquid and No More Robots say both sports will handle "completely different[ly]", too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/descenders-next-pc-game-pass-2025-snowboarding.jpg?itok=rTnR0Ufl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/descenders-next-pc-game-pass-2025-snowboarding.jpg?itok=l0-oYLe0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>is aiming high with a new mix of sports.</figcaption></figure><p>The two studios are promising that&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>will be "as meaty as&nbsp;<em>Descenders</em>" at launch; it'll feature online multiplayer, "tons of tricks and grinds", and "multiple huge biomes".</p>
<p>It's not clear whether or not the game will pursue the same mixture of procedural and hand-crafted content that the first game featured.</p>
<p>In a press release, No More Robots and RageSquid say&nbsp;<em>Next&nbsp;</em>will offer "a more natural experience" which will feature "procedural off-piste mountains" transitioning into "tight, winding parks and vistas". It sounds to me like there won't be much in the way of hand-crafted areas to explore, but we'll have to see.</p>
<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>to see if it'll be your extreme cup of tea right here.</p>

<p>Not only will&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>feature plenty of biomes to explore, but it'll also offer a range of objectives to complete, including races, trick challenges, and "scavenger hunts".</p>
<p>Electronic music label Monstercat, which has handled soundtracks for games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/beat-saber"><em>Beat Saber</em></a>, will provide the soundtrack, and No More Robots and RageSquid describe&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next</em>'s music as "absolutely banging".</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>when it launches on Steam and PC Game Pass sometime next year. Stay tuned for more info.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-disney-dreamlight-valley-roadmap-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gameloft has revealed a brand new&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley&nbsp;</em>roadmap for the remainder of 2024, and it's promising iconic characters from big Disney properties, plus new updates and more.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://disneydreamlightvalley.com/news/ValleyVignette" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on the game's official website</a> titled "Valley Vignette: What's Next for&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em>", Gameloft breaks down what's coming to the cozy life sim between now and the end of 2024.</p>
<p>First up, later this month,&nbsp;<em>The Princess and the Frog</em>'s Tiana comes to the Valley, bringing "culinary delights" with her. This month also marks the arrival of a new paid expansion pack for&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em>, and it's themed around stopping Jafar from carrying out his evil schemes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-dreamlight-valley-roadmap-2024-full.jpg?itok=scTXcf7m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-dreamlight-valley-roadmap-2024-full.jpg?itok=VGG0p42N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Disney Dreamlight Valley&nbsp;</em>is getting lots of new stuff between now and the end of the year.</figcaption></figure><p>In October, a new update will arrive that brings some important quality-of-life updates, but it'll also introduce the chance to work alongside&nbsp;<em>The Lion King</em>'s Timon and Pumbaa to stop an "invasion of Night Mites".</p>
<p>Then, later in 2024, Gameloft will be airing a new Showcase, where you'll learn more about what's coming to&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley&nbsp;</em>for the rest of 2024, as well as what's happening throughout 2025.</p>
<p>One of the things that's being teased for the remainder of this year appears to be a&nbsp;<em>Nightmare Before Christmas&nbsp;</em>crossover; in the preview for "late 2024", the roadmap invites you to "stitch a new mystery together", and Sally's dress from the aforementioned movie can clearly be seen.</p>
<p>In the next year or so, Gameloft also says it'll be dedicating some time to improving some of&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em>'s features, including Photo Mode, decoration, wardrobe organization, and more. The game's next update will also add PlayStation crossplay at last.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-dreamlight-valley-roadmap-2024-ariel.jpg?itok=agK6gEZq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-dreamlight-valley-roadmap-2024-ariel.jpg?itok=0nv2ZZlA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Expect lots more fun Disney characters to make an appearance in&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley&nbsp;</em>over the next year or so.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em>, it's a cozy life sim that invites you to start a new life in the titular Valley, getting to know a raft of Disney characters and making friends with them as you do so.</p>
<p>Since the game launched back in 2022 (although its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disney-dreamlight-valley-10-release-date">1.0 release technically arrived last year</a>), new Disney characters from properties like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disney-dreamlight-valley-laugh-floor-update"><em>Monsters, Inc.</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disney-dreamlight-valley-april-update-brings-simba-nala-and-much-more"><em>The Lion King</em></a>, and many more have been added, and plenty of new activities and quality-of-life improvements have been introduced as well.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley&nbsp;</em>right now across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1401590/Disney_Dreamlight_Valley/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/disney-dreamlight-valley/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/disney-dreamlight-valley/9nsf0bgh8d86" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/disney-dreamlight-valley-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

            <p>
There's now a release date for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, the upcoming video game tie-in to the Emily Blunt-starring post-apocalyptic horror movie franchise. 
</p>
<p>
The Road Ahead, which looks to tell its own original story within the world of the franchise's three films (and counting), will launch for PC via Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 17th October. 
</p>
<p>
Fans of the film series will recognise its creepy alien antagonists are back, and fans of the excellent Alien Isolation have already been comparing The Road Ahead's gameplay favourably with that survival horror classic.

<p>
A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead was first announced back in 2021 as being in development at Stormind Games, the studio behind Remothered: Tormented Fathers. 
</p>
<p>It was then properly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-revealed-for-pc-and-consoles">revealed by publisher Saber Interactive back in June this year</a> with a new trailer.</p>
<p>
You play as Alex, an asthmatic college student trying to survive the end of the world with her boyfriend Martin, who must not to make any noise lest she alert any extra-terrestrial horrors. But aliens aren't the only problem - there's plenty of other threats to deal with in the ruins of civilisation - how very 2024.
</p>
<p>
One to keep a (quiet) eye on as the nights begin to draw in...

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fall-guys-makes-its-way-into-fortnite-with-fall-guys-islands/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Fall Guys has an <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-road-trip-fortnite-rocket-league/">official collaboration</a> with Fortnite that has been released today. In this collaboration, players can participate in brand-new maps called Fall Guys Islands. There are six Fall Guys Islands in total, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fall-guys-dives-into-fortnite" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all hand crafted by Mediatonic</a>. Three of these maps were also created in cooperation with Studio 568 and Spiral House.</p>
<p>Players can explore these colorful maps via the "Fall Guys" row in Discover. These maps include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Falling Up</li>
<li>Tumble Towers</li>
<li>Blunderdrome Blast</li>
<li>Hex-a-Gone Unlimited</li>
<li>Bean Circuit</li>
<li>Pegwin Pickup</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these curated maps, Fortnite Creators can also make their own Fall Guys Islands if they wish. The tools needed for these maps went live on July 23 in UEFN and Creative. There is also the potential for any of the maps made with the Fall Guys template to qualify for a place on the Fall Guys row in the Discover section.</p>
<p>In addition to Fall Guys Islands, there is a massive obstacle course coming to Fortnite. This obstacle course is called "Where We Fallin'" and will be available for players to participate in from now through August 15. The aim is to track down one of the several Bean Idols that are hidden throughout the Classy Courts. Once you interact with one, you'll transform into a Fall Guys bean and be able to participate in the obstacle course in the sky.</p>
<p>There are also "Where We Fallin'" quests that players can participate in to earn rewards. Per Battle Royale match, players have three attempts to set a time, but can only complete the obstacle course once per match. If you manage to complete the obstacle course in or under 120 seconds, you'll get your hands on some loot for the rest of the match.</p>
<p>If you've been playing Fortnite and wished you could see yourself as a Fall Guys bean, this collab will allow you to do just that. Your outfit will morph into a Fall Guys bean during the obstacle course, in the Lobby and Locker if you have a Fall Guys Island selected, as well as when you are roaming the Fall Guys Islands.</p>
<p>Depending on what outfit you have equipped will alter how your Fall Guys bean will look. Once you've completed the obstacle island or you are no longer on a Fall Guys Island, your outfit will revert back to normal. For those who are using outfits that don't belong to a default Fortnite character, your bean appearance will automatically transform into the default bean from Fall Guys.</p>

It’s a personal favorite location to farm as, once the enemies have been forcefully removed, there’s usually a lot of loot to sort through.

      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > No More Robots [19 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/no-more-robots">No More Robots</a> and developer <a title="Companies > RageSquid" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ragesquid">RageSquid</a> have announced <em><a title="Games > Descenders Next" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/descenders-next">Descenders Next</a></em>, a multiple extreme sports follow-up to the downhill biking game <em>Descenders</em>. It will launch first for <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,775 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,365 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [20,804 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2375530/Descenders_Next/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and Microsoft Store in 2025, as well as via <a title="Platforms > Xbox [24,483 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox">Xbox</a> Game Pass, followed by <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,587 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> and <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,013 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a> at a later date. A representative for No More Robots told <a title="Companies > Gematsu" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/gematsu">Gematsu</a> that while a Switch version is doubtful, it will likely appear on Nintendo’s next console. <span id="more-903732"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via No More Robots:</p><blockquote><p><em>Descenders Next</em> is the long-anticipated follow-up to downhill biking hit <em>Descenders</em>.</p><p><em>Descenders Next</em> will aim to become the only extreme <a title="Genres > Sports [562 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/sports">sports game</a> you’ll ever need, starting life with a couple of deeply-crafted sports, and slowly but surely adding more and more adrenaline-fueled activities over time.</p><p>Building on the success of <em>Descenders</em>—which has seen 30 million players since it launched six years ago—<em>Descenders Next</em> is the natural evolution of the original experience. We asked ourselves: Where do we go from <em>Descenders</em>? How do we deliver the same feel, the same sense of speed, but expand beyond mountain biking? From there, the idea of perfecting the fluidity of numerous sports was born.</p><p>When <em>Descenders Next</em> launches in 2025, it will begin life with a focus on boarding sports. Players will learn to conquer the snowy caps through tight, effortless snowboarding <a title="Genres > Action [2,051 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>, before taking to the highlands with the grittier feel of mountainboarding. Each sport will feel and handle completely different to the others, meaning players will have to learn to tackle and master every nook and cranny of <em>Next</em>.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

Players will earn rep as they scale the mountain, and use that to buy new boards, kits, helmets, goggles, and more to customize their rider.</p><p>Last time around, <em>Descenders</em> provided both procedurally-generated tracks, as well as a selection of hand-crafted parks. With Descenders Next we’ve brought it all together with a more natural experience, as players will tackle procedural off-piste mountains that chain together into tight, winding parks, and vistas.</p><p>The parks in particular will provide fresh new challenges, while also acting as Next’s playgrounds of fun. Sometimes you’ll be required to dash down the mountain with your friends as quickly as possible, while other times you’ll be aiming to focus on your tricks and perfect landings. Scavenger hunts will see players exploring every inch of the mountain, and unlocking special rewards for those who venture the deepest.</p><p>Top it all off with an absolutely banging soundtrack from Monstercat, and you’ve got even more reasons to spend hours on the slopes, chilling out to the latest in drum and bass hits.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dead-by-daylight-five-nights-at-freddys-crossover-officially-confirmed.945810/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-five-nights-at-freddys-crossover<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Behaviour Interactive has announced that a&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight Five Nights at Freddy's&nbsp;</em>crossover is on the way, although it's a fair ways off at the moment.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/DeadbyDaylight/status/1820580582767870187" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>X (formerly known as Twitter) account, the crossover is set to arrive in the popular multiplayer horror game in summer next year, which seems an awful long time to wait.</p>
<p>That's all you're getting for now: confirmation that the worlds of&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Five Nights at Freddy's&nbsp;</em>are crossing over, and a rough release window of "summer 2025". You'll have to wait a little while for more, it seems.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-by-daylight-five-nights-at-freddys-crossover-announcement.jpg?itok=GjDBIDzy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-by-daylight-five-nights-at-freddys-crossover-announcement.jpg?itok=jvvPwHm5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>is getting a&nbsp;<em>Five Nights at Freddy's&nbsp;</em>crossover, and...that's pretty much all we know.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, we can speculate about what exactly might make its way to&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>from&nbsp;<em>Five Nights at Freddy's</em>.</p>
<p>It's probably not a stretch to assume that Freddy Fazbear will be added as a killer, and we may well see a couple of the other animatronics as well. Some of the main characters of the games could also be added as survivors.</p>
<p>Given how far off the collaboration is, we might also be getting a new map or something equally substantial. After all, it seems a little strange to make players wait a whole year for just a new killer or survivor.</p>
<p>At any rate, it's probably going to be a while before we hear more about the&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight Five Nights at Freddy's&nbsp;</em>crossover, but don't worry; there's plenty of other stuff to keep you occupied in the meantime.</p>

<p>What's more, if you want to take a break from&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>but still want to remain immersed in the game's extensive lore, then you'll be pleased to know the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-casting-of-frank-stone-release-date">release date for story-based spinoff&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-casting-of-frank-stone-release-date">The Casting of Frank Stone</a>&nbsp;</em>was recently revealed, and it's landing next month.</p>

            <p>Sony's Playstation VR2 PC Adapter is set to go on sale from tomorrow but, before you go rushing off to buy one straight away, in my experience, getting the PS VR2 working on PC isn't nearly as easy as it should be.</p>
<p>I was planning on having a review on the site ready for launch, but it turns out the PS VR2's Sense Controllers are very flakey when it comes to Bluetooth connectivity. Even though I have the required Bluetooth adapter built into my PC, constant connection losses meant that I couldn't even make it past the headset's initial setup process on PC. </p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Screenshot-2024-08-06-at-12.20.21.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Trying to connect things to Bluetooth is a nightmare in most cases, but the Sense Controller connection process nearly sent me over the edge.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While waiting to hear back from Sony about my issues, I did a bit of digging on the device's <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/hardware/pc-prepare-ps-vr2/" target="_blank">support site</a> and found this line of text hidden away near the bottom, "Some Bluetooth® adapters may not be compatible with your PlayStation®VR2 PC adapter. For more information on Bluetooth® adapters, visit the link below."</p>
<p>That <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/support/hardware/pc-ps-vr2-bluetooth/" target="_blank">link</a> leads to a page which gives a list of four external Bluetooth adapters that "have been confirmed to work by SIE as of 07/20/2024, but operation is not guaranteed." Those adapters are the TP-Link UB500, Buffalo BSBT5D205BK, ASUS USB-BT500 and the IO-DATA USB-BT50LE.  </p>
<p>I've got a TP-Link UB500 on the way from <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/TP-Link-Bluetooth-Multiple-Receiver-UB500/dp/B09C25VRXD/ref=sr_1_3?crid=2IIFX5F8ENDUL&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.aqNzWF93tr2a0TsigRKNpw0b8J5vZGkmz4Uo6jYLehPNrlRqslq4koaLHnAhCh9iIry241V0B38WdxPbHNs5knfPNKhR1VYf5BXj3zODvuBIhEZ3fRHpjyrDI6x28LELNYGTdJEcNBm9VyxgJr7S89ayFjZmPY-t9k0ZqOuAK4vt4tVLjigPM2pe4FD3CJDDlpANr7_kQic2LBaUnJGIS9QMaMJWXY2eiCJsQ-xxwuY.R9pu9S-T5Tn0mj5tmW8mZtSBuSIi_KryutAiFggZ6DQ&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=TP-Link+UB500&amp;qid=1722946547&amp;sprefix=tp-link+ub500%2Caps%2C75&amp;sr=8-3" target="_blank">Amazon</a> now, and it's due to turn up tomorrow so hopefully my full coverage won't be delayed too much by this little bump in the road. Either way, I strongly suggest you look into buying a separate Bluetooth dongle if you're planning on picking up the Playstation VR2 PC Adapter - unless you actually <em>want</em> to experience an hour's worth of frustration like I did, that is. </p>
<p>While the Bluetooth issue came as a surprise to me, Sony has been quite vocal about the fact that you will need to buy a separate DisplayPort 1.4 cable in order to connect the PS VR2 to your PC. There isn't one included in the packaging for the Playstation VR2 PC Adapter so if you don't have a spare lying around, picking up one of these cables along with one of the suggested Bluetooth dongles will hopefully save you a lot of time and frustration during that initial setup process.</p>
<p>Seriously, PS VR2 owners have been waiting long enough to play Half Life: Alyx on the headset, so don't delay that process any further if you can help it!</p></div>

				</p>
			
			
			<p>The Tokyo Stock Exchange has crashed significantly, causing huge losses to major Japanese game companies. Companies such as Nintendo, Sega, Capcom and Square Enix are among the companies to experience a drop. The Tokyo Stock Exchange's stock market has been plummeting for three consecutive days. As of August 5, 2024, the stock market dropped by 4,451.28 Yen from the previous day, which has gone on to make it the biggest drop since the crash of the stock market in 1987.</p>
<p>Out of the Japanese game companies that were affected, CAVE was affected the most on this day. They experienced a 23% drop, with Capcom following behind at 16%. Square Enix was the least affected company, experiencing a drop of 5%, as shown by <a href="https://x.com/serkantoto/status/1820331372935848112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1820331372935848112%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statistics shared on X</a>.</p>
<p>However, Nintendo also experienced a significant amount of loss. They saw a decline in their stocks for three consecutive days, causing them to hit a new low for the year. This comes at a relatively rough time for Nintendo, as they had just released <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-q1-2025-report-reveals-sales-down-by-46-5/">their financial report</a> for the first quarter of the 2025 fiscal year. In this report, it was revealed that they are experiencing heavy declines in sales, with a 46% drop in sales and a 70% decline in operating profits.</p>
<p>Capcom hit the limit down (which is when the maximum amount the price of a stock can decrease in a single trading day happens,) despite Capcom saying that they had positive forecasts for the fiscal year.</p>
<p>Of course, the Tokyo Stock market crashing significantly didn't just affect companies like Nintendo, Capcom and Square Enix. It also affected major tech companies, such as NVIDIA, Apple and Microsoft.</p>
<p>To some, the crash of the stock market doesn't come as much of a surprise. There were many factors that helped cause the market to crash, such as the massive amount of concerns over the US economy, as well as the rapid appreciation of the Yen against the dollar. To counteract this, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/japan-economy-rates-boj-yen-e00919b053412fabf7a800ed78a9ad7a#" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Bank of Japan</a> has raised the interest rate from 0.1% to 0.25%, which helped the Yen gain significantly after this decision.</p>
<p>Whether the stock market will continue to crash or whether it will slowly return to normal remains to be seen, but this event helps serve as a stark reminder of just how volatile the stock market can be for those who choose to trade and purchase shares.</p>
<p>With the significant dip that Nintendo has experienced, people are considering buying up Nintendo shares so that they will make a decent profit once their losses have balanced back out to a normal level.</p>

Set in the “Purribean” with a whimsical piracy theme, <em>Cat Quest 3</em> doesn’t just see you fighting on land and in dungeons and castles. You’ll also take to the sea in your very own ship, where enemy vessels will pose their own unique challenges. With a variety of fun sidequests, dungeons to explore, and the ultimate quest of finding the North Star Treasure, <em>Cat Quest 3</em> provides a jovial and entertaining adventure that’s well worth your time if you enjoy light-hearted action-RPG shenanigans.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196599,196086" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div><h4> What platforms is <em>Cat Quest 3</em> available for?   </h4><p> <em>Cat Quest 3</em> launches on August 8 for  PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and Windows. It  runs flawlessly on Steam Deck, which was where I spent the majority of  my time. <em>Cat Quest 3</em> is also best experienced with a gamepad  and, in my opinion, is a perfect portable game as evidenced by my time  with it on Steam Deck.   </p></div><p>In the roughly five-or-so hours I’ve spent with <em>Cat Quest 3</em>, I’ve had a blast. While the repetitious soundtrack grates a bit, the core combat and gameplay loop are wildly satisfying. Once I got the hang of things and learned to dodge effectively and put together a solid build, I quickly got hooked on sailing the seas of the Purribean to seek out new equipment and get into more engaging fights. And while the story is mostly lighthearted fun, it’s proving to be somewhat intriguing as I come to learn exactly who my kitty is in the game’s lore and just what my spiritual pirate companion is up to.</p><hr><figure id="" data-id="69463f230e10b3de37efa2d5f11665bb" data-recommend-id="image://69463f230e10b3de37efa2d5f11665bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pirate cat attacks a large rat with a sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A pirate cat attacks a large rat with a sword." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Gentlebros / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="69463f230e10b3de37efa2d5f11665bb" data-recommend-id="image://69463f230e10b3de37efa2d5f11665bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pirate cat attacks a large rat with a sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’re gonna be doing a lot of brawling in <em>Cat Quest 3</em>, so it’s a good thing the combat here is a lot of fun. You can switch between your melee and ranged weapon at the push of a button. While there is ammo for your ranged weapons, it recharges over time so you don’t have to worry about keeping track of it. The same is true of your magical resource, mana. Different items will augment how quickly mana and ammo recharges, and even grant new ways of fighting, such as the ability to deal damage by rolling into enemies.</p><p>And don’t let the game’s cuteness fool you; the combat here isn’t without its challenges. Early on, you’ll quickly encounter enemies throughout the world who punch harder than you, soak up way more damage, and often outnumber you as well. Luckily, you can gear up with new weapons and spells to take on the new threats, and thankfully there’s more to beating your opponents than just increasing an assortment of power numbers. New equipment, and particularly spells, really shake the game up in some satisfying ways. </p><p>Take spells, for instance. Right now I’ve got two that I’m digging: a fireball that does a limited amount of persistent damage, and the ability to spawn ice shards on the ground which both damage enemies and also slow them down. That last part is particularly great for dealing with groups of foes as I can slow them down to target specific ones. These different spells can combine in some satisfying ways, too: I can slow down an opponent with my ice spell, which also does damage. I can then follow that up with a fireball that deals persistent damage. As they’re both slowed by the ice and taking damage from the fireball, I can empty my flintlock pistol into them, then switch back to my melee which recharges my mana with each strike thanks to an item I have equipped. </p><figure id="" data-id="e8557c571cbfc1c686bbfc4a47e54c48" data-recommend-id="image://e8557c571cbfc1c686bbfc4a47e54c48" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pirate cat faces off against a rat who claims to be Level 40." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A pirate cat faces off against a rat who claims to be Level 40." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Gentlebros / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e8557c571cbfc1c686bbfc4a47e54c48" data-recommend-id="image://e8557c571cbfc1c686bbfc4a47e54c48" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pirate cat faces off against a rat who claims to be Level 40." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This combination of spells and equipment can lead to very satisfying techniques you can deploy against groups of enemies or in one-on-one showdowns. And because finding a new item, spell, or weapon can add to your arsenal of attacks, the game inspires a wonderful forward momentum to go out, explore, pillage, and grow in power. And it’s all brought to life with excellent sound effects and wonderfully fun animations that often look as silly and enjoyable as watching animals play-fighting.</p><p>What I haven’t found as satisfying early on, however, is the ship combat. While I was able to quickly grow in power with my swords, guns, and spells, ship upgrades have proved more elusive. I suspect this is somewhat intentional as your ship is necessary to cross the ocean to other islands, and so a weaker ship keeps you focused on the earlier areas instead of letting you chart off to more difficult fights before you’re ready (you can swim in a life preserver, but you’ll get chewed up pretty quickly by hostile ships and have no way to fight back). I also found firing the ship’s cannons accurately to be a bit of a challenge. Thus far I’ve come out of most ship battles pretty banged up. That I’ve already gotten pretty powerful on land but still suck out in the waters makes the game feel a little discordant, so I’m hoping to find some new upgrades for my ship soon.</p><p><em>Cat Quest 3</em> also has some wonderful visual flair. With its vivid, cheery, and diverse color palette that mixes things up across the different regions of the Purribean, the whole experience really pops on Steam Deck OLED, and it’s all rendered with a generous draw distance that conveys an excellent sense of scale.</p><figure id="" data-id="a84b7f9f2363b892e6250c3edf24db04" data-recommend-id="image://a84b7f9f2363b892e6250c3edf24db04" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pirate cat explores a cavern river in a life preserver." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A pirate cat explores a cavern river in a life preserver." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Gentlebros / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a84b7f9f2363b892e6250c3edf24db04" data-recommend-id="image://a84b7f9f2363b892e6250c3edf24db04" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pirate cat explores a cavern river in a life preserver." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h6127"><a id=""></a>This music is pushing it, though</h2><p>Sadly, despite the game’s many charms, the music has dampened my desire to spend more time with <em>Cat Quest 3</em>. Don’t get me wrong, the production value is excellent…it’s just, listening to pirate shanty-themed music for an extended period of time really wore on me. I was delighted when I’d come across a dungeon or something that’d change up the soundtrack. Unfortunately, since the difficulty of combat will see you spending a bit of time doing some gentle grinding (which rarely feels <em>like</em> a grind given how fun the combat is), you’ll end up exposed to the same pirate-y melodies over and over and over again. </p><p>To its credit, the composition tries its best to mix things up even in the main overworld region, but after a couple of hours I’d find this music stuck in my head as I went about my daily errands. As someone who can find such whimsical melodies grating, it wasn’t great having them on loop in my head. This is the only thing that’s made me hesitate to jump back in (and I might lower the music volume a touch when I do). </p><hr><p><br><em>Cat Quest 3</em> is a joyful, silly, and satisfying way to spend time as a cute little cat pirate. Despite the allergic reaction I’m experiencing to its soundtrack, I’m looking forward to jumping back in to level up my gear, learn some new spells, and continue my search for the mysterious North Star Treasure. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Much like a band or singer-songwriter looking to shake things up and explore new aural delights for a third album, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cat-quest-iii">Cat Quest 3</a> takes to the high seas in search of a refreshing change of pace after a pair of medieval fantasy adventures. This time, the punniest action RPG out there is all about pirates and a quest of legendary booty of the North Star.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cat Quest III - Release Date Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K5TQm1N8vuM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s a fresh tale of predestination and prophecies in Cat Quest 3, with the opening cutscene showing the Pi-Rat King sinking a ship on the open waters, with the only survivor being a kitten in a wicker basket. That little kitty is discovered by the spirit of Captain Cappey, who shepherds you through to adulthood and then journeys with and encourages you on your adventure of piracy across the Purribean. The good and honourable kind of piracy, though, where you’ll still deliver mail between NPCs and not just terrorise shipping lanes.</p>


<p>Of course, since you’re now a pirate, that means you’ll spend a fair amount of time on a ship of your own, which adds a new layer to the action RPG battling you’ll still find on land. It’s a nice, albeit light, change that still feels very much in keeping with the on-land action, though the ship has a distinct turning circle and momentum, and you’ll have to manage its own set of upgrades.</p>


<p>While it’s perfectly in keeping with the rest of the game, I did wish for a little more depth to the ship combat though. Your cannons auto-aim within an arc before you, instead of having broadside batteries like you might expect, so it actually feels more like you’re dogfighting in planes instead of ships – strangely, even the most basic enemy ships have full 360º aiming. It’s also a pain that you can’t repair your ship without it first being destroyed, which you have to swim next to in your life preserver for a few moments to restore. Racing away to get back to a little jetty and summoning your ship just brings it back to you in the same condition, so where you have a spell to heal up your kitty between rest point cat naps, it’s the ship is more restrictive feeling.</p>
<p>Of course, the bulk of the action still takes place on land – which still has the same kind of scale as a traditional RPG overworld – and this is a solid iteration on the previous two games. You now have a main melee weapon with a secondary gun or wand to switch to (as opposed to swapping characters) and can equip up to four magic spells, with spell slots being charged up by your regular attacks.</p>

<p>It’s all nice and simplistic, and allows you to focus more on the enemies that you’re facing and dodging their attacks, whether it’s a pi-rat butt stomp, a hog charge attack, swooping bird or various elemental enemies. While it’s hardly Dark Souls difficulty, the combat’s got some claws to watch out for and I personally found it can be deceptively easy to get carried away and take a lot of damage. Boss battles all feel nice and distinct, and will often push you in a new direction, whether that’s making use of elemental weapons or leaning more on ranged attacks and magic – if ever I was taking the wrong approach to an enemy, a few deaths would have me buck up my ideas!</p>
<p>The loot you gather on your adventure is kept simple and to the point. There’s a menagerie of different hats and armour, as well as a variety of swords, axes, shields and guns, but instead of Diablo-esque loot where everything has different stat rolls, once you’ve got something, it can stay with you through the full adventure. Pick up a duplicate and it will bump up the level of your existing gear, and if you feel you need a little bit more juice in your attacks, you can head back to the one main port in the game and throw money and magic crystals to level up anything you’ve got.</p>
<p>As in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/10/30/cat-quest-ii-review/">Cat Quest 2</a>, all of this can be played in co-op, which is a nice and fun inclusion, though one I only dabbled with briefly while reviewing. It means you’ve got a little bit of slack in battle, as your buddy can come and pick you back up – just beware of getting hit while you’re stationary – and you can kit yourselves out with complimentary gear, and you’ll have to since you’re sharing an inventory. It does generally help to chop and change between different elements at times, so the ice wand lets you dodge through fire damage, while the shields are great for blocking rolling enemies and damaging them back. The main oddity in co-op is that you only get one ship,which is fine, but unusual when you can both control the same vessel.</p>

<p>You can quite quickly rattle through the main quest and story of the game, with your kitty chasing after the Pi-rat King, hunting down ancient keys and the like, but there’s a bunch of side quests like delivering mail, catching catfish, hunting down books, and optional dungeons with bounties to collect. All of the story is delivered with the same kind of pitch purrfect punning that’s positively pawesome, and there’s a good dose of foreshadowing for later twists, and callbacks to the overarching narrative of the series.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-roadmap<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>roadmap, so now you know what kind of content you can look forward to from this single-player adventure over the next year or so.</p>
<p>The season pass includes a mission that's exclusive to&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>' Season Pass, as well as a character pack, two cosmetic bundles, and two major story expansions, which takes us up to spring next year.</p>
<p>If you've been keeping up with&nbsp;<em>Outlaws&nbsp;</em>news, you'll probably recognize the exclusive mission, which is "Jabba's Gambit". Ubisoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-outlaws-jabba-season-pass-ubisoft">made sure to clarify</a> back in April that this mission isn't the only chance you'll get to see Jabba the Hutt.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-roadmap-full.jpg?itok=o5B0IkZG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-roadmap-full.jpg?itok=7XUAp9RZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't worry,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>fans: you're getting plenty of content this year.</figcaption></figure><p>Both the Jabba's Gambit mission pack and the Kessel Runner cosmetic pack, which contains cosmetics for Kay and her buddy Nix, are coming on launch day.</p>
<p>Following that, this fall, you'll get the first&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>story DLC in the form of&nbsp;<em>Wild Card</em>, which will see Kay crossing paths with Lando Calrissian as she infiltrates a Sabacc tournament.</p>
<p>If you're a Season Pass holder, you'll also get two cosmetic bundles, both of which contain new looks for Kay, Nix, your speeder, and the Trailblazer ship.</p>
<p>Lastly for this roadmap,&nbsp;<em>A Pirate's Fortune</em>, the second&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>story DLC pack, is coming in spring next year. It'll see Kay meeting up with pirate Hondo Ohnaka and taking on a "ruthless gang of pirates" alongside him.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-roadmap-kay.jpg?itok=I-6lEwaO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/star-wars-outlaws-roadmap-kay.jpg?itok=NEa9XZ5g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>is due to land later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>Whether or not this is the last we'll hear of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>after launch remains to be seen, but given how high-profile both the game and its IP are, I wouldn't bet on it.</p>
<p><em>Star Wars Outlaws&nbsp;</em>launches <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/uk/star-wars-outlaws/645ba713a9ce0448bffa4c12.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S on August 30th</a>. It's Ubisoft's open-world foray into the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>universe, and it combines traversal across a range of beautiful&nbsp;<em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>worlds with third-person shooting, stealth, and climbing-based platforming.</p>

Microsoft has announced its next lineup of titles headed to Xbox Game Pass over the first half of August, and it's headlined by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-is-nostalgia-done-right-and-that-includes-the-irritations">Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy</a>.
</p>
<p>
Is this one game? Is this technically three? Regardless, get ready to play (or replay) Crash Bandicoot, Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back and Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped on cloud, console and PC from this Thursday 8th August. 
</p>
<p>
Coming to Xbox Game Pass this month:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Creatures of Ava (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S) - 7th August </li>
<li>Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy (Cloud, Console, and PC) - 8th August </li>
<li>Mafia: Definitive Edition (Cloud, Console, and PC) - 13th August</li>
</ul>
<p>
It's not a long list of games, to be sure, but if you're yet to try the souped up Mafia remake then that is definitely worth a look. A ground-up rebuilding of the first Mafia tale, this takes place in 1930s America and sees Tommy-gun-toting title character Tommy Angelo trying to make his way in a world of organised crime. 
</p>
<p>"A mostly thorough remake of 2002's original, Mafia: Definitive Edition has its moments - but it struggles by the standards of today," Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-definitive-edition-review-a-generous-remake-that-still-shows-some-age">Eurogamer's Mafia: Definitive Edition review</a>.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/action-adventure-critter-saving-game-creatures-of-ava-releases-later-this-year">Creatures of Ava</a>, meanwhile, launches in to Game Pass this week. This colourful creature-saving fantasy action-adventure looks like it could be something special. It's co-developed by Spanish indie studios Inverse and Chibig, with Tomb Raider writer Rhianna Pratchett involved in creating the narrative.

Finally, <em>Dead by Daylight</em>’s 2v8 game mode is available to try on the service until August 8. <em>Valorant </em>isn’t part of Game Pass, but it is free-to-play and shadow dropped on console yesterday, in case you needed a new hero-based tactical shooter to add to your rotation. </p><p>  <em>N.

<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/AQuietPlaceGame/status/1820810851340910636" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> today, the team behind A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead revealed that its official release date is set for October 17, 2024.</p>



<p>Saber Interactive also revealed a brief new trailer to coincide with the release date announcement. The trailer features some brand-new footage captured on PC, including both cinematics and gameplay. </p>



<p>Saber Interactive’s new trailer also invites fans to pre-order A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead now, teasing pre-order bonuses. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead - Release Date Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/riegOv5eRuY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Players who pre-order earn extra digital content including a Hospital Care Package, Exclusive Concept Art, and a Creature Animation Showcase. The Hospital Care Package features batteries and inhalers, which are usable in-game as seen in today’s new trailer.</p>



<p>In June 2024, Saber Interactive first offered a reveal trailer with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-is-coming-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broad release window</a> for this year. Last month, they added a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-receives-new-story-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tense story trailer</a> featuring 2 minutes of footage that breaks down the basic premise of the game.</p>



<p>Today, fans got a closer look at some more gameplay, teasing medical challenges, enemy encounters, and various obstacles.</p>



<p>Saber Interactive’s anticipated game is based on the hit series of horror films. Gaming fans can also look forward to an Until Dawn movie, which just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-movie-cast-grows-peter-stormare-possibly-reprising-dr-hill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expanded its cast</a>, an animated show <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jb-smoove-high-on-life-animated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">based on High on Life</a>, and more.</p>



<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead will be available on PC via Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S when it releases this October.</p>

                <p>It's been a long time coming, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fall-guys/" data-ref-id="5000-497671">Fall Guys</a> has finally arrived in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>. The bean-based competition game begins its integration into the Fortnite ecosystem in several different ways--with Fortnite creative islands by Fall Guys developer Mediatonic, the ability for users to publish their own Fall Guys maps and, most importantly, an all-new Fall Guys-themed mini-game for battle royale and Zero Build.</p><p>Let's start with that. With this week's update, Fortnite battle royale will now host a Fall Guys mini-game that players can participate in by praising one of the statues of a Fall Guys bean person located around Classy Courts. Once you do, you'll be transformed into a bean person and made to play Fall Guys in an obstacle course in the sky. You'll have 120 seconds to complete it for loot--the faster you get it done, the better your loot will be. You can only complete it once per match, but you get three tries. And once the bean statues are in the storm you're locked out.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4345767-fortnitefallguys.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4345767" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4345767-fortnitefallguys.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4345767"></a><figcaption>A glimpse at the Fall Guys obstacle course in Fortnite battle royale.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4345767-fortnitefallguys.jpg"></figure><p>This is similar to a feature from Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 7, during which players could be abducted by aliens and made to play a competitive mini-game. But in this case, the choice to participate is entirely yours. Along with the mini-game will be a series of "Where We Fallin'" quests for rewards, including a bean person back bling.</p><p>What's particularly cool about this is that, as with Lego versions of skins, each of your Fortnite original skins will have a unique bean person design. Sadly, none of the current collaboration skins, like Marvel or Star Wars, is getting the bean guy treatment just yet, and so if you're wearing one of those then you'll appear as a generic, naked bean.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4345912-fallguysfortnitebackbling.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4345912" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4345912-fallguysfortnitebackbling.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4345912"></a><figcaption>This back bling will be a free quest reward during Fortnite's Where We Fallin' event.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4345912-fallguysfortnitebackbling.jpg"></figure><p>On top of the battle royale event, Fall Guys is getting six new Fortnite Creative islands from developer Mediatonic, and users can also now publish their own Fall Guys-themed islands as well.</p><p>This summer season has been unusually full of events in Fortnite, starting with Metallica and Reload in June, All Sweat Summer, Pirates of the Caribbean and Tesla in July, and now this Fall Guys stuff in August.

<p>"Although we're incredibly eager to share every fun detail of the game with you, 'Black Myth: Wukong' is a single-player game with an original storyline and unique gameplay," Game Science said on Twitter. "Therefore, we kindly ask that in these last few days before the official release, you avoid spreading any text, images, or videos that might reveal unreleased content, as well as any 'leak information' from unofficial sources."</p><p>Black Myth: Wukong launches on August 19 for PC and PlayStation 5. The game is also coming to Xbox Series X|S, but fans will have to wait a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-delayed-but-only-on-one-platform/1100-6524046/" data-ref-id="1100-6524046">bit longer as that version</a> currently doesn't meet the studio's standards and needs more time for optimization.</p><p>Game Science said that this is its first time launching a game internationally, so the team is looking into the logistics of how to provide physical copies to fans.</p>

However, it’s also reported that Reeves is only signed on in a production role, not an acting one.</p><p>Having tried to watch 2023's interminable <em>John Wick 4</em> twice now, the biggest news here for me is that it has an end. I love the first three films, albeit without having the faintest idea what was actually going on, but good lord, I wasn’t watching for the slow, plodding conversations. Still, end it must eventually have, because this TV show will continue the story after Wick’s meddling with the elite crew of crime bosses, the High Table, and a sort of reset on the whole assassin-organizing regime. And, well, if you’ve seen it, you’ll know the other major issue.</p><p>It’ll apparently feature the old guard attempting to reclaim the High Table for themselves, while a group of newbies attempt to step in and mould things to their own liking, which will provide the vital inner turmoil. However, what it won’t feature is John Wick.</p><p>This will be the second televised outing for the franchise not to feature its main character, the first being a three-episode limited series <em>The Continental: From the World of John Wick</em>, that aired on Peacock in 2023. However, that at least alluded to its tangential nature. “<em>John Wick: Under The High Table</em>” is clearly asking us to just accept the character’s name is also now some “Lego”-like franchise name, but it’s hard to imagine many will read it that way.</p><p>And this is just a fraction of forthcoming <em>John Wick</em>-related output. Currently a fifth main movie is in pre-production, while a Len Wiseman-fronted spin-off movie, <em>John Wick Presents: Ballerina</em> is due in June, 2025. There’s also yet another movie in the early stages, which will continue the events shown in <em>John Wick 4</em>'s post-credits scene, focusing on Donnie Yen’s character, Caine. Oh, and there are already plans for a <em>Ballerina</em> sequel. Good gravy.</p><p>For those who haven’t kept up, the first three <em>John Wick</em> movies are about a guy whose puppy gets killed prompting him to go on a 364-minute killing spree. Then the fourth film is about the man falling down a flight of stairs, sort of. Hopefully the new TV show will remember to keep talking to a minimum, and fighting to a maximum. There’s no word on a network yet, but it’s perhaps pertinent that Lionsgate owns Starz.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/08/06/xbox-game-pass-august-2024-wave-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> today, Xbox Wire revealed the first wave of titles coming to Game Pass in August 2024, including the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy and more.</p>



<p>There are only two other titles coming to Game Pass this month, including Creatures of Ava and Mafia: Definitive Edition. </p>



<p>Creatures of Ava will be available day one on Game Pass tomorrow, August 7, 2024. Mafia: Definitive Edition will join the Game Pass later on August 13, 2024. </p>



<p>Notably, the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy arrives between them on August 8, 2024, confirming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-is-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-on-august-8-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous leaks</a> from late last month. This may add a lot of validity to leaker eXtas1s and their future claims.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Although three titles is quite small for a wave of Game Pass titles, the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy is sure to please as a bundle. It offers Crash Bandicoot, Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back, and Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped. </p>



<p>These all remain fan favorite games, just like Mafia: Definitive Edition. Although, 2K Games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mafia-definitive-edition-comes-to-xbox-game-pass-august-13th/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously announced</a> when Mafia: Definitive Edition was coming to Game Pass in July, so it isn’t much of a surprise.</p>



<p>Creatures of Ava is a day one release, which always adds some value to the subscription, and it’s an indie highlight. The game is a creature collector from developer Inverge Studios.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cataclismo-sales-120k-two-weeks</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/manor-lords-publishers-cataclismo-racks-up-120k-sales-in-two-weeks.945717/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cataclismo-sales-120k-two-weeks<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>publisher Hooded Horse has announced that&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo</em>, the base-building strategy game developed by Digital Sun, has hit a pretty impressive sales milestone just two weeks after its initial release.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/HoodedHorseInc/status/1820552533557014698" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on Hooded Horse's X (formerly Twitter) account</a>,&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo&nbsp;</em>has managed to amass 120,000 sales within its first two weeks of launch, which isn't bad for an Early Access strategy-based city-builder. Looks like that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cataclismo-delayed-early-access">delay and Early Access adoption</a> served Digital Sun well.</p>
<p>In the post, Hooded Horse also announces that&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo&nbsp;</em>has racked up a 93% positive review score on Steam, so it looks like players are taking to its mixture of base-building and tower defense.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cataclismo-sales-120k-hordes.jpg?itok=gBJ87Z8X 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cataclismo-sales-120k-hordes.jpg?itok=mzj9L3WF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cataclismo&nbsp;</em>has captured strategy fans' imaginations, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>The publisher says it's "honored" to work with Digital Sun on&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo</em>, and that Hooded Horse "love[s] building and defending castles". I should hope so, given that's&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo</em>'s bread and butter.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://x.com/DigitalSunGames/status/1820746886619230696" rel="noopener" target="_blank">own X post</a>, Digital Sun says that&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo&nbsp;</em>is its fastest game to surpass 100,000 sales, as well as its highest-rated game on Steam.</p>
<p>It's true; a quick look confirms that shop management sim-come-roguelite&nbsp;<em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/606150/Moonlighter/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Moonlighter</a>&nbsp;</em>has an 82% approval rating, while&nbsp;<em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1457080/The_Mageseeker_A_League_of_Legends_Story/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">The Mageseeker: A League of Legends Story</a>&nbsp;</em>sits at 84%. Those aren't bad scores by any means, but they do make&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo</em>'s success even more impressive.</p>
<p>Admittedly,&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter&nbsp;</em>has far more reviews under its belt, but&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo&nbsp;</em>is comparable to&nbsp;<em>The Mageseeker&nbsp;</em>in terms of review numbers, so the increased score is perhaps a bit more telling there.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/digital-sun-cataclismo-sales-the-mageseeker.jpg?itok=qVduXvB8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/digital-sun-cataclismo-sales-the-mageseeker.jpg?itok=_Ump3hoy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Mageseeker&nbsp;</em>is Digital Sun's next best-reviewed game on Steam after&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Cataclismo</em>, it's a strategy game in which you must design a base and then defend it against hordes of slavering monsters.</p>
<p>You'll have access to a wide range of pieces from which to build your bases, and when it comes time to defend them, you'll be able to command soldiers with specialist skills and abilities to help you.</p>
<p><em>Cataclismo&nbsp;</em>is out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422440/Cataclismo/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>. Digital Sun says it's aiming to keep the game in Early Access for "around a year", but that this timeframe could change depending on "player feedback".</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fall-guys-is-now-in-fortnite.945708/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/fall-guys-is-now-in-fortnite<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Bean-based battle royale <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a> now exists within <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, with fresh courses built by developer Mediatonic.
</p>
<p>
The addition of Fall Guys as a permanent part of the Fortniteverse comes after Epic Games acquired Mediatonic back in 2021, and after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fall-guys-developer-hit-hard-by-epic-games-layoffs-but-studio-to-remain-open">extensive layoffs at the British firm last year</a>.
</p>
<p>
For a limited time, you can play Fall Guys within Fortnite's battle royale, via an enormous obstacle course currently floating above the map. Enter into it and your in-game character will be turned into a customised Fall Guy bean. There's also a smattering of limited-time rewards. 
</p>
<p>
Outside of Fortnite's battle royale, you can play custom Fall Guys levels made by Mediatonic and additional mini-games made by other creators, who have had access to Fall Guys assets ahead of time.

</p></div>
<p>
The tie-up appears permanent, with a dedicated Fall Guys row in Fortnite's main Discover menu, and all non-licensed Fortnite skins given a Fall Guys bean character equivalent.
</p>
<p>
"If we started Fall Guys development over today, we'd do it inside Fortnite," Epic Games executive vice president Saxs Persson told Eurogamer earlier this year, when asked if Fall Guys development would ever solely exist within Fortnite. "But we are where we are, we don't have anything to announce right now.
</p>
<p>
"You learn different things when you're separate, but we truly believe the magic of Fortnite is having fun in a game with your friends so the more players there are, the more content there is, the more fun you have. So by that simple measure, it benefits us to have everything in one place."
