			<p>It seems the news around <strong>Ubisoft</strong> is not stopping anytime soon, as a statement sent to Wccftech (first spotted on <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-redundancy-process-to-cut-200-jobs-from-paris-head-office">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>) reveals that the company has kicked off a <strong>"<em>voluntary</em>" layoff program</strong> at its <strong>Ubisoft Paris</strong> headquarters, where it intends to cut as many as <strong>200 employees</strong> from the studio.</p>



<p>This follows after the company <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">announced it would undergo a <strong>"<em>major reset</em>"</strong> last week</a>, which saw the entire company get restructured into five different 'Creative Houses,' multiple projects getting delayed or outright cancelled, and caused the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lost-nearly-95-of-value-in-eight-years-34-share-price-drop-after-major-reset/">company's share price to drop to its lowest point since <strong>2011</strong></a>. Now, after a report directly regarding how <a href="https://wccftech.com/french-union-claims-ubisoft-ceo-has-no-knowledge-or-understanding-of-his-company-after-major-reset/">morale within Ubisoft and specifically at Ubisoft Paris is led by <strong>"<em>anger and despair,"</em></strong></a> we've learned that things are getting worse for employees at the Paris HQ.</p>



<p>It should be noted that, due to this being a voluntary program that will cut as many as 200 employees, it's possible that fewer than 200 positions will be made redundant by the program's completion. The statement confirms that this program <strong>only applies</strong> to employees under Ubisoft International with French contracts, and that no cuts will be made final until an agreement is reached with union representatives and validated by French authorities.</p>



<p>"<em>In line with last week’s announcements on its new operating model and the acceleration of cost-reduction&nbsp;initiatives, Ubisoft International (HQ' legal entity) has initiated discussions&nbsp;regarding&nbsp;a potential Rupture&nbsp;Conventionnelle&nbsp;Collective (RCC), <strong>a collective, voluntary mutual&nbsp;termination&nbsp;agreement</strong> that could involve&nbsp;around&nbsp;200 positions at its headquarters in France</em>," the statement reads.</p>



<p>"<em>At this stage, this&nbsp;remains&nbsp;a proposal&nbsp;and will require&nbsp;a collective agreement with&nbsp;unions&nbsp;and validation&nbsp;by French authorities&nbsp;to come into effect.</em> <em>The&nbsp;proposal&nbsp;applies exclusively to Ubisoft International employees under French contracts and has no impact on other French entities or Ubisoft teams worldwide.</em>"</p>



<p>These cuts are part of the layoffs we were told to expect after Ubisoft made it clear that part of its restructure under this "<em>major reset</em>" would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/">further cost reduction to the tune of <strong>€200</strong> <strong>million</strong></a> and a return-to-office mandate, two elements that led to a strike taking place outside of Ubisoft Paris this past Thursday, January 22, 2026.</p>



<p>It's clear this is not the end of Ubisoft's woes, but only the beginning of a new chapter of bad news for Ubisoft. Last week, ahead of the strike, French video game union <strong>Solidaires Informatique</strong>, which represents several Ubisoft Paris employees, specifically called out Ubisoft chief executive officer,<strong> Yves Guillemot</strong>, for the company's current issues.</p>



<p>"<em>It is out of the question to let a boss run wild and destroy our working conditions. Perhaps we need to remind him that it is his employees who make the games</em>."</p>



<p>As one of the co-founders, along with his brothers, Yves Guillemot and his family have led Ubisoft since its inception. In the last eight years, with Yves at the helm, Ubisoft lost <strong>95% of its total value</strong>, going from a valuation of <strong>$10 billion</strong> to just <strong>$500 million</strong> as of last week.</p>

            <p>When you were making plant pots in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape">RuneScape</a> and selling them to other players, you might not have thought you were laying the groundwork for a UK legal precedent that would define in-game gold as intangible property covered by the Theft Act 1968, but, well, here we are.</p>
<p>Lord Justice Popplewell has ruled on appeal that RuneScape's gold pieces are legal property, which is important for the ex-Jagex developer accused of stealing 705 billion of them.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to the judgement handed down by <a href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/crim/2026/4#end-of-document">the Court of Appeal</a>, while working as a content developer at Jagex, the developer Andrew Lakeman is accused of accessing 68 different players accounts and "stripp[ing] those accounts of hundreds of billions of gold pieces" worth £543,123 if converted into RuneScape bonds, an item that can be bought for gold and exchanged for game membership. Jagex alleges this all took place in 2018. Lakeman and his solicitor dispute the charges.</p>
<p>When the case first went to trial last year, however, the judge dismissed the case agreeing with the defence's argument that RuneScape's in-game gold couldn't be legally defined as property under the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/contents">Theft Act 1968</a>.</p>
<p>While the law does exclude certain items from being considered property, such as wild mushrooms and animals, it doesn't, oddly enough, list in-game currencies. However, to be considered a legally stealable item, something also has to be "rivalrous" and not "pure information". Meaning, as quoted within the case report: "if the use or consumption of the thing by a person, or of a specific group of persons, necessarily prejudices the use or consumption of that thing by one or more other persons.”</p><p>The judge ruled in favour of the defence because Runescape's in-game gold isn't "rivalrous", because if one player has gold, it doesn't take away another player's ability to get it. “Gold pieces within [Runescape] are not sufficiently rivalrous to be classed as intangible property," the judge said. "One gold piece is the same as any other, and their supply is infinite. The fact that existing players have wealth does not preclude new players from joining the game and getting more wealth, without taking it from existing players. This means, in my judgment, that even if the Crown is able to prove every single factual assertion that forms the basis of its case, the offences currently charged are not made out in law and I would not be prepared to leave them to a jury.”</p>
<p>However, the judge left their ruling open to appeal and appeal the prosecution bloody well have. The ruling went to the Court of Appeals, and ended up in front of Lord Justice Popplewell. Hold onto your legal pads, reader.</p>
<p>"We differ from the Judge in his reasoning for reaching the contrary conclusion on rivalrousness. The two reasons which the Judge gave in his ruling do not, with respect, bear analysis," Popplewell writes. "The first was that 'one gold piece is like any other, and their supply is infinite'. This does not, however, distinguish them from many other forms of rivalrous property. One paper clip from a given manufacturer is like any other; and the manufacture and supply of them infinite, in the sense that is not capped at any finite number. Yet each paper clip constitutes property. The same is equally true of gold pieces."</p>
<p>Effectively, just because each gold piece in RuneScape is identical and functionally the same, does not make it something that a player can be deprived of.</p>
<p>"The Judge’s second reason was that '[t]he fact that existing players have wealth does not preclude new players from joining the game and getting more wealth without taking it from existing players'," Popplwell continues. "However this too is no answer to the rivalrousness of the in-game wealth which a particular player already has at any given time. It focuses only on different assets which may thereafter be acquired."</p>
<p>After all, if you had had 100 million gold taken from you and someone said, 'Don't worry, at least it won't stop other players from earning gold', you might say that doesn't make a jot of difference to you.</p>
<p>In their conclusion, Popplewell lays out their reasons for granting the prosecution's appeal, saying that RuneScape's gold pieces "are properly described as something which can be stolen as a matter of normal use of language. They do not fall within any of the established exceptions. They are not 'pure knowledge': functionally they exist as identifiable assets distinct from the code which gives rise to them and outside the minds of people. There is no good policy reason for excepting them from the category of property which can be stolen. On the contrary, they are assets which have an ascertainable monetary value and which may be traded for that value both in the game and outside the game. Within the rules of the game they represent money’s worth as the product of purchase of a bond. Outside the game they are regularly traded for money’s worth. They are capable of being subject to dishonest dealing which deprives their possessor of their use and value. It would be surprising and unsatisfactory if such dishonest dealing did not amount to the offence of theft."</p><p>While you may not want to read the whole case document, as it is a pretty extensive read, it is full of interesting examples of other legal precedents. For instance, there was the Oxford student accused of theft for taking an exam paper, even though they returned it, because they now possessed the questions that were in the document. Or the discussion that compares forbidden real money transfers in games to theft of Class A drugs.</p>
<p>With the Court of Appeal's decision now handed down, it would appear that the original case can now proceed.</p>

<p>A medieval massacre awaits in Half Sword. The innovative physics game wants you to maim, and blood will be the price of glory. In terms of Half Sword’s actual price and how much it costs, that’s where this guide enters the fight.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming described Half Sword as ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hilarious-medieval-combat-early-access-half-sword/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the most hilarious medieval combat sim</a>.’ If you’ve not seen it yet, you need to. Thousands of you have already begun your crusade to lop off limbs and put down your enemies like dirty dogs, courtesy of the free demo.</p>



<p>Eventually, Half Sword will be available to buy, and this is where you need to know its cost and price tag.</p>







<h2 id="h-half-sword-price-explained">Half Sword Price, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I challenge you to a duel. Credit to Half Sword Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s been confirmed through the Half Sword Discord that the combat game will be under $30 when it launches in early access, with a discount at launch.</strong></p>



<p>There isn’t a more concrete price tag at the moment, but the faq section in the Half Sword Discord has clarified some price details:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Price is still TBA. It will be less then $30 and the first two weeks of EA will feature a discount.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>You’ve got a brief window to get early access for a more bank account-friendly price. The Half Sword Discord is extremely active with thousands of players, and the development team provides updates regularly. There’s every chance there will be a full price tag update before launch; if not, everyone will find out together on release day.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-half-sword-have-microtransactions">Does Half Sword Have Microtransactions?</h2>



<p><strong>You might be pleased to hear that Half Sword will feature no microtransactions of any kind.</strong></p>



<p>Diverting back to the official <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1043854763189600337/1272470349245579396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">faq</a>, when addressing the question of “Will there be microtransactions?” it has a simple and blunt, one-word answer: “No.”</p>



<p>There might be some free extra content released after launch, or maybe fuller expansions (it is only early access, though), but it’s confirmed there will be no microtransactions.</p>



<p>Half Sword easily looks like one of the most promising and fun games of 2026. The concept looks brutal, and the price tag isn’t going to give your wallet a headache. Will you be going all in on Half Sword early access?

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nyxis-hyperion-3-is-on-paper-the-perfect-joy-con-2-alternative</link>

<p>Early-bird price expires today</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Over the coming years, we're likely to see a bunch of alternatives to the Switch 2's Joy-Con, but NYXI's new Hyperion 3 looks like it might be a solid early contender.</p>
<p>Available for pre-order now via the <a href="https://nyxigame.com/products/nyxi-hyperion-3-wireless-joypad-for-switch-2">NYXI website</a>, you can currently take advantage of a 30% 'early-bird' discount, bringing the price down to <strong>£88</strong> for those in the UK. This is only valid for the remainder of the day, by which point the price will return to <strong>£125</strong>.</p>
<p>The Hyperion 3 looks to be a thoughtful evolution of its predecessor, boasting a more ergonomically-friendly design that's sure to be a bit more comfortable to grasp than Nintendo's own official offering. You've also got Hall-Effect sticks to reduce the risk of drift, micro-switch face buttons, gyro support, and wake-up support. Not bad at all.</p>
<p>Here's the official list of features from NYXI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Hall Effect Joystick (No Drift)<br>
- Micro-Switch D-Pad &amp; A/B/X/Y<br>
- Micro-Switch Trigger/Dual-stage Linear Trigger<br>
- 9-Axis Gyro on Switch<br>
- Pro Controller Mode/Handheld Mode<br>
- Wake-up &amp; Screenshot Feature<br>
- Adjustable Turbo &amp; Rumble Function</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Naturally, we'll reserve full judgement until we're able to get our hands on the Hyperion 3, but on paper at least, yeah, this looks pretty neat. The regular price of £125 could be a bit of a sticking point for some, but if the features justify it, then this could be a go-to accessory for those who like to play both docked and handheld.</p>

<p>After <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/were-truly-sorry-opus-prism-peak-slips-into-2026">a last-minute delay</a> towards the end of 2025, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/opus-prism-peak">OPUS: Prism Peak</a> — the spiritual successor to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/opus_echo_of_starsong_-_full_bloom_edition">Opus: Echo of Starsong</a> (a game we <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/opus-echo-of-starsong-full-bloom-edition">absolutely adore</a>) — finally has a brand new release date for Switch 1 and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Coming out on <strong>26th March 2026</strong>, Opus: Prism Peak is a narrative puzzler where you play as a photographer who has stumbled into a strange realm. Accompanying him is a young girl who seems to understand this world you've ended up in, and the game focuses on your photography skills and the relationship between the two main characters.</p>
<p>The brand new trailer features a stunning theme song 'I Am Farewell Itself, I Am Life', composed by Kevin Penkin, the composer of anime such as <strong>Made in Abyss</strong>, <strong>The Apothecary Diaries</strong>, and <strong>Tower of God</strong>, as well as for the narrative video games <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/necrobarista_final_pour">Necrobarista</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/florence">Florence</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of what to expect from the game when it launches later this year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Key Highlights:</strong><br>
* Adventuring Together: The heart of the experience lies in the evolving relationship between the two protagonists as they navigate a landscape of spirits.<br>
* Photography as a Narrative Bridge: While exploring, use an old camera to uncover the world's mysteries. Photography is how you interact with the world and strengthen the connection between characters.<br>
* Grownup Regrets meets Shinkai Aesthetic: Experience a world that blends Makoto Shinkai’s vibrant visuals with the midlife disillusionment of Firewatch</p>

			<p><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> is one of the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2026-martial-artists-spies-super-heroes-and-criminals/">most anticipated games</a></strong> launching on consoles this year. Following <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">two delays</a></strong>, the excitement surrounding the game has only increased, and many are getting ready to jump into this new rendition of<strong> Vice City</strong> with a physical copy of the game to complete their series collection.</p>



<p><span>Unfortunately,&nbsp;<strong>it seems like this won't be possible</strong>, at least not at laun</span>ch, in a move that is just as <strong>unprecedented</strong> as the game is set to be when it is released later this year.</p>



<p>In a new report shared today, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/397290/gta-6-a-wersja-pudelkowa-sprzedawcy-zwiastuja-smutna-wiadomosc-dla-fanow-fizycznych-wydan.html">Polish publication PPE</a></strong>, which has proven <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-playstation-5-november/"><strong>quite reliable over the past few months</strong></a>, revealed that the highly anticipated game will <strong>only be available digitally at launch.</strong></p>



<p><em>"This source, who handles physical video game sales in Europe, informed us that Grand Theft Auto 6 publisher Take-Two is currently not planning a physical edition of Lucia and Jason's story. At least not for release due to possible story or gameplay leaks,"</em> the report reads via an automated translation. The physical release will only arrive a few months later, but the source doesn't know if this will happen only a few weeks after launch or only in the first half of 2027.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">"We're hearing more and more that the physical version won't be released simultaneously with the digital version to prevent leaks. We're getting conflicting reports: some say the physical version will arrive three to four weeks after the digital release, while others say it won't happen until early 2027,"</em> another source said. Thankfully, more information will reportedly be available in mid-February.</p>



<p>Needless to say, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>launching in digital format only is <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">incredibly disappointing</strong>. However, considering how many highly anticipated games get into the hands of gamers <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ahead of the official release date</strong>, it's not surprising that Take-Two is willing to go so far to protect what is set to be t<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">he <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">biggest entertainment launch of all time</a></strong>, and possibly earn more by exclusively selling the game digitally at launch.</p>



<p>Hopefully, this decision, if final, will not <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">prevent the release of any Collector's Edition</strong> at launch, which could still include a voucher for the digital version of the game alongside whatever extra goodie is packed in. The value of such a proposition, however, would certainly be diminished by the <strong>lack of a physical copy of the game.</strong></p>



<p>Would a digital-only launch of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Grand Theft Auto 6</em> make you wait for the physical release, or would you still get the game when it launches on November 19? Let us know in the comments!</p>

Today I became aware of Bolt Action, a historical strategy sim based on the World War II tabletop miniatures game from Warlord Games (founded by erstwhile Games Workshop staffers John Stallard and Paul Sawyer). It sees you fretting over questions of morale, line-of-sight and cover, while leading US, British or German armies across maps that range from beaches to churchyards. There’s multiplayer, too. Trailer ho!

In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3856030/view/541128612120628420?l=english">a blogpost this week</a>, developers Frag Games simultaneously announce their desire to do right by the source material while making clear that they don’t want to just transplant it, Victoria Crosses and all.  “We’ve all seen ‘PC adaptations’ that strip the soul out of a tabletop game to make it ‘accessible,’" they sneer, like grown men disproving the existence of Santa Claus. “So our designers spent weeks in ‘boot camp’: reading rulebooks, painting minis, rolling dice, measuring distances with tape, and feeling the genuine panic of a FUBAR roll.
</p>
<p>
“We learned a lot, and we’re still learning,” it continues. “But the one thing we DID know from the beginning was that we didn’t want to build a digital version of Bolt Action.  Bolt Action already exists! Playing a table-top experience will always remain special. What we want is the best Turn-Based Tactics videogame built on the Bolt Action ruleset.”</p>
<p>There follows a breakdown of the “six tactical choices” that await you whenever you pick a unit: firing, advancing, running, ambushing (aka overwatch), rallying (aka getting rid of suppression “pins”), and going prone. 
</p>
<p>
Another section explores vehicles, which are proof against small arms and have a selection of armour facings. There’s a bit on how indirect fire works, with the accuracy of consecutive shots on a target improving each turn, and a bit on platoon experience levels, upgrades and customisation.
</p><p>
It looks like a tidy little wargame – no release date yet - but that’s not why I’ve written it up. “We’re building a game for the person with five unpainted armies sitting on their shelf, but also for the strategy fan who wants a WWII game with complex rules and deep gameplay,” the devs comment near the end of that blogpost.</p>
<p>The mention of unpainted armies fills my heart with decades-old guilt – alas, Teclis, Loremaster of Hoeth, I never did get round to finishing your cape – but also, <em>possibility</em>. Adaptations of tabletop miniatures games often come with elaborate livery editors, but now that I reflect, I’m not sure I’ve played one that lets you show up to the brawl with an unpainted force.
</p>
<p>
It’s been a while since I wielded a physical range ruler, but there is surely no better way to demonstrate your contempt for an opponent - and maybe, throw them off - than by rocking up with some High Elves you couldn’t be bothered to basecoat, let alone shade and layer. Imagine if Henry V came to Agincourt with no pants. How might the French have reacted? Clarification: I have not researched the Battle of Agincourt, so apologies if going commando was, in fact, a critical element of the English strategy. 
</p>
<p>
Less abrasively, I just think miniatures adaptations could do a better job of reflecting the fact that a lot of miniatures collectors aren’t great painters, however enthusiastic. There should be an editor function that recreates the effect of a spirited 10-year-old getting Warhammer for Xmas and trying to pimp out a whole Lizardman battalion in felt tip. I think this could be wholesome? Authentic, even?

            <p>
Against the overbearing weight of modernity, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/old-school-runescape">Old School RuneScape</a> continues to complete a Sisyphean task of simply existing two and a half decades after it originally launched. It just celebrated that 25th anniversary at the start of the year in fact, and now during a Winter Summit a slew of updates coming to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a> were shown off in a roadmap from developer Jagex.
</p>
<p>
Kicking things off on the roadmap is Deadman: Annihilation, a "high intensity, PvP everywhere" variation on its main PvP mode that'll run from January 30th through to February 21st. This one'll feature some new sigils and breaches, and you can earn points to pick up cosmetics. Following that, in April Leagues is returning with Leagues VI: Demonic Pacts, complete with bonus XP drops and loot boosts, alongside some reimagined combat masteries.

Sailing, the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/old-school-runescape-is-getting-its-first-new-skill-since-it-launched-and-so-the-xp-grind-begins-anew">first new skill since it changed from regular RuneScape to Old School RuneScape</a>, will be expanded upon sometime in 2026 too, namely new quests to do. Those of you that have been around for a long time will be interested to hear about the Blood Moon Rises update coming in the summer, a Grandmaster-tier quest that'll wrap up a story started all the way back in 2004. Jeepers creepers! Pull out the champagne for that questline. On top of all that, there's also The Fractured Archive, the game's first new raid in four years.
</p>
<p>
As always I'm just impressed this thing is trucking. It's the first online anything where I had an actual username (no I'm not telling you, some things are best kept as secrets), those types of internet histories are typically lost to time. Kudos!

            <p>A group of modders wearing the finest reverse-engineering goggles has managed to port birdly and beary platformer Banjo-Kazooie to PC, with a bunch of extra bells and whistles to make sure it won't make for a disappointing dip back into your childhood or adulthood.

<p>This recompiled version of the N64 classic, brought to life using <a href="https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp">N64: Recompiled</a>, is primarily the work of modder Wiseguy. It works on Windows, Linux, and Mac, provided you bring along the game files via a legally-sourced ROM of the North American 1.0 version.</p>
<p>If you do, you're in for a version of Banjo which offers a bunch of helpful features designed to ensure it's ideal to play on today's hardware, though it is also promised to run on more potato-shaped boxes. There's support for high framerates if you don't fancy leaving it at a solid 60, widescreen and ultrawide modes, and rapid loading times. A dual-analog camera steup, the ability to keep your notes if you die or exit a level, and support for playing on Steam Deck are also part of the puzzle.</p>
<p>Finally, there's built-in mod support in case you want to get Doom running in the jigsaw minigame. Or just download the likes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLzv0U3cFlo">Jiggies of Time</a> and or a revamped texture pack.</p>
<p>All in all, it's a project that looks well worth the wait of eons for Banjo to get a proper PC port, something Microsoft haven't yet deigned worth digging back into the nostalgia toybox to whip out.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving Banjo: Recompiled a go, you'll find it and its souce code on <a href="https://github.com/BanjoRecomp/BanjoRecomp/releases/tag/v1.0.0">GitHub</a>, where Wiseguy also notes they're planning on delivering ray tracing to it at some point down the line.</p>

              <p><span>If you’ve grown up with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon</span></i></a><span>, you have no doubt dreamt of waking up in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>universe. That’s a pipe dream, but if you can make it to Tokyo, you can get a facsimile of this experience at PokéPark Kanto, a new theme park opening on February 5. In the months since The Pokémon Company announced the attraction, we’ve </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-pokemon-theme-parks-first-trailer-still-doesnt-explain-anything-2000642904"><span>mostly only seen mock-ups of what the park was going to look like</span></a><span>. Well, some Japanese press and content creators finally got to see the park ahead of its grand opening and have posted videos and photos, and y’all, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cph2QjATgeo"><span>I want to go to there</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The idea of PokéPark Kanto is that you’re essentially being transported to the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>world, with statues, character actors, and photo ops all meant to immerse you in the setting. Think of it like one of the immersive experiences at Disney World, but instead of </span><i><span>Star Wars </span></i><span>characters, you’re rubbing shoulders with Pikachu and hundreds of other critters. There are several outdoor displays, but you’ll also find spots like a Pokémon Center and a professor’s lab.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Despite the name, there are Pokémon from several regions, not just the Kanto setting of the original games. You can find “scenes” of Pokémon battling and interacting in the wild while others like Chansey, who stands behind the desk at the Pokémon Center, act as helpers for the staff. There’s also a shop with exclusive merchandise, and you can probably expect some of those items to end up on reseller sites in the coming weeks.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202601/64249"><i><span>Famitsu</span></i></a><span> has a rundown of their experience at the park, and there’s a ton of photos of the different Pokémon on display, the different buildings and attractions you can visit, and&nbsp; the exclusive merchandise that you can buy at the shop.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Proposes 200 Job Cuts At Paris Headquarters]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-proposes-200-job-cuts/</link>
            <guid>1416454</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/publishers/ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a> is already looking at cutting jobs, just days after its announced company-wide restructuring.</p>



<p>According to a new report, Ubisoft is proposing cutting up to 200 jobs at its Paris headquarters. These jobs would be filed under a Rupture Conventionnelle Collective (RCC) that allows employees to come to a “mutual termination agreement.”</p>



<p>Ubisoft currently employees 1,100 people at its Paris office.</p>







<p><strong>“In line with last week’s announcements on its new operating model and the acceleration of cost-reduction initiatives, Ubisoft International has initiated discussions regarding a potential Rupture Conventionnelle Collective, a collective, voluntary mutual termination agreement that could involve up to 200 positions at its headquarters in France,”</strong>&nbsp;a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-follows-last-weeks-game-cancelations-and-studio-closures-with-a-proposed-reduction-of-200-more-jobs-at-its-paris-headquarters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft spokesperson said to IGN</a> on the matter. </p>



<p>Ubisoft says that this remains just a proposal at this point. A final decision can’t come until an agreement is made between the company and employees. It then has to be “validated by French authorities”.</p>



<p><strong>“The proposal applies exclusively to Ubisoft International employees under French contracts and has no impact on other French entities or Ubisoft teams worldwide,”</strong> Ubisoft said.</p>







<p>It’s unclear exactly how many jobs could be lost across the entire company over the next two years. Based on past history, it wouldn’t be surprising to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-human-cost-ubisofts-next-cost-cutting-measure-could-see-another-2000-jobs-lost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">see another 2,000 or more people</a> lose their jobs during that time span. </p>



<p>On January 21, Ubisoft announced that it was going through a company-wide restructure. These plans called for the cancelation of six games, including the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake</a>. It also saw the company split into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-operation-model-features-5-creative-houses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">five “creative houses”</a> that would oversee various Ubisoft franchises. </p>

Using your old camera, you’ll explore an ethereal realm and its ties to the world you left behind, uncover its mysteries, and ultimately find your way home.</p><p>You are a weary, middle-aged photojournalist retreating from a life of disappointment in the city to find solace in your roots. But an unexpected accident leaves you stranded in an ethereal mountain realm, where you cross paths with a mysterious girl. To uncover the truth of this enigmatic world and find a way back home, you must gather clues and piece together its mysteries—all with nothing but the old camera in your hands.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Where do grownups go when they lose their way?</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Photography</strong> – Photography in <em>OPUS: Prism Peak</em> reflects how closely the protagonist looks at the world. Players must take in their surroundings, understand what each spirit desires, and capture the realm’s secrets through their lens. Capture the moment, then learn to let go.</li><li><strong>Companionship</strong> – Among the spirits is a girl with no memory of who she is, only a faint sense that she needed to help a grownup through his struggles. As their journey unfolds, her presence offers a different angle that helps him see the world more clearly. It’s nice that you came along at a time like this.</li><li><strong>Wistful Magical Realism</strong> – This world is not unlike reality, yet it is slowly fading away. Humanity has long since vanished, leaving only animal spirits to inhabit its remains. They believe that so long as they capture each other’s moments, they will continue to exist.</li><li><strong>Spiritual Bonds</strong> – The spirits you encounter throughout the game may grow closer to you depending on your choices, quietly shaping what awaits at your destination.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="OPUS: Prism Peak｜Release Date Trailer｜Nintendo Switch &amp; Steam" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4AVrwtzgYrI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/opus-prism-peak-launches-march-26]]></content:encoded>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Autumn 2026 could be the definitive release window for Xbox and Playground Games' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fable-2024">Fable</a>, which last week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fable-finally-gets-a-release-window-following-xbox-developer-direct-will-launch-in-autumn-2026">confirmed</a> its journey to PS5 on top of Xbox Series X/S and PC. Years after its original announcement, it's had its ups and downs, but the powers that be appear to have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/are-xbox-and-playground-making-the-right-move-sticking-so-closely-to-fables-history">a solid grasp on what they want to achieve with it</a>. Now, we also know it'd been a dream project for the developer for a while.</p>
<p>"The first conversations we had about doing something other than <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a> and building a second team go right the way back to the year after we shipped <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-3">Forza Horizon 3</a>," said Playground general manager Ralph Fulton during <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/why-playground-games-ambitious-open-world-fable-reboot-is-a-fresh-start-for-the-series-this-has-to-be-playgrounds-fable/">an interview for GamesRadar</a>. It was in 2016 that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-3-review">Forza Horizon 3</a> was released and cemented the open-world driving series as a modern behemoth.</p>
<p>"It was the best Forza Horizon we'd made. The team really hit its stride – the game was really high-quality, it landed with a wide audience. We felt great about that," Fulton added. Around that time, conversations started at the studio about building a second team which maybe could take on something different: "The conversation around building a second team and doing something else, doing something different, was really about wanting to challenge ourselves – to learn and grow as developers." As we all know, the Forza Horizon series has become essential to the studio, especially after Xbox bought it, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-6-shows-off-largest-ever-map-as-microsoft-confirms-a-may-release">its sixth entry</a> could help offset any possible disappointment with the Fable reboot.</p>
<p>Still, we're generally optimistic about the ambitious RPG, especially after the franchise was left for dead following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-acknowledges-missteps-in-its-handling-of-lionhead-studios">Lionhead Studios' closure in 2016</a>. A lot of what's made Forza Horizon special over the years seems to be on full display on Playground's Albion. Fulton admits the veteran devs "felt our transferable skills were, in a genre sense, open-world game design, open-world technology, and open-world streaming," which helped the studio narrow down what it could do outside of driving sandboxes.</p>

<p>Fulton went on to explain how the technology had to be modified and optimized to fit an open-world RPG and how passionate the entire team is about Fable and its legacy. But funnily enough, he doesn't exactly remember who first brought the famous IP up as a real possibility: "I don't remember who mentioned [Fable], but as soon as I heard the word I was sold."</p><p>As underlined by the trailers released so far and the in-studio videos we've received over the past few years, Playground wants to make its own version of Fable instead of Fable 4 under a different, simpler name: "We're not Lionhead, we're a different studio with different people and a different culture. It would be inauthentic for us to try and just make Fable 4."</p>
<p>From the focus on sitcom-inspired comedy to leaning more on a fairytale-like aesthetic, it's safe to say this extremely British take on Fable has a voice of its own. The question now is whether it'll live up to most players' terribly high expectations after six years of teases and development hiccups.</p>

<p>February? Say it ain't so!</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="861b0e4e49fc1"><a title="Nintendo Direct 9.12.2025 screenshot" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/861b0e4e49fc1/nintendo-direct-9-12-2025-screenshot.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>New year, new Nintendo Direct rumours — Nintendo usually likes to hold a big presentation every February, and it appears that it's continuing that trend in 2026, as a proper Nintendo Direct (not focused on the <strong>Mario Galaxy Movie</strong> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life</a>) could be coming as soon as next week.</p>
<p>This rumour comes from prominent podcaster and YouTuber Nate the Hate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JwMQiG9bc4c">on his podcast</a> (via the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qnigei/natethehate_the_first_nintendo_direct_of_the_year/">GamingLeaksAndRumors subreddit</a>), who says he has heard from his sources that a Nintendo Direct will be airing "in the opening week of February", potentially <strong>Thursday 5th February</strong>.</p>
<p>Now, before you get too excited, Nate does stress that he hasn't been able to confirm this with his best sources, but given Nintendo's history, we'd be extremely surprised if we didn't get a Direct --either a big one or a Partner Showcase — sometime next month.</p>
<p>We will say as we always do with stories like this, take this with a pinch of salt. Nothing is official until Nintendo says anything, so for now, we can just speculate on <em>what</em> exactly Nintendo might bring to the table.</p>

<p>2025 was obviously an outlier in terms of February Directs as the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal came in January. 2024's big February showcase was actually a Partner Direct. Prior to last year, the Japanese gaming giant hasn't missed a February since 2018.</p>
<p>Of course, we're getting some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-nintendo-direct-announced-for-thursday-29th-january">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream later this week</a> thanks to a specific Direct, but Nintendo has a busy slate for 2026. Y<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book">oshi and the Mysterious Book</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave">Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rhythm_heaven_groove">Rhythm Heaven Groove</a> are just some of the titles we know about.</p>
<p>We've also got indies such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/witchbrook">Witchbrook</a> awaiting brand new release dates after they were delayed out of 2026. Plus, there may well be a bunch of third-party port announcements for Switch 2 on the horizon. We'll see!</p>

 <p>Ever since <em>Shadows</em> dared include an African samurai as one of its two protagonists, it’s been the target of anti-woke attacks, <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-backlash-racist-elon-1851539007">including from Elon Musk</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-backlash-racist-elon-1851539007"><span>(who was later ratio’d by whoever runs the official </span></a><a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1904648274675445938?s=20"><i><span>Assassin’s Creed</span></i></a><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-backlash-racist-elon-1851539007"><span> X account)</span></a><span>.</span>&nbsp;Some of those same people have now been saying the company’s financial fallout vindicates their attacks on diversity and inclusion in gaming.</p> <p><span>Shimoda, who worked for the publisher from 2021 to 2024, stated “unequivocally” that Ubisoft’s DEI initiatives “didn’t wield that much influence” and were, in fact, “actually beneficial” in helping them expand in South America and the Middle Eastern territories.</span></p>

 <p><span>His comments regarding Ubisoft’s “excessively low turnover rate” and “lack of senior/lead-level staff with experience” imply that Shimoda lays the blame squarely at the feet of the publisher’s upper management, especially when paired with his “Big Business Syndrome” remark.</span></p>

 <p><a href="https://www.omron.com/global/en/about/corporate/history/founder/06/"><span>Big Business Syndrome</span></a><span> is a term coined by Kazuma Tateisi, former president of Japanese electronic manufacturer OMRON, in 1987. In short, Tateisi believed that the profits of several prominent Japanese companies in the 80s began to fall once their leaders became too obsessed with maintaining the status quo. When stepping down as president in 1987, Tateisi warned OMRON employees that refusing to pursue the same riskier strategies that led to their initial success, yet continuing to expand in the process, would lead to them suffering the same fate as their contemporaries.</span></p> <p><span>Shimoda is arguing that Ubisoft has become a victim of the same mentality. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-black-flag-remake-delay-2000661866"><span>On January 21</span></a><span>, the publisher announced a painful shakeup that included the cancellation of “4 unannounced titles, including 3 new IP’s” and the formation of “Five Creative Houses” that will solely focus on developing games for their pre-existing IPs. But some current employees feel like this latest reset is just history repeating itself.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Headwinds Trailer ‘Leak’ Reveals Solos vs Squads Mode]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-headwinds-trailer-leak-reveals-solos-squads/</link>
            <guid>1416388</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Headwinds, the first major ARC Raiders update of 2026, is set to drop tomorrow. It’ll introduce a new matchmaking option, a fresh player project, some hot new cosmetics, <strong>and </strong>probably a few new quests. Earlier today, the trailer for that update was ‘leaked’ early, with a Japanese Embark Studios social profile posting the short video ahead of whatever the intended drop time was.</p>



<p>The trailer was taken down, but not before users managed to capture the footage and circulate it on social media. Above all else, it reveals that a bizarre new ‘solos vs squads’ matchmaking option is coming into effect with Headwinds.</p>







<h2 id="h-headwinds-will-be-here-in-24-hours">Headwinds Will Be Here in 24 Hours</h2>



<p>Headwinds is an all-new update coming to ARC Raiders tomorrow. Embark Studios’ extraction adventure title suffered a little over the festive break with stagnation and some issues with cheaters and exploits, but now it’s all systems go. The team recently published a roadmap that covers four months of content, including tomorrow’s Headwinds update.</p>



<p>We’re not getting a new ARC Raiders map or large-scale enemy until <strong>April</strong>, but there’s still plenty on the way.</p>



<p>Per the ‘leaked’ trailer, we know that Headwinds is set to include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Solos vs Squads matchmaking mechanics</li>



<li>New map condition – Bird City</li>



<li>Project: ARC Trophy Display</li>



<li>New cosmetics: The Sandwalker set</li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>The first item on the list was previously known as the ‘LVL 40+ Matchmaking Option’, which left players wondering what that might look like. Nobody predicted it would be a solos vs squads mode, but it’s certainly a place for the most capable players to strut their stuff.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, we can imagine that Sandstorm will be an offensive map condition that forces players indoors, much like Cold Snap did, while the Sandwalker set will be themed very much <strong>on </strong>that condition.</p>



<p>The ARC Trophy Display project will give players something to aim for over the next few weeks. It’s likely a construct that pops up in your Raider Den that gives you the option to display literal trophies from the ARC enemies you slay outside Speranza.</p>

            <p>Blizzard has teased a selection of big reveals starting the 29th January, which will cover almost its entire repertoire of games, including World of Warcraft, Diablo, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hearthstone">Hearthstone</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>.</p>
<p>In a short but fancy video laden with nostalgic props and retro PC set-ups, a history of big Blizzard moments are panned over. The purpose being to celebrate 35 years of Blizzard history, with four days dedicated to the next chapter of select games.</p>

</p>
<figcaption>You can watch this Blizzard 35 teaser here.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYsAssECbR4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>In the description of the teaser we can see the following game-specific showcases:</p>
<ul>
<li>World of Warcraft: 29th January 9am PT / 12pm ET / 5pm GMT / 6pm CEST</li>
<li>Overwatch: 4th February 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm GMT / 7pm CEST</li>
<li>Hearthstone: 9th February 9:30am PT / 12:30pm ET / 5:30pm GMT / 6:30pm CEST</li>
<li>Diablo: 11th February 2pm PT / 5pm ET / 10pm GMT / 11pm CEST</li>
</ul>
<p>What's interesting is the teaser itself ends with a selection of logos placed under the words' Blizzard 35', including games not included in that list. This includes the logos of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/heroes-of-the-storm">Heroes of the Storm</a>, and Starcraft.</p>
<p>Starcraft itself is an interested absence from the list of showcase days, especially given the recent reports of <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/crazy-blizzard-stories-with-jason-schreier-unlocked-661">an in-development Starcraft shooter</a>. However, how far through development this project is, or if it's even made it past the R&amp;D stage, has yet to be confirmed.</p><p>It's certainly a big year for Blizzard in terms of releases and major updates. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-warcraft-expansion-midnight-release-date">World of Warcraft is getting its Midnight expansion soon</a>, as well as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> Lord of Hatred update. But who knows? Maybe even bigger surprises are around the corner. World of Warcraft: Classic fans have been begging for an expanded version of the original MMO, <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/classic/news/did-blizzard-just-drop-another-hint-for-classic-379737">which is an idea the developers haven't crossed out</a>.</p>
