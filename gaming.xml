            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-speed-freeks-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Plaion and developer Caged Element have revealed the&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Speed Freeks&nbsp;</em>release date, and the chaotic combat racing game is heading to PC via Steam Early Access later this summer.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://press.plaion.com/WARHAMMER-40000-SPEED-FREEKS-EARLY-ACCESS-LAUNCHES-ON-AUGUST-6" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a>,&nbsp;<em>Speed Freeks&nbsp;</em>crashes the Early Access party on August 6th, which is also when the game's first season will begin. It'll be free-to-play, too, so it won't cost you anything to check it out.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Speed Freeks</em>, it's a car combat game that revolves around&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k</em>'s Orks, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-40k-10th-edition-orks-previewed">biologically-engineered race of violence-obsessed xenos</a>. Who better to "drive" (ahem) a game about blowing other players to smithereens with bumper-mounted rocket launchers?</p>

<p>If you're a fan of games like&nbsp;<em>Twisted Metal&nbsp;</em>or even <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/review/mad-max-review-praise-angel-combustion">2015's&nbsp;<em>Mad Max</em></a>, then you should know what to expect here; Orks brightening up the grim darkness of the 41st millennium with their signature brand of gleeful anarchy.</p>
<p>When the game launches, you'll have a choice between two core game modes: Deff Rally and Kill Konvoy. In the former, you'll compete to capture points and control them before sprinting to the finish line, while the latter sees you protecting a Stompa and attempting to destroy its counterpart on the enemy team.</p>
<p>You can check out the new&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Speed Freeks&nbsp;</em>release date trailer, which gives a good sense of just how chaotic this one's going to be, right here.</p>

<p><em>Warhammer 40k: Speed Freeks&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2078450/Warhammer_40000_Speed_Freeks/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on August 6th, and a full release is coming later this year.

On a dark and stormy night, a young boy asks his not-at-all creepy clown-looking attendant to tell him a story. The attendant dives into a tale about the War of the Reapers, a (fictional) conflict between humans and demons. Humanity only prevailed thanks to forging five armlets, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lord-rings-lotr-gollum-kotaku-review-worst-game-2023-1850606133&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lord-rings-lotr-gollum-kotaku-review-worst-game-2023-1850606133"><em>Lord of the Rings</em></a></span>-style, with the power to contain the demons. The story ends and the attendant reveals that many years have passed, and now England and France are engaged in their own war that has lasted close to a century. This is the (historical) conflict known as the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hundred_Years%27_War" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hundred Years’ War</a></span>, and the boy is Henry VI, King of England. To change the tides of war the attendant, John of Lancaster for you history buffs, calls upon those demons of old. I cannot stress enough how hard this goes, despite being admittedly silly. Just imagine someone having no previous knowledge of what this game is about and getting the twist that it’s about a real conflict between England and France. Oh, and there are demons involved.</p><p>After that amazing opening, we finally meet our heroine, a young woman in the village of Domrémy, named Jeanne. To get the action started, the game sends Jeanne and her friend Liane into the woods to search for a missing man, Roger. In their search, the two women come upon a dead knight and a small group of demons. Jeanne finds a mysterious armlet on the knight, picks it up, and begins to hear a voice. Then combat begins. </p><p>In the few encounters I’ve had so far, the game’s combat is pretty standard tactical RPG fare. You and the enemy take turns moving and attacking until you meet the encounter’s win conditions, usually just taking out all enemies. Soon, Jeanne activates the power in her armlet and gets a sick <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/we-tried-to-uncover-the-long-lost-american-sailor-moon-1827695456&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/we-tried-to-uncover-the-long-lost-american-sailor-moon-1827695456"><em>Sailor Moon</em></a></span> transformation that dresses her in badass armor. The new fit also lets you use special abilities, like one that gives you an extra turn of movement after defeating an enemy. In one encounter I was able to take out four enemies in a row thanks to smart use of that specific ability. As the game gets more complex and I learn new abilities I can only imagine how this will add to the strategic possibilities at play. </p><figure id="" data-id="3cded1142db3ae4a7d3d94e2976fc511" data-recommend-id="image://3cded1142db3ae4a7d3d94e2976fc511" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A blonde girl swings a sword at a pig-like creature in a burning village" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A blonde girl swings a sword at a pig-like creature in a burning village" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->PlayStation</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3cded1142db3ae4a7d3d94e2976fc511" data-recommend-id="image://3cded1142db3ae4a7d3d94e2976fc511" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A blonde girl swings a sword at a pig-like creature in a burning village" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Most of my first hour was spent asking questions about what the rest of my playthrough will hold. Is the voice Jeanne hears the Roman Catholic God? Is England literally in cahoots with the biblical devil? Am I going to see Jeanne burned to death before the game rolls credits? Clearly <em>Jeanne d’Arc </em>is willing to play fast and loose with the history books, so I think it’ll be kind of hilarious to see how demons pop up at the siege of Orléans—because what are we doing if the Joan of Arc game doesn’t have the siege of Orléans?<br></p><p>So far <em>Jeanne d’Arc</em> has proven to be a tactical RPG with room to grow as I get deeper into it. It is also an exceedingly silly story that I doubt will do much justice to the complexities of the real woman, and yet I can’t help but enjoy it every time the game puts demons next to historical figures. It’s like the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> of tactical RPGs and like with those games, I’m not coming back to this one for historical accuracy. I’m here for a fun time, not an educational one. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=veMD9nuQ1Xk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer</a> released today, Respawn revealed the Void Reckoning event, which includes more cosmetics and the new Big TDM limited-time mode.</p>



<p>Big TDM will introduce a 12v12 version of the classic Team Deathmatch mode. The official <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/void-reckoning-event" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> revealed further details about the mode and its balancing. </p>



<p>It will feature 5 different maps to compete on, as well as “improved health regeneration and an increased score limit of 60.”</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Apex Legends: Void Reckoning Event Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/veMD9nuQ1Xk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Void Reckoning will also add 22 limited-time cosmetics, each counting towards bonus rewards after earning 5, 12, and 17 items. </p>



<p>There will be no duplicate event items in the Void Reckoning event packs, though each pack only has one event item. Players can get these packs to earn all event items, including the “Crestfallen Stars” reactive havoc. </p>



<p>Apex Legends recently faced serious fan backlash after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-overhauls-battle-passes-abandons-in-game-ac-currency-option/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battle Pass overhaul</a>. It split the Battle Pass into two per season. </p>



<p>Notably, it also removed the option to purchase them with Apex Coins, the in-game currency. Fans must now pay with real-world currency for two Battle Passes each season to earn all content.</p>



<p>Players quickly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-review-bombed-over-new-battle-pass-move/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">review-bombed the game</a> this week, in turn causing the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-esports-world-cup-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overall community to plummet</a>. Although the Void Reckoning event has a neat LTM, it may not be enough to begin renewing interest among longtime fans.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-re-announced-with-a-much-bigger-team-and-bigger-dreams<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>When Ian Proulx and his colleagues at 1047 fully released Splitgate in 2021, his expectations for the “Halo with Portals” multiplayer shooter were fully in check. He expected it to do well enough over time, and was hoping for slow and steady growth. At the time, 1047 consisted of less than 20 individuals, and only four engineers.</p><p>“But it was like, nope, this is your moment now, everything's on fire,” Proulx says.</p><p>Splitgate blew up far beyond what Proulx ever expected or what their small indie team were ready to handle. It peaked, he says, at around two million daily active users, and the team spent the next several months in “fire fighting mode” trying to keep the game stable amid the surge of interest.</p><p>Fortunately for Proulx and 1047, Splitgate was a financial success for the team. What’s more, 1047 was able to raise an additional $100 million from investors thanks to the game’s positive reception. At first, they expected to pour that money into building and maintaining Splitgate. But in conversation after conversation, Proulx and his colleagues found they had to keep their ambitions in check due to the game’s technical and the team’s personnel limitations. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“When you're making an indie game, it's really about finding your niche, doing a few things really, really well,” Proulx says. “But then you do have to cut corners, because you don't have the resources of a Call of Duty. And so our view at the time was like, wow, we're licking our lips. We're thinking, man, we don't have to cut corners like this. What if we could do it all over again?”</p><p>Which is exactly what 1047 decided to do. In 2022, the team announced they were ending active development on Splitgate in the interest of building Splitgate 2.</p><p>“We know what Splitgate does well, and we know where it falls short,” Proulx explains. “And we also felt like our goal is we want to build one of the biggest shooters in the world. We want to be out there competing with Call of Duty, and Apex, and Fortnite. And we didn't feel like we could ever get there by continuing to iterate on Splitgate.”</p><h2>A new trajectory</h2><p>Today, 1047 has officially announced Splitgate 2 for release on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox sometime in 2025, with a first cinematic trailer showing off the sequel’s vibes and introducing its factions. Starting today, fans can download a Splitgate 2 Companion App, which includes a free digital comic series developing the lore of the universe, quizzes, collectible digital cards, and other activities. And 1047 is planning for a community play test later this year, sometime around Gamescom.</p><p>Proulx tells me that Splitgate 2 is still fundamentally Splitgate: it’s still a free-to-play (with only cosmetic microtransactions, Proulx reassures), first-person shooter with 4v4 battles. It’s still a shooter where players mess around with portals and physics to fling themselves or their enemies around at wild angles and speeds. The biggest difference between the sequel and its predecessor is the introduction of three different factions, each tailored to a different gameplay style or strategy. 1047 isn’t saying much about the details on these factions for now, though today’s cinematic trailer offers some clues as to the vibes on offer. Proulx loves lore, which is why he channeled his love of old Halo novels into the Splitgate 2 companion comic as a way to define art style, characters, and factions for the audience ahead of the game’s release. He tells me the three pillars he wants his team aiming for are “positive,” “sporty,” and “future.” </p><p>“We're not killing each other to save humanity or to defeat evil,” he says. “It's a sport. And so that reflects itself in the lore, in the art style. You saw a very small smidge of that in Splitgate, because that was always my original vision is I wanted it to be a sport.”</p><p>Apart from the addition of factions, Proulx says the most noticeable difference between Splitgate 1 and 2 is the map design. In Splitgate, he tells me, he ended up as the map designer somewhat by default. But for Splitgate 2, he hired professionals.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I want a universe that I want to live in.</p></div><p>”I had no clue what I was doing [in Splitgate 1],” he says. “Some of [the maps] are okay, but we have real level designers now who are phenomenal. And they're also, not only are they way better than me, but it's just our process. Everybody's iterating, we're play testing, we've got just much more of an iterative process. We're not afraid to test a map and throw it away and start over. And so what we've ended up with is, I think, by far our best maps ever. But also just much more actual guidelines and thought put into the maps.”</p><p>For example, he says, the walls on which players could place portals were placed “kind of randomly” in the original game. But now, with the combined experience and data from players using them over the years, the team has a better understanding of what kind of placement works well, and what doesn’t. As a result, there are fewer portal walls in Splitgate 2 than in 1, but their placement is more deliberate.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Splitgate 2 First Reveal Images</h3></div></output><p>“Splitgate was much more of an arena shooter, fast-paced, very circular motion,” Proulx adds. “With this next game, it's much more of a class-based shooter or arcade shooter where it's still fast-paced. It's still about shooting people and portaling, but it's a little bit more thoughtful, it's a little bit more strategic. The angles are a little bit more intentional and less chaotic.”</p><p>Proulx and his studio have, in some ways, dodged an industry bullet. They accumulated enough funding to make Splitgate 2 ahead of the recent industry funding crisis, and were able to scale up 1047 from less than 20 people to over 170 with senior talent from games including Call of Duty and God of War: Ragnarok. And during that time, Proulx has been obsessing over live ops, preparing the team and Splitgate 2 to handle whatever happens during its launch days and weeks. He also has a two-year roadmap for future updates – though he expects that will inevitably change based on community feedback. Whatever happens when Splitgate 2 launches next year, this time, Proulx is prepared.</p><p>“The dream truly is to build the number one shooter in the world,” he says. “That's what I'm going to fight for forever. I think though, really, if we can make a game that all the Splitgate 1 fans love and are sticking around forever, but also broadening our scope so that the people who never got to enjoy Splitgate can enjoy this game as well. That's what success would look like to me.”</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip? Send it to rvalentine@ign.com.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>With each new season, Activision typically releases a new BlackCell DLC pack, and that trend will continue with the July 24 release of Season 5 for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-597446">Modern Warfare III</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone/" data-ref-id="5000-572198">Warzone</a>.</p><p>The new Season 5 BlackCell bundle comes with a new operator, Reckoner, who sports an animated skin that "occasionally reveals the ghoul within."

                <p>Call of Duty is known for its crossover characters, but could The Crow be next? That's what fans are theorizing after Activision published the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-and-mw3-season-5-roadmap-reveal-wwes-cody-rhodes-and-rey-mysterio-as-operators/1100-6525067/" data-ref-id="1100-6525067">first details on Season 5</a>. The roadmap image includes a "classified" image of an Operator coming to the game mid-season, and people think it's Bill Skarsgard's new take on the character from the upcoming remake.</p><p>Indeed, a zoomed-in image seems to match up with the silhouette of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bill-skarsgard-takes-flight-in-first-new-crow-trailer/1100-6521850/" data-ref-id="1100-6521850">Skarsgard's rendition of the character. </a> The Crow releases in theaters in the US on August 23, so if the character is indeed coming to Call of Duty, fans can likely expect it to happen around then.</p><p>Call of Duty was also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-and-mw3-might-include-a-deadpool-wolverine-crossover-in-season-5/1100-6524622/" data-ref-id="1100-6524622">rumored to have a Deadpool &amp; Wolverine collaboration</a>, but it remains to be seen if that will happen. There was no mention or tease for any possible crossover in the Season 5 rundown. The new season is, however, adding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-and-mw3-season-5-trailer-shows-off-cel-shaded-maps-and-wwes-rhea-ripley/1100-6525062/" data-ref-id="1100-6525062">WWE's Rhea Ripley, Cody Rhodes, and Rey Mysterio.</a></p><p>Season 5 releases on July 24, with content to continue rolling out in the weeks and months after. In addition to the WWE characters, Season 5 adds new maps, weapons, and 15 minigames.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's Call of Duty Season 5 rundown to see <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-and-mw3-season-5-roadmap-reveal-wwes-cody-rhodes-and-rey-mysterio-as-operators/1100-6525067/" data-ref-id="1100-6525067">what's coming to Modern Warfare III, Warzone, and Warzone Mobile.</a> The next Call of Duty game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/" data-ref-id="1100-6523361">Black Ops 6</a>, launches in October, but the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta-dates-how-to-get-in/1100-6524124/" data-ref-id="1100-6524124">multiplayer beta kicks off in August. </a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-layoffs-come-for-everyone-big-and-small.930834/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/axis-studios-collapse-closed-layoffs-vfx-animation<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The<a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> mass layoffs that have hit video games over the past year</a> are a tragedy on a number of levels. There's of course the tragedy for those immediately affected: families uprooted, careers derailed. There's the wider tragedy for all of us: shuttered studios and cancelled projects are signs of an increasingly precarious industry, and means there will be fewer video games to enjoy.</p><p>To be aware of the former involves knowing those affected directly. To learn of the latter--or for the latter to be reported in the media so that people are able to learn--it's usually a company that's well-known, or it's a game you're aware of that has been binned. But not every closure is going to resonate with the wider public. Axis Studios is the kind of place that lived its life under the radar of most fans. Yet its "<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gvqlezn1o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collapse</a>" this week is a huge loss, for those personally affected (<strong>obviously</strong>) but also for fans and the wider industry, because over the years Axis made some <em>very cool shit</em>.</p><p>As an animation and VFX studio, Axis was rarely in the spotlight, because everything it made tended to be part of something else, for somebody else's thing. But they've been behind the scenes for over two decades now, creating clips that you might not know by name, but will definitely <em>know</em>.</p><p>Let's start with <em>Dead Island's</em> 2011 announcement trailer. One of the most famous and effective video game trailers of all time, it was a three-minute film so powerful that it damned the actual game, which couldn't hope to recapture the same energy:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Dead Island Reveal Trailer (North America)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/72b1rSqawgk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>More recently, if you played <em>Halo: Infinite</em>, you would have sat through the game's lavish cinematic intro sequence. Axis made that too:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Halo Infinite | Campaign Opening Cutscene" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pHJmfFFsYLs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>As an example of something bigger, if you have kids and/or enjoy Christmas, you might have seen Netflix's <em>Scrooge </em>movie, which Axis animated:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Scrooge: A Christmas Carol | Official Trailer | Netflix" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tZylTiyaWV8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In the past decade Axis has created trailers and cinematics for<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqnxnOH5FDCJX8l5T_H1kMv-8YDAlKk8C" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Halo</em>, <em>Gears of War</em>, <em>Elder Scrolls</em>, <em>Deathloop</em>, <em>League of Legends</em>, <em>Clash of Clans</em>, <em>Dawn of War</em>, <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Age of Empires</em>, <em>Destiny</em>, <em>Crackdown </em>and <em>Alien Isolation</em></a>. Just to name a few. The showreel below highlights some of their animation work from just the last 12 months:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Axis Studios Stylized Animation Reel 2024" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PYkYYc1xcY8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Axis was founded 24 years ago, but found itself forced to close this week due to "severe cash flow problems", which<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cv2gvqlezn1o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> administrators say</a> was due to "a decline in customer projects, as well as increases in labour costs". Those are hollow terms that don't really do the situation justice; Axis actually found itself just<a href="https://defector.com/inside-hollywoods-visual-effects-crisis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the latest casualty in a VFX and outsourcing crisis</a> that has been decimating animation and effects studios the world over.</p><p>The studio's collapse leaves 162 people out of work, and every single project in production Axis had been working on has now been halted. Four employees remain, cruelly, to "help <a href="https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/winding-up" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wind up</a> the business".</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Unlike the previous roadmap revealed by the two studios, this one applies only to&nbsp;<em>House Flipper 2</em>; the first game will get its own separate roadmaps from here on out, since it's still getting regular updates and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/house-flipper-dine-out-dlc-lets-you-flip-restaurants">DLC drops</a>.</p>
<p>First up,&nbsp;<em>House Flipper 2&nbsp;</em>is getting a major update sometime this summer, and it'll bring a new environment in the form of Old Pinnacove, where you'll find new renovation jobs, as well as new features like resizable curtains and text messages from clients when jobs are complete.</p>

Halloween-themed features like new decorations, Gothic furniture, and more will also be added.</p>
<p>The winter update will round off&nbsp;<em>House Flipper 2</em>'s three seasonal updates for this year, bringing a new snowy job, a winter-themed house, and, well, snow, as well as other seasonal additions.</p>
<p>PlayWay and Frozen District are also planning to begin the open beta period for&nbsp;<em>House Flipper 2</em>'s co-op mode in Q4 this year, and a new DLC will be announced around then as well, although we don't know what that DLC will be just yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/house-flipper-2-roadmap-interior.jpg?itok=uVP5_O8L 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/house-flipper-2-roadmap-interior.jpg?itok=pYd3mDG0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You're about to get a whole lot more&nbsp;<em>House Flipper 2&nbsp;</em>in your life.</figcaption></figure><p>The two studios also say they've got "a couple of aces up [their] sleeves" for this year, hinting that pools could be on the agenda, so watch this space for more info on that.</p>

To achieve that, Microbird cofounders Regina Reisinger and Philipp Seifried told Game Developer that they aimed to make a game that can feel like a "temporary home"—the kind that can take players on a digital vacation of their own.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Dungeons of Hinterberg"><span>Dungeons of Hinterberg</span> is a mix of Persona and Swiss culture</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Seifried and Reisinger said they began work on what would become </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeons of Hinterberg</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. They were big fans of how the Persona games use a day/night cycle to let players explore urban Japan, and observed that no one had used that framework for a game set in Europe.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Switzerland's game development scene is still relatively small, and few developers from the region have explored the aesthetics of the Swiss countryside—most famously the Swiss Alps. Hinterberg is inspired by the town of Helstadt, but the pair said they took inspiration from many towns when they ventured out of Vienna on research trips.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Taking those trips helped them think about how even though they were Swiss citizens, they weren't all that different than the international travelers passing through after seeing videos of the Alps on social media. "We both grew up more in the city," Reisinger said. "We're familiar with these small towns but we're also kind of outsiders...on the one hand, it's your home country and you know the landscapes, but at the same time you are a bit of a tourist if you come to such a small village."</span></p><p>Image via Microbird Games/Curve Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Capturing that sensation led to an interesting challenge for designing Hinterberg itself: the town had to feel like a small Austrian village, but it also needed the aesthetics of a tourist trap to dial in that "vacation" feeling.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The sensation of being on "vacation," or treating games as a temporary home, seems to be close to Seifried's heart. "If you go on vacation, there's a new place you get to explore. You have your home base there—usually your hotel—and you have your daily routine. That's something that's in [games], right?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This concept adds another layer of fun to the magic abilities players unlock when they visit different zones. In each hub area out in the world, players get access to a pair of magical abilities, designed to uniquely interact with puzzles in that region. Trekking up and down the hills to find different dungeons becomes akin to a small hike, with magically-solved puzzles having the feel of tourist activities instead of world-altering power.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This peaks when players visit the top of the mountains themselves in an area called Kolmstein. In this snowy region, players get access to a snowboarding ability that lets them shred the slopes and grind rails. Using the snowboarding power outside of combat or puzzles shows how Microbird captured the sensation of mindlessly gliding over the hills. It's one of many ways where </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeons of Hinterberg</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> rewards idle play over relentless progression.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Microbird Games' small team meant it needed a &quot;generalist&quot; design philosophy">Microbird Games' small team meant it needed a "generalist" design philosophy</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Asking Reisinger and Seifried about the game's social system—where players choose an NPC to spend time with each evening to boost stats and unlock abilities—led to a conversation about the nuts and bolts of developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeons of Hinterberg</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. I'd asked them how they made the system manageable despite the small team size.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We didn't," was the sheepish answer I got back. Seifried admitted it was "four hard years" for himself and Reisinger, the only two members of the studio who would work any overtime. "There's probably not a lot of teams of our size that would tackle a project this big and ambitious, but if you do that you reap a lot of benefits just from the fact that... in order to do something like this, everyone must wear several hats."</span></p><p>Image via Microbird Games/Curve Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Seifried wrote the game's story, was the lead programmer, and designed the engine used for cutscenes. That meant when he was penning dialogue sequences, he could think about what the cutscene tool was capable of displaying, and also what he could improve in said tool when he got back to work on it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Likewise Reisinger also pulled double duty with the level designers, and knew how to block out spaces to make her artwork more efficient. "Being a small team with everybody being trained in more than one discipline gives us a lot of opportunity to figure out how to do something big as this without tons of meetings, iterations, and friction," said Seifried.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You'll fund some of that swiss-army-utilitarianism in Reisinger's art as well. The game jumps camera perspectives and gameplay styles to enable puzzles, high-speed snowboarding, combat, and exploration. She was already inspired by the clear lines and flat colors of French and European comics, but also took inspiration from Sony Animation's Spider-Verse films.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most assets were built in 3D without intensive concept art, and don't require tons of texture work—not every asset requires normal maps, Seifried added. This art style also makes it easy to bring in third-party assets.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Reisinger summed it up like so: "We built stuff to be as usable in different contexts as possible."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The pair seemed ready to take a vacation of their own after </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeons of Hinterberg</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> ships, both of them saying they'd love to crunch "far less" on their next game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But Seifried did note that making a vacation-themed game helped make the crunch tolerable. "If you're going to work overtime on your project, try and find a project where you work on a vacation [setting]," he joked. "That place, over time, will feel a lot more pleasant than if you're doing a survival horror game."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

			<p>A new Cyberpunk 2077 mod released online today introduces a fix for a major path tracing issue that impacts visuals considerably while also introducing some new HD textures.</p>
<p>The Preem Fixes mod, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/15800?tab=files">Nexus Mods</a>, addresses the stationary shadow mesh seen phasing through cloth, an issue that has been in the game since its implementation of path tracing but has yet to be fixed. The fix, however, renders cloth flat, and it doesn't interact with light as it should. In addition, a second version of the mod also introduces new HD textures for cloth, which look considerably better than the low-quality, vanilla ones.</p>

<p>Even though CD Projekt Red has concluded the development of Cyberpunk 2077, the game is still set to receive additional content and features thanks to modders, including an <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-mod/">online multiplayer mode</a>. Even without mods, however, the game is in an excellent state, mostly thanks to the massive 2.0 update and the excellent Phantom Liberty expansion. You can learn more about them with Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty builds upon what was an already great game to deliver more fantastic storytelling (with a spy thriller theme, this time around), exciting combat, and very high-quality side content. The perk tree overhaul is a major improvement to progression, and additions like vehicle combat and the overhauled police system are very welcome, albeit not game-changing. If you've been holding out on Cyberpunk 2077 until now, you'll find a huge game with over 120 hours of quality content and an incredibly immersive game world to literally lose yourself in. On top of that, it's by far the most beautiful and technically advanced game available if you have the hardware for it (PC and RTX 40 GPU).</em></p>

<p>In a new interview <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/fallout-season-2-red-white-and-royal-blue-sequel-amazon-tease-1236076344/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Variety</a>,  Jennifer Salke and Vernon Sanders discuss the current state of Fallout Season 2, which is reportedly on schedule and apparently making swift progress.</p>



<p>Vernon Sanders, head of TV, revealed that “I think we’re ahead of schedule, in terms of being able to get Season 2 back.” </p>



<p>They clarified that the creative team still can’t offer a concrete launch date or window. However, Sanders did add that “we’ve already gotten scripts in hand.” This should give fans a better idea of the development timeline.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In addition to Fallout’s schedule, Amazon MGM Studios chief Jennifer Salke addressed rumors about season 2 shifting to an anthology format. Some fans believed it would allow the writers to explore the wider lore of the series. </p>



<p>In today’s report, Salke did express some interest, saying “it does have a lot of doors we can go through.” However, they reinforced that the show will continue the storyline of the existing characters established in season one. Salke clarified that “we are fully committed.”</p>



<p>The new interview closely follows an impressive series of Emmy nominations for Amazon’s live-action Fallout series. The show earned <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-emmy-nomination-predictions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">16 Emmy nominations</a> total, many of which pointed to The End episode.</p>



<p>Amazon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-tv-show-renewed-for-season-2-at-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">greenlit Fallout Season 2</a> just a week after the series premiere. The creative team recently stated it believes the show can <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-tv-show-five-seasons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last five seasons</a>.</p>

<p>Several other new features have also been added, including new garage upgrades, the ability to paint your car headlights and light parts, and a new Juke Jet car part that lets you dodge to the side. Just like in real life!</p>
<p>Ironwood also says it's added "expanded worldbuilding" elements to&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em>, including new points of interest, new explorable rooms, and more. Make sure you keep an eye out for them on your travels.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squads-second-season-adds-frozone-esque-mrs-freeze<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Ahead of the launch of Suicide Squad's second season, Rocksteady has detailed the playstyle of Mrs. Freeze.
</p>
<p>
We've known of her existence already thanks to a roadmap, but now her unique traversal abilities have been revealed in a <a href="https://www.suicidesquadgame.com/en-us/community/season-of-frozen-hearts-available-july-25">new blog post for Season of Frozen Hearts</a>, as well as more about the Frozen Elseworld environment.
</p>
<p>
If you've seen Frozone from Pixar's The Incredibles film then you'll have an idea of what to expect from Mrs. Freeze, who can use her Ice Path to glide over land and through the air with ease. She can also create loops and platforms to dash around battles and shoot enemies from above.
</p>

<p>
<a aria-label="Let's Play Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League - IS IT A QUINNER OR A SINNER?" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aZS4HXe3-_E?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>

As with other characters, Mrs. Freeze has three playstyles: Cooler, which provides a freezing tank style of play; Physicist, which focuses on buffing melee and Shield Harvest; and Technician, which enhances her gear for traversal and shooting.
</p>
<p>
But who even is Mrs. Freeze? As the blog states: "Victoria Frias is an ice-cold, self-sufficient survivalist who has watched her Elseworld turn to ice as Brainiac's invasion took hold. By the time we meet her in Season Two, she has spent years as the last holdout of her dying planet, unwilling to leave her cryogenically frozen wife behind. But after being recruited by the Squad, she may have the chance to save her - and unleash icy hell."
</p>
<p>
First, though, players will need to persuade her to join the Suicide Squad by completing a series of Incursions to locate her.
</p>
<p>
Season two will take place in the new Frozen Elseworld, where Mrs. Freeze has sabotaged Brainiac by sending the entire planet into an ice age. Expect arctic conditions as well as bursts of lava and ice storms.
</p>

<p>
The season will also add new gear, much of which is appropriately icy. Further, the new Battle Pass will add outfits themed around Toyman and classic Arkham outfits.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-second-season-gets-last-minute-delay">Season of Frozen Hearts will launch on 25th July after a short delay</a> announced just ahead of the previous release date last week. It follows the first season, which added <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-first-season-kicks-off-with-the-joker-this-month">iconic villain The Joker</a>.

</p>
<p>
However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has reportedly "fallen short" of Warner Bros.' expectations</a>. Are enough players interested in this second season for it to be considered a success?

		<p>C-Smash VRS: New Dimension has a release date, with the flatscreen port of the excellent VR sports game launching for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> on 26th September. A free update for existing owners on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PSVR 2</a>, the game will also feature hybrid online multiplayer.</p>
<p><iframe title="C-Smash VRS New Dimension - Release date and Hybrid-Online-Play Announcement (ESRB)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jWd1t7BDklw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>New Dimension switches C-Smash VRS from first person VR to third person, much like arcade and Dreamcast original that inspired it. To do this there’s a whole bunch of new gameplay mechanics, animations (like a charge shot flip) and visual tweaks.</p>
<p>Underneath it all, this is the same minimalist game of space squash, and that’s allowing RapidEyeMovers and Wolf &amp; Wood to cater to cross-format multiplayer. Whether playing on TV, on PlayStation Portal or with a PSVR 2 headset on your noggin, you can play against and with all other players. PS5 vs PS5, PS5 vs PSVR 2 or PSVR 2 vs PSVR 2.</p>
<p>The new version of the game is available to play at BitSummit Drift this weekend.</p>

<p>Since its launch last June exclusively for PSVR 2, C-Smash VRS has been supported with several major feature updates, including an endless mode, co-op play, AI opponents, more levels, more music and plenty besides. In April it was also released for&nbsp;Meta Quest and Pico standalone VR headsets.</p>
<p>In our<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/14/c-smash-vrs-review/"> C-Smash VRS review</a>, I wrote, “With the simplicity of squash and block smashing at its core, C-Smash VRS is a virtual racket sport delight. The bat and ball physics are tricky to master, but stick to the easier Zen mode, or play with a friend in multiplayer and co-op, and there’s plenty of joy to be had here.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/splitgate-2-brings-back-chaotic-portal-based-arena-shooting-next-year.930732/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/splitgate-2-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>1047 Games has announced&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>, a sequel to its successful 2021 portal shooter. The game is due to arrive on PC and consoles sometime next year.</p>
<p>Per a press release, the sequel will retain the fast-paced portal-hopping first-person shooting of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/splitgate">the original</a>, but since it's been built from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5, it'll feel like a totally different beast.</p>
<p>This time around, you'll get the chance to choose between three unique factions: the "agile" Aeros, the "time-manipulating" Meridian, and the powerful Sabrask. They'll duke it out across a "large variety" of arenas and modes, wielding a range of weapons as they do so.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/splitgate-2-announcement-gameplay.jpg?itok=j_EriBgN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/splitgate-2-announcement-gameplay.jpg?itok=_JaLUAwT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>brings back the fast-paced portal-shooting action of the original next year.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not entirely clear whether the new game will have a stricter class-based system that makes it more akin to a hero shooter than a standard arena FPS, but 1047 says&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>will offer "multiple playstyles and loadouts for strategic team setups" within factions.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you want to know more about your particular faction, you'll be pleased to know that 1047 has <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">released a companion app</a> that offers the chance to delve into the background lore of the game, and that the first installment of a "five-issue comic book series" offering further lore explorations is available today.</p>
<p>You can take a look at the&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>announcement trailer, which shows off some of the game's characters and factions, right here.</p>

<p>Per an official&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.splitgate.com/faq" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FAQ on the game's official website</a>, the sequel will be free-to-play, just like its predecessor. It won't have a single-player campaign, but it will have different gameplay modes that offer "distinct experiences".</p>
<p>1047 is refusing to be tied down to a release window more specific than 2025, but the developer does jokingly say that&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2&nbsp;</em>will be released in one of the year's twelve months. Thanks for narrowing it down, guys!</p>
<p>For&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>, 1047 CEO Ian Proulx says he's recruited an "all-star team", with the studio's staffers currently comprising people who've worked with studios like 343 Industries, Bungie, and Riot.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here's hoping all of that experience translates into success for&nbsp;<em>Splitgate 2</em>, which launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2918300/Splitgate_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010012" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/splitgate-2/9pf5q1b0fhsl" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a> in 2025. Stay tuned for more.</p>

If you <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price">read or watched my review</a> when it came out, you’ll know I think the Vision Pro is sort of an end point for one set of technologies, and I wanted to know if Matt felt the same and what needs to happen to make all of this more mainstream and accessible.</p><p>Matt’s overall point is that it’s tempting to think that the metaverse just fizzled out after the huge explosion of hype that came after Facebook renamed itself to Meta, hype which the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23451629/meta-quest-pro-vr-headset-horizon-review">lackluster Quest Pro</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/6/23391895/meta-facebook-horizon-worlds-vr-social-network-too-buggy-leaked-memo">messy Horizon platform</a> couldn’t really live up to. And hype which eventually got totally washed away by the arrival of generative AI. </p><p>But the metaverse didn’t just disappear. The major players — Meta, <em>Fortnite</em> maker Epic Games, <em>Roblox</em> — are all still plugging away at the idea, albeit gradually. While Meta and Apple go head-to-head on hardware, the gaming companies whose engines make the 3D internet come to life are still working on some of the core technical ideas — like interoperability and what combination of AR and VR consumers actually want.</p><p>That’s all while game makers contend with an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172733/summer-game-fest-video-game-announcements-layoffs-labor-live-service-fortnite">industrywide downturn that’s led to waves of layoffs</a> in addition to a pretty stark lack of consumer enthusiasm in the whole metaverse concept. Combine all of that<em> </em>with some intense backlash against both AI and crypto, and you can start to see why we’re not racing as fast toward this next-generation internet as we might have once thought. </p><p>Matthew and I got into all of that and more, and he makes his case for why the ideas that power what we think of as the metaverse today are a whole lot bigger than just buzzwords and futurist predictions. He’s optimistic that we’re still on the path toward this new, spatial, or more 3D version of the internet — progress is still being made and that maybe these booms and busts are just part of the trajectory from where we are now to where we might be in the future.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Splitgate developer 1047 Games has today said it will launch the sequel to its surprise hit indie shooter in 2025. 
</p>
<p>
The original Splitgate racked up 22m downloads, and received a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-review-the-appliance-of-science">positive reception to its mix of fast-paced Halo-esque combat with the ability to traverse portals, Portal style</a>.
</p>
<p>
Splitgate 2's pitch is clear. All of the above, but now with a bigger budget and with a much larger roster of veteran development talent - including people who worked on Halo back in the day.

<p>
"The original Splitgate's development was ambitious but scrappy,” said Ian Proulx, co-founder and CEO of 1047 Games. "The game was created from a dorm room, and the massive success and community it earned surpassed our wildest dreams.
</p>
<p>
"This time around, Splitgate 2 has been designed from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5 to deliver the AAA FPS experience our fans deserve, with the series' signature action completely overhauled by an all-star team composed of the most talented individuals in the industry."
</p>
<p>
Not mincing his words, Proulx went on to describe Splitgate 2 as a "revolutionary step forward for competitive shooters", a fresh entry point for newcomers, as well as a worthy upgrade from the original for those who bought that.
</p>
<p>
PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S versions of Splitgate 2 are all on the way next year. 
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, there's the first episode of a new digital comic series and unlockables for the upcoming game over at Splitgate.com, and a new Splitgate companion app available today via iPhone and Android. 
</p>
<p>
Word of a sequel does not come as a surprise. Back in 2022, 1047 Games explained it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-is-ending-feature-development-so-dev-can-focus-on-new-game-in-same-universe">stepping away from further updates to the original Splitgate</a> to work on something new in the same universe - something that was built on UE5 and launched as a free-to-play game. And indeed, two years later, here we are! One to keep an eye on for 2025.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-about-finding-a-family-and-saving-the-world-with-them-says-bioware/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As part of the ongoing Game Informer monthly coverage, BioWare has <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/07/17/bioware-on-returning-to-the-dragon-age-series-10-years-after-inquisition" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussed</a> its focus on companions for Dragon Age: The Veilguard in greater depth. Creative Director John Epler stressed that the game's storyline will feel like finding a family of people and saving the world with them.</p>
<p><em>Dragon Age has always been about characters but to some degree, it's almost felt like we've lucked into that. Inquisition is a story that ultimately, you, the main character, have the biggest part to play. We wanted to tell a story this time where you literally cannot save the world without these characters. Beyond that, though, we also wanted to give them their own arcs that can run parallel to the main story and really give them that kind of deep storytelling our fans really enjoy.</em></p>
<p><em>They [the companions] have their friendships, they have their rivalries, and lean into that concept. You're not just pulling together a bunch of people who will do whatever you say. You're assembling a family, and that becomes the core of what the Veilguard is all about. It's about taking this group, this found family, and saving the world, side by side with them.</em></p>
<p>Former franchise producer Mark Darrah, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-mass-effect-team-helping-mark-darrah-advisor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returned</a> as a consultant on Dragon Age: The Veilguard, clarifies:</p>
<p><em>The thing that is so amazing about Veilguard is this is the game where we finally said out loud that BioWare's greatest strength is telling stories through characters. If you go all the way back to Baldur's Gate 1, Baldur's Gate 2, these games are telling stories through characters, but there wasn't an intentionality behind that. And in this game, we're finally putting that intentionality first and foremost, putting the characters first, building the game around that, around those character moments, which is really the best way that BioWare knows how to tell stories.</em></p>
<p>Darrah also said that the development team is now much more knowledgeable with the Frostbite engine. That, coupled with the greatly improved hardware capabilities, will provide a level of visual quality that wasn't really possible in previous games. For example, each character now moves in a certain way instead of moving exactly like the others.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard is scheduled to launch at some point this Fall on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.
