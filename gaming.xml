            <p>Atari 50 was already a fairly comprehensive offering of retro games spanning half a century, launching in late 2022 as a playable museum of sorts charting the classic publisher’s output across arcade machines, the 2600, 5200, 7800 and Jaguar home consoles, 8-bit computers and the Lynx handheld. The more than 100 games included at launch was far from stingy, with an extra dozen being added in a free update at the end of last year. Now the collection will add almost 40 more games in an upcoming ‘Expanded Edition’, taking its total game count to over 150.</p>

</div>
<p>The Expanded Edition of Atari 50 will add the games across two additional interactive timelines, dubbed The Wider World of Atari and The First Console War. As with the collection’s other playable histories, the games will be presented in chronological order alongside various insight into their development in video segments, interviews, advertisements from the time and other “historical artefacts”.</p>
<p>The Wider World of Atari will take up 19 of the games, including Berzerk and a look into the creation of Breakout, while The First Console War will delve into the battle between the Atari 2600 and Mattel’s Intellivision with 20 more games, including several prototypes. Funnily enough, Atari settled the apparent conflict by purchasing the rights to Intellivision earlier this year.</p>
<p>Atari 50’s Expanded Edition will be offered as both DLC for the existing game and a standalone collection by itself. We’re yet to get a full rundown of the games included or how much it’ll cost, but expect a release on October 25th.</p>

			<p>Around three months after the launch of Dragon's Dogma 2, CAPCOM is now asking fans to submit their feedback on pretty much every aspect of the action RPG <a href="https://jp.research.net/r/p_dd2?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via a dedicated survey</a>. Doing so will be rewarded with a new digital wallpaper.</p>
<p>Interested fans will have to vote on the following topics:</p>
<ul>
<li>The naturalness, style, and readability of the text for the language you played Dragon's Dogma 2 in</li>
<li><span>The voices for the language you played in</span></li>
<li>The size of the in-game text</li>
<li>The design of the font used in the subtitles</li>
<li>The game's menus</li>
<li>The game's sound effects</li>
<li>The music</li>
<li>The story</li>
<li>The characters</li>
<li>The graphics</li>
<li>The controls</li>
<li>The game mechanics (combat, in-game currency, leveling up, etc.)</li>
<li>The User Interface</li>
<li>The level of difficulty</li>
<li>The amount of content</li>
<li>The immersive factor</li>
<li>Whether Dragon's Dogma 2 provided a unique gaming experience</li>
<li>An overall rating for the game</li>
<li>Whether they would recommend it to friends</li>
</ul>
<p>The long-awaited action RPG sequel sold well, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-breaks-3-million-units-sold-milestone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">breaking the 3-million milestone</a> and pushing the Japanese publisher to <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-announces-upward-revision-for-earnings-forecast-following-favorable-dragons-dogma-2-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revise upward</a> its original sales forecast.</p>
<p>However, Dragon's Dogma 2 definitely has some areas that could be improved. In my review of the game, I <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>:</p>
<p><em>The original game was an amazing foundation to build upon, and yet CAPCOM seemed content with keeping the same strengths without improving much on the weaknesses. Twelve years later, though, the effect cannot be the same. Still, make no mistake: Dragon's Dogma 2 is a highly enjoyable fantasy action/adventure with RPG elements that will provide you with about 40 hours of pure fun. Its peerless sense of exploration, meaty combat system, and stunning visuals will motivate you throughout the entire playthrough. Just don't expect to find a fantasy world simulator or, indeed, a narrative worth remembering.</em></p>
<p>The original Dragon's Dogma was expanded a year later with Dark Arisen, which added a whole new endgame dungeon and more. Given the positive sales of the sequel, CAPCOM could choose to do the same while also improving some of the shortcomings. Stay tuned - we'll keep you abreast of the publisher's plans.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24186312/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-erdtree-difficulty-too-hard-git-gud</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring%E2%80%99s-popularity-has-changed-the-whole-difficulty-conversation-for-the-dlc.912159/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24186312/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-erdtree-difficulty-too-hard-git-gud<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="NsCbAV">It wouldn’t be a FromSoftware release without some perennial discourse over difficulty, and while <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> follows suit, this time, there’s a twist. Players aren’t debating whether or not FromSoftware’s notoriously difficult games should offer an easy mode or better accessibility options, nor is the community sneering and telling people they should simply “git gud” (derogatory). This time, we’re seeing hardcore fans bemoan the grueling nature of the new DLC, if not saying that game director Hidetaka Miyazaki has gone too far. </p>
<p id="RjC3j5"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> employs an unusual mechanic that attempts to mitigate the likelihood of players jumping into the DLC with overleveled characters. While you still retain your base stats when entering the Land of Shadow, the DLC-specific location has new upgrades — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24178006/scadutree-fragment-locations-all-where-to-find-sote-dlc">Scadutree Fragments</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24178007/revered-spirit-ashes-locations-all-where-to-find-sote-dlc">Revered Spirit Ashes</a> — that dictate how much damage you can deal and withstand while in this new realm. The more of these upgrades you have, in other words, the better you’ll do; the game has also recently been <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24186316/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-patch-notes">updated</a> to make these upgrades even stronger. This system also means that players who have likely spent hours building and optimizing their characters are, in some ways, being forced to start from scratch. Without these new embellishments, run-of-the-mill enemies can and will destroy your character if you’re not careful. The developers warned this would be the case before <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> came out, with Miyazaki outright stating he believed the team had <a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/elden-ring-creator-hidetaka-miyazaki-talks-shadow-of-the-erdtree-new-weapons-and-more/">“pushed the envelope” of what could be “withstood” by players</a>. </p>
<p id="io9sZZ"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24180518/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-dlc-fromsoftware">Reviews</a> for the expansion were also published ahead of its actual release, and while many critics wrote about the DLC’s difficulty, as a whole, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> was well received. Right now, <em>Elden Ring</em>’s expansion is <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/">sitting on a 95 on Metacritic</a>, which the grading system deems to be “universal acclaim.” Despite this, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review">a Eurogamer review</a> that gave the expansion three stars out of five caused a fan outcry. According to these fans, who again were reading this review before playing the DLC themselves, the critic had made the mistake of saying that the game seemed too difficult this time. Worse, the critic wasn’t sure if they had the motivation to try and trudge through certain parts of it.</p>

<p id="hDMl1p">“This, however, feels like difficulty for difficulty’s sake, turned up to eleven, perhaps because with the added expectations of a DLC having something extra-absurd to conquer even though it technically doesn’t require finishing the core game,” the reviewer wrote of one particularly egregious optional boss fight. “I go through dozens of deaths over a period of several days, and despite taking breaks to go off and do other things and explore other areas, I realise that I just don’t want to do this anymore.”</p>
<p id="842QFq">This admission was not well received by some fans, especially given the larger, ongoing stereotype that game journalists are bad at games and therefore not fit to judge a series where part of the point is to suffer (“Prepare to die” was an official tagline for the first <em>Dark Souls</em>, after all). Replies to Eurogamer’s <a href="https://x.com/eurogamer/status/1803066963595239443">post on X</a> (formerly Twitter) linking the review often chastised or tried to humiliate the reviewer for the perceived crime of believing the difficulty had not been well tuned. As of this writing, top responses say things like “It was to hawd fow you?”, “Perhaps stick to something like Mario it might be more your speed,” and of course, the obligatory “get good.”</p>
<p id="8amng9">The irony here is that the review spends a good chunk of its word count expressing frustration with how much the expansion tries to hand-hold the player. Specifically, the reviewer felt that the expansion doesn’t seem to trust the player to figure out what they should do, often signposting in an unusually overt way. This, the reviewer suggests, robs the player from earning a sense of discovery and worse, makes some of the unique obstacles trivial. As an example, the review mentions that the game outright tells the player to not let specific enemies see them, so the reviewer equipped an item that made sneaking around easier.</p>

<p id="3wVXWc">Ultimately, though, 3 out of 5 is not a bad score — and again, as a whole, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> has been reviewed well. But for some fans, this didn’t matter. Social media posts questioning the credentials of the reviewer went viral despite the fact that many of these people clearly didn’t read the full review. Then, once players finally got their hands on the DLC, karma reared its judicious head. </p>
<p id="DfvP9w"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/">On Steam</a>, the <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC dropped down to a “mixed” rating, which is a harsher verdict than the expansion’s <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/">Metacritic score</a>. Some of these reviewers simply aren’t happy with <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s poor performance on their PCs. But an unusual number of the negative reviews on the DLC’s store page admit that for them, the expansion was unfairly brutal. “Filled to the brim with uninspired, unfun boss fights that rely on incredibly annoying features to make them ‘difficult,’” one negative review reads. “I dont mind learning how to fight hard bosses but if you’re simply murdered half the time for missing a roll I think some of the numbers should be re-evaluated,” another states. “Well this game isn’t just hard, it’s artificially hard,” another claims.</p>
<p id="wZz027">The frustration with <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s bosses spans beyond Steam players. On Google, negative reviews also cite the outrageous difficulty. “The scaling is ridiculous, every enemy does insane damage whilst you do relatively little damage,” states a one-star review. The top review on that platform deems the DLC to be 8/10, which, while a positive score, also begins with the judgment that the developers “overdid the difficulty.”</p>
<p id="ChgvnN">The most visible repudiation of <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> comes from an unexpected source, however: influencers who play games for a living. “I think the DLC is too hard to be fun,” said popular Twitch streamer Asmongold.

<p id="0Vejbq">For some, all of this will come off as a case of people getting a taste of their own medicine; after years of looking down on players who felt defeated by FromSoftware games, these elitist players are finally finding themselves in the same boat. At the same time, much of this phenomenon is transpiring during a pivotal moment for FromSoftware games as a whole. <em>Elden Ring</em> is by far the Japanese studio’s best-selling game, by orders of magnitude compared to its other titles. Arguably, it’s the game that’s brought the genre to the mainstream; even celebrities like <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/06/18/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-review/">The Weeknd and Travis Scott were excited for <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a>. </p>
<p id="dr4hQx">Those in the know are aware that FromSoftware games have been hugely influential to the video game industry as a whole, but for a long time, these have been relatively niche games. This means that <em>Elden Ring</em> is likely now being played by a huge group of people who don’t have any of the experience, memories, or baggage that come with the genre and its notorious difficulty. These are fresh faces who haven’t grown tired of arguing over whether or not the games should be this harsh, and they’ve certainly not been privy to judgments from fanatics who have strict ideas about how the games should be played. </p>

<p id="Ij24Hb">As a series that’s built a name for its unforgiving nature, FromSoftware games have attracted a fandom that prides itself on overcoming challenges. Sadly, some of that attitude has gotten warped over time, leading some players to add even more stipulations for what is and isn’t considered admirable. In the case of <em>Elden Ring</em>, conservative players have considered specific play styles less valid than others. Things like using summons, which are NPCs who can help the player during specific moments, or spirit ashes, which are ghostly buddies that can also help the player with certain designated battles and boss fights, have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/qtsyad/are_spirits_this_games_easy_mode/">often been deemed as “easy mode”</a> by players who have spent years beating FromSoftware games without additional help. Many FromSoftware games — including <em>Elden Ring</em> — also have a system for summoning other players to help with various in-game challenges. Again, according to the most intense subsection of FromSoftware fans, using these in-game tools is an admission of weakness.</p>

<p id="G6xYIN">In a way, this restrictive attitude has been implicitly reinforced following the popularity of Twitch streams. In order to stand out, Twitch streamers often make up challenges to beat FromSoftware games. There are players who beat games like <em>Elden Ring</em> at low levels and with basic gear, or with unexpected tools like musical instruments, dance pads, and even brain waves. Twitch streamers who feel pressure to entertain their audiences therefore have a stake in having the games present a challenge, but not one that is so insurmountable that it leads to an unsatisfying viewing experience.</p>
<p id="P7NR9E">Players who review games on Steam or Google because they’re dissatisfied, or streamers who play games for a living, are hardly representative of a community composed of 25 million people and counting. When you look at discussions about <em>Elden Ring</em> outside of these highly specific contexts, the evolution of the community and its attitude is palpable. It’s practically become a meme that players are relying on things like spirit ashes to help them survive the Land of Shadow, especially the Mimic Tear, which creates a copy of the player to take on foes. The Mimic Tear has all of the abilities that the player does, but with fewer weaknesses: It can withstand multiple attacks that would normally kill the player.</p>
<p id="9VdcXK">Even if it’s provided by the game and therefore meant to be used, longtime FromSoftware fans still clearly feel justified in calling spirit ashes “broken.” Despite this, the much larger current community for <em>Elden Ring</em> doesn’t seem to think less of people who use spirit ashes; if anything, the player base seems to be bonding over it. On Reddit, some of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dnz7mc/these_bosses_are_beating_my_ass/">most popular</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dnrzv9/mimic_tear_haters_after_the_first_weekend_of_the/">common threads</a> are jokes about the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dnygrs/after_every_boss_fight_in_the_dlc/">seemingly universal</a> reliance on spirit ashes. Rather than looking down on it or ridiculing it, using tools like the Mimic Tear is now outright encouraged by most players.</p>
<p id="QQP5UQ">Even the much-reviled “get good” attitude seems to have shifted. In a video by the popular YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@penguinz0">penguinz0</a>, he doles out some tough love for players who dislike <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s difficulty. He tells people to get good. At one point, this phrase would undoubtedly reflect a toxic, gatekeeping attitude about who gets to enjoy FromSoftware games. Here, it’s merely encouragement to put aside your pride and use the tools at your disposal. “Get good” now means getting familiar with those tools over trying to brute force your way through a game without any aids.</p>
<p id="prRxP2">“Every Souls game has always been a series where it’s as difficult as you make it,” he says. “There are broken builds that you can use… There are full-blown mechanics that are there to help you through difficult challenges. With summoning, you can just use a Mimic Tear to help you go through a boss.”</p>

<p id="cG33gX">Most of the time, when a niche series breaks through to the mainstream, it’s because something about the latest game has become more accessible. Compared to older games, <em>Elden Ring</em> appears to fit that bill. The shift to open-world mechanics means that, unlike in some prior FromSoftware games, you don’t have to repeatedly bash your head against a wall if you’re stuck. You can go and take on something simpler, get stronger, and then come back to that initial challenging section and perhaps overcome it. But rather than doubling down on what made <em>Elden Ring</em> so approachable in the name of catering to these fans, FromSoftware has tried to thread the needle. While <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is, as mentioned by the Eurogamer review, more explicit about where to go or what to do, overall, the DLC is much more punishing on the player, especially when it comes to bosses. Sure, you can hop into a battle with <em>both </em>an in-game summon and your Mimic Tear at the same time, but the foe waiting on the other side of the fog mist still packs a wild multi-hit combo that can one-shot you.</p>

<p id="Ph1ADm">The emphasis on challenge is so pronounced this time that it has encouraged the now larger player base to be softer with one another. Rather than defining this larger community, the vocal assholes are now far more outnumbered and seen for exactly what they are. FromSoftware, meanwhile, gets to enjoy the successes of creating a blockbuster without having to compromise the vision that built the genre in the first place. </p>
<p id="y5aZOB">“If we really wanted the whole world to play the game, we could just crank the difficulty down more and more. But that wasn’t the right approach,” <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/21/hidetaka-miyazaki-fromsoftware-elden-ring-shadow-erdtree">Miyazaki told The Guardian in an interview</a>. “Had we taken that approach, I don’t think the game would have done what it did, because the sense of achievement that players gain from overcoming these hurdles is such a fundamental part of the experience. Turning down difficulty would strip the game of that joy – which, in my eyes, would break the game itself.” </p>

However, if you want to give Atlus more of your money, <em>Vengeance </em>adds two extra quests that you can purchase for $5 USD a pop. The first of these is the Sakura Cinders of the East DLC, which players are expected to access around the midpoint of their adventure. The default store pages for this DLC don’t disclose many more details than this, so to help you decide if it’s worth your cash, here’s everything the pack entails.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Sakura Cinders of the East is a level 47 quest in <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</em></strong>.

As long as you can complete the two battles required to finish the quest, your actual level is irrelevant.

If you haven’t gotten to the Tokyo Diet Building yet, then you’re almost certainly too low-level to be doing this quest anyway. Just keep playing!</p><p>Once you return to the Tokyo Diet Building, go through the exit on the south side of the Terminal Room. In the next room, keep running down the hallway and go down the staircase. Talk to the Head Researcher, and select the “Offer assistance” option.

This is very convenient, since <strong>Crusher Onslaught has low accuracy, and missing just one party member is enough to cut its turn short</strong>. Additionally, Oyamatsumi is weak to the Mirage status ailment, which lowers its accuracy even further.</p><p>All told, you can coast to victory by harassing its hit rate with Mirage and spells like <strong>Sukunda </strong>while buffing your party’s accuracy and evasion in turn. You’ll want to avoid bringing party members weak to Ice to be safe, but that’s about it. <strong>Oyamatsumi is weak to Fire</strong>, so use any fire elemental attacks you have and you’ll crush this golem in no time at all.</p><p>With your victory in hand, you can now return to Konohana Sakura.

You’ll still want to zap her with electric attacks, just keep an eye out for whether or not she has a shield up.</p><p>Honestly, Konohana Sakura isn’t especially challenging. Her main gimmick involves using <strong>Sakuya Sakura</strong>, which heals her and buffs all her stats. If her stats are raised, she can activate the <strong>Oath of Plenteousness </strong>passive, which boosts her healing potential. To best handle this, keep her stats debuffed (as you should against many enemies in <em>Shin Megami Tensei</em>) so she can never activate her own passive.

She natively learns <strong>Zandyne</strong>, <strong>Agidyne</strong>, and <strong>Maragidyne</strong>, allowing her to hit enemies weak to Force and Fire damage (just like the version of her you defeated). </p><p>However, the star of the show is <strong>Sakuya Sakura</strong>, which is honestly a little <em>too </em>good. This Unique spell will heal your party’s HP, MP, <em>and </em>raise everyone’s stats by one stage whenever it’s used. The MP healing is relatively minor, but it still restores ~35 MP per party member once her <strong>Oath of Plenteousness </strong>passive activates (which technically requires just one cast of Sakura Sakura). This spell is a flat-out upgrade of Idun’s Unique Golden Apple spell, which is already very good. Sakuya Sakura even has the same MP cost, despite also providing MP regen.<br></p><p>The only arguably negative trait of Konohana Sakura is that her Magic stat is good, but less than Idun’s. Also, you’ll likely want to cover her Thunder weakness with <strong>Resist Elec</strong>, which can be hard to access via Essences early on. Otherwise, she’s a very good demon that you’ll almost certainly take with you into the endgame just for the sheer turn economy that Sakura Sakura provides. You certainly don’t need Konohana Sakura to beat <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</em>, but if you have her, enjoy her and the crazy buffs she can apply!<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Bethesda Softworks did not always publish the beloved post-apocalyptic RPG game series Fallout. The game’s original creators are Interplay Entertainment, and they were responsible for delivering the first title in 1997. Recently, a series co-creator spoke about what it would take to bring him back to Fallout. Learn more about what he said below.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Timothy Cain, the highly revered American video game developer and one of the co-creators of Fallout, is a passionate advocate for game development. His substantial presence on YouTube is a testament to his dedication, as he regularly speaks about various aspects of game development. His recent videos have touched on making games, cancelling Fallout Van Buren, writing good NPCs, and much more. Notably, Cain published a video yesterday discussing what it would take to bring him back to Fallout.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Would I Work On Fallout Again?" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/c21OGTOoxso?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Cain starts by stating that “Would I work on Fallout again?” has been among his most frequently asked questions in the past few months. He explains that the answer is more “complicated” than we think. The first thing Cain wants to know is whether he will be remaking the first Fallout from a 3D perspective, creating a remake like New Vegas, or maybe Fallout 5.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Cain explains that every RPG he has worked on till now has had something new and different to offer, which was nothing related to “money, power, authority” or anything along those lines. It was “the game itself” that captivated his interests and got him motivated. He says that was also one of the reasons why he didn’t work on Fallout 2, as it wasn’t adding anything new for him, and he doesn’t like working on sequels. Cain spoke about this before giving examples of what games like Wildstar, Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodline, Dungeons and Dragons and more offered him in terms of “something new”.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fallout 4 - Launch Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X5aJfebzkrM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Cain added that he had been approached for several games and decided not to work on them because there was nothing new for him to experience. He has had people asking him to “work on a new IP” or be a “director again”, but that is not something that interests him. Cain also spoke about how money is a factor, and he wants to be paid according to his experience and accolades in the industry. So there you have it; if Bethesda wants Timothy Cain on the next Fallout title, they need to serve him something “new” to get him on board.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the topic of Fallout, we recently saw a collaboration between the Bethesda RPG and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-dutys-fallout-update-goes-live-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a>. Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-next-fallout-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Todd Howard has stated</a> that they don’t wish to “rush” the next title. What do you think about Timothy Cain’s requirement to return to Fallout? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-alters-meet-the-jans-aka-the-many-alternate-reality-versions-of-yourself-ign-first<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Have you ever wondered what you’d do if you ever ran into another version of yourself? What you’d say? How they’d act? What kind of haircut they’d have? Whether or not you’d be proud of them, and vice versa? How their life would be different from yours? Where they live, what they do for work, who they are?</p><p>Well, imagine being stranded on a hostile planet and having to create, manage, and work with several versions of yourself to survive. That’s the predicament Jan Dolski finds himself in in The Alters, the latest from This War of Mine creator 11 bit Studios. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-alters-branching-narrative-explained-ign-first"><u>In a previous interview with game director Tomasz Kisilewicz and lead designer Rafał Włosek</u></a>, we talked about how The Alters handles branching narratives, but what about the alters themselves? Who are they?</p><p>To truly understand The Alters, you need to, well… understand the alters. To do that, we played the Steam demo so we could meet a couple of them in person, and then sat down with game director Tomasz Kisilewicz one more time to get a better idea of who the other Jans were, how many of them there are, and perhaps most importantly, how they interact with you and each other. The interview that follows has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Alters - Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p><strong>IGN: We’re going to encounter a ton of other Jans on our journey. Can you talk about building a character whose branching paths could lead to such dramatically different people?</strong></p><p><strong>Tomasz Kisilewicz:</strong> When designing the character of Jan, we really wanted to create the everyman type of character. We felt this way it would be easier for people to relate to him, understand his backstory and the choices that he has made in the past and the choices that shaped him. And it was crucial for Jan's background to have those points of regret, because from these points we can branch into drastically different scenarios of how his life could turn out if he had made some different choices along the way.</p><p><strong>IGN: So far we’ve seen the Technician, the Botanist, the Refiner, and the Miner. How many Jans can we expect to run into in The Alters? How did you go about deciding what these different types of Jans would be, and how they’d impact The Alters?</strong></p><p>We needed to build a variety of Jans, not only for gameplay reasons, but also to create a compelling story of Jan and truly dive into the topic of the “what if?” question. Different alters, have very different skill set that strongly affects your strategy in the game. You can't create all possible alters in a single playthrough. So the decision on who you bring on board will affect the way you handle the base and how you handle your objectives.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Having various sets of characters with very different personalities will strongly affect our story and also create very different dynamics between Jans. When it comes to how many alters we can create, when you look at the cover of the game, there are 11 characters and I think it gives a good sense of magnitude. But we have some surprises up our sleeves about that. So I don't want to spoil the fun, and I think I will leave it at that.</p><p><strong>IGN: Based on the demo, the first Jan you’ll create is the Technician, who is basically just a more competent version of our Jan, despite taking a very different, less traditional path at an early age. Why did you choose to start off with the Technician?</strong></p><p><strong>Kisilewicz: </strong>We decided to start with the Technician because, in many ways, he is the polar opposite of the main Jan and he is more competent in some ways, while at the same time, he can be quite flawed in others. But what's interesting about him is he always keeps challenging our Jan. That's why he's so useful at the very early stage of the game when we are onboarding the player with the whole idea of engaging in the relationship with your alters.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Jan and the Technician, they branched out quite early in their life paths. The Technician is someone who stayed with his family. He stood up to their abusive father, something that the main Jan was never able to do. And that's why he's a very important axis of the story of our main Jan because that's one of his biggest regrets that he has.</p><p><strong>IGN: One of the immediate differences between Technician Jan and our Jan is that Technician Jan is a little more standoffish, and much more assertive, which seems like it came from the decision to stand up to Jan’s father, and has influenced a lot of his decisions since. Can you talk about how the decisions each Jan makes influence not only their skills and profession but as a person, and how we might see that play out?</strong></p><p><strong>Kisilewicz: </strong>From the point of branching between Jans, their lives can go in very different directions. It's like this butterfly effect where changing one little decision can affect your entire life and in the end make you a different person. So understanding those differences helps us understand alters as people, and in the end, helps us effectively manage our crew.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Different Jans can react to our decisions in different ways. For example, one of them can expect us to be a very efficient and mission-oriented leader. While the other might want us to be more empathetic towards the rest of the crew. And pleasing everyone won't be easy, if not impossible. </p><p><strong>IGN: As you interact with the Jans, you can see their responses in real-time, and that seems to determine their reactions to what you see and how they view you. Can you talk about how your choices affect your relationships with the Jans or influence their behavior?</strong></p><p><strong>Kisilewicz: </strong>The alters have their emotional state that affects how they work, how they behave. And if it's not managed well, it can lead to some drastic results, including rebelling against us. We can influence their emotions both through economic strategic decisions that we make, and also through interactions.</p><p>A big part of the game is dialogue, and actually, every dialogue choice in the game affects the emotional state of our alters. So it is crucial to understand who they are, and where they're coming from, because different approaches can work better with different alters. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Alters - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p><strong>IGN: The more Jans you get, the more complicated it seems those relationships will become. Can you talk about how the Jans react to other Jans? Do you have to mediate disputes? Do they get jealous if you don’t hang out with one of them enough or become friends with another Jan they don’t like?</strong></p><p><strong>Kisilewicz: </strong>The more Jans we create, the more different dynamics between them are generated, and that can of course lead to fights and arguments. We have a chance to intervene or pick one of the sides. For example, alters can argue about the quality of food in the base. One can think we should invest in a better quality to food while the other thinks that this is a waste of precious resources. So every time we make a promise, we need to make sure we can fulfill it, otherwise there will be consequences.</p><p><strong>IGN: Speaking of getting along, a large part of whether Jan and the other Jans get along seems to be shared experience, which you can track via the quantum computer in the base. Jan bonds with the Technician by trying to recreate the pierogi their mom made when they were kids. Is it harder to relate to the other Jans if your common experiences diverge more drastically, and if so, how do you deal with that?</strong></p><p>The relationship between Jans is always about what we have in common, but also what makes us different. And that can lead to both emerging conflicts, but also it can help us in resolving them. So no matter how far different Jans are from each other on the branches of the tree of life, there is always something we share. There is always something we have in common. It’s just that, sometimes, it will require us to do a little bit more digging to find this common ground.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>IGN: Can you tell us about the other Jans, and give us some insight into what we might expect of them? Do you have a favorite Jan that you’re excited for players to meet?</strong></p><p><strong>Kisilewicz: </strong>With Jans you can expect the unexpected. We put a lot of effort into creating these multi-layered characters that you'll uncover piece by piece. At first, when you learn the life path of one of the Jans, you feel like you understand that character just by knowing what he went through. But then you go deeper and deeper and you are uncovering different surprises in not just his outlook on things, but also how he behaves, how he interacts with us, and how he interacts with other alters.</p><p>I do have a favorite alter, although it's a bit like picking your favorite child. [Whispers] It's the scientist.</p><p><strong>IGN: Obviously, it might be a little weird if several Jan Dolskis came back from this mission. Is that something we see the Jans discuss? Does that cause friction in the group? How do they deal with that?</strong></p><p><strong>Kisilewicz: </strong>Between alters, there is this question of “what's going to happen to us?  What is our future? Do we even have a future?” And the closer we get to actually going back home ,this question will raise more and more tension inside the base. Different alters are different people, so they also differ in their outlook on this topic. That will put even more pressure on us as a captain regarding what are we going to do about it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>IGN: This question may be a bit silly, but can I create multiple versions of the same Jan? Can I have five Technician Jans running around if I want to?</strong></p><p><strong>Kisilewicz: </strong>Something we knew very early on in development was that we don't want to allow to create multiple versions of the same alter. First of all, the game was never really about cloning. So multiplication of the same character, it's an extremely interesting topic, but it's just not the topic of our game. But most importantly, we always wanted alters to feel like real people with real emotions and real stories. We were afraid that making too many of them would make them more of an NPC or a unit in the game rather than a character with his own thoughts and emotions. So we felt that increasing the number of them might, in the end, reduce their significance as individuals.</p><p><strong>IGN: Is there anything we haven’t covered about the Jans that you’d like folks to know about?</strong></p><p><strong>Kisilewicz:</strong> I think the biggest surprises about the alters lie in their backstories, in their storylines, in the situations they can generate. So we really can't wait for the players to start unraveling it all and start making their own decisions about the shape of their crew, about what alters they bring on board, in what order, and most importantly, what decisions they make about the alters and about the fate of our main Jan.</p><p>Our month of exclusive IGN First content is almost over.

            <p>We’re only a couple of days away from the early access launch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail">Dawntrail</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy XIV</a>’s latest expansion and first in over two years since the climactic Endwalker. As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-is-looking-summer-ready-as-we-explore-the-new-land-of-tural">the summery story expansion</a> prepares to drop, Square Enix have run down everything else arriving in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a>’s 7.0 patch, which notably includes its long-awaited graphical overhaul along with several other nice-to-have improvements whether you’re playing Dawntrail or not.</p>

<p>As well as Dawntrail’s story quests, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-14s-new-cyberpunk-city-has-me-hoping-dawntrail-will-shower-more-love-on-the-series-best-entry">locations</a>, dungeons and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-14s-new-jobs-bring-a-splash-of-splatoon-and-pokemon-to-its-dawntrail-expansion">new jobs</a> - we won’t spoil anything here - 7.0’s headline feature is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-14s-long-awaited-graphics-update-in-70-will-look-better-than-the-dawntrail-benchmark-yoshi-p-promises">total visual overhaul</a> of the now decade-old game. Comparisons in the 7.0 patch notes show just how much sharper we can expect environmental textures to look, with other polishes including more fluid animations, better hair and skin textures on characters, softer shadows and more light sources, and various other additions down to more subtle eye movements, glasses lenses, and effects for water and wind. There’ll be some technical additions too, including support for FSR and DLSS upscaling for AMD and Nvidia users respectively, TSCMAA anti-aliasing and an alternative SSAO using GTAO. Plus DualSense owners can now use the PlayStation controller natively on PC.</p>
<p>In case the graphical changes make your character look a bit different, everyone will be gifted a Fantasia to let them remodel their character for free rather than having to buy one from the real-money shop. Character creation itself has been expanded with new lighting options, combat voice line previews and a 60-minute grace period during which you can hop back in to tweak your appearance without using another Fantasia. There’s some new hairstyles and the option to combine glasses and hats for the first time, too.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/027df51f6c2c3d792f33cbc4430ef648e989722d">patch notes</a> are extensive, but a few other quality-of-life changes stand out. The first is especially well-timed given the inevitable rush of players working their way through Dawntrail’s main scenario: you can choose to hide other players around quest-giver NPCs, either when you’re just nearby or when you’re interacting with them. It’s a small but welcome tweak that should help with the mess of trying to click on an NPC amid dozens of fellow Warriors of Light.</p>

<p>The other change is to Final Fantasy XIV’s stealth missions that involve tailing a certain NPC. While there aren’t many in the MMO, the few that are required can be a frustrating exercise in suddenly being spotted and having to restart. Now, NPCs will have a very clear indicator around them that shows whether you’ll be spotted if they turn around, along with a glowing AoE-like zone around them when you need to stay clear.</p>
<p>I’m also personally relieved to see you can now just click on an emote icon in the Duty List when having to perform specific emotes during a quest, rather than typing them out everytime.</p>
<p>There’s plenty more - such as new house furnishings, including a light fitting that looks suspiciously similar to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-14s-perfect-steamed-bun-animation-puts-its-blocky-grapes-to-shame">Endwalker’s iconic low-poly grapes</a> - all of which will be available once FF14 returns from going offline for maintenance ahead of the new expansion tomorrow.</p>
<p>Don’t forget - as if you need me to remind you - that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-14-braces-for-dawntrail-login-queues-with-plans-to-limit-travel-and-crack-down-on-afk-players">there’ll be new queue and AFK measures in place</a> to help alleviate the expected server slam caused by Dawntrail’s arrival too, so maybe steer clear for a bit unless you absolutely plan to be making your way through the new expansion and don’t mind waiting a while to get in.</p>

  <p id="1rOjqz">Nothing beats having a new comic book in your hot little hands and settling in for a good read. Fortunately, 2024 has delivered fantastic comics from every side of the industry — and there are lots more on the way. </p>
<p id="VakCfQ">But for now, these are Polygon’s best comics of the first half of 2024. Stay tuned for more!</p>
<p id="aQzuHb">Comics were considered eligible if they were graphic novels published for the first time in 2024 or series that were collected for the first time, or published their final collection, in 2024. Everything on this list is available in paperback or collected form for your eager hands — no worries for trade-waiters.</p>

<p id="Ox1WLk">I’ve never read a cartoonist that makes me feel the space between each panel as strongly as Taiyo Matsumoto. He doesn’t have to fill a page with the buzzing of cicadas or the pulse of a city’s streets for me to hear them in my ear; on a deep instinctual level he knows what two images juxtaposed together will create that ambience, and fill his pages with room tone. He is a master of quiet.</p>
<p id="wZtyMW">There are also few cartoonists as loud as Matsumoto. His distorted figures and grotesquely expressive close-ups are a gonzo hallmark of his work like <em>Tekkonkinkreet</em> or <em>Ping Pong</em>, which makes the still moments in those stories stand out all the more.</p>

<p id="IoJsx6">Yet <em>Tokyo These Days</em> has none of those moments of noisy bravura. It’s a more restrained, somber work, about Shiozawa, a career manga editor who surreptitiously decides to quit the business. Yet before he fully settles into retirement, he gives himself a final to-do list: to meet with several struggling cartoonists he used to work with and ask what happened to the love and passion that once lived in their stories, to see if there is any bit of romance left in the medium that wrung them all out. Burning out has never looked so beautiful. —<em>Joshua Rivera</em></p>

<p id="wYN2YC">Skybound Entertainment’s stealth launch of an interconnected G.I. Joe/Transformers setting was one of the best-kept comic book secrets of 2023. What has become clear as the Energon Universe has rolled out, however, is that <em>Transformers</em> is among 2024’s best comics set in <em>any</em> interconnected brand universe. </p>
<p id="ojPMOV">Daniel Warren Johnson’s <em>Transformers</em> is a war comic where the tanks and planes can punch and kick and vertical suplex each other off of cliffs — and it’s some of the most beautiful action put on the page this year. There’s more of a sense of scale and weight in any given panel of <em>Transformers</em> than there is in the whole of a Michael Bay movie. And when it comes to implied motion in a static image, Johnson is simply one of the best in the business.</p>

<p id="xx7XCu">But for a book that’s 90% the wildest “giant robots that can turn into cars and planes” action you’ve ever seen, the stakes are as small and personal as the families of precocious teens Spike and Carly. The real miracle of <em>Transformers</em> is how Johnson keeps it all pinned to an emotional ground — and when the fights are so good, that’s saying something. —<em>Susana Polo</em></p>

<p id="Up9JxM">There is a tendency to overrepresent the contribution of writers in discussions about comics, especially when they loom as large as Jonathan Hickman. So it’s something that <em>Doom </em>doesn’t<em> </em>even open with his words, but with late rapper MF Doom’s. “Living on borrowed time/The clock ticks faster” begins the stand-alone one-shot, cribbing the opening bars of “Accordion,” a track off the era-defining album <em>Madvillainy</em>. It’s a good tone-setter: The writer, like the reader, is just along for the ride. </p>
<p id="DdMvbz">The wonderfully kinetic artist/writer Sanford Greene is the MC here, setting the stage for a story about the greatest villain in the Marvel Universe at the end of everything. This wouldn’t be the first story about Doctor Doom as the last man standing between a version of the Marvel Universe and a Galactus gone mad — but it is perhaps the most thrilling. <em>Doom</em>’s lean, mean script sets the stakes as big as they come, and then gets out of the way to let Sanford Greene absolutely rip, folding the character’s entire history into one cosmic battle. His linework is unrestrained chaos fitting the story’s scope, with Greene and colorist Rachelle Rosenberg rendering the end of the world in magenta and green.</p>

<p id="W4nVjq">In a fallow era for American superhero comics, <em>Doom</em> is a goddamn meteor streaking across the sky, with metaphors made flesh wrestling above all of existence. The magic trick Greene and Hickman pull here is a very old one, when you think about it. Here it is, the bare minimum of what a good superhero comic should be, spun into one of the coolest damn books you can read. Straw spun into gold. —<em>JR</em></p>

<p id="ZSyEw3">In 2017, Emil Ferris’ debut graphic novel, <em>My Favorite Thing Is Monsters</em>, exploded out of nowhere to become one of the most acclaimed books of the 2010s. Presented as the spiral notebooks of Karen Reyes, a precocious grade schooler who loves art and creature features, the comic was dazzling in its voice and density. Through Karen’s monster-obsessed eyes, Ferris gave readers a vivid ballpoint-pen portrait of ’60s Chicago and its sex workers, queer and BIPOC denizens, and related outcasts as Karen attempts to solve a murder and uncovers a family secret. </p>
<p id="TC5QIH">The first half of a two-volume work, <em>My Favorite Thing Is Monsters</em> spent seven years suspended on a cliffhanger as a dispute <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/my-favorite-thing-is-monsters-author-emil-ferris-interview.html">between Ferris and publisher Fantagraphics</a> kept the fate of <em>Book Two</em> in limbo until now. Ferris’ struggle to publish this voluminous work has not been in vain — <em>My Favorite Thing Is Monsters Book Two</em> is as awe-inspiring a conclusion as its predecessor was an opening act. </p>
<p id="QB5RtF">Following the template set by the first volume, Karen’s journals depict a girl dealing with tumultuous change within and without, in parallel with the city around her. Under Karen’s pen, fictitious monsters are a comfort as she comes to grips with a life more perilous than she realized, one haunted by gangsters, crooked cops, and killers that threatens to swallow her and her older brother Diego alive. Answers to the questions posed in the first act elude her in the second — and the ones she does find are overwhelming.</p>

<p id="ngARxt">Ferris has done something incredible in these two volumes. She’s crafted a coming-of-age story like no other, a comic that considers the ways we have made monsters out of the innocent so monstrousness can run rampant, and funneled all through the pen of a 10-year-old unaware she’s experienced a lifetime of horror. She draws herself as a little werewolf to cope, but also maybe to inspire. There are good monsters and bad monsters, and it’s on us to decide which we’re going to be. <em>—JR</em></p>

</p>
<p id="g3yHal">A crime drama lives or dies on its tone, and a detective series lives or dies on its hook — and <em>Newburn</em>, a modern noir crime drama with the structure of a detective series, lives quite well indeed. </p>
<p id="s3Rrkt"><em>Newburn</em>’s tight two-volume story<em> </em>introduces Easton Newburn, private detective, as he takes on an apprentice partner. The twist is that Newburn doesn’t work for just anybody: He’s the neutral party that all of New York City’s organized crime families depend on to get to the real truth. Writer Chip Zdarsky spins up a cadre of murder mysteries where the answer is never just whodunit but “who’s gonna pay for it without throwing the city into gang war,” while artist Jacob Phillips’ understated colors and linework belie just how talented you have to be to make a book with this many conversations feel tense and dynamically staged. </p>

<p id="hAwWNN"><em>Newburn</em>’s<em> </em>marriage of crime comics and the odd-couple detective duo slides easily into the most compelling questions of both genres: This detective is the best at what he does, but has he left his humanity behind him?

<p id="w2akOY">In addition to streaming movies like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23068332/top-gun-maverick-review-tom-cruise"><em>Top Gun: Maverick</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23674416/dungeons-and-dragons-movie-honor-among-thieves-role-play"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</em></a>, Paramount Plus with Showtime is also the home to culty favorites like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22553973/evil-season-2-review-paramount-plus"><em>Evil</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24065955/sonic-knuckles-tv-series-paramount-plus"><em>Knuckles</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/22865685/yellowjackets-theories-lost-cliffhanger-twist-showtime"><em>Yellowjackets</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23955524/the-curse-nathan-fielder-a24-show"><em>The Curse</em></a>. If none of those titles grab your attention, remember that Paramount Plus is also the home for the entire Star Trek franchise as well.</p>
<p id="v4Gcsb">While getting rid of ads is the most obvious advantage of signing up for the Showtime bundle, the Premium plan also allows you to download content to your mobile device for offline viewing. Considering this deal is the same price you’d usually pay for a year of the ad-supported Paramount Plus Essential plan, there’s an advantage to giving this deal a look before Paramount Plus raises its prices at the end of the summer.</p>

You can also put a weapon on your car and use the turret to damage enemies until you’ve completed the challenge. Or you can simply hang out the window and shoot your gun at someone.

<p>Have you ever noticed that some of the largest AAA games on the market are announced earlier than before? How it always feels that when  a big game is revealed, it’s still five, six, or seven years off at least? It’s something that many wonder why and now one prominent developer is giving his insight into what that reason could be.</p>



<p>Mark Darrah is known for being the creator of the Dragon Age series and is currently working as a consultant on the new Dragon Age: The Veilguard. He also has his own YouTube channel where he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NK0vKRf0_c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recently addressed the topic</a> of why AAA games take so long to release.</p>



<p>While the nearly 25-minute video is worth a full watch for the insight from Darrah, one thing he said that really stood out has to do with a potential fear within the studios making the games.</p>



<p>“There might be reasons why it’s important for the studio or the publisher to have that game in the public consciousness,” Darrah said. </p>



<p>“It might be because the publisher’s slate is a little weak, and they want the public to remember it still has important games in its back pocket. It might be because the studio wants the game announced because they’re worried the publisher might kill it otherwise.”</p>



<p>He added that it’s not usually the best strategy for building up attention and hype for the game.</p>



<p>Aside from that possible fear, Darrah says that just because a studio says it’s working on a game, that doesn’t mean it’s full effort or focus is on that game when it’s announced.</p>



<p>“Studios can kind of be misleading on this front, because they’ll say things like ‘we’ve started work on Elder Scrolls 6’, or they might even a trailer for the game even though the current team size is under 10 people,” he said. </p>



<p>“So they’re giving the impression that this is parallel development, that the team is working on this game, when in fact it’s a few people having a few meetings, and not much is being done.” </p>



<p>There’s also the likelihood that when games are 10 or so years apart, no work is likely being done on that game for the first few years.</p>



<p>On top of this fear, other factors that go into it are things like the size of the game, the team working on it, a focus on more intricate features, and more.</p>



<p>You can watch his full video on the topic below. Again, it’s highly recommended.</p>

While another sequel doesn't seem to be on the horizon, the original game is getting a second redo in Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster.</p><p>Capcom announced the new remaster alongside a teaser trailer that brings back the series' original protagonist, Frank West. But unlike the 2016 HD remake of Dead Rising, the Deluxe Remaster appears to be a completely updated take on the 2006 game with a look that's closer to Capcom's Resident Evil remakes from the past few years.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aL8m3OaJ2g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9aL8m3OaJ2g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Although there's no gameplay in this teaser, the core premise of the title appears to remain the same. Frank is a photojournalist who is looking to get the story of a career by dropping into a zombie-infested mall for 72 hours. Presumably the remaster will once again allow Frank to deal with the zombie hordes in his own inventive fashion, while adding a few new tricks to his arsenal.</p><p>Capcom hasn't announced a release date for Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, but it will be coming to the current generation of consoles. And if this return to the franchise is successful, perhaps we'll finally get Dead Rising 5 some time down the road.</p>

			<p>Borderlands 3 free Epic Game Store</p>		</div><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The July 2024 <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> monthly games have been revealed, and PS Plus subscribers – across all of Essentials, Extra and Premium – are being taken to the Borderlands with this trio of games.</p>
<h2>What are the PS Plus June 2024 games?</h2>
<p>The following three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, 2nd July.</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Borderlands 3</strong></li>
<li><strong>Among Us</strong></li>
<li><strong>NHL 24</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a> saw the long awaited return of the co-op looter shooter, with another blast of, well…. blasting stuff to smithereens! Jason said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/18/borderlands-3-review/">our review</a> that “I like it and it’s fun to play, but it could have been so much more and the writing feels like time traveling back to your high school days and being surprised and a little disappointed at how immature everyone is.”</p>

<p>If you enjoy your time with Borderlands 3 from the monthly collection, and are subscribed to PS Plus Extra or Premium, then make sure to also check out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/30/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-review/">Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</a> which is in the PS Plus Catalogue. It struck a much better writing and humour balance for Jason.</p>

<p>Following on from that is a game that’s really rather sus. The social gaming sensation <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/among-us">Among Us</a> is being chucked onto PS Plus to get more people chasing each other round, doing tasks on space ships and pointing fingers at one another when someone ends up being found dead.</p>

<p>And finally we have another of EA’s sports games, which might help you feel a little bit cooler as we get waves of hot summery weather. NHL 24 will let you take to the ice rink with the latest take on pro ice hockey.</p>
<p>So, what do you think of this month’s games?</p>
<h2>Can you still get the June 2024 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>You can still grab June’s titles up until the new set of game’s arrives on 2nd July, so make sure to grab one of the best beat ’em ups of recent times!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SpongeBob Squarepants: The Cosmic Shake</strong></li>
<li><strong>AEW Fight Forever</strong></li>
<li><strong>Streets of Rage 4</strong></li>

            <p>
Dragon Age creator and BioWare veteran Mark Darrah has discussed some of the reasons why big-budget games seemingly take so long to make - and why some projects are announced so long before they're ready to release.
</p>
<p>
Darrah, a veteran of BioWare back to the original Baldur's Gate, previously headed the Dragon Age franchise and returned to work on the upcoming entry Dragon Age: The Veilguard as a consultant. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking via his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NK0vKRf0_c">YouTube</a> channel, Darrah provides some interesting insight on the topic of big-budget game development. And, while he avoids namechecking any of BioWare's games directly, it's not difficult to read between the lines at certain points as to how this wisdom relates to the company he's spent most of his career at.
</p>

</p>
<figcaption>Dragon Age: The Veilguard reveal trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXKsoC12JCY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
To begin with, Darrah counters the question of why AAA game development takes so long by simply saying that it doesn't - or at least, it doesn't take as long as you might initially believe. In practice, various games get announced well in advance of full development taking place, with only small teams working on pre-production or ideation for several years.
</p>
<p>
"There might be a small nascent seed of a team, but really there isn't any work being done for quite a long time," Darrah notes. "Studios can kind of be misleading on this front, because they'll say things like 'we've started work on Elder Scrolls 6', or they might even a trailer for the game even though the current team size is under 10 people. 
</p>
<p>
"So they're giving the impression that this is parallel development, that the team is working on this game, when in fact it's a few people having a few meetings, and not much is being done."
</p>
<p>
As a reminder, BioWare released its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-mass-effect-teaser-shows-series-will-return-to-milky-way">first teaser trailer for Mass Effect 5</a> in 2020, even though the bulk of BioWare has been busy working on Dragon Age: The Veilguard in the meantime. BioWare has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-teaser-image-revealed-and-analysed">updated fans with fresh concept art</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-teases-mass-effect-5-title-plus-answers-to-trilogy-ending-questions">other visuals</a> each year - but it's clear the game is still nowhere near launch.
</p>
<p>
"There might be reasons why it's important for the studio or the publisher to have that game in the public consciousness," Darrah continues. "It might be because the publisher's slate is a little weak, and they want the public to remember it still has important games in its back pocket. It might be because the studio wants the game announced because they're worried the publisher might kill it otherwise."
</p>
<p>
Announcing projects early isn't the best strategy, Darrah continues, but sometimes "needs must". 
</p>

<p>
The full video, above, is worth watching to hear more of Darrah's thoughts on what holds up big budget games from being made, including the growth in size of open-world or live-service projects in scope (and therefore the need for bigger, more cumbersome teams of people making them), a push from publishers for greater iteration and a "fidelity death cult" where projects have to continue pushing the bar in terms of visuals.

            <p>Sony has announced next month's PlayStation Plus games, and headlining July's PS Plus lineup is shooter-looter Borderlands 3.</p>

            <p>
The thing everybody forgets about Sisyphus is that he was an absolutely awful bastard who deserved everything he got. Prior to being the guy who has to push a boulder up a hill for all eternity, Sisyphus was a crafty Ephyran tyrant who used to murder his guests for kicks, and who once fathered children with his own niece in a bid to depose his own brother. Charming! The Ancient Greek gods were outraged both by the king's violation of the norms of hospitality, and by his general insistence on being too clever by half - and I feel a similar way reading the Xitter feed of Bashir "ManliestDev" Kashalo, who is making a game in which you play as Sisyphus after his eventual demotion to Hell's chief rock-pusher. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Kashalo has come to <a href="https://x.com/manliestdev/status/1805269658448146898">"hate"</a> playtesting the game, jovially titled Pushing It! With Sisyphus, whose <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2899090/Pushing_It_With_Sisyphus/">Steam page</a> promises "levels of frustration not previously thought possible". He's just really sick of that boulder. Waiter! Please fetch me the world's smallest violin, grind it to a paste and gently spoonfeed it to the developer who is weary of the game he consciously and deliberately decided to make about the experience of infinite failure. I'm sure no other video game developers can relate.
</p>
<p>
Kashalo is, of course, not being serious and neither am I. I think Pushing It! With Sisyphus looks hilarious. I also think it's hilarious that it's not even the only Sisyphus sim on the store. The others include 2D precision platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1634190/SISYPHUS/">SISYPHUS</a>, in which Sisyphus is a low-key ninja with the power of time manipulation, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2904890/The_Game_of_Sisyphus/">The Game Of Sisyphus</a>, perhaps the most polished of the currently available Sisyph 'em ups, which, when I discovered it, had a "mostly positive" rating on Steam. 
</p>
<p>
You might think that "overwhelmingly positive" would be funnier, but the thing I love about "mostly positive", without reading the individual reviews, is that it implies a level of good-humoured debate and some carefully considered reservations at the level of both premise and execution, because after all, one player's eternal punishment is another player's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-4-best-class">Diablo 4</a>. Perhaps if the boulder had ray-tracing it would have squeaked into "overwhelmingly positive" territory. 
</p>
<p>
And then there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2732980/Capybara_The_story_of_Sisyphus/">Capybara: The Story of Sisyphus</a>, in which Sisyphus is a capybara roped to a barrel, and the goal is to have a bath on top of the mountain. This particular incarnation of Sisyphus has Wild West levels and what's more, "if you suddenly fall off the mountain, there's a small chance you'll end up on the roof of a steampunk building!" I feel the spirit of the original myth has been lost, somewhat, but then again the capybara doesn't appear to have been a mass-murderer and would-be fratricide in her previous life - she's just "lazy". Perhaps becoming a capybara roped to a barrel and in sore need of a wash was the Olympian punishment for sloth? In fairness, this isn't worlds away from the average Aristophanes play.
</p>
<p>
What can we learn from this strange outbreak of Sisyphus games, which extend beyond explicit adaptations to widely influential Sisyphean works like Bennet Foddy's Getting Over It, the recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-tried-to-escape-hell-in-chained-together-and-one-of-us-kept-running-ahead-with-no-warning">Chained Together</a> and whole genres, like the endless runner? I dunno, but there's probably a wonky op-ed in how these games symbolise an entertainment form that has given itself over to cycles of indirectly monetised futility that wear the label of "progression system". In the eyes of investors and CEOs, every game needs to be a mountain without a summit. I'll say this for Sisyphus games, though: they make for brilliant streaming fodder. If you've got an hour to burn, you could do worse than watch one of Northernlion's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNNwBl7YmAc">fully narrated, surprisingly chill videos about his experience of Stygian torment</a>. Perhaps Bashir Kashalo would find the footage restful too, once he's done digesting that violin.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-gets-surprise-announcement-2024-release-and-controversial-frank-west-redesign.912015/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-gets-surprise-announcement-2024-release-and-controversial-frank-west-redesign/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Right out of nowhere, with no leaks or rumors or even official teases, CAPCOM has published a trailer for Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. It's an updated version of the first game in the franchise, originally released for Xbox 360 in 2006. It will be released for 'new generation platforms', which clearly includes PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X (and hopefully PC, too), at some point in 2024.</p>
<p>It does seem to be more than your average remaster (hence the Deluxe moniker) since the visual uplift is pretty significant. However, the main character, Frank West, has clearly suffered a bit of a facial redesign, and I have a feeling it may be a bit controversial.</p>


<p><iframe title="Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xyZ7gagpgsU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Anyway, as a long-standing franchise fan, I really appreciate the return of Dead Rising. The original game was very fun, and its time-sensitive mechanics also made it unique compared to many modern games. The last game in the series, Dead Rising 4, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-rising-4-review-jolly-hacknslash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> in December 2016 without any of those time-based systems and was the worst for it.</p>
<p>As you might remember, CAPCOM Vancouver was making Dead Rising 5 between 2016 and 2018, but the home office in Japan decided to ax it and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-capcom-vancouver-shut-down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shut down the studio</a> after spending around $40 million on the project.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-vancouver-wanted-to-make-new-dino-crisis-dead-rising-5-before-shutting-down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a report by Liam Robertson</a>, the game would have taken place in Santa Catarina, Mexico, between the events of Dead Rising 2 and 3, and would have featured Dead Rising 2 protagonist Chuck Greene.</p>
<p>Dead Rising 5 would have been powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 4, which wasn't nearly as refined then as it is now, and reportedly posed some serious development challenges for CAPCOM Vancouver as they tried to make an open-world title with massive zombie hordes roaming around, as is customary for the Dead Rising franchise. At one point, the developers even considered switching from the usual bombastic and cheesy Dead Rising atmosphere to something much more serious.</p>
<p>Perhaps CAPCOM, which is in a much rosier financial situation nowadays, is testing the waters with this Deluxe Remaster to possibly greenlight a brand new installment in the franchise. One can hope, anyway.</p>
