			<p>The news that <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-most-awarded-game-wccftech-awards-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> has surpassed the total </a><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-most-awarded-game-wccftech-awards-elden-ring/" target="_blank">number of&nbsp;<strong>Game of the Year</strong>&nbsp;<strong>awards</strong></a>&nbsp;won by the previous record holder, FromSoftware's Elden Ring (<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-25-winners-clair-obscur-gta-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with our very own awards marking the historical occurrence</a></strong>), has circulated widely on the Web over</span> the past few days. </p>



<p>Industry veteran <strong>Rich Vogel</strong>, whom <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/is-the-mmo-genre-dead-for-western-aaa-developers-we-asked-three-industry-veterans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we recently interviewed about the state of the MMORPG industry in Western countries</a></strong>, shared his thoughts on the event <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rich-vogel-093425_i-am-very-happy-that-expedition-has-been-activity-7419821314288410624-rTqW/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAArFoNcBzkxomfY-95d2ZvawwFRKUakif8M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a LinkedIn post</a>. Vogel feels that Expedition 33 is a 'really good game', but also <strong>can't quite wrap his head around it being 'better' than Elden Ring</strong>, which he praised for its brilliant open world design.</p>



<p><em>I am very happy that Expedition has been honored with so many awards. It is a really good game. It is hard for me to accept that Expedition 33 is a better game than Elden Ring. I had more fun playing Elden Ring. The open-world design was brilliant. I like that it did not force you down paths like Skyrim and gave you the freedom to go anywhere in the world. You started out being hunted and became the hunter.</em></p>



<p>Another industry veteran who was part of the aforementioned Wccftech interview on MMOs, <strong>Greg Street</strong>, also replied that Elden Ring is much more replayable. Street <strong>called Expedition 33 a masterpiece</strong> but also noted that the game's emotional story makes people more forgiving of other faults, such as the level design.</p>



<p><em>I imagine I will play Expedition 33 once or twice more in my lifetime, which is typical for single player RPGs for me. I predict I will go back to Elden Ring ten times or more. The replayability potential between the two is hard to compare. I think 33 is a masterpiece for sure, but I think people’s love for the story and characters leads them to overly forgive other places where the game is weaker, such as level design.</em></p>



<p>Of course, the fact that Sandfall's acclaimed turn-based JRPG has earned more Game of the Year awards (436 versus 435, though Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 still has several prizes left to claim) than Elden Ring <strong>does not mean it is objectively 'better'</strong>. For one thing, FromSoftware's game arguably had stronger competition, with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony Santa Monica's God of War Ragnarök</a></strong> taking its own share of GOTY awards that year. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Not long after the original&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> trilogy wrapped, fans got the first officially licensed video game with 1982's&nbsp;<em>The Empire Strikes Back&nbsp;</em>on the Atari 2600. Ever since then, the IP has spawned dozens of video games across multiple generations, with more announcements coming every year.</p><p>LucasArts gave us some phenomenal games for decades, and though they rebranded to Lucasfilm Games in 2021, there are many much-anticipated titles on the horizon that fans can look forward to.</p><p>With the rest of 2026 ahead of us, I wanted to take a moment to pause and look at the current state of&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>, tallying the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> games that have been teased or announced. Though some of these games have a release window, there are a few projects that we might not see until next decade.&nbsp;</p><p>Check out which ones are around the corner and which <em>Star Wars</em> release dates we'll have to wait a bit longer for.</p><picture>

The&nbsp;<em>Galactic Racer</em> teaser trailer showcases speeder bikes and other racers rocketing across Jakku, but one thing is noticeably missing: pod racers. Distancing itself from 1999's&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Episode 1: Racer&nbsp;</em>will help make this experience feel like a fresh take on the genre in the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> universe.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, I hold out hope that we'll get some level of pod racing introduced before the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Galactic Racer</em> release date hits later in 2026.&nbsp;</p><picture>

Branding itself as a "new action-adventure, multiple-character branching narrative game,"&nbsp;Eclipse offers the ability to freely explore the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> galaxy and play as multiple characters with different arcs, abilities, and morality systems.</p><p><em>Star Wars Eclipse</em> has the potential to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4cJpiOPKH14" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">offer a little bit of everything</a>&nbsp;to any&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> fan, but it's likely not a game that we'll see this year. Even though it was revealed at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-announcement-from-game-awards-2021" rel="nofollow">The Game Awards in 2021</a>, the trailer footage was still early development, making the&nbsp;<em>Eclipse </em>release date a bit uncertain.</p><picture>

But hopefully, when all things are said and done, we'll be able to go in and make something really cool for you guys again."&nbsp;</p><p>We loved&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em></a>, scoring it a 9 in our TechRaptor review, and eagerly await the next and likely final installment in the Cal Kestis trilogy. Given the five-year gap between the first two games, the next&nbsp;<em>Jedi&nbsp;</em>game could come sometime in 2028.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><em>Star Wars: Zero Company</em></h2><p>Star Wars Celebration 2025 in Japan came with a flurry of announcements, including&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-zero-company-respawn-bit-reactor" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Wars: Zero Company</em></a> from Respawn and Bit Reactor. Set during the Clone Wars,&nbsp;<em>Zero Company</em> is a single-layer turn-based tactics game that puts you in control of a squad of heroes from across the galaxy.</p><p>Starring a former Republic officer named Hawks,&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Zero Company</em> will introduce a whole new cast of characters and allow player choices to shape the outcome of your experience. Expected later in 2026, the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Zero Company</em> release date is one of the few that should arrive this year, barring any delays.</p><h2>An Amy Hennig&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> Project</h2><p>Back in 2022, Skydance New Media announced a collaboration with Lucasfilm Games to develop an original, narrative-driven action-adventure game within the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> universe led by Amy Hennig. The studio is currently hard at work on&nbsp;<em>Marvel 1943: The Rise of Hydra</em>, which, as of a couple months ago, got <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-delayed-indefinitely" rel="nofollow">delayed indefinitely to "beyond 2026."</a> Given the scope of these two very large projects, it's not surprising that we likely won't see this <em>Star Wars </em>release date for quite some time, but the wait should be worth it.</p><p>Hennig has earned her own accolades in the industry, with credits that include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-review-cult-of-personality" rel="nofollow"><em>Legacy of Kain</em>&nbsp;</a>when she worked with Crystal Dynamics and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/20-years-jak-and-daxter" rel="nofollow"><em>Jak and Daxter</em></a> while at Naughty Dog. She also created the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/series/uncharted" rel="nofollow"><em>Uncharted</em></a><em> </em>series and has been working in the industry for nearly 40 years, making her a perfect choice for a&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em> narrative adventure.</p><picture>

However, a recent&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/kotor-ii-restored-content-mod-dlc-switch-killed-disney" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Game File report</a>&nbsp;on a lawsuit discovered references to both&nbsp;<em>KOTOR 1 &amp; 2 </em>remakes, providing hope that the projects aren't dead quite yet.</p><p>Fans can hold out hope that development is still well underway, especially with one of the most recent announcements to come out of The Game Awards 2025, which brings me to….</p><picture>

After that, hopefully we can get our hands on at least a couple of these titles before 2026 is out.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <p>
Hear ye, hear ye! Embark have shared some more concrete details for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raider's</a> next main update, Headwinds, which is set to be downloaded onto your platform of choice tomorrow, January 7th. Namely, just what that new matchmaking option is, which is, as it seems, one that won't be for everyone.
</p>
<p>
As previously detailed, this new matchmaking option will only be for those of you that are level 40 and upwards, because it allows you to fly solo into a lobby filled with squads. Aye, that means it's just you and the whims of individual groups. Apparently this particular matchmaking mode will net you extra XP, but that sounds to be about it for now. Doesn't sound particularly worth it given extraction <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a>' whole thing, but hey, I'm sure some of you out there like the thrill.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">📡 Attention, Raiders!<br>The ice has thawed - Unprepared Raiders have fallen, the hardy survivors must press on. Here’s what’s coming tomorrow when Headwinds launches!<br>Solo VS Squads<br>• A new matchmaking option for LV40+ Raiders, take on full squads as a solo Raider for higher risk… <a href="https://t.co/Rg69cT3gil">pic.twitter.com/Rg69cT3gil</a></p>— ARC Raiders (@ARCRaidersGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2015832160020697466?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 26, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>
There is also a new trophy display feature, which allows you to harvest those nasty old ARCs for "prizes," with a <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/headwinds-content-update">blog post</a> explaining, "Build out your trophy case, progress through the levels, and unlock valuable items in the process." On top of that, you might start to notice flocks of birds flying around particular spots on the Buried City map. Head to their nests and you may find some convenient loot, but of course this'll be something everyone can find, so keep the challenge in mind as well. Lastly, there's a couple of new cosmetic sets, like the Sandwalker set for some stealthy vibes.
</p>
<p>
Nothing too game changing to be found here, though that new solos vs groups option sounds like it'll be a bit contentious. You can probably place bets on a future patch tweaking how much XP you do or don't get. In any case, Embark recently outlined a bunch of other plans for the game slated to arrive over the next few months, which you can have a gander at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-devs-reveal-plans-for-new-large-arc-a-fresh-map-two-expeditions-and-extra-matchmaking-options">here</a>.

            <p>Created by former developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a>, Highguard was the final game announced during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced-for-pc">December 2025’s Keighley Awards</a>. It’s a free-to-play, guns &amp; sorcery, PvP raid shooter in which magic cowboys in capes vie for control of an uncharted continent. It’s got temples, airships, rideable panthers, fireballs, frost giants, and enchanted siege engines on caterpillar tracks. It’s also out now on Steam. That was quick.</p>

<p>Highguard has kindled a lot of curiosity by having almost zero marketing - a pleasant reprieve from the usual drip-feed of pre-order bait that has provoked acute withdrawal symptoms among news writers addled by years of character spotlight trailers. Geoff Fest trailer aside, the game has cruised along on the strength of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/">the following scanty Steam blurb</a>: “From the creators of Apex Legends and Titanfall, comes Highguard: a PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent. Battle rival Warden crews for possession of the Shieldbreaker, then break into and destroy the enemy base to secure territory in this all-new breed of shooter.”</p>
<p>I’m not particularly enticed by that elevator pitch, but I do like me a setting that can’t decide whether it's Call Of Duty or God Of War. I also approve of the developer’s possibly calculated silence following the announcement, because it has really annoyed a lot of people and I am a deeply pathetic human being. Pranksters have sought to fill the breach: a fake Bluesky call for fan art last week <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/will.bearwaves.com/post/3mcwfihuups2g">attracted</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/redsutter.bsky.social/post/3mcwsm6232c2m">a</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tannerofthenorth.bsky.social/post/3mcwt6wmm7k22">few</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vforvalensa.bsky.social/post/3mcwxrlopgk2g">responses</a> of the “I’m John Highguard” variety.</p><p>James included Highguard on his personal list of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/james-most-anticipated-pc-games-for-2026">most anticipated PC games of 2026</a>, despite observing of the aesthetic that “you could lose track of it in a bowl of porridge”. I’m a bit warmer on the visuals than James, but I can well imagine Highguard vanishing without trace. Still, I am also one of the many who didn’t see <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> becoming more popular than bread. Perhaps we’ll look back on Highguard’s pre-launch period as a successful example of always leaving ‘em wanting more?</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Highguard Devs Talk Turning Rust Into A Hero Shooter And That Terrible Game Awards Reveal]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>Developing games is hard and unpredictable, and marketing them is no different. Sometimes companies make decisions they later regret. Maybe you had a bunch of splashy reveals made announcing one release date, only for a last-minute change to throw things into disarray. Maybe an opportunity presents itself, one that feels too good to pass up, and you shift your entire approach to accommodate it. Sometimes that doesn’t work out either.</span></p> <p><span>The plan had always been to shadowdrop </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>, a multiplayer hero shooter developed by&nbsp;</span><span>Wildlight Entertainment, a studio made up of ex-Respawn Entertainment heavyweights. It’s a strategy that benefitted </span><i><span>Apex Legends</span></i><span>, a </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span> rival that came out of nowhere and quickly muscled its way into the competitive live-service gaming landscape. So why did Wildlight Entertainment decide to drop a trailer revealing the game for the first time at the Game Awards, knowing the team would go radio silent again immediately afterwards?&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“Look, we always planned for a, you know, a surprise release,” studio cofounder Chad Grenier told </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> at a preview event earlier this month. “Geoff came in and wanted to do something special and put us in the TGAs. We were gonna do a shadowdrop, you know, since day one, almost since forming this company; we did it with </span><i><span>Apex </span></i><span>and it worked well.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Instead, Wildlight decided to close gaming’s biggest event of the year with a trailer that left some intrigued but others unimpressed. It was a gamble that ricocheted out across social media in unpredictable ways, with mini-drama cycles sprouting up around the lack of any new information surrounding the game ahead of its January 26 launch. Some even theorized it might secretly get delayed after the poor reaction to the first trailer.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000663151" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663151"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663151">Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>“We’ve known Geoff for a long time, and he said, ‘let me do something,’ that’s maybe a little risky in hindsight<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->but different, [to] take a free to play PvP Raid Shooter and do something with it,” Grenier said. “So we rushed a trailer together. I wish the reception had been better, but in hindsight we made a trailer to entertain really quickly, and didn’t show the gameplay loop, and what’s different and unique.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Despite the online noise, the team stayed quiet. The next time players saw<em> Highguard</em> it would be live and be able to speak for itself. It’s a tough call. With multiplayer releases, a game lives or dies based on whether it can find a big enough audience; while </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>is free to play, meaning that there’s very little barrier to entry, the odds are still stacked against it. At the preview event where I spoke to members of the team, it was impossible to miss the mix of pride and trepidation about the game’s first proper appearance to the press and influencers.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“So here we are. We’re launching the game now, and the team is resilient and enthusiastic,” Grenier said. “They’ve made a ton of games in their careers; we’ve seen the highs and the lows. I think, ultimately, we believe wholeheartedly in what we’ve created.”</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> was one of a number of media outlets and content creators invited to a launch event for </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span> in Los Angeles, California on January 21. It’s part hero shooter, part MOBA, part MMORPG raid. Players descend upon the map, race around to collect gear and resources, and ultimately battle over a special artifact that must be deployed inside the enemy team’s base in order to win. It can’t be a lot to wrap your head around.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Heading into the event, I had very little idea of what to expect. While Wildlight includes developers who worked on<em> Titanfall</em> and </span><i><span>Apex Legends</span></i><span>, this is the studio’s debut project</span><i><span>. </span></i><span>Co-founder Grenier and Dusty Welch described the shift to independence as ultimately freeing but noted that about 60 percent of the team’s roughly 100 staff previously worked together at Respawn, eliminating some of the challenges of building up an entirely new team.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000663155" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663155"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663155">Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>“When Chad and I left and started this company, it was to reunite a group of people,” Welch said. “Like, Chad and [Creative Director Jason McCord] have worked together for 17 years. Chad was my game director on </span><i><span>Apex</span></i><span>; we’ve worked together for quite a long time, and we have 60, 61 people from </span><i><span>Apex</span></i><span> that are working here on a 100-person team. So we wanted to create an environment and a place that was a home to experience the best of game making to our ability.”</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>He continued, “That home, that freedom to find new, fun things was great<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->with none of the burns, and none of the blockers, and none of the oversight and the baggage that comes with some of the places that we’ve worked, or the experiences we’ve had.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Wildlight is a “remote first” studio. While Dusty and Chad left Respawn during COVID, </span><i><span>Apex Legends</span></i><span> was developed by a team that already had experience working remotely. The co-founders also made one other thing clear about how they see the team; while they’re aiming for that “AAA” game polish, they stress that they consider themselves an independent developer with all of the pain points that can entail. Wildlight is self-publishing the game. There’s no massive company to offer QA support or provide a marketing machine. </span><i><span>Apex </span></i><span>had EA. This time they’re on their own.</span></p> <p><span>“It’s a fresh start, which is a good opportunity in a lot of ways, but it can take a while to get things up and going at the speed you were accustomed to,” Grenier said. “Luckily, it’s offset by what needs to happen anyways, which is just a lot of long discussions about what we’re making here. So, you’ll have some people working on tech while these long design discussions are happening, and they kind of go hand in hand<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->but, you know, it’s hard. We don’t have a big publisher to give us anything or help us in any way. We’re very much on our own and learning new things that we’ve never had to do ourselves before.”</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s nothing simple about designing a multiplayer shooter in 2026 either. Creative Director Jason McCord, as well as </span><i><span>Higuard</span></i><span>‘s Lead Game Designer Carlos Pineda, spoke to some of the challenges and inspirations that guided the studio in its early days<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->including some of the core inspirations behind what would ultimately become </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>‘s unique gameplay loop. The team wanted it to be something that stood out, so the game wasn’t just discarded as yet another free-to-play PvP shooter.</span></p> <p><span>“At the beginning, making the new game…we don’t know what the game is yet. We’re asking ourselves, what is it?” Pineda said. “What’s a game that we could make that people are gonna care about? Something that they’re not just gonna brush off like ‘it’s just another game.’ So we knew we had to not be one of those popular genres, not a battle royale or an extraction shooter.”</span></p> <p><span>The answer ended up lying in an unlikely place. “One day, I walked into the office and was like, hey, have you played </span><i><span>Rust</span></i><span>?” Pineda said.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000663153" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663153"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663153">Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>’s ambitious goal became distilling the feeling of raiding bases in the popular survival crafting sim, but without the time-intensive preamble of gathering resources and building up small fortresses. Eventually the core concept of the Shieldbreaker, the object that players would fight over to decide who would be raiding who, was born. The entire design process was centered around finding the right balance of maintaining the energy of those shootouts while keeping match time manageable.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>At one point in development, victory was determined by fully destroying an enemy Keep. Eventually, the team settled on detonating bombs at objectives like in </span><i><span>Counter-Strike</span></i><span> to streamline things instead. The decision to increase the rarity of gear salvaged with each successive round until a winner had been crowned came as a result of matches during playtesting devolving into menial back-and-forth tug-of-wars that would lose their spark. For a similar reason, the team eventually opted to give the Shieldbreaker a time limit before it automatically activates on the closest Keep.</span></p> <p><span>The team’s passion for the project is infectious, even as the anxiety about the looming launch is plain to see on their faces. McCord tells me about the story behind the axe, and how it ended up serving as both a means of gathering resources and a combat tool. Carlos explains how the “momentum problem” was only really solved in 2025, over three years into development. It stands out to me how open the team has been about the struggles they went through developing </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>, a game they’ve worked on for years but whose fate is at the mercy of a fickle and chaotic online audience.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“We put our heads down and listened and paid attention to what was going on and took it to heart,” Grenier said. “But we stayed silent because we knew that the first time, the next time that we say anything to the audience, it better be the game and let the game speak for itself.”</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/highguard-game-awards-trailer-rust-hero-shooter-interview-2000663137]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>Despite its big reveal at the Game Awards last month where it had the coveted “one last thing” slot, nobody outside of the development team had any idea what to expect from </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span> as we sat down to play several hours of the game at a launch event in Los Angeles. All we knew was that the team, Wildlight Entertainment, had christened it a “PvP Raid Shooter,” a term that meant close to nothing without knowledge of what the gameplay itself is like. Half a week later, I’m here to tell you that I understand what sort of game it is, and how it won me over.</span></p> <p><span>Getting the inevitable out of the way, </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>is a PvP hero shooter in which each match can be roughly divided into three disparate segments. At the start, players choose their characters, called “Wardens,” each with their own secondary ability and ultimate, and vote to select one of four “Keeps” which will act as the home base they must defend. Each base features three points of interest which the enemy team will want to destroy by planting bombs—think </span><i><span>Counter-Strike—</span></i><span>and at the start of each round teams are given a minute to choose which sections to prioritize for reinforcement with their limited resources. It’s a deceptively short amount of time; a trend that the rest of the gameplay loop follows through with.</span></p>

 <p><span>Keeps can have radically different layouts, each one representing a set of trade-offs that make the choice meaningful. “Hellmouth” comes suspended over lava, making movement for both defenders and raiders considerably more restrictive; “Bellringer” instead goes for a more open floor plan, buoyed by multiple towers and a central zipline. It’s easier to traverse, but leaves defenders and raiders alike out in the open as they make their way to their objective. Just a handful of hours is far from enough to come to grips with the quirks of every Keep in the game, but it’s fair to say that each of the ones I competed on felt unique both visually and in terms of game feel.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000663141" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663141"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663141">Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Once the initial timer lifts, players ride out of their keep into the wider map in search of resources; armor, weapons, additional material to reinforce sections of your Keep, and accessories for your Warden as well as saddles to buff your mount. Players have several minutes to prepare before the “Shieldbreaker”—the flag—spawns, and everyone collapses on the same central location marked on the map via a storm cloud. Once it spawns, the game becomes Capture the Flag, with the twist that you’re meant to bring the Shieldbreaker to the opposing team’s base to damage its health and knock down its shields to start a raid. Once the Shieldbreaker has been planted, the defending team has some time for last-minute preparations, as a Siege Tower appears that will act as the opposing team’s spawn point for the duration of the raid.</span></p>

 <p><span>On paper it’s a lot to explain, yet in practice it’s all surprisingly intuitive. Developer Wildlight was formed by folks who had worked on </span><i><span>Apex Legends</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Titanfall</span></i><span>, and that lineage is apparent in the feel of </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>; while it’s a weightier, more deliberate experience than those games, it still fits like a glove with some excellent-feeling gunplay and responsive controls. The user interface is polished and immediately readable and the game’s art direction is rather strong, with a ton of heart. Scattered across the game’s maps and at each team’s spawn point is Flynn, the shopkeep who can exchange resources mined from the environment for gear, and always has a delightful cross-eyed Owlbear Koala called Gregory by his side.</span></p>

 <p><span>Wardens, too, showcase a lot of personality in action. Kai’s ability to conjure ice walls and send them slamming forward into enemies is delightful enough on its own, but what was even more memorable was some of his banter with other Wardens about his ultimate ability that lets him shapeshift into a frost giant. I wasn’t able to see too many of these conversations between characters, but the ones that I managed to witness ultimately helped endear them to me.</span></p> <p><span>Of course, Wardens come with their own set of kits. Some are more suited for defense, like Una who can summon spirits which lob grenades at enemies in their line of sight. Others excel at subterfuge; Scarlet, for instance, has the ability to shift destructible walls into sand, allowing her to pass through the environment while minimizing the sound left in her wake. Every Warden I tested felt laser-focused on what role they’re meant to fill during a match; watching players learn exactly what those archetypes are over the course of the day was one of the most enjoyable moments of the whole experience.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000663142" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000663142"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000663142">Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Throughout the launch event, the devs stressed that they wanted to avoid matches that stall out for hours on end; at most, </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span>‘s games are designed to last 30 minutes. Even then, chances are the average will clock in at closer to 15 to 20 minutes. Each time a team successfully defends against a raid, the whole loop starts over again with a twist; the rarity level of gear increases, and weapons and tools alike gain additional perks. A sniper might become full-auto, a shotgun’s reload speed might be reduced, or a zipline gun might cloak anyone riding the ziplines it sets. When the Shieldbreaker is active, if it hasn’t been set after a few minutes the match will shift to Sudden Death in order to force the issue. If that’s not enough, it will automatically activate on the closest base if enough time has elapsed.</span></p> <p><span>It’s an interesting philosophy, and in practice it means that even in matches where both teams trade blows it never feels like you’re at a standstill. Whether those feelings will last after dozens or even hundreds of games remains to be seen, but for now it lends </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span> a brisk energy that I didn’t really expect from such an involved gameplay loop. Certainly it accomplishes Wildlight’s stated goal of making something truly unique for the genre; it does feel like a breath of fresh air, even if individual elements are stuff we’ve seen time and again.</span></p> <p><span>My first look at the game, made the poor reception to its reveal sting all the more. </span><i><span>Highguard </span></i><span>has spent the last several weeks being the butt of the internet’s jokes, and it leaves me wondering if players will give it the chance it probably deserves. It’s easy for a developer to claim that they’ve developed something truly new for a genre, and at the same time it’s equally rare for a studio to deliver on that promise. </span><i><span>Highguard</span></i><span> well and truly feels like something special, and like </span><i><span>Titanfall </span></i><span>before it I could see it garnering a rabid fanbase. I just hope it’s afforded that chance.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/highguard-impressions-titanfall-2-apex-multiplayer-shooter-2000663136]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>1416568</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s been an usual couple of months for Wildlight Entertainment’s Highguard, mostly in part to the constant abuse the game has recieved for its lack of marketing since its The Game Awards announcement.</p>



<p>But now, we know why.</p>







<h2 id="h-it-was-meant-to-be-a-shadowdrop">It was Meant to be a Shadowdrop</h2>



<p>During a behind-the-scenes presentation with press and creators, Vice President of Product and Publishing Jason Torfin and Lead Designer Mohammed Alavi sat down with attendees of the event to answer questions. </p>



<p>As expected, one of the main questions was around the games marketing, or should we say lack thereof, and that’ss because the game was always intended to follow a similar release to Apex Legends; a shadowdrop. However, sometime in 2025, The Game Awards host Geoff Keighley put a spanner in the works because he was stoked for the game and wanted to reveal it.</p>



<p><strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-highguard-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RELATED – Complete Highguard Trophy L</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-highguard-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-trophies/">ist—How To Get All Achievements &amp; Trophies<br></a></strong><br>Speaking at the event (thanks <a href="https://xboxera.com/2026/01/26/highguard-was-meant-to-be-a-shadowdrop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">XboxEra</a>) on the original plans, Tofin said, “I think the fact that we’re independent and that we’re smart with how we run our business and build our team means that we have those luxuries. We’re not beholden to shareholders or any sort of other corporate shenanigans, and it allows us to have that sort of confidence. And from the get-go, you can’t bank on commercial success right out of the gate. If you do that, you’re probably going to fail most of the time.”</p>







<p>“And that’s why we were going to shadow drop.” he said “Let the game speak for itself. It was always the plan. And then, you know, Geoff came in the past year and he played the game. I mean, he really liked it and he was stoked. And we had an opportunity and we decided, okay, we can make a trailer that would be in our shadow-drop. And so the one we put there [at The Game Awards] was the one that would be the first thing you saw in the shadow-drop, followed by twenty-five minutes of other context. And unfortunately, that trailer wasn’t meant to be the thing to ‘educate’.” </p>

</p></figure>



<p>So, there you have it. Highguard’s marketing wasn’t bad persay, it just changed on a whim and kind of shot themselves in the foot for a couple of months.</p>



<p>It explains why past rumours said that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-devs-didnt-pay-for-game-awards-spot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard wasn’t a paid placement</a>, despite it being the show’s last trailer (something traditionally reserved for the absolute best stuff). It simply was because Geoff Keighley liked it… Case closed!</p>



<p>Whether it means the game is good or not is another story… I guess only time will tell!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Launches a “Voluntary” Layoff Program at Ubisoft Paris HQ in an Attempt to Cut up to 200 Jobs]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-layoff-program-ubisoft-paris/</link>
            <guid>1416514</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It seems the news around <strong>Ubisoft</strong> is not stopping anytime soon, as a statement sent to Wccftech (first spotted on <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-redundancy-process-to-cut-200-jobs-from-paris-head-office">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>) reveals that the company has kicked off a <strong>"<em>voluntary</em>" layoff program</strong> at its <strong>Ubisoft Paris</strong> headquarters, where it intends to cut as many as <strong>200 employees</strong> from the studio.</p>



<p>This follows after the company <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">announced it would undergo a <strong>"<em>major reset</em>"</strong> last week</a>, which saw the entire company get restructured into five different 'Creative Houses,' multiple projects getting delayed or outright cancelled, and caused the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lost-nearly-95-of-value-in-eight-years-34-share-price-drop-after-major-reset/">company's share price to drop to its lowest point since <strong>2011</strong></a>. Now, after a report directly regarding how <a href="https://wccftech.com/french-union-claims-ubisoft-ceo-has-no-knowledge-or-understanding-of-his-company-after-major-reset/">morale within Ubisoft and specifically at Ubisoft Paris is led by <strong>"<em>anger and despair,"</em></strong></a> we've learned that things are getting worse for employees at the Paris HQ.</p>



<p>It should be noted that, due to this being a voluntary program that will cut as many as 200 employees, it's possible that fewer than 200 positions will be made redundant by the program's completion. The statement confirms that this program <strong>only applies</strong> to employees under Ubisoft International with French contracts, and that no cuts will be made final until an agreement is reached with union representatives and validated by French authorities.</p>



<p>"<em>In line with last week’s announcements on its new operating model and the acceleration of cost-reduction&nbsp;initiatives, Ubisoft International (HQ' legal entity) has initiated discussions&nbsp;regarding&nbsp;a potential Rupture&nbsp;Conventionnelle&nbsp;Collective (RCC), <strong>a collective, voluntary mutual&nbsp;termination&nbsp;agreement</strong> that could involve&nbsp;around&nbsp;200 positions at its headquarters in France</em>," the statement reads.</p>



<p>"<em>At this stage, this&nbsp;remains&nbsp;a proposal&nbsp;and will require&nbsp;a collective agreement with&nbsp;unions&nbsp;and validation&nbsp;by French authorities&nbsp;to come into effect.</em> <em>The&nbsp;proposal&nbsp;applies exclusively to Ubisoft International employees under French contracts and has no impact on other French entities or Ubisoft teams worldwide.</em>"</p>



<p>These cuts are part of the layoffs we were told to expect after Ubisoft made it clear that part of its restructure under this "<em>major reset</em>" would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/">further cost reduction to the tune of <strong>€200</strong> <strong>million</strong></a> and a return-to-office mandate, two elements that led to a strike taking place outside of Ubisoft Paris this past Thursday, January 22, 2026.</p>



<p>It's clear this is not the end of Ubisoft's woes, but only the beginning of a new chapter of bad news for Ubisoft. Last week, ahead of the strike, French video game union <strong>Solidaires Informatique</strong>, which represents several Ubisoft Paris employees, specifically called out Ubisoft chief executive officer,<strong> Yves Guillemot</strong>, for the company's current issues.</p>



<p>"<em>It is out of the question to let a boss run wild and destroy our working conditions. Perhaps we need to remind him that it is his employees who make the games</em>."</p>



<p>As one of the co-founders, along with his brothers, Yves Guillemot and his family have led Ubisoft since its inception. In the last eight years, with Yves at the helm, Ubisoft lost <strong>95% of its total value</strong>, going from a valuation of <strong>$10 billion</strong> to just <strong>$500 million</strong> as of last week.</p>

            <p>When you were making plant pots in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/runescape">RuneScape</a> and selling them to other players, you might not have thought you were laying the groundwork for a UK legal precedent that would define in-game gold as intangible property covered by the Theft Act 1968, but, well, here we are.</p>
<p>Lord Justice Popplewell has ruled on appeal that RuneScape's gold pieces are legal property, which is important for the ex-Jagex developer accused of stealing 705 billion of them.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to the judgement handed down by <a href="https://caselaw.nationalarchives.gov.uk/ewca/crim/2026/4#end-of-document">the Court of Appeal</a>, while working as a content developer at Jagex, the developer Andrew Lakeman is accused of accessing 68 different players accounts and "stripp[ing] those accounts of hundreds of billions of gold pieces" worth £543,123 if converted into RuneScape bonds, an item that can be bought for gold and exchanged for game membership. Jagex alleges this all took place in 2018. Lakeman and his solicitor dispute the charges.</p>
<p>When the case first went to trial last year, however, the judge dismissed the case agreeing with the defence's argument that RuneScape's in-game gold couldn't be legally defined as property under the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/60/contents">Theft Act 1968</a>.</p>
<p>While the law does exclude certain items from being considered property, such as wild mushrooms and animals, it doesn't, oddly enough, list in-game currencies. However, to be considered a legally stealable item, something also has to be "rivalrous" and not "pure information". Meaning, as quoted within the case report: "if the use or consumption of the thing by a person, or of a specific group of persons, necessarily prejudices the use or consumption of that thing by one or more other persons.”</p><p>The judge ruled in favour of the defence because Runescape's in-game gold isn't "rivalrous", because if one player has gold, it doesn't take away another player's ability to get it. “Gold pieces within [Runescape] are not sufficiently rivalrous to be classed as intangible property," the judge said. "One gold piece is the same as any other, and their supply is infinite. The fact that existing players have wealth does not preclude new players from joining the game and getting more wealth, without taking it from existing players. This means, in my judgment, that even if the Crown is able to prove every single factual assertion that forms the basis of its case, the offences currently charged are not made out in law and I would not be prepared to leave them to a jury.”</p>
<p>However, the judge left their ruling open to appeal and appeal the prosecution bloody well have. The ruling went to the Court of Appeals, and ended up in front of Lord Justice Popplewell. Hold onto your legal pads, reader.</p>
<p>"We differ from the Judge in his reasoning for reaching the contrary conclusion on rivalrousness. The two reasons which the Judge gave in his ruling do not, with respect, bear analysis," Popplewell writes. "The first was that 'one gold piece is like any other, and their supply is infinite'. This does not, however, distinguish them from many other forms of rivalrous property. One paper clip from a given manufacturer is like any other; and the manufacture and supply of them infinite, in the sense that is not capped at any finite number. Yet each paper clip constitutes property. The same is equally true of gold pieces."</p>
<p>Effectively, just because each gold piece in RuneScape is identical and functionally the same, does not make it something that a player can be deprived of.</p>
<p>"The Judge’s second reason was that '[t]he fact that existing players have wealth does not preclude new players from joining the game and getting more wealth without taking it from existing players'," Popplwell continues. "However this too is no answer to the rivalrousness of the in-game wealth which a particular player already has at any given time. It focuses only on different assets which may thereafter be acquired."</p>
<p>After all, if you had had 100 million gold taken from you and someone said, 'Don't worry, at least it won't stop other players from earning gold', you might say that doesn't make a jot of difference to you.</p>
<p>In their conclusion, Popplewell lays out their reasons for granting the prosecution's appeal, saying that RuneScape's gold pieces "are properly described as something which can be stolen as a matter of normal use of language. They do not fall within any of the established exceptions. They are not 'pure knowledge': functionally they exist as identifiable assets distinct from the code which gives rise to them and outside the minds of people. There is no good policy reason for excepting them from the category of property which can be stolen. On the contrary, they are assets which have an ascertainable monetary value and which may be traded for that value both in the game and outside the game. Within the rules of the game they represent money’s worth as the product of purchase of a bond. Outside the game they are regularly traded for money’s worth. They are capable of being subject to dishonest dealing which deprives their possessor of their use and value. It would be surprising and unsatisfactory if such dishonest dealing did not amount to the offence of theft."</p><p>While you may not want to read the whole case document, as it is a pretty extensive read, it is full of interesting examples of other legal precedents. For instance, there was the Oxford student accused of theft for taking an exam paper, even though they returned it, because they now possessed the questions that were in the document. Or the discussion that compares forbidden real money transfers in games to theft of Class A drugs.</p>
<p>With the Court of Appeal's decision now handed down, it would appear that the original case can now proceed.</p>

<p>A medieval massacre awaits in Half Sword. The innovative physics game wants you to maim, and blood will be the price of glory. In terms of Half Sword’s actual price and how much it costs, that’s where this guide enters the fight.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming described Half Sword as ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hilarious-medieval-combat-early-access-half-sword/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the most hilarious medieval combat sim</a>.’ If you’ve not seen it yet, you need to. Thousands of you have already begun your crusade to lop off limbs and put down your enemies like dirty dogs, courtesy of the free demo.</p>



<p>Eventually, Half Sword will be available to buy, and this is where you need to know its cost and price tag.</p>







<h2 id="h-half-sword-price-explained">Half Sword Price, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>I challenge you to a duel. Credit to Half Sword Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s been confirmed through the Half Sword Discord that the combat game will be under $30 when it launches in early access, with a discount at launch.</strong></p>



<p>There isn’t a more concrete price tag at the moment, but the faq section in the Half Sword Discord has clarified some price details:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Price is still TBA. It will be less then $30 and the first two weeks of EA will feature a discount.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>You’ve got a brief window to get early access for a more bank account-friendly price. The Half Sword Discord is extremely active with thousands of players, and the development team provides updates regularly. There’s every chance there will be a full price tag update before launch; if not, everyone will find out together on release day.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-half-sword-have-microtransactions">Does Half Sword Have Microtransactions?</h2>



<p><strong>You might be pleased to hear that Half Sword will feature no microtransactions of any kind.</strong></p>



<p>Diverting back to the official <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1043854763189600337/1272470349245579396" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">faq</a>, when addressing the question of “Will there be microtransactions?” it has a simple and blunt, one-word answer: “No.”</p>



<p>There might be some free extra content released after launch, or maybe fuller expansions (it is only early access, though), but it’s confirmed there will be no microtransactions.</p>



<p>Half Sword easily looks like one of the most promising and fun games of 2026. The concept looks brutal, and the price tag isn’t going to give your wallet a headache. Will you be going all in on Half Sword early access?

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nyxis-hyperion-3-is-on-paper-the-perfect-joy-con-2-alternative</link>

<p>Early-bird price expires today</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Over the coming years, we're likely to see a bunch of alternatives to the Switch 2's Joy-Con, but NYXI's new Hyperion 3 looks like it might be a solid early contender.</p>
<p>Available for pre-order now via the <a href="https://nyxigame.com/products/nyxi-hyperion-3-wireless-joypad-for-switch-2">NYXI website</a>, you can currently take advantage of a 30% 'early-bird' discount, bringing the price down to <strong>£88</strong> for those in the UK. This is only valid for the remainder of the day, by which point the price will return to <strong>£125</strong>.</p>
<p>The Hyperion 3 looks to be a thoughtful evolution of its predecessor, boasting a more ergonomically-friendly design that's sure to be a bit more comfortable to grasp than Nintendo's own official offering. You've also got Hall-Effect sticks to reduce the risk of drift, micro-switch face buttons, gyro support, and wake-up support. Not bad at all.</p>
<p>Here's the official list of features from NYXI:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Hall Effect Joystick (No Drift)<br>
- Micro-Switch D-Pad &amp; A/B/X/Y<br>
- Micro-Switch Trigger/Dual-stage Linear Trigger<br>
- 9-Axis Gyro on Switch<br>
- Pro Controller Mode/Handheld Mode<br>
- Wake-up &amp; Screenshot Feature<br>
- Adjustable Turbo &amp; Rumble Function</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Naturally, we'll reserve full judgement until we're able to get our hands on the Hyperion 3, but on paper at least, yeah, this looks pretty neat. The regular price of £125 could be a bit of a sticking point for some, but if the features justify it, then this could be a go-to accessory for those who like to play both docked and handheld.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>After <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/were-truly-sorry-opus-prism-peak-slips-into-2026">a last-minute delay</a> towards the end of 2025, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/opus-prism-peak">OPUS: Prism Peak</a> — the spiritual successor to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/opus_echo_of_starsong_-_full_bloom_edition">Opus: Echo of Starsong</a> (a game we <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/opus-echo-of-starsong-full-bloom-edition">absolutely adore</a>) — finally has a brand new release date for Switch 1 and Switch 2.</p>
<p>Coming out on <strong>26th March 2026</strong>, Opus: Prism Peak is a narrative puzzler where you play as a photographer who has stumbled into a strange realm. Accompanying him is a young girl who seems to understand this world you've ended up in, and the game focuses on your photography skills and the relationship between the two main characters.</p>
<p>The brand new trailer features a stunning theme song 'I Am Farewell Itself, I Am Life', composed by Kevin Penkin, the composer of anime such as <strong>Made in Abyss</strong>, <strong>The Apothecary Diaries</strong>, and <strong>Tower of God</strong>, as well as for the narrative video games <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/necrobarista_final_pour">Necrobarista</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/florence">Florence</a>.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of what to expect from the game when it launches later this year:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Key Highlights:</strong><br>
* Adventuring Together: The heart of the experience lies in the evolving relationship between the two protagonists as they navigate a landscape of spirits.<br>
* Photography as a Narrative Bridge: While exploring, use an old camera to uncover the world's mysteries. Photography is how you interact with the world and strengthen the connection between characters.<br>
* Grownup Regrets meets Shinkai Aesthetic: Experience a world that blends Makoto Shinkai’s vibrant visuals with the midlife disillusionment of Firewatch</p>

			<p><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> is one of the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2026-martial-artists-spies-super-heroes-and-criminals/">most anticipated games</a></strong> launching on consoles this year. Following <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/">two delays</a></strong>, the excitement surrounding the game has only increased, and many are getting ready to jump into this new rendition of<strong> Vice City</strong> with a physical copy of the game to complete their series collection.</p>



<p><span>Unfortunately,&nbsp;<strong>it seems like this won't be possible</strong>, at least not at laun</span>ch, in a move that is just as <strong>unprecedented</strong> as the game is set to be when it is released later this year.</p>



<p>In a new report shared today, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/397290/gta-6-a-wersja-pudelkowa-sprzedawcy-zwiastuja-smutna-wiadomosc-dla-fanow-fizycznych-wydan.html">Polish publication PPE</a></strong>, which has proven <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-playstation-5-november/"><strong>quite reliable over the past few months</strong></a>, revealed that the highly anticipated game will <strong>only be available digitally at launch.</strong></p>



<p><em>"This source, who handles physical video game sales in Europe, informed us that Grand Theft Auto 6 publisher Take-Two is currently not planning a physical edition of Lucia and Jason's story. At least not for release due to possible story or gameplay leaks,"</em> the report reads via an automated translation. The physical release will only arrive a few months later, but the source doesn't know if this will happen only a few weeks after launch or only in the first half of 2027.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">"We're hearing more and more that the physical version won't be released simultaneously with the digital version to prevent leaks. We're getting conflicting reports: some say the physical version will arrive three to four weeks after the digital release, while others say it won't happen until early 2027,"</em> another source said. Thankfully, more information will reportedly be available in mid-February.</p>



<p>Needless to say, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>launching in digital format only is <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">incredibly disappointing</strong>. However, considering how many highly anticipated games get into the hands of gamers <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ahead of the official release date</strong>, it's not surprising that Take-Two is willing to go so far to protect what is set to be t<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">he <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">biggest entertainment launch of all time</a></strong>, and possibly earn more by exclusively selling the game digitally at launch.</p>



<p>Hopefully, this decision, if final, will not <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">prevent the release of any Collector's Edition</strong> at launch, which could still include a voucher for the digital version of the game alongside whatever extra goodie is packed in. The value of such a proposition, however, would certainly be diminished by the <strong>lack of a physical copy of the game.</strong></p>



<p>Would a digital-only launch of <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Grand Theft Auto 6</em> make you wait for the physical release, or would you still get the game when it launches on November 19? Let us know in the comments!</p>

Today I became aware of Bolt Action, a historical strategy sim based on the World War II tabletop miniatures game from Warlord Games (founded by erstwhile Games Workshop staffers John Stallard and Paul Sawyer). It sees you fretting over questions of morale, line-of-sight and cover, while leading US, British or German armies across maps that range from beaches to churchyards. There’s multiplayer, too. Trailer ho!

In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3856030/view/541128612120628420?l=english">a blogpost this week</a>, developers Frag Games simultaneously announce their desire to do right by the source material while making clear that they don’t want to just transplant it, Victoria Crosses and all.  “We’ve all seen ‘PC adaptations’ that strip the soul out of a tabletop game to make it ‘accessible,’" they sneer, like grown men disproving the existence of Santa Claus. “So our designers spent weeks in ‘boot camp’: reading rulebooks, painting minis, rolling dice, measuring distances with tape, and feeling the genuine panic of a FUBAR roll.
</p>
<p>
“We learned a lot, and we’re still learning,” it continues. “But the one thing we DID know from the beginning was that we didn’t want to build a digital version of Bolt Action.  Bolt Action already exists! Playing a table-top experience will always remain special. What we want is the best Turn-Based Tactics videogame built on the Bolt Action ruleset.”</p>
<p>There follows a breakdown of the “six tactical choices” that await you whenever you pick a unit: firing, advancing, running, ambushing (aka overwatch), rallying (aka getting rid of suppression “pins”), and going prone. 
</p>
<p>
Another section explores vehicles, which are proof against small arms and have a selection of armour facings. There’s a bit on how indirect fire works, with the accuracy of consecutive shots on a target improving each turn, and a bit on platoon experience levels, upgrades and customisation.
</p><p>
It looks like a tidy little wargame – no release date yet - but that’s not why I’ve written it up. “We’re building a game for the person with five unpainted armies sitting on their shelf, but also for the strategy fan who wants a WWII game with complex rules and deep gameplay,” the devs comment near the end of that blogpost.</p>
<p>The mention of unpainted armies fills my heart with decades-old guilt – alas, Teclis, Loremaster of Hoeth, I never did get round to finishing your cape – but also, <em>possibility</em>. Adaptations of tabletop miniatures games often come with elaborate livery editors, but now that I reflect, I’m not sure I’ve played one that lets you show up to the brawl with an unpainted force.
</p>
<p>
It’s been a while since I wielded a physical range ruler, but there is surely no better way to demonstrate your contempt for an opponent - and maybe, throw them off - than by rocking up with some High Elves you couldn’t be bothered to basecoat, let alone shade and layer. Imagine if Henry V came to Agincourt with no pants. How might the French have reacted? Clarification: I have not researched the Battle of Agincourt, so apologies if going commando was, in fact, a critical element of the English strategy. 
</p>
<p>
Less abrasively, I just think miniatures adaptations could do a better job of reflecting the fact that a lot of miniatures collectors aren’t great painters, however enthusiastic. There should be an editor function that recreates the effect of a spirited 10-year-old getting Warhammer for Xmas and trying to pimp out a whole Lizardman battalion in felt tip. I think this could be wholesome? Authentic, even?

            <p>
Against the overbearing weight of modernity, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/old-school-runescape">Old School RuneScape</a> continues to complete a Sisyphean task of simply existing two and a half decades after it originally launched. It just celebrated that 25th anniversary at the start of the year in fact, and now during a Winter Summit a slew of updates coming to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a> were shown off in a roadmap from developer Jagex.
</p>
<p>
Kicking things off on the roadmap is Deadman: Annihilation, a "high intensity, PvP everywhere" variation on its main PvP mode that'll run from January 30th through to February 21st. This one'll feature some new sigils and breaches, and you can earn points to pick up cosmetics. Following that, in April Leagues is returning with Leagues VI: Demonic Pacts, complete with bonus XP drops and loot boosts, alongside some reimagined combat masteries.

Sailing, the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/old-school-runescape-is-getting-its-first-new-skill-since-it-launched-and-so-the-xp-grind-begins-anew">first new skill since it changed from regular RuneScape to Old School RuneScape</a>, will be expanded upon sometime in 2026 too, namely new quests to do. Those of you that have been around for a long time will be interested to hear about the Blood Moon Rises update coming in the summer, a Grandmaster-tier quest that'll wrap up a story started all the way back in 2004. Jeepers creepers! Pull out the champagne for that questline. On top of all that, there's also The Fractured Archive, the game's first new raid in four years.
</p>
<p>
As always I'm just impressed this thing is trucking. It's the first online anything where I had an actual username (no I'm not telling you, some things are best kept as secrets), those types of internet histories are typically lost to time. Kudos!

            <p>A group of modders wearing the finest reverse-engineering goggles has managed to port birdly and beary platformer Banjo-Kazooie to PC, with a bunch of extra bells and whistles to make sure it won't make for a disappointing dip back into your childhood or adulthood. Their creation's dubbed Banjo: Recompiled, and it dropped over the weekend.</p>

<p>This recompiled version of the N64 classic, brought to life using <a href="https://github.com/N64Recomp/N64Recomp">N64: Recompiled</a>, is primarily the work of modder Wiseguy. It works on Windows, Linux, and Mac, provided you bring along the game files via a legally-sourced ROM of the North American 1.0 version.</p>
<p>If you do, you're in for a version of Banjo which offers a bunch of helpful features designed to ensure it's ideal to play on today's hardware, though it is also promised to run on more potato-shaped boxes. There's support for high framerates if you don't fancy leaving it at a solid 60, widescreen and ultrawide modes, and rapid loading times. A dual-analog camera steup, the ability to keep your notes if you die or exit a level, and support for playing on Steam Deck are also part of the puzzle.</p>
<p>Finally, there's built-in mod support in case you want to get Doom running in the jigsaw minigame. Or just download the likes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLzv0U3cFlo">Jiggies of Time</a> and or a revamped texture pack.</p>
<p>All in all, it's a project that looks well worth the wait of eons for Banjo to get a proper PC port, something Microsoft haven't yet deigned worth digging back into the nostalgia toybox to whip out.</p>
<p>If you fancy giving Banjo: Recompiled a go, you'll find it and its souce code on <a href="https://github.com/BanjoRecomp/BanjoRecomp/releases/tag/v1.0.0">GitHub</a>, where Wiseguy also notes they're planning on delivering ray tracing to it at some point down the line.</p>
