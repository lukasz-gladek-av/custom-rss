<p>My lunch yesterday consisted of air fried lumps of failed pizza dough from a disastrous first batch. One of my new year's resolutions was to learn how to make flawless pizza. This might be against the spirit of asceticism these goals usually incorporate, but such puritan edicts have no place here. The platonically perfect slice, like hailstones battering the word 'bum' into soft cement, is a natural marvel impervious to notions of morality both spiritual and profane.</p>
<p>Would the dough have turned out better if I'd sought the help of Into The Restless Ruins's harvest maiden, who grants the desires of those who petition her? Oh. <em>Oh</em>. The 'harvest' refers to slaughter, not grain. Should have guessed really.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/into-the-restless-ruins">Into The Restless Ruins</a> is a roguelite dungeon crawler deckbuilder. A yawnsome genre prospect on paper, until I noticed that the dungeon you crawl is one you build yourself from your deck. Hang on! That's a bit like the original <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1634/warhammer-quest">Warhammer Quest</a>, my beloved! Only where the tabletop game used a randomised dungeon tile deck to create a sense of mystery, this one inverts the idea by having you build and plan your route before each run.</p>
<p>To a backdrop of chunky 80's synthpop, you'll begin each night by drawing a hand of five tile cards. Some of them are plain corridors or junction points, some are rooms with special effects. A damage-buffing armoury, say, or a place to heal. You get three build points, which normally means you can place three tiles. Your goal here is to go from entrance to exit by unlocking progressively deeper sections of the dungeon through locked seals, which require collectibles. But you also need to return to the entrance at the end of each run before your health runs out, either through combat or because you've let your torch die. You can place bonfire rooms which replenish your torch, but they might end up making your overall layout a little awkward, and it's possible to get completely blocked out of progression.</p>
<p>Your character swings their weapon automatically, but you can finesse combat through movement and positioning. Slain enemies drop glimour, and the harvest maiden will grant you new room cards when you collect enough. You can keep runs short and safe but there's an ominous counter that fills up each night at the top of the screen. I'm certain something bad happens if it fills but I always blocked myself off and had to restart before it got to that point.</p>
<p>This is all wrapped up in Scottish folklore, which is where the harvest maiden comes from, although that version of her <em>was</em> all about the grain. Storytelling is svelte during the actual runs, but room tiles do have snatches of detail. A training room where blood seeps from the dummies. A campfire you can't feel the warmth from. But I think my favourite thing here is - as far as I could tell - you can't pull the map up during the actual runs, which means you have to navigate from plans and memory, perhaps building yourself entire mazes of health and bonfire buffs off to one side to let you harvest glimour. I could have just pressed every key on my keyboard and seen if any of them brought the map up, but I'm choosing to believe this is deliberate because I like the implications. I did press, like, four of them.</p>
<p>If I had to describe it in a single word, I'd say "addicting". And then I'd beat myself up because the correct word is "addictive". And then I'd beat myself up some more because that's a horribly nefarious and cold word to describe something as lovingly made as a nice videogame. Ahem: I had to tear myself away and I want to play more of it. On the wishlist it goes.</p>
<p>You can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2877770/Into_the_Restless_Ruins/">Into The Restless Ruins' demo on Steam here</a>. It's due out this April from Wales Interactive and Ant Workshop Ltd, whose previous forays into ill-lit catacombs include <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2144040/Dungeon_Golf/">Dungeon Golf</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Psylocke functions perfectly as an assassin while Hawkeye is meant to be used at range. But if you’re looking for an easy-to-pick-up hero with more flexibility, there is plenty of fun to be had with Magik.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-best-worst-duelists-damage-hela-hawkeye-1851739483&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-best-worst-duelists-damage-hela-hawkeye-1851739483"><em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ Damage Heroes, Ranked From Worst To Best</a></span></p><p>The young mutant is a powerhouse of a duelist who can deal substantial damage and steal health from enemies at the same time. Her kit is admittedly a bit all over the place, but we have the tips to help you master the Limbo ruler and bully the opposition.</p><h2 id="h162658"><a id=""></a><strong>You can dive in or be an off-tank</strong></h2><p>Magik has two prominent play-styles that can find success. The more popular strategy in my experience is using her as a dive character. This means using her Stepping Discs to teleport in from the sides or behind the enemy team, getting an elimination or two, and then returning to safety. I wouldn’t recommend taking on a Vanguard, but any <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-strategist-supports-best-worst-luna-snow-1851738627&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-strategist-supports-best-worst-luna-snow-1851738627">support heroes</a></span> or lonely ranged attackers are perfect targets.</p><p>Another viable strategy is to play Magik as more of an off-tank, to keep enemies from focusing on your team’s Vanguards. The main difference is that you’ll be fighting on the frontline alongside your Vanguards. Feel free to mix it up occasionally and use your stepping stones for a quick dive on the opposing team as well.</p><h2 id="h162659"><a id=""></a><strong>Watch out for the damage falloff on her primary Soulsword attack</strong></h2><p>One of my favorite qualities about Magik is her sword’s reach. The 6.5m length outclasses all other melee units and has helped me get numerous eliminations that seemed just out of reach. However, it does come with a unique drawback of damage falloff. Her primary Soulsword melee only deals the maximum 65 damage if the enemy is within 4.5m. It will then fall to 50 percent at the end of its range.</p><p>This drawback exists in her Darkchild form as well. Although her Soulsword range increases to 10m, the damage falloff begins at 6m and drops to a measly 25 percent damage at maximum range. The key takeaway here is that it’s better to be up close and personal when swinging this sword.</p><h2 id="h162660"><a id=""></a><strong>Animation canceling is your friend</strong></h2><p>Another drawback with Magik’s Soulsword is the slow rate of the attacks. Thankfully, just like other heroes, you can get a lot more damage in with animation canceling. Many of her abilities can instantly cancel the swinging animation, but the sweet spot is right after the sword makes contact. My go-to combos typically follow a loop of Soulsword &gt; universal melee &gt; another ability. Thanks to the damage buff she receives from her <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-season-bonus-team-up-health-damage-1851725468&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-season-bonus-team-up-health-damage-1851725468">Season Bonus</a></span>, I usually just need another Soulsword swing plus melee added to ensure that combo eliminates weaker heroes.</p><h2 id="h162661"><a id=""></a><strong>Stepping Discs and Umbral Incursion should be used often</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="ce2ee11b904b0f1ba0c927304833c524" data-recommend-id="image://ce2ee11b904b0f1ba0c927304833c524" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magik launches upwards towards Iron Man on the practice range." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Magik launches upwards towards Iron Man on the practice range." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ce2ee11b904b0f1ba0c927304833c524" data-recommend-id="image://ce2ee11b904b0f1ba0c927304833c524" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magik launches upwards towards Iron Man on the practice range." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Outside of animation canceling, the proper balance to her weighty attacks is some nifty mobility techniques with Stepping Discs and Umbral Incursion. Stepping Discs is a two-charge ability that teleports her horizontally in whichever direction she’s moving. Aside from becoming invincible to damage during the movement, it also allows her to cast one of two additional attacks for three seconds after teleporting. These special attacks include a wide area-of-effect swing and a demon familiar summon.</p><p>Umbral Incursion is a rapid dash that will slash enemies upward if it makes contact. Its range is longer than her teleport and the potential launcher is a great way to deal more damage. While she isn’t invincible during the dash, Magik can use it to dash upward or downward.</p><p>My advice is to use these liberally with fights and general movement alike. Both abilities are perfect for repositioning around enemies and putting the hurt on them. Pair them together and you can even get in the face of flying heroes like Iron Man. Equally important, the invincibility of Stepping Discs and verticality of Umbral Incursion makes them perfect for making a quick exit.</p><h2 id="h162662"><a id=""></a><strong>If your health gets low in a fight, keep on fighting</strong></h2><p>Whenever a fight gets too dicey for most heroes, the solution is either to use a protective or healing ability, or to escape. The appropriate response in Magik’s case is usually to keep swinging that sword and using her abilities. Thanks to her Limbo’s Might passive, Magik converts 30 percent of the damage she inflicts as bonus health. I can tell you from experience playing with her and against her that she can last a long time in a fight. Once the odds get stacked against her, such as a pesky ranged hero joining the fray, it’s time to leave.</p><figure id="" data-id="b3aa292dbc1e2893291c810f2cbcde19" data-recommend-id="image://b3aa292dbc1e2893291c810f2cbcde19" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Darkchild breaks the ground beneath her as she roars on the Hero information screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Darkchild breaks the ground beneath her as she roars on the Hero information screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b3aa292dbc1e2893291c810f2cbcde19" data-recommend-id="image://b3aa292dbc1e2893291c810f2cbcde19" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Darkchild breaks the ground beneath her as she roars on the Hero information screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h162663"><a id=""></a><strong>Play even more aggressively as Darkchild</strong></h2><p>Magik’s ultimate has her transform into the corrupted Darkchild for 12 seconds. Unlike the Hulk, the ability moveset is the same across both forms. The difference is that everything is enhanced as Darkchild. Attacks can do more damage and land additional hits, Umbral Incursion reaches a longer range at a quicker speed, and cooldowns are lowered across the board. All of it comes together to allow her to deal massive amounts of damage and gain a decent amount of bonus health at the same time.</p><p>Whether you’re diving in the back or pushing up front, the goal of Darkchild is to be aggressive and do whatever you can to get some eliminations. Earning the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-ace-scoreboard-team-kill-mean-1851722529&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-ace-scoreboard-team-kill-mean-1851722529">Ace title</a></span> can be a cinch with an ultimate like this. Just don’t activate it in the middle of a fight, since her low health can quickly get depleted and waste your opportunity.</p><p>Magik isn’t without her weaknesses in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, but she is still one of the deadliest dive heroes on the roster.

			<p>Just as it seems they are in real life, the museums of Two Point County are in a right old state. Luckily, you’re on hand to become the curator in Two Point Museum, taking charge of these underfunded, understaffed and under-exhibit-filled establishments while pioneering the exploration of everything from dinosaur skeletons to ghostly apparitions and even the wonders of outer space!</p>
<p><iframe title="Two Point Museum | ... MUSEUMS!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wx0_n1fGkWg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s easy to lump the Two Point series together, each of them being management sims with a homely art style and a love of puns that could only come from British developers. At a baseline, you’re creating rooms and flows for patrons to pass through, managing the happiness of your team of employees, and trying to make as much money as possible, but each of these games has some striking differences.</p>


<p>For Two Point Hospital, it was about creating a sequence of rooms, taking a patient from diagnosis through to treatment. Two Point Campus upended that with students locked in for a full year of learning, going through term time lectures as you also try to encourage their extra-curricular activities and foster lasting friendships and relationships, hoping to get good grades out of them at the end of the year. Two Point Museum swings back the other way, now with the most freeform and customisable layout for your buildings full of exhibits, and a separate layer that sees you sending employees off on expeditions to find things that belong in a museum.</p>


<p>There’s five overarching themes that run through Two Point Museum –&nbsp;Prehistory, Marine Life, Supernatural, Science and Space –&nbsp;each of which is the basis for the five main museum locations in the game. There’s some really fantastic variation between the five, all permeated by Two Point’s typical sense of humour. Prehistory has that classic dino skeleton museum look to it, that’s immediately contrasted to having to put up aquariums that cater to various fishy demands, the spectres and haunted mannequins of the supernatural, and how the Science museum puts more emphasis on creating steampunk-adjacent exhibits in your workshop. There’s also plenty of crossover between them, so you’ll be hiring experts from other disciplines to support your work in other museums.</p>
<p>That’s felt most heavily when sending teams out on expeditions. There’s a five regions, each filled with points of interest that are home to certain finds, and each with certain requirements and potential dangers. You’ll need to create a team with experts, and sometimes taking janitors, assistants and security staff alongside. Their particular trained skills and perks will give certain advantages to, alongside the single gear slot, cancel out dangers, boost your potential finds, and more.</p>
<p>It’s a good meta layer that you’ll constantly keep returning to, though it can also be a sticking point as you have to keep rolling the dice to try and find that one particular exhibit of the 3 or 4 available, or require you to level up staff and craft particular items to bypass obstacles.</p>

<p>In terms of raw numbers, having five museums (plus a few high score tasks) is a bit disappointing when compared to the 12 distinct campuses and themes in the last game. There’s hundreds of exhibits to uncover, though, and Two Point Museum’s structure through the career is different, having you flit back and forth between museums as you reach each milestone and earn a star, finding new narrative beats at each stage, and with each level having more than just a three star rating to hunt for. Of course, there’s also a sandbox mode that you can play across those core maps.</p>
<p>You’re given more freedom than ever before in how you want to construct your museum. The concept of placing individual rooms is still here for staff rooms, research, gift shops and the like, but the main areas through which visitors meander is as plain a canvas as you could want for. You can just have a totally open sprawl, if you want, but there’s a new kind of partition wall that you can use to create freeform rooms and layouts, adding structure and a flow to how you want visitors to experience your museum –&nbsp;and it’s also important when certain exhibits have particular environmental requirements.</p>
<p>These walls break from the strict grid layout that regular rooms and buildings still have, letting you block things out with diagonals and on the grid’s midpoints. That’s a huge increase in the flexibility it gives you, and in tandem with now being able to paint floor tiles with quartered triangles, it means that you can really customise the look of different areas, but it doesn’t always hang together quite right. In particular, setting a new wallpaper on the building proper won’t stop at a partition wall attached at the half grid, so you have a bit of orange (let’s say) sticking through to the cool blues you wanted next door, and the fill tools to quickly slap a new look down sometimes get confused and paint through to other areas. It can just be a little fussy. Thankfully, placing items is better than ever, defaulting to the grid an 45º angles, but letting you make micro adjustments from that to perfect their placement.</p>

<p>That’s important, because each exhibit needs to be situated in a good spot with access, but also have plentiful decorations, information boards, and more surrounding it to generate as much Buzz and Knowledge for your visitors. It’s can be generally quite straightforward, grouping exhibits together that come from a similar branch of research –&nbsp;all the prehistoric plants in one room with heaters, misters and other plants for decoration, all the dino skeletons together with interesting fossils nearby with thematic tusks, torches and dino footprints on the floor – but each will also have a particular decoration requirement to fulfil to help bump the Buzz level up further.</p>
<p>Your curated experience is really tied together by creating tours that your experts run, walking guests to a sequence of exhibits, explaining things to your patrons (with a bit of playacting), and looking to boost their enjoyment from their visit to your museum. A tour has a bunch of criteria that gives it a rating out of 5, including the overall Buzz, the length (sometimes less is more), the cohesiveness and the quality of the exhibits featured. The better the rating, the bigger the donations you receive, but it sometimes feels impossible to inch a tour past a particular rating –&nbsp;a regular objective –&nbsp;and can lead you to throwing money at expedition after expedition to get there.</p>
<p>Because, believe it or not, it is still all about money, and museums can’t live on entry ticket fees alone. No, there’s obviously the various vending machines, cafeteria and the plushie-filled gift shop to drain your patrons pockets, but if they’re enjoying their time, they’ll also throw any other cash they have into a nearby donation bin.</p>
<p>Each guest will have particular hopes for what they want to see. You’ll need to cover the basics of food, drink and loos, keep the environment neat and tidy, the exhibits in good condition, but they’ll also have a particular dream that you will want to fulfil. Kids might want to have a bunch of interactive exhibits, Cheese-moongers might want some cheesy food, Goths might want to be transformed into a vampire by a prehistoric chair. The usual kind of museum activities…</p>

<p>It’s easy to gloss over some of these finer details, just work on the fundamentals and still generally keep your museum growing and improving. If there’s a really pressing need, icons will pop up over someone’s head to let you know, and you’ve got a lot to juggle with adding security patrols to combat thieves, sending out expeditions, and doing the research and training in-house as well. Still, you can really dive in a get a deeper understanding of how things are going, boost you exhibits with upgrades, train up staff to specialise in particular areas, assign them to specific jobs, mark out zones and more. It’s often good to overhaul your museum’s layout, remix the exhibits you have and make efficiencies, just as it is to buy adjacent plots of land and expand, but this relies on nitty-gritty adjustments without a click and drag to select multiples.</p>

<p>As part of&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>'s first season of DLC characters, iconic fighters like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-heihachi-mishima-dlc-release-date" rel="nofollow">Heihachi Mishima</a>, capoeira dancer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-reveals-eddy-gordo-as-first-dlc-character-alongside-season-pass-1-roadmap" rel="nofollow">Eddy Gordo</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>'s Clive Rosfield, and Bandai Namco is continuing to add classic&nbsp;<em>Tekken&nbsp;</em>characters to&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>'s roster with its second season.</p>

<p>Introduced as "Scarlet Lightning" in her debut trailer, Anna proceeds to beat seven bells out of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-victor-chevalier-reveal" rel="nofollow">French agent Victor Chevalier</a>, who's voiced by none other than acting legend Vincent Cassel.</p>

As you'd expect given that this is Anna's trailer, the assassin makes short work of Lidia.</p>

<p>Finally, in a showdown for the ages, Anna gets to take on her sister Nina, who once again takes a beating from Anna. We also get to see Anna's Rage Art, which sees her summoning a helicopter to provide fire support as she blasts her opponent with Lovely Tom.</p>

<p>Anna will be released for&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>on April 3rd, with three-day early access available on March 31st for those who purchase the game's second season pass. You can see Anna in action via her debut trailer right here.</p>




<p>The second round of&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>DLC will include not only Anna, but also three more characters, as well as two extra stages. The first stage will arrive in summer, as will the next character after Anna. One more character will arrive in fall, and in winter, the season's final character and stage will launch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/two-point-museum-review-a-new-exhibit-in-fun/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Two Point series has long been known for its quirky humor, engaging management mechanics, and distinct art style. Two Point Museum is no exception. Following in the footsteps of Two Point Hospital and Two Point Campus, this new entry takes the tried-and-true formula to a fresh setting. If you couldn’t guess by the title, that setting is museums. While it doesn’t break the mold from what Two Point has offered players in the past, the additions it brings to the series—like expeditions and collections—make it a standout title that keeps players hooked.</p>



<h2 id="h-two-point-museum-review"><strong>Two Point Museum Review</strong></h2>



<p>Visually, Two Point Museum retains the same charming aesthetic as its predecessors. Upon your first load into the game, it immediately feels familiar, making it easy for veterans of the series to jump in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At its core, the gameplay loop also remains simple yet satisfying:</p>



<ol>
<li>Build out your museum with exhibits.</li>



<li>Attract visitors who pay for entry, gift shop items, and leave ratings on your museum.</li>



<li>Use their feedback and earnings to improve and expand.</li>



<li>Rinse and repeat.</li>
</ol>



<p>The campaign offers a well-paced introduction to the game, easing the sense of being overwhelmed with a structured progression. Each level introduces different environments and museum themes, ensuring variety and keeping things fresh. Whether you’re setting up a traditional city museum, converting a haunted hotel into a set of spooky exhibits, or building a marine-themed waterfront attraction, each setting presents unique challenges and opportunities.</p>



<p>One of Two Point Museum’s standout new features is the ability to send staff on expeditions to retrieve artifacts and exhibits. These can range from fossilized floppy disks to full dinosaur skeletons. Some exhibits require multiple trips to different regions to complete a full display, adding an extra layer of depth to the collection process. However, danger lurks&nbsp; as staff may encounter dilemmas, such as whether to retrieve an artifact teetering on the edge of a cliff, where the wrong decision could result in a lost team member. Occasionally, staff can even go missing entirely, forcing you to hire, train, and build up a replacement.</p>



<p>Adding to the fun, the game mocks loot boxes with an obnoxious animation when expeditions return, reinforcing that signature humor.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Two Point Museum Review | Insider Gaming" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SatxhdNJDSg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h3 id="h-managing-the-madness"><strong>Managing the Madness</strong></h3>



<p>Beyond collecting artifacts, keeping the museum running smoothly presents its own set of challenges. Managing staff is key, as employees tend to wander off or take seemingly endless breaks if not properly supervised. Visitors also present their own set of problems—families with kids need entertainment, which can mean setting up play areas with oddly positioned ladders, while mischievous guests might climb exhibits when you’d really prefer they didn’t.</p>



<p>Security plays a role, but theft, even on higher difficulty settings, doesn’t feel like as big of a threat as it could have been. Running the museum can get expensive, but (mostly) thanks to grants, finances never feel overly restrictive, even on harder difficulties. The real challenge comes in dealing with Kudosh—the game’s “premium” currency—, which can sometimes be frustrating to earn but never to the point of breaking the experience.</p>



<p>For those who prefer more creative freedom, Two Point Museum includes a robust sandbox mode. Players can choose between creative, career, or hardcore modes, with the latter increasing difficulty through limited cash, a higher chance of theft, and other obstacles. The Steam Workshop integration also opens the door for endless customization, allowing players to add new exhibits, museum themes, and more.</p>



<p>The campaign progression carries over across locations, meaning unlocks and inventory persist as you expand your museum empire. This incentivizes returning to previous museums to complete special exhibits, like one requiring both a marine and prehistory expert, or to integrate newly unlocked features like museum tours and small aquarium exhibits.</p>

<h3 id="h-areas-for-improvement"><strong>Areas for Improvement</strong></h3>



<p>While Two Point Museum delivers an overall enjoyable experience, there are a few areas where it could be refined. The inability to expand or adjust the layout of existing buildings is a bit frustrating, especially as space becomes limited. Although adjacent buildings can be added, the lack of flexibility in modifying layouts feels restrictive. Sure, you can build interior walls, but it’s not the same.</p>



<p>Additionally, the game’s user interface could be more intuitive, particularly when unlocking new areas of the map. For instance, progressing in the campaign requires reaching Level 5 Enlightenment, but the game does not clearly explain how to achieve this milestone, which can be confusing for players. Another missed opportunity lies in the security mechanics. While theft is present, even at higher difficulty settings, as mentioned earlier, it never truly feels like a significant challenge. A more dynamic security system could have added another engaging layer of management. These minor issues don’t detract from the overall enjoyment, but refining these aspects could elevate the game even further.</p>



<h3 id="h-two-point-museum-review-verdict"><strong>Two Point Museum Review Verdict</strong></h3>



<p>Two Point Museum doesn’t revolutionize the series, but it successfully adapts the beloved formula to a new and entertaining setting. Expeditions and collections inject fresh gameplay elements, while the humor and accessible mechanics make it enjoyable for both newcomers and seasoned players. Despite a few minor frustrations with building expansion and UI clarity, the game’s charm, depth, and variety make it an easy recommendation.</p>



<p>Whether you’re uncovering ancient artifacts, dealing with frozen bees and cavemen (who, if thawed, cause chaos on your guests), or wondering why Yetis and vampires are visiting your museum, Two Point Museum has that special something that hooks you.</p>



<p>In my time with the game, it became way too easy to find myself sitting down to play only to realize five hours have passed and it’s now 2am with a baby who wakes up at 6am. Still, Two Point Museum is a one of those games well worth the sleep deprivation.</p>



<p><strong>VERDICT: BUY</strong></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-2-remake-studio-bloober-team-working-with-konami-on-new-game.1118211/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-konami-new-game-ip<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake developer Bloober Team has announced that it's working on another project alongside Konami, and that the game will be based on Konami's intellectual property.</p>

<p>In a press <a href="https://blooberteam.prowly.com/383560-bloober-team-and-konami-continue-their-collaboration" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">release</a>, Bloober says it's "focusing on a new game based on Konami's IP" and that details of the project "remain a mystery" right now. The studio goes on to say it "can't reveal too many details at this time" but that fans will be "just as excited" about the collaboration as Bloober is.</p>

<p>It's interesting that Bloober is remaining cagey about exactly what IP it's working on. The obvious choice would, of course, be&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>; perhaps the team has been selected to develop another remake. Still, it's a little odd Bloober would play those cards so close to its chest given its work on&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloober-team-konami-new-game-silent-hill-2.jpg?itok=vItbk2rq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloober-team-konami-new-game-silent-hill-2.jpg?itok=Uhp93h6U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bloober Team is working on another game based on Konami IP, and it may or may not be&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Given Bloober Team's penchant for horror, it doesn't feel like any other IP makes sense; I can't quite picture a Bloober Team&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid&nbsp;</em>game, for instance, although<i>&nbsp;</i><em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>might be a slightly easier pitch.</p>

<p>If you ask me, I think it'll likely be a remake of the original&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>. Remaking the third game before the first makes no sense to me since they share plot elements, and while I'd love&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 4: The Room&nbsp;</em>to get a remake, it hasn't been that long since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-4-room-comes-to-gog-for-gogs-12th-anniversary" rel="nofollow">the game was re-released on PC</a>.</p>

<p>Either way, picking Bloober Team to work on a new Konami game makes sense given their first collaboration's success; Konami recently revealed that the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">topped two million sales worldwide</a>,&nbsp;</p>




<p>It's been a pretty active time for Konami recently in terms of its major franchises. After many years of dormancy, the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake launched in October, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-and-more-all-but-confirmed" rel="nofollow">more&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>projects are on the way</a>&nbsp;as well.</p>

<p>Not only that, but <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">in August</a>, Konami will release&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>, a full remake of the 2004 stealth-action classic built in Unreal Engine 5 and sporting revamped gameplay.</p>

<p>Now, all Konami needs to do to complete the trifecta of my childhood dreams is to revive&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>. It's been so long that I'd even take a remake at this point, although I'd prefer an entirely new game, of course. Stay tuned for more!</p>

They’re best at wielding two-handed weapons for big bonks or going the sword and shield route for a bit of added protection. If you like a traditional soldier archetype, the Fighter is your best bet.</p><p>During the opening hours of your time as a Fighter, you’ll get the Charge ability that lets you interrupt enemies with a dash attack, and passive abilities that improve your damage with two-handed weapons or your critical damage with any melee weapon. You’ll also get another passive ability that reduces how much of a stamina penalty you suffer for wearing heavier armor.</p><p>Later, your Fighter will receive an ability that taunts and pulls foes to you, as well as one that allows your melee attacks to deal back some of the damage you’ve recently received. When you reach the end of the tree, you can even snag an ability that lets you spin in a whirlwind to obliterate every baddie you hit. Spin to win!</p><h2 id="h373"><a id=""></a><strong>Ranger - Light melee and ranged combat with high agility and stealth</strong></h2><p>Rangers are masters of agility, stealth, and precision. This class is best when using bows or guns at range, then busting out one-handed melee weapons when forced into close-quarters combat. If sniping your foes from afar and kiting around them while using forces of nature appeals to you, the Ranger might be your cup of tea.</p><p>As a Ranger, you’ll get early access to passive abilities that improve your damage with bows, guns, and one-handed melee weapons. You’ll also get an incredibly useful spell that roots enemies in place for eight seconds to give you some time to put some space between the two of you.</p><p>As you continue to level the Ranger, you’ll get an ability that makes you invisible so that you can sneak around in the shadows, as well as a passive ability that occasionally grants you an extra upgrade material when picking herbs or breaking down equipment. You’ll even be able to summon a ghostly bear to aid you in battle much later on, which is objectively cool as hell.</p><h2 id="h374"><a id=""></a><strong>Wizard - Spell-based combat with improved Essence and elemental effects</strong></h2><p>Wizards focus on slinging spells and controlling the battlefield with magic. This class is designed for those who enjoy a magic-focused playstyle with limited attention to physical combat. You’ll spend most of your time casting spells with wands and grimoires, and you’ll benefit from having a higher pool of Essence (essentially mana) to aid in that endeavor.</p><p>When first starting out with the Wizard, you’ll be able to use a passive ability to increase your damage with wands and choose from a variety of spells from different elements like fire, electricity, ice, and poison. You’ll be able to improve your survivability by casting a spell that reduces incoming damage by 25 percent, while building up Frost on attackers.</p><p>As you progress with the Wizard, you’ll become a magical powerhouse. You’ll be able to choose which types of damage you want to improve accumulation with, as well as rain hellfire down with a meteor shower that can deal huge damage to all enemies in an area. When you’re running low on Essence, you can even summon a seal to stand on that will regenerate it for a short while. (Like a glyph. Not a small aquatic mammal. Don’t stand on those.) You’re virtually unstoppable!</p><hr><p><em>Avowed</em> is available now on Xbox Series X and PC.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Delta Force and its Black Hawk Down Campaign gameplay need a console release. The title is having great success on PC, but a lack of console presence can be a killer. Let’s see what developer Team Jade has planned for the shooter’s future.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Hawk Down Campaign</a> kickstarted a new wave of interest in Delta Force. The military shooter has gained a sizable following due to its no-nonsense first-person shooter gameplay. Bullets and bombs are all part and parcel of the deadly Delta Force experience. 2025 saw the game’s official launch, and Black Hawk Down is a piece of free, single-player Campaign DLC.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-mostly-negative/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Hawk Down has been perceived as too difficult</a> in some corners of the internet. But console players are desperate to judge this for themself. Let’s find out the latest on Delta Force coming to consoles.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-delta-force-black-hawk-console-release">Do we Know The Delta Force Black Hawk Console Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Imagine this on the PS5 and Xbox Series X. Credit to Team Jade</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Team Jade has postponed Delta Force’s original console release date, meaning the Black Hawk Down content has also been delayed. There is no new revised released window for the first-person shooter title on either PlayStation or Xbox for now.</strong></p>



<p>A video featuring one of <a href="https://www.playdeltaforce.com/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Delta Force</a>‘s devs talked about the game’s release on console. They said “The release date may have to be postponed” and cited “input fairness” and controller/aiming as a problem the team was having a tough time translating to console.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>But they were quick to indicate “development of the console version is going well,” meaning we, hopefully, shouldn’t have to wait too long. We should learn more soon enough as the official Delta Force X account has indicated a “<strong>console roadmap</strong>” is gearing up to be shared with the community.</p>







<p>For the time being Delta Force—and the Black Hawk Down content—is only playable on PC until a new announcement is made. Be sure to check in with the guide as we anticipate an update from Team Jade.</p>



<hr>



<p>Are you playing Delta Force on PC in the meantime? Will you switch over the second it’s released on consoles? Or has the prospect of the Black Hawk Down Campaign put you off completely? Let us know.</p>



<p>We have a few other Delta Force guides to keep you going until the announcement. We know the game’s available <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-delta-force-platforms-playstation-xbox-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">platforms</a> and its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-delta-force-hawk-ops-weapons-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">weapons list</a>.</p>

Our 'two-pronged' approach (combining self-research and investments to explore global markets), is still actively progressing and yielding positive results.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For titles developed by the self-owned studios, we successfully launched games like Once Human and Marvel Rivals in 2024.

That is the company’s strategy, and there is no change in this plan. For any studio globally, it behooves us as a responsible commercial business to frequently evaluate the progress, viability and potential for success of our products and teams."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When pressed for an update specifically regarding NetEase subsidiary studios Nagoshi Studio, Grasshopper Manufacture, Pincool, GPTRACK50, and Quantic Dream, the NetEase Games rep added:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For the studios you specifically pointed out, I haven’t heard any changes so far.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-shutting-down-in-may<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Phoenix Labs has announced that multiplayer monster-hunting action RPG&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>will shut down in May, and while the studio hasn't given a concrete reason for the game shutting down, it's easy to guess why it's happening.</p>

<p>In a rather terse&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/331370/view/503943474819631342" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on Steam, Phoenix Labs simply says that&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>will shut down on May 29th and that it will receive "no additional content or updates". From May 29th, you'll no longer be able to play&nbsp;<em>Dauntless</em>.</p>

<p>It sounds like not only will there be no new content after the shutdown (naturally), but that the game won't be getting any major updates before then, either. In short,&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>is basically a dead game walking at this point.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dauntless-shutting-down-monster.jpg?itok=iWDvQy2c 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dauntless-shutting-down-monster.jpg?itok=Czum_WmI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>will shut down in May.</figcaption></figure><p>So, why is&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>shutting down? Well, while Phoenix Labs doesn't give a reason (in either the official announcement or in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dauntless/comments/1ix9232/its_finally_over/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a Discord message</a> sent to players, apparently), we can make a very strong educated guess.</p>

<p>A quick look at&nbsp;<em>Dauntless</em>' Steam numbers (via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/331370/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, as usual) shows an active player count of just 61, with 107 players checking into the game over the last 24 hours. It's clear players aren't exactly flocking to&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>right now.</p>

<p>A major reason for that is likely the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-awakening-update-apology" rel="nofollow">controversial Awakening update</a>, which was released in December and which quickly drew the ire of players.&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>fans criticized the update's approach to monetization and progression, among other things.</p>

<p>Following the Awakening update's poor reception, Phoenix Labs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-developer-phoenix-labs-more-layoffs" rel="nofollow">laid off "the majority" of its staff</a>, leaving the future of games like&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>uncertain. Now, the future of at least one of those games is a lot clearer.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm</em>, it's unclear whether support will continue for the cozy farming sim. Phoenix Labs isn't shutting down just yet, after all, although things aren't looking good for the studio.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you need a monster hunting fix, you might want to check in with Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, which launches later this week. Our own Tyler <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier" rel="nofollow">was impressed with the game</a>, so it might well fill that&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>hole for you.</p>

Redditor Shaun_LaDee highlighted three images included in paid bundles that have irregularities that could suggest the use of generative AI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans then called on Activision to disclose the use of generative AI for art that is included in bundles that are sold, and following new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3862463747997849618" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>AI disclosure rules</u></a> for Steam, it has now added a vague disclosure that covers the entirety of Black Ops 6 on Valve’s platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 6’s Steam AI Generated Content Disclosure reads: “Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in game assets.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In July, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Wired</u></a> reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-reportedly-sold-an-ai-generated-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-cosmetic"><u>Activision sold an “AI-generated cosmetic” for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 last year</u></a>. The cosmetic in question was not named, but was linked to the Yokai’s Wrath bundle released in December 2023. The store did not disclose any use of generative AI for this bundle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This bundle cost 1,500 COD Points, the premium virtual currency sold for real-world money that generates hundreds of millions of dollars for Activision each year. 1,500 COD Points is approximately valued at $15.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wired pointed out that Microsoft, which owns Activision Blizzard after its $69 billion acquisition of the company last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce"><u>cut 1,900 staff from its gaming business</u></a> just months after Activision sold this skin. The report alleged that 2D artists’ jobs were being replaced by AI at the company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of 2D artists were laid off,” one anonymous Activision artist told the site. “Remaining concept artists were then forced to use AI to aid in their work.” Activision employees were allegedly “made” to sign up for AI training, with its use promoted throughout the business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Generative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. Generative AI thus far has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-made-purely-with-ai-failed-because-tech-was-unable-to-replace-talent"><u>The game failed</u></a>, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> developer Niantic has responded to confusion over unexplained progression limits for the game's first paid event battle pass, which went on sale yesterday.
</p>
<p>
The game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-tour-pass-how-to-get-points-ranks-milestones-rewards-deluxe-price-9505">Tour Pass is a core part of this weekend's upcoming Go Tour event</a>, and rewards an encounter with Mythical creature Victini plus oodles of in-game items and bonuses. It also includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-lucky-trinket-how-to-get-9505">the first Lucky Trinket item</a>, which instantly unlocks Lucky Friend status with a player of your choice.
</p>
<p>
There's a free version of the Tour Pass without Victini and the Lucky Trinket, or alternatively you can pay £14.99 for the Deluxe version with far more rewards at each rank. For those really looking to spend, you can instead pay £19.99 for the Deluxe pass with 10 tiers unlocked straight away.
</p>
<p>
Why would you want to pay to unlock tiers? Well, the Tour Pass has 100 levels of item and Pokémon encounter rewards, and then a further 400 levels of Stardust resource dollops - making for 500 levels total. And, currently, you are restricted to only unlocking five tiers per day. 
</p>
<p>
Pokémon Go does not currently state in-game that this restriction will be lifted when this weekend's game properly begins, and yet you can start inching through the battle pass now. 
</p>
<p>"I was excited to have something to grind for and actually go out and play," one fan wrote on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1ix96z1/update_on_tour_pass_from_niantic_support/">top Pokémon Go reddit TheSilphRoad</a>. "Then I reached my cap just playing around my office and I suddenly have no interest in going out to play."</p>
<p>"I feel robbed but I guess that's the norm," wrote another fan. "Went out and did all the raids and caught all the legendries from research only to get to the same level as I could have by just catching a few pokemon in the yard."</p>

<p>
On the one hand, allowing players to get to grips with the game's first battle pass ahead of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-tour-unova-event-times-schedule-rewards-free-activities-9505">Pokémon Go Tour this weekend</a> means fans can figure out how it all works in good time. On the other, not explaining the limits, not giving players the same experience they'll get at the weekend and selling an even more expensive version of the battle pass with extra progression built in without explaining that has left some fans complaining of a cash grab.
</p>
<p>
At the very least, it's a bizarre situation that could have been better explained - something Niantic itself has seemingly now realised, as it issued a <a href="https://x.com/NianticHelp/status/1894092647981072499">clarification notice via the game's Support social media account</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Trainers, we want to clarify the Tour Pass experience during the Road to Unova event. You can earn a capped amount of Pass Points per day from Monday to Friday to get a head start on your Tour Pass," Niantic wrote. 
</p>
<p>
"During Go Tour Global weekend, the Pass Point limits will be removed and you will have the opportunity to obtain an unlimited amount of points during the event."
</p>
<p>
The forthcoming event is one of Niantic's most heavily-monetised in-game weekends ever, with the following tickets available:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-masterwork-research-a-dazzling-aria-quest-steps-rewards-how-to-get-shiny-meloetta-9505">Masterwork quest for Shiny Meloetta</a> - £4.99</li>
<li>Tour Pass Deluxe - £14.99</li>
<li>Tour Pass Deluxe + 10 Levels - £19.99</li>
<li>Road to Unova: Raids Ticket - £4.99</li>
<li>Road to Unova: Hatch Ticket - £4.99</li>
</ul>

<p>
Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-developer-close-to-selling-games-for-35bn-to-saudi-owned-monopoly-go-maker-report">it was reported that Niantic was in negotiations with the Saudi-backed mobile giant Scopely</a>, developer of Monopoly Go and Marvel Strike Force, over a sale of the still hugely lucrative Pokémon Go. 
</p>
<p>
The news was met with shock by members of the Pokémon Go community, based on the aggressive monetisation added by Scopely to other games it has acquired. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fans-launch-campaign-to-protect-games-future-as-concerns-mount-over-sale">Fans have since begun contacting the overall owner of the Pokémon franchise to share their concerns</a>.

			<p>A new Final Fantasy VII Rebirth mod released today introduces a new handy feature that allows players to add more characters to their active combat party, including those not normally available and that never actually join the party during the course of the game.</p>
<p>The Party Mod Menu, developed by Braklinath and now available for download on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/530?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>, adds an in-game menu to change the party members that participate in battle, making it possible to make every available character an active combat character, change the party leader and add characters that do not join the party during the course of the game, including Sephiroth, Zack, Cid, and Vincent. Having any of these four characters in the party, however, can lead to issues outside of combat, and even in combat, as the game even locks up if either Cid or Vincent are in the active combat party, which is not surprising since the two characters were never meant to be playable in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. In case you want to check out how the mod works before downloading it, you can watch a video showcase provided by the mod's developer below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/618709/steam-deck-3-year-anniversary-handheld-gaming-shipments-idc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Today is the third anniversary of Valve’s Steam Deck, the handheld gaming PC that all but created the market for handheld gaming PCs. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22950371/valve-steam-deck-review">It was a mess to start</a>! But three years later, <em>The Verge </em>has data showing how it has dominated the nascent market. While Valve told us in November 2023 that it had<a href="http://its competitors have stacked up"> sold “multiple millions”</a> of the AMD-powered handheld, we’ve never had a good glimpse at how big it is or how Windows competitors stack up… till now. It seems the Steam Deck, so far, has been bigger than all its competitors combined.</p><p>Market research firm IDC uses supply chains to estimate just how many handheld gaming systems have shipped around the world, and creates <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US50814724">spending forecasts</a>. When I asked IDC market research analyst Lewis Ward if he’d be willing to isolate SteamOS and Windows gaming handhelds from that data, he said yes.</p><p>So here are the estimated combined shipments of the Steam Deck, and the Windows-based Asus ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go, and MSI Claw from 2022 through 2024, and an estimate for 2025:</p><div><table><thead><tr><th><h3>2022</h3></th><th><h3>2023</h3></th><th><h3>2024</h3></th><th><h3>2025 (Estimate)</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1,620,000</td><td>2,867,000</td><td>1,485,000</td><td>1,926,000</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><cite><em>Combined Valve Steam Deck, Asus ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go, and MSI Claw. Figures include all SKUs in associated hardware families.</em></cite></p></div></div><p>Add it up, and that’s just under 6 million shipments in three years. One way to view that: it’s small and it’s not really growing. IDC’s forecasting under 2 million shipments in 2025, rather than any major expansion.</p><p>Another is that it’s simply early days for the category: Meta’s Ray-Bans only <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/613292/meta-ray-ban-2-million-10-million-capacity-subscription-essilor-luxottica-earnings">sold 2 million pairs</a> between October 2023 and February 2025, but its maker is taking that as a sign it could soon sell 10 million <em>each</em> year.</p><p>“I think it’s amazing,” AMD gaming marketing boss Frank Azor tells me, discussing IDC’s numbers for handheld gaming PCs. “This didn’t exist three years ago; we went from nothing, zero, to incremental category creation in the millions of units.”</p><p>But out of those 6 million shipments, the lion’s share have been the Steam Deck itself, according to IDC’s estimates. All of the 2022 shipments are the Steam Deck, and Ward tells me upwards of 50 percent of the 2023 shipments and 48 percent of the 2024 shipments are the Deck as well. Doing the math, Valve has now shipped upwards of 3.7 million Steam Decks and has quite possibly crossed 4 million by now.</p><p>(Note: IDC’s numbers do not currently include Chinese handhelds from companies like GPD, Ayaneo and OneXPlayer, though it seems possible they are small players based on their public backer numbers on Indiegogo.)</p><p>With as few as 2 million Windows handhelds shipping in two years, it’s not a <em>huge</em> surprise <a href="http://The Z2 line is similarly a set of tweaked laptop chips">that AMD and Intel aren’t spending big on more custom chips</a> like the one that’s still working perfectly well for the Steam Deck — particularly if the rumors are true that early Windows handheld buyers returned their purchases at unusually high rates. (Anecdotally, I’ve seen lots of open-box stock of the Asus ROG Ally when I’ve looked at Best Buy online and in-person.)</p><p>But I hope AMD will invest in making that Steam Deck lightning strike again. Because when every other low-power gaming chip is originally aimed at laptops rather than handhelds, we get disappointments like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/617613/lenovo-legion-go-s-review-feels-good-plays-bad#comments">the new Lenovo Legion Go S</a>, which couldn’t stand up to the three-year-old Steam Deck’s one-year-old OLED revision in my review, or the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24105991/msi-claw-review">original MSI Claw</a>. Or, we get pretty good handhelds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">like the ROG Ally X </a>that offset power hungry chips with a bigass battery, but cost $800 or more.</p><p>Not that chips are the <em>only</em> reason the Steam Deck has come this far, not by a long shot! It’s the combination of Valve’s pick-up-and-play SteamOS — which lets you simply press a button to easily sleep and resume — and its Proton compatibility layer and precompiled shaders that, incredibly, often make Windows games run on Linux better than they run on Windows. Then there’s its infinitely customizable and comfortable controls that make decades of older games playable.</p><p>It’s also the price — think console, not gaming laptop — and how incredibly easy Valve makes it to temporarily tweak performance in exchange for more battery life, and how many additional things you can do with a Steam Deck if you try. (Epic Games Store and Ubisoft and even Blizzard games are playable if you jump through a couple hoops; it can easily stream your PlayStation with the Chiaki app you can find in the Linux desktop app browser, letting the handheld double as a PlayStation Portal.)</p><div><p>No other shipping handheld has come close, and while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">a combination of the Asus ROG Ally X and the SteamOS not-quite-a-fork Bazzite</a> can feel like the best of both worlds, you’ll pay twice the price of an entry level Steam Deck to get it.</p></div><p>I mistakenly thought the most important handheld at CES 2025 was the Lenovo Legion Go S, because Valve’s Steam Deck designers had given it their blessing to become <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">the first authorized third-party SteamOS handheld</a>, but I was wrong. Here’s how I ended my Legion Go S review: “If you’re waiting for a $499 Legion Go S with SteamOS, here’s my advice: just buy <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">a $530 Steam Deck OLED</a> instead.”</p><div><p>While it’s true that new triple-A PC games now require more power than the Steam Deck can comfortably give you, Valve has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275604/dont-expect-a-new-steam-deck-to-drop-each-year">consistently said</a> that it will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23884863/valve-steam-deck-2-refresh-upgrade-cpu-2025">wait until it can provide a “leap”</a> in performance without sacrificing battery life before it introduces a Steam Deck 2, and that it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337300/amd-ryzen-z2-z2-extreme-z2-go">won’t be using this year’s AMD Z2 chips.</a></p></div><p>Between that promise, the many excellent new games that <em>do</em> target Steam Deck, the high prices of new Nvidia GPUs, and the idea that new Microsoft and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305337/sony-handheld-gaming-console-playstation-nintendo-microsoft">Sony handhelds</a> are<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295461/dont-expect-an-xbox-handheld-any-time-soon"> likely a few years away</a>, I don’t think there are all that many reasons to wait to buy today’s Steam Deck — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24351383/handheld-pcs-challenge-switch-2-editorial">unless the Nintendo Switch 2</a> somehow supplants the Steam Deck as the handheld that game developers prefer to target with games.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Activision has confirmed some in-game content in Call of Duty has been created using generative AI.</p>
<p>As spotted by Call of Duty account CharlieIntel, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1938090/Call_of_Duty/">Steam page</a> for the game's launcher (incorporating <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a>, Modern Warfare 3, and Warzone) has been updated with a new AI notice, as per the rules of Steam.</p>
<p>"Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in-game assets," it reads.</p>

<p>No further details are specified, but fans are already speculating where AI has been used.</p>
<p>"We could tell lmao this loading screen had six fingers," reads one reply, referring to the zombie artwork used last Christmas (above). <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-block-ops-6-players-accuse-activision-of-using-ai-slop">Players accused Activision at the time</a> of using "AI slop".</p>
<p>Other responses called out Activision for being lazy, or replied sarcastically: "Really? No way?!"</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Activision has now confirmed some in game content in Call of Duty is AI generated. </p><p>“Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in game assets,” Activision says as part of a required disclosure on Steam. <a href="https://t.co/YJ3Yebd2wc">pic.twitter.com/YJ3Yebd2wc</a></p></div>— CharlieIntel (@charlieINTEL) <a href="https://twitter.com/charlieINTEL/status/1894211182141091939?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 25, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Other artwork in the past has been called out by fans, including a <a href="https://x.com/notblametruth/status/1865233189091823987">six-fingered hand holding Gobblegum</a>, while <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/call-of-duty/call-of-duty-admits-its-using-generative-ai-to-help-develop-some-in-game-assets-and-suddenly-all-those-poorly-made-calling-cards-make-sense/">PC Gamer</a> has pointed out the seeming use of AI in 2D calling cards.</p>
<p>Since January 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-adds-in-game-reporting-of-illegal-content-in-ai-games">Valve has required developers to disclose on Steam when AI is used</a> in their games. Players are also able to flag when "illegal content" has been used.</p>
<p>AI is also used in Activision's Ricochet anti-cheat system, which uses machine learning to combat cheaters. But as <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/">Wired reported in 2024</a>, the rise in using generative AI for in-game assets has followed the loss of jobs across the games industry.</p>

            <p>A new story trailer for the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies Of P</a> Overture expansion shows us more of the "legendary stalker" the player will be following through the snowy surroundings of Krat. The lore is served up raw with a heavy garnishing of opaque chatter that explains absolutely nothing. But I hear that's how you cook a soulslike story. Come watch and see if you can understand more of the stalker's words than I do. You probably will if you recognise the classical tune playing underneath it all.</p>

<p>The track that plays during the trailer is a classical cover of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdRx1OMpJQ">"Feel"</a> from the base game, which you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzlQlUtlQ40">play on gramophone in-game</a>. It's described in lore-ish item notes as a "a song that quietly comforts the dark." I haven't played Lies Of P, so I don't know if the song is significant to the game's story in any other way, or if this is just the developers capitalising on a fan favourite from the original soundtrack (let me know). Either way, it's a nice tune.</p>
<p>The DLC will see you following and fighting alongside a swordswoman dressed in what looks like an officer's cavalry uniform of the era. This stalker and the puppety protagonist seem to be out of sync in one part of the trailer, but come together at the end to stand in front of a manor that might be the Rose Estate - a charity house for orphans that was teased in the base game. It's possible this prequel expansion will investigate the <a href="https://lies-of-p.fandom.com/wiki/Rose_Estate_Incident,_Left_As_A_Mystery">shady goings-on</a> of that building.</p>
<p>The expansion was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-the-absence-of-bloodborne-on-pc-we-get-a-snowy-expansion-for-lies-of-p">announced a couple of weeks ago with a boss-dripping trailer</a> during PlayStation's State of Play event. It's due to be released some time in summer this year, we're told. I like to think that Ed (RPS in peace) is out there somewhere, looking at this and wondering if it's worth dipping back into the world of Belle Époque marionettes. He liked the game a lot <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lies-of-p-review">when he reviewed it</a>. Alas, I cannot know his feelings. We cannot cross the bounds of time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
