PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 subscribers get the original PlayStation 2 version via an emulator, while Xbox Series X and S and Xbox One subscribers get the Scholarship Edition.</p><p>Here’s Rockstar’s explanation:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Players on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 4 can download and play the original PlayStation 2 version of Bully via the PlayStation 4 rerelease and PlayStation 5 backward compatibility</li><li>Players on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One can download and play Bully: Scholarship Edition via Xbox backward compatibility</li></ul><p>(Bully: Scholarship Edition contains missions, classes, clothing items, and two-player online mini-games not included in the original launch version of Bully.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every IGN Rockstar Game Review Ever</h3></div></output><p>So, no remaster or fresh version of Bully then, which will come as some disappointment to fans. Bully is Rockstar Vancouver’s much-loved open-world juvenile delinquent sim that first launched in 2006 on PS2. A sequel <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-rockstar-developers-share-details-on-the-development-of-the-cancelled-bully-2"><u>was once in development at Rockstar’s New England studio in the late 2000s</u></a>, but obviously never came out. In November, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-gta-6-waiting-in-the-wings-fans-find-possible-evidence-of-cut-gta-5-story-dlc-canned-bully-2"><u>the alleged leak of a database file for Grand Theft Auto 5</u></a> was found to include reference to the unreleased <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/bully-2"><u>Bully 2</u></a>, with some of its ideas making it into other Rockstar games like Red Dead Redemption 2.</p><p>In April, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-gets-bully-and-la-noire-later-this-year-rockstar-teases-big-gta-online-update-this-summer">Rockstar said LA Noire is also coming to GTA+ later in 2024</a>, although there’s no release date yet. LA Noire is Team Bondi’s 2011 open-world game set in 1947 Los Angeles. As with Bully, fans have called for a sequel, although Team Bondi itself is no more.</p><p>All this comes with <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi"><u>GTA 6</u></a> looming over the horizon. Rockstar has said it will come out fall 2025. It has yet to say what will happen to the existing GTA Online when it does.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p> Game director Hiroshi Takai said that future Final Fantasies may launch on both PC and console day one.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-16-confirms-september-pc-release-date-director-says-its-possible-probably-even-likely-future-final-fantasy-games-launch-day-1-on-pc/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, Takai was asked whether future Final Fantasy games will get a day-one PC release. He responded, "I think it's possible--probably even likely," but then clarified, "That said, the team in charge of each project gets to decide its own policy, so this is just my personal opinion."</p><p>This PC port of Final Fantasy XVI comes over a year after the original game released. When asked whether the wait was worth it, Takai said, "Looking at the results, I think the time we've put into optimizing the game for PC was time well spent." </p><p>Square Enix has had some big shakeups recently. According to a financial report earlier in 2024, the company is seeking to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-is-rethinking-how-it-approaches-games-and-its-coming-at-a-huge-cost/1100-6523070/" data-ref-id="1100-6523070">more selective about which games it will develop</a>. This approach led to multiple titles being canceled, leading $140,000,000 in "content abandonment" losses, though Square Enix did not identify which games were affected.</p><p>The company has struggled with PC ports in the past. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stranger-of-paradise-game-breaking-hair-has-been-fixed/1100-6503579/" data-ref-id="1100-6503579">Stranger in Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forspoken-updates-coming-to-improve-performance-graphics-and-more/1100-6511306/" data-ref-id="1100-6511306">Forspoken</a> both got some big updates after launch to boost performance. In the interview Takai affirmed that the company "always listens to player feedback and bears it in mind." Square Enix is not the only company emphasizing PC ports. Sony is also launching some games day one on PC, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-boss-reveals-why-sony-doesnt-release-most-ps5-games-on-pc-day-and-date/1100-6523804/" data-ref-id="1100-6523804">waiting to port others</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-xvi-launches-on-pc-in-september-demo-out-now/1100-6525923/" data-ref-id="1100-6525923">Final Fantasy 16 is landing on PC</a> September 17, alongside both DLC (sold seperately).

            <p>Sony is pulling <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a> from its PS Plus subscription service in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>The first-party Sony game is now listed under the 'Last Chance to Play' section on PS Plus, along with the likes of NieR Replicant, Marvel's Midnight Suns and Alien Isolation.</p>
<p>This upcoming removal of Forbidden West comes just a few months after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-is-pulling-its-own-blockbuster-game-from-ps-plus">Horizon Zero Dawn was also removed from the service</a>, which as Tom wrote at the time seemed a surprising move by Sony.</p>

<p>The full list of games in the Last Chance to Play section of PS Plus are as follows:</p>

<li>Horizon Forbidden West</li>
<li>Marvel's Midnight Suns</li>
<li>Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2</li>

<p>Along with Forbidden West and - of course - Alien Isolation, I would fully recommend giving Marvel's Midnight Suns a go. In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-midnight-suns-review-crush-evil-dm-the-avengers-and-find-that-perfect-bedside-table">Eurogamer's own Marvel's Midnight Suns</a> review, Christian Donlan called it "great tactical fun nestled in a sweet-natured superhero dollhouse".</p>
<p>Also, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-your-playstation-plus-extra-and-premium-lineup-for-august">as previously announced</a> but highlighting it again here because I know how you all feel about TimeSplitters: the trilogy is now live in the PlayStation Plus Classics Catalogue. The games are also available to purchase via the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/search/timesplitters">PS Store for £7.99 each</a>.</p>

The new Game Pass Standard subscription includes the usual Game Pass library for Xbox but with online console multiplayer, too. Crucially, it doesn’t include immediate access to day-one game releases, though.</p><p>During the test period, Xbox Insiders will be able to access Xbox Game Pass Standard for just $1. “Any renewals during the preview period will also be $1 per month,” <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/08/20/xbox-insiders-everything-you-need-to-know-about-xbox-game-pass-standard/">says Megan Spurr</a>, senior community lead for Xbox Game Pass. Once this Standard tier launches fully, it will be priced at $14.99 per month.</p><div><figcaption><em>The new Game Pass lineup.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Microsoft</cite></p></div><p>Microsoft is also providing some clarity on when day-one games and other titles will be available in the Standard tier. “Some games coming to Game Pass Ultimate (day one games or other game entries) will not be immediately available with Game Pass Standard and may be added to the library at a future date (can be up to 12 months or more and will vary by title),” says Spurr.</p><p>Microsoft first revealed its new Xbox Game Pass Standard tier in July, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/9/24195312/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-increase-standard-subscription">alongside price increases</a> for Ultimate and PC Game Pass subscribers. Microsoft has promised to launch Xbox Game Pass Standard in the “coming months.” The existing Xbox Game Pass for Console subscription will continue for current subscribers, but new Game Pass subscribers are no longer able to select the console option until the new Game Pass Standard subscription is available more broadly.</p><p>If you’re interested in testing Xbox Game Pass Standard for just $1, you can opt-in through the Xbox Insider Hub on an Xbox console. Microsoft says “current Game Pass Core members with two months or more on their membership or current Game Pass Ultimate members will not be able to participate in this flight.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the years since it began syndication, it was nominated for (and won) a few literary awards, and both seasons of its anime series brought home Crunchyroll’s Anime of the Year. But as a weekly reader, my “in memoriam” to the manga is that it hasn’t been very good for a while, and its end couldn’t come soon enough. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194718" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="These Anime Moms Deserve All The Flowers For Mother's Day" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="241" data-playlist="194718,194741,193781" data-current="194718"><div><p>These Anime Moms Deserve All The Flowers For Mother's Day</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194718/194718_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194718/194718_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194718/194718_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194718/194718_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20185.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>First and foremost, I’m not a <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em> hater; I’m far worse. I was a huge anime fan and read ahead in the manga. And who could blame me? Its first season introduced a magic system that begged to be explored, its ensemble cast was charming, and production studio Mappa’s action sequences delivered without fail. While the first half of season 2 undoubtedly has the series’ strongest writing, its latter half is marred by a barely-there story and shock-value character deaths that fail to serve as connective tissue for its raucous action sequences. Like Jimmy Fallon and authentic laughter, its story <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/jujutsu-kaisen-season-2-part-2-review-shibuya-incident-arc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jujutsu-kaisen-season-2-part-2-review-shibuya-incident-arc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">never truly comes together</a></span>. If anything, <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em> season 2 is an empty spectacle that does a significant disservice to the groundwork of its first season.<br></p><p>If season 2’s Shibuya Incident arc was the wheels coming off the bus, the anime’s upcoming Culling Game death tournament is <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em> barreling down the street rolling on tire belts instead of rubber. Knowing that its manga will conclude in just five more chapters is more of a mercy for readers than something to lament. </p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jujutsu-kaisen-season-3-teaser-culling-game-1851134414&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jujutsu-kaisen-season-3-teaser-culling-game-1851134414"><em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em> Season 3 Will Kick Off A Bloody Tournament Arc</a></span><br></p><p>The experience of reading <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em> started as the first weekly updated Shonen Jump manga I’d eagerly dive into before shifting into the one I saved for last out of frustration with its monotony.<strong> </strong>It reached a point where reading <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em> felt comparable to reading <em>Rent-A-Girlfriend</em>’s<em> </em>going nowhere fast trashy romantic drivel—a misfortune I wouldn’t wish on my worst enemy. To talk around manga spoilers for anime-only viewers, the problem with <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em>’s manga is as follows:<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Hard-to-follow action sequences</li><li>Mid-fight exposition dumps that would put <em>Bleach </em>to shame</li><li>An overcomplicated magic system that seemingly retcons itself with each passing week</li><li>Shock value character deaths and weaponized postpartum flashbacks</li></ul><p>Each passing chapter felt like cracking open an SAT prep notebook of power systems in order to keep track of <em>Jujutsu Kaisen’</em>s exposition-heavy battles that seemingly improvise and change up how attacks and counter-attacks work every week. Instead of feeling engaged by the kaleidoscope-esque reveals of the manga, I routinely threw my hands up in frustration and said, “Sure, whatever,” at every convoluted plot development.</p><p>If anything, the goodwill <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em>’s action<em> </em>has earned from its fandom is due to the heavy lifting of Mappa’s overworked animation department, which articulates movement with clarity, weight, and immaculate imagery—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/JuJutsuKaisen/comments/17vairi/jujutsu_kaisen_production_meltdown_continues/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JuJutsuKaisen/comments/17vairi/jujutsu_kaisen_production_meltdown_continues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">despite the production meltdown its animators withstood</a></span> to make it happen. The manga’s portrayal of action, on the other hand, is uneven at best. While many of its two-page spreads are outstanding, the bulk of its action choreography made me squint to try and parse out the barely legible anatomy of fight scenes. This is further proven in the manga’s final battle(s), which see everything <em>and</em> the kitchen sink thrown at its titular villain, only for him to “Nuh-uh” his way out of insurmountable odds.<br></p><p>Unlike <em>My Hero Academia</em>’s manga, which concluded a month prior with a serviceable epilogue that tied most of its narrative loose threads together, <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em>’s conclusion in just five chapters all but assures a rushed ending to a story that–-if we’re being honest—never felt truly realized in the first place. If anything, <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em>’s ineffectual story serves simply as a vehicle to ferry viewers to the next fight scene. </p><p>All this to say, there’s still hope that season 3 won’t be as monotonous as its manga counterpart, seeing as how Mappa turned the narrative ship around with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/attack-on-titan-eren-jaeger-finale-ending-anime-manga-1850995603&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/attack-on-titan-eren-jaeger-finale-ending-anime-manga-1850995603"><em>Attack on Titan</em>’s controversial finale</a></span>. But as things stand, five chapters won’t be enough to turn <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em> into an emotionally resonant manga with fully realized characters. It will, however, still make for good out-of-context AMV fight sequence fodder for TikTok, if that’s any consolation.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The caveat here is that all of those controllers also offer console support. The V3 Pro is a somewhat uncommon in this regard, but it's conceivable that not partnering with a console manufacturer contributed to keeping the price lower than we typically see.</p><p>Here's a quick rundown of the OPS V3 Pro's features:</p><ul><li>Six remappable buttons (four on back, two on top)</li><li>Hall Effect analog sticks and triggers</li><li>PowerA's Quick-Twist analog sticks with three different heights</li><li>Tactile mechanical switches for face buttons, D-pad, and shoulder buttons</li><li>Trigger locks with three stop points</li><li>Textured grip</li><li>Custom profiles</li><li>Multi-zone RGB lighting</li><li>Bluetooth, 2.4GHz wireless with USB-A dongle, and USB-C wired connections</li><li>Program, LED, and Profile buttons to cycle through settings on the fly</li><li>Magnetic charging stand with slot for USB dongle</li><li>Dual rumble motors</li><li>Turbo button</li><li>Up to 30-hour battery life</li><li>Magnetic charging stand with slot for USB dongle</li><li>PowerA HQ Windows app for further customization</li></ul><p>The OPS V3 Pro doesn't have any swappable parts, but it does have a rather unique feature with its Quick-Twist sticks. Just like it sounds, you can twist the analog sticks up or down and lock them in three different positions. Some players swap sticks specifically to put them at different levels--this is common in FPS games--so it's cool to see that implemented without the need to keep track of small components. That said, another reason to swap sticks is to use a different style cap (concave, convex, etc.). While that's missing here, you could add a pair of removable thumbstick caps to fit your preference--there are tons of third-party options that would fit these sticks.</p><p>PowerA used Hall Effect sensor technology to combat stick drift as well as to increase the durability of the triggers. Next to the triggers, you'll find two extra programmable buttons, which are joined by four programmable back buttons. Most pro-style controllers have four, and sometimes only two, extra inputs. The back buttons retain PowerA's usual boxy form factor, which could take some getting used to if you're experience is with the elongated paddle shape found on other controllers. It's a matter of preference, but paddles in general feel more intuitive and faster. Still, the four back buttons are placed in the best possible locations, as shown below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4353352-poweraopsv3back.png" data-ref-id="1300-4353352" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4353352-poweraopsv3back.png" data-ref-id="1300-4353352"></a><figcaption>PowerA's OPS V3 Pro has four remappable back buttons and two remappable shoulder buttons.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4353352-poweraopsv3back.png"></figure><p>Another notable feature of the OPS V3 Pro is its use of microswitches. Similar to Razer's Wolverine controllers, the face buttons, D-pad, and shoulder buttons actuate with microswitches instead of conventional membrane switches. This produces a clicky, mouse-like feel and promotes faster speeds. You won't find microswitches on the aforementioned Fortnite-themed controller.</p><p>You can remap inputs, cycle through profiles, and adjust the RGB lighting effects directly on the controller. PowerA also has a Windows app where you can tinker with input settings and layouts.</p><p>Trigger locks can be set at three different stopping points to increase or decrease pull distance. The V3 Pro also has rubberized, textured grips, a turbo button, and a rumble motor in each handle.</p><p>You'll get up to 30 hours of playtime on a single charge, and there's also an included magnetic charging stand (3-4 hours to fully charge). It connects to your PC via Bluetooth, 2.4GHz wireless, or wired via a braided USB-C cable. Though designed with PC in mind, you can also use the OPS V3 Pro for mobile gaming.</p><p>PowerA sent us the OPS V3 Pro for testing, and we've been impressed by its feature set and performance so far. It's easily the most advanced controller in PowerA's crowded catalog. One thing that's immediately noticeable when holding the controller is that it gets weight <em>and </em>weight distribution right. One of the key reasons why the Elite Series 2 feels so great to use is because of how it distributes its relatively hefty weight. It simply adds to the premium feel. At 366g, the OPS V3 Pro is actually heavier than the Elite Series 2 (345g), but the weight is similarly well-distributed. Like with the Elite Series 2, this design helps give the OPS V3 Pro a high-end feel that matches its wealth of customization features. And that's quite impressive when you consider the price.</p><p>PowerA's OPS V3 Pro releases September 16. If primarily game on PC and aren't a huge Fortnite fan, the OPS V3 Pro seems like the better option versus PowerA's new Xbox/PC controller.</p><hr><h2>PowerA OPS V1</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4353351-poweraopsv1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4353351" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4353351-poweraopsv1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4353351"></a><figcaption>PowerA OPS V1 - PC and mobile controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4353351-poweraopsv1.png"></figure><ul><li>Price: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-Gaming-Lumectra-Charging-Console/dp/B0D8T9222Q?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$50 at Amazon</a></li><li>Release Date: September 9</li></ul><p>At half the price of the OPS V3 Pro, it's not surprising that the OPS V1 isn't loaded with as many customization features or premium parts. But even though it's billed as an entry-level PC controller, it does have several welcome features you don't always see on $50 controllers.</p><ul><li>Four remappable back buttons</li><li>Program button to map inputs</li><li>Trigger locks with three stop points</li><li>Hall Effect analog sticks and triggers</li><li>Dual rumble motors</li><li>Turbo button</li><li>Up to 20-hour battery life</li><li>Bluetooth, 2.4GHz wireless, and USB-C wired connections</li></ul><p>If you've used one of PowerA's Enhanced controllers for Switch, the OPS V1 has a similar feel. It's much lighter than the V3 Pro at 269g and excludes the rubberized grips, so you can certainly notice the difference in quality.</p><p>A $50 controller with Hall Effect analog sticks and triggers, four remappable back buttons, and three-way trigger locks isn't all that common from a major brand.</p><p>In terms of competition, it makes sense to compare the OPS V1 to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Charging-Gaming-Console/dp/B0B9BDMWWN?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">8BitDo Ultimate</a>, which is available in multiple different models, all of which work on PC and can be found for around $50 (sometimes less). The OPS V1 has the Ultimate beat in quantity of remappable inputs (four versus two), but the Ultimate's back buttons have a better feel to them. The Ultimate also lacks trigger locks, if this feature is important to you. 8BitDo's customization software has the OPS beat with its customization app, which also works on mobile devices. Depending on which model you pick, the Ultimate can also offer Switch or Xbox compatibility. The OPS V1, unlike the V3 Pro, doesn't come with a charging dock--and 8BitDo's charging stand is better than the OPS V3 Pro's dock if you want to display your controller.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4353353-opsv1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4353353" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4353353-opsv1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4353353"></a><figcaption> PowerA's OPS V1 controller has four remappable back buttons.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4353353-opsv1.png"></figure><p>Based on our testing, the OPS V1 doesn't hit the sweet spot of pro-style features <em>and </em>feel for a budget price as well as the 8BitDo Ultimate. But it must be said that the 8BitDo Ultimate is currently our pick for the best PC controller in 2024 because of its premium feel and well-integrated feature set.</p><p>The OPS V1 launching alongside the OPS V3 Pro, a controller that truly punches above its price, makes the impactful differences between them more noticeable. But if you want four remappable buttons and trigger stops in a $50 controller, the OPS V1 is a solid choice. Just know that the OPS V3 Pro is a big step up.</p><p>PowerA's OPS V1 releases on September 9. Along with the standard black model for $50, Amazon is taking <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Wireless-Controller-Gaming-Lumectra-Charging-Console/dp/B0D8T84XZ7?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorders for a Fortnite-themed variant</a> for $55.</p><hr><p><em>Disclosure: GameSpot received product samples from the manufacturer to test for review.</em></p>

Paradox Interactive's streak of game delays continues with the news its Chinese-Room-developed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> is now targeting a release in the "first half of 2025", rather than its previously announced "late 2024" window.
</p>
<p>
In a post <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/news/whats-next-for-bloodlines-2">on its website</a>, Paradox called the delay a "proactive decision" derived from its commitment early this to deliver "high-quality games" to its players. "Though [Bloodlines 2] is in a good enough place that we could have maintained our planned release window," it continued, "Paradox and The Chinese Room collaboratively decided to prioritise polish."
</p>
<p>
Paradox says the delay will "create a quality assurance buffer, giving more time between testing and launch, ensuring we release the game when it's ready." More specifically, The Chinese Room will use the time to expand Bloodlines 2's story, providing twice as many endings as its predecessor, and to "adjust certain areas" such as Fabien - the voice in its protagonist's head.

<p>
The Chinese Rooms adds it'll continue sharing Bloodlines 2 details with fans in the run-up to its revised released next year, with future topics of discussion set to include social feeding, Seattle's different factions, some additional characters, and more. "It has been a long journey," Paradox's statement concluded, "but we're near the final stages of development and will share the release date once we are confident with the game’s level of polish."
</p>
<p>
Bloodlines 2 is, of course, far from the only game to be delayed by Paradox in recent times, with Prison Architect 2 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-console-launch-delayed-again">Cities: Skylines 2's console release</a> having both faced multiple delays. Paradox's Sims-like Life By You also saw repeated delays until the publisher made the shock decision to pull the plug on the project earlier this year, cancelling the game and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-shuts-down-life-by-you-studio-following-sims-likes-sudden-cancellation">closing its studio</a>.
</p>
<p>
Life By You's cancellation was just the latest in a string of high-profile disasters for Paradox in recent years. Bloodlines 2 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-says-it-almost-cancelled-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-earlier-this-year">almost cancelled</a> before The Chinese Room stepped in after troubles at its original studio, while 2023's The Lamplighters' League was enough of a flop that Paradox opted to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split%20with%20developer%20Harebrained%20Schemes">part ways with its developer Harebrained Schemes</a>. And the ramfactions of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a> 2 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-publisher-refunds-dlc-and-admits-we-let-you-down">catastrophically premature launch</a> are still being felt, with Paradox having pledged <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-publisher-refunds-dlc-and-admits-we-let-you-down">not to release any additional DLC</a> until its issues are addressed. In July, Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-ceo-admits-it-made-the-wrong-calls-in-several-projects-following-cancellation-of-life-by-you">admitted</a> the publisher had "made the wrong calls in several projects".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/arco-combat-impressions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Usually, I wait to play more of a game before I write something about it, but I’ve played a couple hours of last week’s indie release<em> Arco </em>and need to tell you how cool its take on turn-based combat is. Caveat: it probably (or at least hopefully) gets cooler as the game goes on.</p><p><a href="https://arco.game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Arco</em></a><em> </em>came out last week for PC and Switch. You play as multiple heroes seeking revenge in a Western tale, with fantasy elements and a welcome air of anti-colonialism; you begin the game cast as Tizo, a member of a nomadic tribe whose family is slaughtered by “newcomers” in the game’s opening, who reflects on balancing his identity against the newcomers’ effects on his people and culture. There’s a wonderful sense of place and history to discover, as you travel to towns set against sweeping vistas that swallow up your little pixel characters.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Arco Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Oft1Mwob7Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I’m still at the beginning, looking for a gang that killed one of Tizo’s old friends, so I can’t say much about where the plot goes. So far I’ve delivered some packages, met some monks, and fought human characters, big lizards, and giant bugs. I’ve picked up a bunch of items whose purpose I’m not totally sure of yet, shared a meal with a stranger instead of attacking them, and pet every animal the game allows me to pet.</p><p>On our <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-valve-deadlock-steam-gabe-newell" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">podcast last week</a>, a reader asked whether we preferred turn-based combat with or without grids; we all said “grids,” but <em>Arco</em> has a gridless, kind-of turn-based combat that is making me change my mind. Here’s how it works: when you enter combat, both you and enemies plan and execute your moves simultaneously. In the planning phase, combat is paused, and you can see what your enemies intend to do and make choices accordingly, planning to move a certain distance and selecting from abilities, which cost Magia to use. Since I’m still in the early game, I’ve only got a handful: a ranged bow called an arco that I’ve upgraded through experience points to lob arrows or shoot multiple projectiles, and a dash that lets me get further away from enemies at the cost of a lot of Magia.</p><p>Magia regenerates as you move or wait, so you have to think about where you’ll end your turn and how much Magia you’ll have to use once you get there. So you need to think about a lot of things simultaneously–what’s actually happening now and everything that’s going to happen, as far as you can figure, and whether you’ll be able to do anything to counter whatever situation you get yourself into. Some abilities, like my arrow lob, take more than one turn to land, but I can only see what enemies are going to do on the next turn. This means I have to predict where I <em>think</em> the enemies will go if I want to actually hit them. The game helps you out here–not with a grid, but with extendable lines that show your range or where a character will be. It feels both precise and a bit like a guessing game–I have to aim not at the enemy, the way I would in a turn-based game like <em>XCOM</em>, but at where they’re going once my arrow’s flight time is factored in.</p><p>Combat’s mix of turn-based planning and real time effects has been a little hard for me to wrap my head around. An enemy will fire their gun, and the bullets will travel very close to me and then, if I'm lucky, stop. Then I’ll have to think about where to dodge out of the way while taking all the bullets’ trajectory and speed into account, and without getting in the line of fire of <em>another </em>enemy’s shots, <em>and</em> without leaving myself Magia-less too close to a melee enemy who plans to attack. Combat has the thoughtfulness and pre-planning of traditional turn-based combat, but also the in-the-moment effects of combat in a regular game. Positioning is key–I spend a lot of time running away and then carefully inching closer to enemies–but fights still feel brisk without being too chaotic.</p><p>Not <em>everything</em> in a fight is turn-based, either: depending what you do in the game’s story, ghosts will sometimes spawn during a fight, representations of your guilt. Ghosts move during the planning phase, and they’ll damage you if they make contact, adding some pressure to finish up your turn if they’re getting too close. This can make even the planning phase feel active, and when combined with my love of panicking and the fact that I’m still in the early game, has made even introductory encounters pretty tough.</p><p>It’s all a little hard to explain in words, and has definitely taken some practice to help me get something resembling a hang of. Here’s a gameplay trailer so you can see it in action.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Arco - Official Gameplay Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NFPDK65zTXU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Despite how many times I just said it was hard to get, and how tough I’m finding it as I learn the ropes, it’s exciting and compelling. Even though I’m struggling with these early game fights, I keep getting into combat so I can practice it. As you level up, you unlock stronger attacks and more slots for consumables like healing items or explosives, and I can tell that controlling more than one character will definitely help as I keep playing through the game.</p><p>It’s a neat system in a game full of neat things, from its charming pixel art to its navigation, where you select from a variety of paths on a map, some of which can be traversed multiple times and others of which are only one way. <em>Arco</em> is another cool entry in <a href="https://aftermath.site/indie-games-pc-2024-may-hades-2-little-kitty-1000xresist-manor-lords" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a year of excellent indie games</a>, and I’m excited to see more of it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-yet-again<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradox Interactive and developer The Chinese Room have announced yet another&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>delay, with the game now not set to launch until sometime next year.</p>
<p>This news comes via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/532790/view/4248669523824762042" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a new post on the game's Steam page</a>, in which the two studios confirm that the release window for&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>has been "updated to the first half of 2025". It was previously <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-developed-by-chinese-room">slated to release some time this fall</a>.</p>
<p>Paradox says the decision to delay was "proactive", and was derived from a "commitment to delivering high-quality games to our players". I'm not sure whether the&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>community <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-word-of-the-week-february-26th">might have something to say about that one</a>.</p>

<p>Somewhat paradoxically, however (ahem), Paradox then says the extra development time will be used to give "more time between testing and launch, ensuring we release the game when it's ready".</p>
<p>Other adjustments will be made during the interim, however; Paradox and The Chinese Room say they'll be able to expand&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2</em>'s story as a result of the extra development time, and that the game will now feature "more than twice as many endings" as the first&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines</em>, which had five.</p>
<p>More information will be released between now and <i>Bloodlines 2</i>'s eventual launch; we'll learn more about game elements like social feeding, factions, and various different characters ahead of the game's release.</p>

<p><em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>has had a rather long and strange journey. The game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-announced-mitsoda-returning-as-writer">first announced back in 2019</a>, with developer Hardsuit Labs then set to handle development duties on the project.</p>
<p>It was then <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed">delayed</a> numerous <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-again">times</a>&nbsp;before original narrative designer Brian Mitsoda was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-indefinitely">removed from the project</a>, along with Hardsuit Labs, in early 2021.</p>
<p>Following that, it was revealed in September last year that the game's development would continue, now spearheaded by&nbsp;<em>Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs&nbsp;</em>developer The Chinese Room. That's also when the original fall 2024 release window was announced.</p>
<p>You'll be able to get your hands on&nbsp;<em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2&nbsp;</em>when it arrives next year for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S (assuming it's not delayed again, of course). Stay tuned for more.</p>

Widely heralded as one of the best platformers ever, and one of the best games of the 2010s, this title set the gaming world on fire when it was released in 2018. <em>Celeste </em>has always been a beloved game, whether that’s for its tough-but-fair difficulty, its trans protagonist, or its approach to subject matter such as mental illness, but regardless of what exactly pulls you in, it’s difficult to deny <em>Celeste</em>’s magnetism. I suggest you let it pull you in, too. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196131" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: November 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="328" data-playlist="196131,195189,195670" data-current="196131"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: November 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21668.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Currently, <em>Celeste </em>is on sale on Steam for all of about $5, and yes it is </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-battery-improve-games-best-pc-great-1850345890&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steam-deck-battery-improve-games-best-pc-great-1850345890"><strong>perfect for your Steam Deck</strong></a></span><strong>. It’s also available on Game Pass and the PlayStation Plus catalog depending on your tier</strong>, if that’s more to your liking, but<strong> </strong>I genuinely don’t think I can emphasize enough how much of a steal this is for just five bucks. Many people who play <em>Celeste </em>cite it as a life-changing, or life-affirming, event. It is cathartic to reach the end of this game and have been able to experience Madeline’s hardships and helped her through it. <em>You </em>can have that experience for the cost of a breakfast sandwich near me. Don’t skip out on a breakfast sandwich, but maybe pick this game up <em>and </em>get a snack.<br></p><p><em>Celeste </em>takes place on the titular mountain, and follows Madeline, a young woman who has come to reach Celeste’s peak. Madeline wants to ascend the mountain to challenge herself in a bid to get over her anxiety, which frequently manifests in panic attacks and the recurring appearance of an alternate persona, Badeline, who throws events into chaos throughout the game.</p><p>As Madeline helps people on her mountain climb, such as the social media influencer Theo and the abandoned resort owner Mr. Oshiro, Badeline appears (almost like that doubtful voice in the back of your head) to knock Madeline down. In one case, Badeline actually does hurl Madeline down the mountain, and though the game seems to play it as a metaphor, it looks pretty damn real to me. How did she survive that?</p><p>The point of the game is much like <em>Dark Souls</em>, where both turn the metaphorical hurdles of life into literal demons to slay and mountains to climb. You will fail <em>a lot</em>, but by overcoming the tasks before her, Madeline hopes to prove to herself that the voice in the back of her head that chastises her isn’t always right. But in order to do so, she has to first do the toughest thing she’s ever committed to: climbing that mountain.</p><p><em>Celeste </em>is a gorgeous and grueling 2D platformer with some of the wildest movement tech I’ve ever seen. Early on, Madeline gains a dash ability that helps her navigate the mountain’s treacherous obstacles and environments, including a haunted resort and an ancient temple. This dash is the only mainstay mechanic that Madeline actually unlocks, and the rest of them are temporary power-ups that mostly appear as extensions of the themes and aesthetics of the stage they’re found in.</p><p>Some appear as bubbles that send Madeline flying and refresh her dash skill, while others look like a golden feather that transforms her into a ball of light that you must tightly control around jagged crystal walls arranged into a maze-like structure. Other times you must simply contend with the wind, and in the most exciting moments of the game, Madeline goes toe-to-toe with Badeline herself. </p><p>If it sounds epic, it’s because it is! For a game that appears bite-sized, <em>Celeste </em>packs a whole hell of a lot of challenges, including B-side (and C-side!) levels that are even more difficult than the main content, and make use of techniques that are all but hidden from players, such as the hyper dash. An epilogue that was added years later functions as the ultimate gauntlet from the developers at <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/earthblade-delay-celeste-developer-maddy-thorson-1851372790&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/earthblade-delay-celeste-developer-maddy-thorson-1851372790">Extremely Ok Games</a></span> and it is as tough-as-nails and simultaneously heartfelt as you might expect.<br></p><p>However, <em>Celeste </em>has also attracted a sizable following over the years, and they’re a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-the-celeste-speedrunning-community-became-queer-as-1848120383&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-the-celeste-speedrunning-community-became-queer-as-1848120383">super dedicated, incredibly welcoming, and very queer bunch</a></span> for whom <em>Celeste—</em>and the reveal that Madeline was trans the whole time—is a pretty significant deal. The community that’s formed around <em>Celeste </em>has gone on to speedrun the game at charity events like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sgdq-2024-summer-games-done-quick-schedule-1851573798&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sgdq-2024-summer-games-done-quick-schedule-1851573798">Summer Games Done Quick</a></span>, and have even developed and run their own mods, which sometimes rival the content of the main game. You can only get those mods if you pick it up on PC, so if that sounds like something you’d like, best pick it up there right away!</p><p>Basically, getting <em>Celeste </em>on sale is a one-way ticket to one of the most devoted and sincere communities in games, while piggybacking off of one of the most challenging and satisfying platformers ever. For the incredibly low price it’s at right now, I don’t see why you shouldn’t take the plunge. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

shrouded in mystery, but we know it draws heavily from the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West. For those unfamiliar, Journey to the West chronicles the adventures of the monk Tang Seng and his allies, one of which is the mischievous monkey god, Sun Wukong.</p><p dir="ltr">Sun Wukong serves as the main inspiration for Black Myth’s playable protagonist, the Destined One, with many abilities, characteristics, and lore drawn directly from Wukong. Born from enchanted stone, Sun Wukong is an immensely powerful immortal being whose arrogant and brash behavior led to his imprisonment by the Buddha. Wukong is eventually released to serve as the bodyguard for Tang Seng, marking the start of his journey toward redemption.</p><p dir="ltr">Before you head off to read all 100 chapters of Journey to the West, you should know that Black Myth: Wukong takes place <strong>after</strong> the novel, so no homework is required. Game Science has also stated that Black Myth is a more mature depiction of the mythos with a central focus on Sun Wukong and the supposed truth behind his redemption.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Where is Black Myth: Wukong set?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Similarly to its plot, not much is known about Black Myth: Wukong's primary setting, other than that it is influenced by Journey to the West. The novel was set in China during the 7th century, in what was known as the 'Western Regions,' primarily comprising Central Asia and India.</p><p dir="ltr">While it's unclear how much of Journey to the West's settings will be revisited, some areas, such as 'Black Wind Mountain,' are present. Enemies inspired by these areas will also appear, such as a hulking black bear based on the 'Black Wind Demon' from Journey to the West.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside characters and settings inspired by the novel, we can expect to see a few original creations from Game Science, as well as depictions based on other stories from Chinese folklore.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4350688-2318169151-ss_86.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350688" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4350688-2318169151-ss_86.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350688"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4350688-2318169151-ss_86.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Exploration in Black Myth: Wukong</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Despite Black Myth: Wukong's beautifully stylized world and environment, it is not an open-world game, instead following a more linear level design. However, each area in Black Myth is still teeming with hidden gear, upgrades, and optional bosses to discover.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Combat in Black Myth: Wukong</strong></p><p dir="ltr">At its core, Black Myth: Wukong is about speed, precision, and reading your opponents. As you journey across realms as the Destined One, your primary means of combat is the Ruyi Jingu Bang--Wukong's iconic, size-altering enchanted staff.</p><p dir="ltr">The staff can be used in at least three stances: Smash, Pillar, and Thrust, each offering a distinct playstyle. The default Smash stance focuses on chaining combos through light and heavy attacks. The Pillar stance allows the Destined One to create a perch for avoiding ground-based attacks, which can then be brought down on enemies for a devastating blow. Alternatively, you can swing around the planted staff - like the mischievous monkey you are - delivering kicks to all enemies surrounding you. Lastly, the Thrust stance delivers quick, powerful strikes that can also be used at long range.</p><p dir="ltr">Mastering each stance is crucial for surviving Black Myth's intense combat, but you won't get far without getting to grips with its versatile dodge mechanic. Outside of deflecting projectiles and using special abilities, there is no block function in Black Myth, so dodging is your primary form of defense. There’s more strategy to combat than just timing, however. With a multitude of combat styles, special attacks, and transformations, you’ll need to use all the tools on your mystical toolbelt to devise the right strategy for each encounter.</p><p dir="ltr">Dodging and attacking drains stamina so choose your moments wisely. Perfectly timed dodges increase your focus meter, granting access to even more powerful attacks and abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">As you progress through Wukong’s rich mythological world, you will come face to face with a vast array of fearsome foes. Journeying through dense forests and fighting atop crumpled temples, players can expect to have their skills tested throughout this Buddhist folklore-inspired epic. From early encounters with blade-wielding anthropomorphic wolves to reflex-testing showdowns with building-sized, venomous toads, each new area requires a cunning combination of stances and a keen eye for reading enemy attacks.</p><p dir="ltr">As you trade blows with leaping lizards or fell katana-wielding tigers, every new beast you battle feels pleasingly unique, their designs and attacks drawing from a rich well of Eastern mythology. In true genre form, taking the time to defeat each opponent reaps great rewards, allowing players to unlock new skills and techniques for their chosen combat stance.</p><p dir="ltr">Nowhere is this truer than with Wukong’s bosses. As you roam across this awe-inspiring land, the Destined One will face increasingly horrifying creatures. Each boss will test your skill, serving as the final exam for everything that you have learned battling the flora and fauna that came before. While many of these bosses are essential to progressing through the story, each region you explore will feature an array of optional mini-bosses, defeating them netting you great rewards. From ancient wolf gods to terrifying demonic infants, this story will pit you against a wealth of unforgettable gods, each more fearsome than the last. Luckily for players, the Destined One has a few extra tricks up his sleeve.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Special abilities in Black Myth: Wukong</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Alongside the Ruyi Jingu Bang staff, the Destined One also has access to an array of magical and physical abilities, many of which appear to be based on Sun Wukong's 72 heavenly powers. These abilities include freezing enemies in place, creating defensive barriers, shapeshifting, and summoning an army of duplicates to aid you in battle. A fearsome fire glaive is an early highlight, allowing players to temporarily transform into a state that imbues their staff with deadly flame attacks, proving incredibly useful for defeating enemies who are weak to burning.</p><p dir="ltr">The ability to shapeshift is one of the most powerful skills in Black Myth and offers many unique abilities. One transformation takes on the appearance of an imposing feline creature that delivers devastating blows, while another turns you into a strange creature made of stone that is impervious to most attacks. Some transformations include previously defeated enemies and bosses, though it's unclear if this is the only way to unlock new forms.</p><p dir="ltr">Certain transformations have uses outside of combat as well. At certain points in the story, you’ll be turned into a small bird or flying insect to progress the story. At one point early on, for instance, you’re turned into a cicada for the chance to survey a new area and prepare for what lies ahead.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4350689-9433826540-ss_96.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350689" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4350689-9433826540-ss_96.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4350689"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4350689-9433826540-ss_96.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Upgrades and crafting in Black Myth: Wukong</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Black Myth: Wukong may borrow some mechanics from soulslike and character-action titles, but it is fundamentally an action RPG. Better armor, weapons, and gear can be found hidden throughout levels and can be crafted with the correct materials. Wearing full armor sets also provides bonus buffs such as increasing the amount of focus you earn from dodging.</p><p dir="ltr">For upgrading abilities, Black Myth: Wukong features three separate skill trees: one for magic abilities, one for staff abilities (in which there are three more trees - one for each combat stance), and one for character-specific abilities, such as increasing your maximum health. Skill trees can be progressed in whatever order best suits your playstyle by spending Sparks. Sparks are level-up points you can obtain through gaining experience (usually from hitting things real good) and through meditation points that you’ll find dotted around the world. Falling in battle causes you to lose a portion of your unbanked experience, but Black Myth: Wukong is a little more lenient than other titles and only penalizes you with a small amount of XP per death.</p><p dir="ltr">You’ll also be collecting Will, which can be used to purchase items and upgrade equipment, so keep an eye out for floating green lights and smash all the pots you see!</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Who developed Black Myth: Wukong?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Game Science is a Hangzhou-based studio known for developing the multiplayer RTS, Art of War: Red Tides. Black Myth: Wukong is Game Science’s first triple-A game and marks their biggest undertaking to date. Previously, Game Science’s core founders worked at Tencent Games on the MMORPG Asura.</p><p dir="ltr">With the first trailer for Black Myth: Wukong garnering well over 10 million views on YouTube and over 10 million on the Chinese video site Bilibili, all eyes are on this ambitious studio and its grander plans for creating a ‘Black Myth’ gaming universe.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>When is Black Myth: Wukong out?</strong></p><p>Black Myth: Wukong reaches its long-awaited release on August 20th for PC and PlayStation 5.</p>

                <p>At long last, Pokemon microSD cards are here. For fans of the pocket monsters franchise, you can now grab one of several SanDisk microSD cards in varying sizes. When you're not using them to store games on your Nintendo Switch--or other electronic devices like Steam Deck--you can gaze at the cute little Pokemon stamped on the plastic. Right now, you can get a <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-15772752%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.westerndigital.com%2Fproducts%2Fmemory-cards%2Fsandisk-microsd-pokemon-cards%3Fsku%3DSDSQXAO-256G-GN6ZK&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnew-pokemon-themed-sandisk-microsd-cards-are-here-to-store-it-all%2F1100-6525964%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pikachu</a> (256GB), <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-15772752%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.westerndigital.com%2Fproducts%2Fmemory-cards%2Fsandisk-microsd-pokemon-cards%3Fsku%3DSDSQXAO-512G-GN6ZK&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnew-pokemon-themed-sandisk-microsd-cards-are-here-to-store-it-all%2F1100-6525964%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gengar</a> (512GB), or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-MicroSDXC-Memory-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0DBZW3982?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Snorlax</a> (1TB) microSD card</strong>. It's rather appropriate that Snorlax has the largest capacity.

It is our first commercial game as a studio, even though most of us have worked together to make mobile games for different companies, and participated in many game jams together. We knew a bunch of things about making games, but we had to learn together how to make a game this big, this ambitious, and this pretty.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodless</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> started out as a game jam project for the 45th edition of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://ludumdare.com/">Ludum Dare</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The Jam's theme of "Start with nothing" inspired us to make a game about a swordless samurai. As a team we had participated in many game jams together, and we were used to making gameplay and visual decisions to make our work easier in the limited development time given to us for events like these.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of these decisions was to make the character have the same action for dodge and parry, to save on animation and coding time. Another such decision was to have a 1-bit-</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>ish</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> aesthetic, with only black, white, and red on the screen, so that the artists could produce environments and animations quickly.</span></p><p>Image via 3D Realms.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This 3-color palette style is very different from what we ended up with in the game. Characters in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodless</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> still keep the black-white-red palette for the most part, but the scenery has completely changed. I think the term "hi-bit," which I've seen a few times to refer to modern pixel art games, really encapsulates what we went for with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodless</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It has an extreme palette limitation, with a maximum of 12 colors on the screen at once. Still, the dynamics of the visuals make it instantly noticeable that this is a modern game with fancy effects going on.</span></p><p>Image via 3D Realms.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So how and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>why</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> did we get from one to the other? When we finished the game jam version, we were by no means dissatisfied with its visual style. We had a positive reception to the game from the community, and one of the most recurring feedbacks we got was that the visuals were very striking. I think that the reason was that, as with many things in this game, we, at some point, developed a vision of what we wanted, and sort of decided that we couldn't do without it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After Ludum Dare, we were all on board with turning that small game jam prototype into a full 5-ish hours-long game (it ended up with nearly twice that playtime, though). We knew that to turn it into a full game, we had to flesh out all areas: more enemies, a deeper story, and improved visuals. We were really happy with how the game looked and thought of just having more detailed scenery and animations, maybe using some extra "accent" colors, like the pink in a sakura tree (which we had made for an expanded version after the game jam).</span></p><p>Image via 3D Realms.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But then I saw </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/653530/Return_of_the_Obra_Dinn/">Return of the Obra Dinn</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and everything changed. I knew we </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>had</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to do something like that. Our game had a great, more traditionally retro visual style, but we wanted to elevate it somehow. That striking style of two-color shading instantly felt like the correct inspiration to me. Luckily, the creator of Obra Dinn, Lucas Pope, even had some blog posts on how he made the art style work, so I studied them quite a bit.</span></p><p>Image via Lucas Pope.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The style of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Return of the Obra Dinn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> uses a technique called </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>dithering </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">quite a lot, where you create the illusion of multiple shades between two colors by alternating between them via a pattern. Instead of transitioning from a light color to a dark color via the intermediate color, you use less and less of the light color and more of the darker one. There are many patterns you can use for dithering. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Obra Dinn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> uses a more noisy pattern that makes it feel more natural, but we ended up using a classic Bayer pattern, which makes it very "pixel-y."</span></p><p>Here’s what a gradient looks like when rendered in Bloodless. Image via 3D Realms.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The rest of the team liked this idea of exploring dithered lights, so they agreed to have me work on this evolution of our art style. We didn't know exactly what we would do, so it was a very exploratory process. I also had very little experience writing shaders, especially 2D shaders. I had to juggle trying to figure out what we wanted to do, how to do it, and if it was even possible. The first thing I could do was just use lighting to alternate between black and white pixels. It was a really cool effect and gave us more certainty that this was a good direction.</span></p><p>Image via 3D Realms.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The really tricky thing was where to go </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>after</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that. Since I was championing this, and it was gated by my skills and the limitations of Unity's 2D Renderer and lighting system, I tried making some prototypes, exploring what I thought would be interesting ways to push the tools we had from Unity's lighting system. I remember a tech demo I made where I tried using the three color channels to make different colors of light and blend them. A lot of those ended up looking pretty bad, and the whole endeavor was driving me crazy.</span></p><p>Image via 3D Realms.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That was when we took a step back and went back into looking for references. One particularly cool indie game that our art director showed us that used some of the same dithering techniques we were trying out was </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hell is Other Demons</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It had a 4-color palette and used lighting to blend between those colors with dithering on the borders. Our game was previously defined by just being black and white (with a bit of red), so each color added had to be thoroughly discussed. I started experimenting with the lighting having a Game Boy Color-esque limited palette, and the results were really promising.</span></p><p>Image via 3D Realms.</p><p>Image via 3D Realms.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We iterated on this style while other aspects of the game were also being improved. The first region of the game was a forest on the outskirts of the Old City, where a lot of the story happens. We went back and forth on the color palette, shader parameters, and features to decide things like how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>dither-y </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">the shading would be, how much each light would illuminate, and how the lighting effect would vary from object to object. Even quite later on in the project, we would still keep adjusting how the palettes worked, how the texture assets themselves were shaded, and how the parameters of the light sources were set up to get everything </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>right</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p>An early illuminated scene. Image via 3D Realms.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So the system we ended up with was: we had the scenery, which was illuminated with a palette of seven colors that served as the shades from lighter to darker in environment objects, plus five "accent" colors that were not affected by lighting. Characters were always flat black and white, with some details using the accent colors, while environment objects had materials that used a subset of the seven colors and had different lighting parameters. Each environment object has up to five colors from the seven, with two of them usually being black and white, with this limitation being very useful for building a visual hierarchy.</span></p><p>Here’s what a palette looks like in the game assets. This is the one for the bamboo forest. Image via 3D Realms.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once we had fully embraced lighting as a core aspect of the game's visuals, light sources became very important, so we started adding more of them: braziers, lamps, light beams from the sky, and fireflies. Our game started feeling oddly… realistic? Not exactly realistic, but grounded in a way. We started experimenting with normal maps and shading in the assets themselves to add more and more to this vibe, and anything that didn't quite match that felt odd. Preserving this grounded feeling proved to be quite a challenge as we added the next big aspect of the game's visual style: water.</span></p><p>Image via 3D Realms.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Having water in the game was not only important to add variety to the scenery but also central to the worldbuilding of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodless</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Bakugawa, the place where the game is set, is an island, and the central deity that its people worship is a god of rivers, so we had to have </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>rivers</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. I remember trying to delay doing this quite a bit back then because I was just very scared of it, and in the end, making the water effects of this game was almost as difficult as building that first version of the lighting style and probably even more stressful.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It took a little more than a month from starting it to when we got the first version of the water and reflections we were happy with. It was a very stressful period and full of frustration, partly because this kind of stuff is generally hard to achieve and was unfamiliar to me, and also because there were a lot of specific aspects of our game that made it even harder.</span></p><p>Image via 3D Realms.</p><p>It took one month to get from the first to the second image. Image via 3D Realms.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Oftentimes, reflections in 2D top-down games are done by simply having an upside-down copy of the sprite rendered only where there is water. That would not be good enough for our game for a bunch of reasons, the most important being the lighting. Because the lighting was so crucial to how every single object looked in our game, having an object be lit differently on the top than the bottom felt weird, so we had to have the same sprite render on the original and the reflection in different passes and use the lighting information from the original on the bottom one.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There were a lot of little details like this that took some time to get right with the water: objects in the water needed to be submerged, and we had water of different depths, so that also had to be taken into consideration. The fireflies go up and down, so they should get closer and further from their reflections during this animation. We had to power through all of this stuff because if anything were out of place or missing, it would stick out like a sore thumb. Thankfully, we managed to do everything we deemed necessary, and I'd say it paid off because the water effects are an integral part of the visuals now (and one of the things I'm personally the most proud of in the game).</span></p><p>Image via 3D Realms.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All of these visual systems ended up requiring a lot of internal tools. Because the reflections were quite expensive, we wanted to disable them for objects that weren't near water. So we made tools to detect the water near the objects and change the object material, saving some precious draw calls to make our game run smoothly. One of the things I'd probably do differently in this project was to test out the performance of all these features earlier. For example, the normal maps in Unity's 2D pipeline are very costly, and we might have been able to avoid using them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bloodless</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was an experience that included a lot of iterations, learning, and pushing ourselves to do new things. We pushed ourselves a lot because we knew the game we wanted to make, and we would not be satisfied until we saw it meet the level of quality we knew it deserved. Everyone brought their best to it, and I couldn't be more proud of what we, as a team, made. The combat, worldbuilding, sound design, level layouts, and everything else were made with loads of care and a little bit of obsession, and I hope it comes across to anyone who plays our game.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It looks similar to something like the <em>Armored Core</em> series, just without a single-player mode. </p><p>Nvidia writes that players will be able to “interact via natural language with game characters” and that the characters can “see” and identify you or objects around you through your webcam, using GPT-4o. It’ll also use a combination of on-device Nvidia models and cloud-based AI to generate NPCs’ voices. </p><p>In the demonstration above, the player asked an in-game character for details about their mission and mechs, then changed their mech’s paint job by talking to it. The AI NPC’s responses were flatly delivered and bland. Maybe that’s fine when NPCs are just glorified in-game wikis.</p><p>But it might not be ideal for much beyond that. When <em>The Verge</em>’s Sean Hollister <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24031687/nvidia-ai-npcs-convai-ces-2023">demoed Nvidia ACE</a> in January, he pointed out that the characters “didn’t feel like real people,” the dialog wasn’t particularly inspiring, and that there were frequent delays before NPCs replied. <em>Mecha Break</em> doesn’t look like it’s any better so far, but we’ll see where things stand when it releases next year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That said, it’s not for the faint of heart, as you must close the distance and play as an aggressive, in-your-face survivor, frantically spamming attacks. Still, the right weapon makes a difference.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196903" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why Fallout: New Vegas Is Still Canon After The TV Show" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="189" data-playlist="196903,196834,195371" data-current="196903"><div><p>Why Fallout: New Vegas Is Still Canon After The TV Show</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196903/196903_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196903/196903_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196903/196903_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196903/196903_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22460.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In Skyline Valley, there are a handful of brand-new named legendary weapons, including a number of melee options.

They’ve all previously reported issues to Oberlin who doesn’t have the time to resolve them. You, however, do.</p><p>The three compadres will ask you to venture down into the lower level Vault 63 atrium, where you must slay their former Vault Dweller friend, Alfie, kill a handful of Radrats clogging up the storage room, and repair the noisy pipes in the reactor room.

Backyard Sports, the iconic video game series known for making kid-friendly sports games, <a href="https://backyardsports.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">is back</a>.</p><p>In a press release, Playground Productions, the company currently holding the rights to the Backyard Sports IP, confirmed it was reviving the series, noting that the franchise is "slated to return in the coming months." Playground Productions also provided the first teaser trailer for Backyard Sports, featuring memorable characters like Pablo Sanchez and Stephanie Morgan.</p><p>You can check out the first trailer below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Beyond the confirmation of new Backyard Sports video games, Playground Productions said the series' return will expand its reach to multiple verticals beyond video games, such as film, TV, and merchandise. Playground Productions explained that the revival of Backyard Sports will use "cutting-edge technology and esteemed character IP" to aim to create stories and experiences that will resonate with those who grew up with the series along with the current generation of youth.</p><p>"We're incredibly excited to reintroduce Backyard Sports to a new generation of players," Playground Productions CEO Chris Waters wrote in the press release. "We're taking great care to preserve the look and feel that made the original games so special while updating them with modern features and gameplay that today's audience expects.
