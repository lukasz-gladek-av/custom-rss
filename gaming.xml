			<p>A new Star Wars Outlaws comparison video was shared online, highlighting the visual improvements ray tracing brings to the game as well as the hit to performance.</p>
<p>The video,&nbsp;<span>put together by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmarkPC</a>, does a great job highlighting how the game's visuals are</span>&nbsp;improved with ray tracing and RTXDI, RTX Dynamic Illumination. As always, the performance cost of ray tracing can be quite heavy at all resolutions, and it is especially true for RTXDI, which seems more like technology that only future GPUs will be able to run with acceptable performance. At 4K resolution, with NVIDIA DLSS 3.7 at the Balanced setting and Frame Generation, the game runs below 60 FPS most of the time with RTXDI on an RTX 4080, which is quite telling, considering how the NVIDIA GPU is still among the best GPUs available on the market.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars Outlaws Ray Tracing + RTXDI On vs Off - Graphics/Performance Comparison | RTX 4080" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6l_Tmn8a4hQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While running Star Wars Outlaws at high resolution with all bells and whistles on will require a powerful system, those who plan to play the game at lower resolutions should be able to do so without too many issues, as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-pc-system-requirements/">detailed system requirements</a> shared earlier this month are rather reasonable.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws launches on August 30th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. It is already available for all those who purchased the Gold and Ultimate Editions.</p>

But there are three black stripes in the middle of the outer layer of the PS5 Pro that are not found on the base models. Billbill-kun noted that the PS5 Pro appears slightly thicker than the PS5 Slim.</p><p>The PS5 Pro seen by billbill-kun does not include a disc-drive. What’s unclear is whether Sony plans to also release a version of the console with a disc drive. A price is not mentioned. The controller remains the base DualSense.</p><p>billbill-kun expects Sony to announce a PS5 Pro during the first half of September 2024. IGN has asked Sony for comment.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><p>A PS5 Pro has been rumored for some time, with reports indicating a release in November. In March, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-specs-leak-online">alleged PS5 Pro specs leaked online</a>, specs IGN understood to be legit. The headline improvements are to the CPU, which is said to be identical to the standard PS5’s CPU but with a 'High CPU Frequency Mode. That reportedly amounts to a 10% increase to 3.85GHz. The GPU, meanwhile, is said to enable faster rendering and higher quality ray tracing powered by 33.5 teraflops. The standard PS5 offers 10.28 teraflops. However, a direct PS5 to PS5 Pro comparison would work out at around 10.28 vs 16 to 17 teraflops.</p><p>Of particular interest, the PS5 Pro is said to have an upscaling/antialiasing solution called PSSR (PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution Upscaling), custom machine learning architecture, and an AI accelerator. Elsewhere, PS5 Pro has a detachable disc drive and 1TB of storage space.</p><p>This “souped-up” refresh is reportedly designed to boost interest in PS5 ahead of the release of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi"><u>Grand Theft Auto 6</u></a> in 2025. As IGN has reported, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-a-lot-riding-on-gta-6-and-not-just-for-rockstar-and-take-two"><u>there is a lot riding on GTA 6</u></a>, and not just for Rockstar and Take-Two.</p><p>Sony has form when it comes to releasing a Pro version of its consoles, of course.

In May, Sony said PS5 sales had peaked after the console entered “the latter stage of its life cycle.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

<p>Raven Software QA workers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/raven-software-qa-staff-win-their-fight-for-union-vote">formed the union in 2022</a> at the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> studio under the name Game Workers Alliance (GWA), with help from the Communication Workers Of America (CWA), following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/raven-software-qa-workers-are-unionising-keeping-activision-blizzards-week-lively">several firings</a>. Even at the time, the workers claimed they faced interference and pushback from management in attempts to "undermine" their efforts. It was a fairly complex back-and-forth involving a limitation on who could actually vote  - I recommend reading the coverage linked above to get the full story.</p>
<p>According to Game Developer,  “the initial optimism that followed the studio's unionisation push has now dissipated”, as attempts to reach a collective bargaining agreement have resulted in yet more stonewalling tactics from higher-ups.</p>
<p>"After Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard, our members were optimistic that they would progress quickly to a first contract at Raven Software," said CWA president’s Claude Cummings to Game File. "Unfortunately, that has not happened. We encourage Microsoft to address the concerns raised in the Unfair Labour Practice charge and make reaching a fair agreement a priority."</p>
<p>Microsoft told Game File they remain “committed to negotiating in good faith,” although the same report points out that Raven’s workers have “yet to make meaningful progress” despite several bargaining attempts since the union’s formation in 2022.</p>
<p>Yesterday, we learned that 44 of 95 workers at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/greedfall">Greedfall 2</a> studio Spiders<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/greedfall-2-developers-call-a-strike-over-working-conditions-lack-of-gender-equality-and-parity-and-global-mismanagement"> signed an open letter </a>to their employers detailing several grievances including unsatisfactory working conditions, lack of gender equality and parity, and “global mismanagement”. The workers have called a strike starting next week. In response, Spiders management called the open letter “false and even defamatory accusations” that “in no way reflect the reality of the day-to-day working life of the company's employees”</p>
<p>Last month, both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-game-studios-developers-ecstatic-to-announce-a-241-strong-wall-to-wall-union">Bethesda Game Studios</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-500-world-of-warcraft-developers-at-blizzard-have-voted-to-form-microsofts-biggest-wall-to-wall-union">World of Warcraft</a> workers formed wall-to-wall unions with the help of the CWA.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Konami has finally acknowledged the possibility of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> 4 being part of an expected Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2.
</p>
<p>
Last year, the company released Master Collection Vol. 1, which includes the first three Metal Gear Solid games plus some extra classics. 
</p>
<p>
However, a second volume is widely expected to continue the story with Metal Gear Solid 4, 5, and Peace Walker, with fans <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-looks-like-metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-will-include-mgs4">digging around on the Konami website</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1-includes-references-to-peace-walker-mgs4-and-5">the first volume's game files</a> for details.

<p>
Even Snake voice actor David Hayter appeared to be teasing something related to Metal Gear Solid 4 in a social media post last November.

<p>
Now, speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-about-metal-gear-solid-4-in-metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-stay-tuned-konami-says">IGN</a> during a preview of the forthcoming remake <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, Konami producer Noriaki Okamura teased the second volume when asked about bringing Metal Gear Solid 4 to modern consoles.
</p>
<p>
"We definitely are aware of this situation with MGS4. Unfortunately we can't really say too much at the moment with Vol. 1 containing MGS 1-3 dot dot dot... you can probably connect the dots!" he said.
</p>
<p>
"Right now we still are internally concerned about what we should be doing for the future of the series. So sorry, we can't really reveal anything at the moment. But stay tuned!"
</p>
<p>
It certainly seems inevitable Konami will release Metal Gear Solid 4 as part of a second volume, but for now the focus is likely on the Snake Eater remake.
</p>
<p>
Still, the fourth game received widespread critical praise on its release but remains only available on PS3. Considering recent releases and plans to revive the series, Metal Gear Solid 4 is certainly due a re-release of some sort.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-deltas-classic-visual-filter-usable-with-either-control-style-konami-confirms">Metal Gear Solid Delta includes a classic visual filter</a> that's usable with both the modern and legacy control schemes.

            <p>
The classic Verdansk map will return to Call of Duty Warzone next year.
</p>
<p>
Verdansk is the battle royale's original map that's no longer playable. But, following in the footsteps of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>'s own OG map return, it will be back in spring 2025.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-report-suggests-that-warzones-verdansk-map-is-making-a-comeback-in-late-2024">return of the map has been rumoured for some time</a>, but Activision officially confirmed the news in last night's Call of Duty: Next livestream.

</figure>
<p>
It's unclear if Verdansk will be altered in any way or return exactly as fans remember. Indeed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-warzone-dev-current-day-verdansk-is-gone-and-its-not-coming-back">Amos Hodge, associate creative director at Raven Studios, previously said</a>: "Players don't know it, but current day Verdansk, they'll never play in that state again. Current day Verdansk is gone and it's not coming back."
</p>
<p>
The timing of the map's return is also intriguing. While no specific date has been given, Warzone originally launched on 10th March 2020 so could this be part of a five year anniversary celebration?

News of Verdansk's return came alongside fresh details on the next map coming to the game in Season 1.
</p>
<p>
Area 99 is Treyarch's new Resurgence map for Warzone, described as "the birthplace of Nuketown". It includes ten points of interest, including a central Reactor and areas like Manufacturing, Loading Bay, and Nuketown Shipping.
</p>
<p>
Nuketown (which sounds very <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a>-esque) is a popular recurring map in the Call of Duty series that, as the name suggests, was a nuclear test site.

The return of the original map in rival battle royale Fortnite proved extremely successful, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-confirms-return-of-original-map-in-2024-due-to-popular-demand">Epic confirming it will return again this year</a>. It's likely this refers to the now-permanent Fortnite Reload mode, which offers a condensed version of the classic Chapter 1 Island, though a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/billie-eilish-coming-to-fortnite-adding-weight-to-a-much-discussed-leak">much-discussed leak suggests a similar OG event will take pace for Fortnite's Chapter 2 iteration later in 2024</a>.
</p>
<p>
The original battle royale PUBG also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-is-doing-a-fortnite-and-bringing-back-its-original-island-map">saw its first map return earlier this year</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-players-told-to-restart-game-offered-cosmetic-ship-trinket-by-ubisoft-as-apology<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Ubisoft has offered PS5 players who were advised to restart <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-early-access">Star Wars Outlaws</a> in order to avoid progression-breaking bugs a peace offering in the form of... a trinket and some Ubisoft Connect currency.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-ps5-players-asked-to-start-all-new-save-to-avoid-progression-blocking-bugs">As we reported yesterday</a>, Ubisoft recently emailed some PlayStation 5 players asking them to update their copy of Outlaws to the latest version, following a chunky bug-busting patch. Players should then start a completely new save, Ubisoft said, as they would likely be unable to progress fully in their current save.</p>
<p>This was, understandably, not particularly well received by players who had begun playing on an earlier version of the game - including those who paid more to get early access, and had already invested several hours into it.</p>

<p>Now, in a follow up email, Ubisoft has said it was making amends for this misstep by giving affected Outlaws players a trinket for Kay's ship Trailblazer and 100 of those aforementioned Ubisoft Connect credits, which can be used to unlock in-game rewards or discounts in Ubisoft games, and is typically earned via completing in-game achievements. Ubisoft said it hoped this offering would make players' return to the Outer Rim "a little more special" this time around.</p>
<p>"We fully acknowledge that asking you to start a new game is not the best experience, especially during the Early Access period, and for that we apologise," Ubisoft's email reads.</p>
<p>The company stated it is now "actively working" on adding the Ubisoft Connect currency into players' accounts. That trinket, meanwhile, can be found in Trailblazer's delivery crate once players reach Toshara, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-players-will-return-to-tatooine-and-its-iconic-mos-eisley-cantina">Outlaws' new moon created for the game that's inspired by the African Savannah</a>.</p>
<p>"We appreciate your patience, and we hope you enjoy the game," the email closed.</p>

<p>We recently awarded Star Wars Outlaws two out of five stars.</p>
<p>"It lacks the branching, open stealth of an Arkham game, the systemic options of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> or the incisive, relentlessly satisfying speed of picking enemies off in Assassin's Creed," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">Eurogamer's Star Wars Outlaws review</a>. "It lacks the linear polish and charisma of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/uncharted">Uncharted</a>. Lacks the animation flow to its yellow-ledge platforming next to a Horizon, or the sheer joy of taking platforming and making it into an actual game in itself, as in Star Wars Jedi."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-sales-increase-japan/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Xbox Series X sales have increased significantly in Japan following the announcement of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-gets-price-rise-in-japan-increasing-by-90/">PlayStation 5 price increase</a> which will go into effect next week.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/ps5-price-increase-in-japan-sends-xbox-consoles-soaring-up-sales-charts/">Automaton</a>, on Yodobashi, one of Japan's biggest retailers, the console reached number 8 in the games and consoles charts this morning, which is an amazing result, considering the system wasn't even in the top 100 yesterday. With the PS5's price increase, the Xbox Series X has become an enticing purchase, as it now costs the equivalent of $100 less. In addition, it seems like it has become difficult for Japanese players to even purchase a PlayStation 5 system, as the pre-rise stock has been completely sold out at most retailers.</p>
<p>Considering how much the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S have struggled in Japan since release, this is definitely good news for Microsoft as it gears up to release new models of both systems, including a <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-all-digital-announced/">Series X All-Digital model</a> coming with a 2TB SSD. On the other hand, the negative sentiment surrounding the PlayStation 5 couldn't have surfaced at a worse time, with Sony supposedly preparing to announce the PlayStation 5 Pro <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-design-reveal/">early next month</a>. The increased specs over the base and the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler, which will make the system <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-100-faster-upscaling-epic-settings/">feel even more powerful than it actually is</a>, may not be enough to convince Japanese customers to pay more to play titles that are also coming on Xbox Series X, such as the upcoming Monster Hunter Wilds, which has been cited by many on Japanese social media as the game that made them want to purchase a PlayStation 5.</p>

			<p>It took a long time, but Square Enix finally <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-xbox-announced-crossplay-square-enix-on-xbox-going-forward/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> Final Fantasy XIV on Xbox consoles earlier this year. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naoki-yoshida-on-dawntrail-criticism-community-feedback-and-the-future-of-final-fantasy-14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking</a> with Eurogamer at Gamescom 2024, producer Naoki Yoshida discussed the community's response to the launch and reiterated Square Enix's commitment to Microsoft's console platform.</p>
<p><em>Players have been waiting a long time for the Xbox release of Final Fantasy XIV, but I'm happy to say that we've seen a really strong response on Xbox. We've seen communities starting to establish and now they're growing. We've had a pretty good response on Xbox.</em></p>
<p><em>With Final Fantasy XIV as an opportunity, we can take this opportunity to strengthen the community on Xbox towards the Final Fantasy franchise. I think this is where we would take more communication and work on establishing the community moving forward. And this is important, not for Final Fantasy XIV, but, I would say, for Square Enix. With Final Fantasy XIV's release on Xbox, Phil Spencer spent a lot of his time and a lot of effort and put in a lot of hard work into making it a reality. So we would like to make the best of that and further deepen the relationship with Xbox gamers moving forward.</em></p>
<p><em>I want you to just take this as a general argument, but when it comes to the Xbox platform and the fact that it was difficult for Japanese titles to be released on the platform, that's tied into the fact that in the Japanese market there is an extremely low number of users on Xbox. And naturally, because we are Japanese developers, we have a desire for many people in our country to play our games. I think that applies to developers in any country, whichever country they come from, they want many people from their own country to play their games. Because of that, it's really a tough point in terms of a business standpoint. I think that's generally one perspective of how you can look at things in terms of the situation.</em></p>
<p><em>However, at Square Enix, we have been changing our policy. So now we are moving towards the policy of releasing our games on a multiplatform basis, and we really want as many players as possible to play our titles. So with Final Fantasy XIV as the starting point, we do want to release more Square Enix games on Xbox, and there will be more of our titles released on Xbox. So I hope players will look forward to future things to come on the platform.</em></p>
<p>Yoshida is referring, of course, to the new multiplatform strategy <a href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-unveils-new-business-plan-with-aggressive-multiplatform-strategy-and-quality-over-quantity-focus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in May by Square Enix. It was largely due to the disappointing sales of PlayStation 5 exclusives like Final Fantasy XVI (also produced by Yoshida-san) and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. The former, in particular, is just about to launch on PC, and it's not at all far-fetched to imagine it will eventually launch on Xbox, too. It may be more tricky with the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, as Sony is believed to have secured those games for good.</p>

<p>The PS5 Pro’s design details have surfaced online, and it seems that the mid-gen refresh console will be similar in design to the PS5 Slim model.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Reliable gaming news source <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-nom-le-design-de-la-nouvelle-console-de-playstation-avec-plein-dautres-details-inedits-59094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a> recently shared more details about the upcoming console, including the official name, design details, announcement window, and more. According to their latest report, as everyone expected, the mid-gen console’s official name was PS5 Pro. Read about the design details, announcement window and more below. </p>



<p>Billbil-kun finding the information suggests that it’s been uploaded on the backend of retailer websites… somewhere, suggesting that the console will soon be announced. </p>

<h2 id="h-ps5-pro-design">PS5 Pro Design </h2>



<p>The report states that the PS5 Pro design will feature “the same white colour” for the outer panels as the previous models. On the front of the console, players will find 2 USB-C ports and a power button. Additionally, there will be three “black stripes” across both side panels instead of the Slim’s one stripe. Lastly, the PS5 Pro model is a bit bulkier than the Slim models.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-controller-and-announcement-window">Controller and Announcement Window</h2>



<p>Moreover, according to the images billbil-kun has received, the PS5 Pro doesn’t seem to have a disc drive; however, this needs to be confirmed. Regarding the controller, the Pro model will still feature the standard DualSense Controller in the box. Lastly, the report states that the PS5 Pro “will be announced very soon” and could be announced as early as “the first half of September 2024.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Insider Gaming previously reported that a PlayStation <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/september-2024-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Play event</a> is seemingly scheduled for the end of September, and the PS5 Pro announcement could arrive during this event.

            <p>
The design of Sony's under-wraps but much-discussed PlayStation 5 Pro model has reportedly been posted online. 
</p>
<p>
Prolific leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-nom-le-design-de-la-nouvelle-console-de-playstation-avec-plein-dautres-details-inedits-59094">bilbil-kun</a> today posted an illustration showing the console model - which looks very similar to that of the base PS5 - and provided a few more details on its reveal. 
</p>
<p>
White in colour, with two USB-C ports and a power button on the console's front, the only major difference is the three ridged lines on the console's shell. This is an upgrade to the one ridged line on the PS5 Slim.

<p>
The PS5 Pro will be offered as a digital-only model, reportedly to keep costs down, though today's report suggests it may still be possible to affix the PS5 disc drive add-on to it - although this is not confirmed either way.
</p>
<p>
There are no changes expected to the PS5 DualSense controller, meanwhile.

<p>
The leak of the PS5 Pro's design comes just weeks ahead of its formal announcement, today's report states, which is expected next month - in September.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer and Digital Foundry have been tracking PS5 Pro's path to release over the past year, since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-df-weekly-are-the-latest-switch-2-and-ps5-pro-leaks-actually-plausible">leaks first popped up in the summer of 2023</a> that Sony was prepping a more powerful PS5. In February of this year, CNBC stated there was now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-pro-expected-this-year-report">"broad concensus" that Sony was indeed preparing PS5 Pro</a> to launch "in the second half of 2024". 
</p>
<p>
In March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-pro-leaked-specs-appear-online">PS5 Pro technical specs appeared online</a>, which Eurogamer understands to be accurate. Digital Foundry did its own analysis, and dubbed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-spec-analysis-playstation-5-pro-the-most-powerful-console-yet">PlayStation 5 Pro to be "the most powerful console yet"</a>. April brought word that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/which-games-will-get-sonys-ps5-pro-enhanced-label">Sony was prepping a "PS5 Pro Enhanced" label</a> for new games (or older ones with new patches) that will take advantage of its upcoming hardware. And yet <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-new-ps5-pro-gpu-details-emerge-including-a-235ghz-max-boost-clock">more PS5 technical details arrived in May</a>. 
</p>
<p>So, will you be buying PS5 Pro?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>How do you remake a cult classic? Change too much and you alienate the hardcore fans of the original, whilst failing to adapt and imrpove ancient mechanics will leave modern audiences cold. Despite having a good stab at it, it’s a conundrum that NatsumeAtari never manage to satisfyingly resolve during the course of their retro 2D slash ‘em up, Shadow of the Ninja- Reborn.</p>
<p><iframe title="Shadow of the Ninja - Reborn" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5u6KyZsKNLo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The original Shadow of the Ninja arrived on the NES in Europe way back in 1991. It was a 2D 8-bit side-scrolling platforming ninja ‘em up; one that stood out in a shadowy genre thanks to its hugely enjoyable 2 player co-op, which saw two ninjas leaping, dashing, and lobbing shuriken with wanton abandon. Now, thirty-something years since its EU debut, Shadow of the Ninja has been reborn under the watchful eye of Tengo Project. Meanwhile, original creatives Dynamic Productions and Iku Mizutani have returned to handle character illustrations and music respectively. And their involvement has paid off, as the presentation of Shadow of the Ninja Reborn is absolutely spot on. Graphically, whilst still a humungous improvement on the original’s 8-bit visuals, Reborn retain its predecessor’s distinctive pixel-coated retro-charm. </p>


<p>Character models are so chunky you can almost chew ‘em; huge mechs clunk into battle, oiled-up beefcakes flex their biceps before charging into battle, whilst gun-toting robo-mercs unleash bullet hell every moment they can get. It’s so charming, so bonkers, it’s like the 90’s never went away! The sprites of returning ninjas Hayate and Kaede are delightful too. Their range of animations are beguiling, and they both look cool slicing through hordes of minions – even if Kaede has, once again, seemingly forgotten to wear any pants. The music is – of course, considering Mizutani’s return – grin-inducing guitar-wailing brilliance. Whilst the environments themselves ooze with incidental details; lightning flashes, thunder brews, and rain pours. The atmosphere that Shadow of the Ninja – Reborn gives off is palpable, who needs polygons huh?</p>


<p>Local co-up is present, correct, and as fun as ever. So, why doesn’t Shadow of the Ninja Reborn deliver on all of its promise? For me, it is too respectful of the original game. The 90’s era levels have been re-produced with likely too much diligence; often becoming a teeth-gnashing grind of pixel-perfect leaps, endless bad-guys, and a peculiar pre-occupation of making it hard to tell if a surface can be clung to or not. My skilled ninja warrior would often hilariously bounce off a wall rather than attach to it, even though visually the wall looked virtually identical to the other’s I had been clambering on. </p>
<p>Controls are unnecessarily fussy too. Climbing is messy, with Hayate and Kaede rarely behaving themselves and dying unnecessarily because of it. Whilst only being able to access one collected power-up at a time fails to add any of the intended strategy, just frustration as you drink a health-potion rather than lobbing that bomb. There’s also a definite input lag, which, when combined with some old-school difficulty levels, can create some near unscalable difficulty spikes. So much so in fact, that my regular local co-up pal soon bounced off the arduous challenge, forcing me to go it alone through what proved be an interminable slog, despite the inclusion of occasional – and much welcome – check points.</p>

<p>Whilst the correct balance of homage and reinvention when it comes to a remake will always be subjective, I can’t help but feel that Shadow of the Ninja – Reborn is too devoted to its predecessor. If you want that old-school uber-challenging retro experience, warts and all, then you’ll love what you find here, for the rest of us, a few more modern design sensibilities would prove a welcome respite.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Shadow of the Ninja - Reborn looks the part, this is a sumptuous 2D scroller that clearly loves the 1990s with unabashed and borderline obsessional desire. It effectively emulates the experience of playing a game from that era too. The problem is that includes dodgy controls, plentiful gameplay frustrations and difficulty spikes so sharp they’d make a 42-year-old man cry. And they did.	</p></div>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-design-reveal/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-pro-to-feature-similar-design-of-base-model-reveal-set-for-early-september.966879/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-design-reveal/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-2tb-storage/">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> design won't be much different that that of the current base model, according to a new report from a reliable leaker.</p>
<p>Earlier today, well-known leaker billbil-kun <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/voici-le-nom-le-design-de-la-nouvelle-console-de-playstation-avec-plein-dautres-details-inedits-59094">provided</a> some new information on the yet-to-be-released system, confirming that it will unsurprisingly be named PlayStation 5 Pro, judging from the front of the final packaging they were able to see. The front of the final packaging also revealed the console's design, which looks pretty much the same as the current base model, barring a few minor differences and a slightly thicker size.</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the PlayStation 5 Pro may be released without a disc drive, as the packaging seen by the leaker shows the system without one. The leaker, however, couldn't confirm if this model will be the only one to get released. Additionally, the console will come with a standard DualSense controller.</p>
<p>Regarding the timing of the announcement, billbil-kun couldn't precisely confirm when the PS5 Pro will be revealed, but it shouldn't take much longer, as the long-rumored system should be revealed during the first half of September.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has yet to be officially announced, but it was basically an <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-was-an-open-secret-at-gamescom-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">open secret at Gamescom 2024</a>, with developers talking freely about it even to our Alessio. We will keep you updated on it as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <link>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-original-resident-evil-2-from-1998-comes-shambling-and-groaning-back-to-pc</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-original-resident-evil-2-from-1998-comes-shambling-and-groaning-back-to-pc.966876/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-original-resident-evil-2-from-1998-comes-shambling-and-groaning-back-to-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Step this way please, fans of pre-rendered backgrounds and pixellated blood spatters. There is something waiting for you in the window of the local internet video game store, GOG.com. Resident Evil 2, the original 1998 survival horror, is now buyable, downloadable, and yes, even playable on PC. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>It's up <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/resident_evil_2">on GOG for £9</a> currently, boasting "Improved cutscenes and subtitles" while also making the bonus character scenarios unlocked from the beginning. For those who've forgotten, these are the two special runs you can do featuring gas-masked military man Hunk, or giant piece of sentient soy, Tofu. This port also seems to squash a few long-standing bugs. "Fixed issues with Rooms 114 and 115 (missing text), Room 210 (invisible diary), and Room 409 (looping sound)," says the blurb. Intriguing.</p>
<p>This is all part of an ongoing roll out of the original zombie-zappin' scarers. Resident Evil 1 was put on sale <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-original-resident-evil-from-1996-comes-back-to-pc-after-decades-of-gathering-flies">a couple of months ago</a>, while Resident Evil 3 has also been <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/resident_evil_2">listed as "coming soon"</a> since then. It's not the first time any of the games have been out on PC, but it is now the easiest (legal) option when it comes to frollicking around Raccoon City in your big bloodstained bandage.</p>
<p>Old Resi 2 is a good aperitif if you've recently played the Resident Evil 2 remake. The remake plays with your memories of the late-ninties statue-pusher in some fun ways. You might gingerly walk down the much beautified bottom floor corridor of the police station, muttering in mental preparation that the first licker will appear overhead shortly. But then... it's nowhere to be seen. Only later, when you're lulled into puzzle solving mode, does the monster show up on another floor entirely, skittering across the ceiling with nary a FMV cutscene to steady your nerves. Well played, Capcom, you got me. </p>
<p>Since these small differences are set against a largely faithful recreation of the original's spirit, they stand out as fun expectation-bouncers rather than iconoclastic upheaval. As you can probably tell, I played a lot of Resi as a young 'un, and I'm fond of the remake. If the various <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/resident-evil-code-veronica-and-0-remakes-are-rumoured-to-be-in-development-at-capcom">rumours about remakes for Code Veronica and Resident Evil 0</a> prove to be true, perhaps we'll see more clever modernisations. But even without those, there is something valuable in going back to the source material, even if you never actually played it in the bright, free beauty of the 1990s. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Also increased EXP for defeating monsters by 1.5 times.</p><p>- You can now acquire rare basic materials as a reward for completing Hard Infiltration Operations.</p><p>- Increased EXP for defeating monsters in Normal Infiltration Operations by 1.5 times.</p><p># Director's Comment</p><p>The 1.1.0 update brings many changes to Hard Infiltration Operations. We've changed some of the pre-existing missions such as Occupation, Defense, and Escort to Extermination or Destruction to give players a run-and-gun styled fast-paced combat experience as they enjoy repeated farming. The reward system has also been adjusted to reflect this: we've significantly increased the amount of EXP gained from defeating monsters and completing missions in Hard Infiltration Operations, and while Special Operations are still the better option for farming EXP, Infiltration Operations can now provide a decent amount of EXP as players farm items. Additionally, we've increased the amount of rare basic materials you can receive from clearing Hard Infiltration Operations. We'll continue to add more content that allows players to enjoy their favorite styles of combat.</p><p>- Added directions to appear when using Ecive during missions.</p><p>- Monsters will no longer target players who are participating in other missions.</p><p>- Story dialogues will no longer be repeated in Hard Difficulty missions. As a result, Hard Difficulty missions will not play additional voice lines or subtitles.</p><p>- Changed the Immunity mechanics of certain Named Monsters. Replaced the sphere destruction mechanic of Eterllick, Celdir, Dmigor, and Plaudia with shooting weak points.</p><p>- Increased the barrier hit range of Named Monster Eterllick.</p><p>- Players will no longer be teleported when joining Largescale Outpost missions.</p><p>- Increased the Gold reward for completing Hard Difficulty Largescale Outposts by approximately 3 times.</p><p>- Improved the routes so that shards acquired from Void Fragments can be used on the Fusion Reactor in the same battlefield.</p><p>- More than doubled the amount of shards obtained from Void Fragments.</p><p>- Changed monster types and spawn locations in certain Void Fragment missions.</p><p>ㄴ "Hagios: Dune Base," "Vespers: Moonlight Lake," "Echo Swamp: Abandoned Zone," and "Fortress: Frozen Valley"</p><p>- Removed the starting requirements (Void Shards) of Void Fusion Reactors and added requirements (Void Shards) to the Reconstructed Devices that appear in Fusion Reactors.</p><p>- Made an improvement so that only one type of shard is required when using the Reconstructed Device in a Void Fusion Reactor.</p><p>- Reduced the time to interact with Reconstructed Devices.</p><p>- Summoned Reconstructed Devices now expire 10 seconds after all participants have used them.</p><p># Director's Comment</p><p>With the 1.1.0 update, we've made adjustments so that a single playthrough of a Void Fragment will yield enough Void Shards to use the Reconstructed Devices in Fusion Reactors once. We've also improved accessibility by making Void Fragments and Fusion Reactors on the same battlefield drop and require the same type of shards. While you can still obtain two types of shards from Void Fragments, the Reconstructed Devices in Fusion Reactors now require only one type of shard, further improving accessibility.</p><p>We are constantly monitoring feedback to further improve Outposts and Void Fragments. For long-term improvements, the dev team is considering ideas to evolve Outposts into a non-stop combat experience, as well as improving the farming accessibility of Void Fragments and Fusion Reactors with the integration of content.</p><p>In this 1.1.0 update, we've also changed the spawn location of certain Void Fragment missions to provide an efficient way to farm shards for each attribute. In addition, we've added snipers in certain Void Fragment areas to prevent the use of macros.</p><p>We hope these changes will make your farming experience more enjoyable.</p><p>- Players can now view the "Past Mission Results" from the menu after completing Special Operations, allowing them to restart the mission.</p><p>- Improved display of the mission tooltip information on the Special Operation and Infiltration Operation World Map screen.</p><p>- More than doubled the amount of shards that can be picked up in Special Operations.</p><p>- Acquire additional Descendant EXP when completing waves in Special Operations.</p><p># Director's Comment</p><p>We've made adjustments to Special Operations so that there is improved efficiency when farming EXP. While we recognize many players enjoy leveling up through Sterile Land Mine Blocking, we still believe it's not as rewarding as other EXP farms that require a simpler play, such as Void Fragments.</p><p>As a result, in this update, we've added EXP when clearing waves in Special Operations. The fastest, "Mine Blockade," will now give you about 1.5 times more EXP than before, while "Resource Defense" and "Neutralize Experiment" will give you 2 times more EXP. We hope this will help players level up more efficiently across various Special Operations.</p><p>(2) UI/UX</p><p>- Fixed issue to allow multiple socket types to be assigned to a single module socket.</p><p>ㄴ The socket type applied to Loadout Setting 1 can also be used for Settings 2 and 3 as well.</p><p>- For slots with multiple socket types, the socket type can be changed from the selected menu</p><p>ㄴ Each socket type for Loadout Settings 1, 2, 3 can be changed so they all may differ.</p><p>- Fixed issue to allow the dismantling of equipment during combat.</p><p>- Added dead zone settings to the game controller options.</p><p>- Made improvements so that the Amorphous Materials linked to Fusion Reactors are displayed in the acquisition information, like Intercept Battles.</p><p>- Made improvements to allow the ability to designate the quantity of researches when researching enhancement materials.</p><p>- Reduced research time for [Standard/Precision] Ion Accelerator, Phase Exchanger, and Adjustment Control Axis.</p><p># Director's Comment</p><p>We have added the ability to select the quantity of researches when researching enhancement materials. One consequence of this change is that only two studies in the research list will result for each enhancement material. This means, previously, multiple Adjustment Control Axis could be simultaneously created; now, when it comes to Adjustment Control Axis, only two can be researched at the same time.</p><p>With the addition of the research quantity selection feature, players can now research up to 500 Adjustment Control Axis at a time. This allows them to conduct more research in one go, reducing the number of visits to Anais. However, the inability to simultaneously conduct multiple research will reduce the amount of enhancement materials that can be acquired in a short period of time.</p><p>While we want to give players new features, we also want to make sure that players in certain situations aren't losing out. As a result, we've shortened the time it takes to research enhancement materials so that despite only doing one research at a time, you'll still acquire a similar amount of enhancement materials as before. We hope this will help players research and utilize enhancement materials more efficiently.</p><p>- Made improvements to display only modules you have in duplicate when combining modules.</p><p>- Increased the number of symbols that can be displayed, when designating them as Attached Items, to 8.</p><p>- Made improvements to allow the ability to set an "Equipment Option" category in "Filter all as junk" for Reactors and External Components in equipment.</p><p>- Changed the display location and design of the random options to improve inventory slots. Removed displays for the Reactor's attributes/Arche type and fixed the display for External Components set effects.</p><p>- The Reactor icon has changed so that it now varies, depending on the Arche type.</p><p>- Changed some External Component icons to differentiate their appearance based on their DEF, Shield, and HP stats.</p><p># Director's Comment</p><p>Previously, in Update 1.0.7, we added information for random options, Arche type of Reactors, and External Component sets for item icons. The feedback we received was, that players were distracted, as there was too much information included. Based on this, we've made improvements so that the icon information is presented in a cleaner, more organized way. Dev Team will continue to listen to the valuable feedback given by community and players as we continue to make improvements to the game.</p><p>- Schematized the "Amount of Owned Equipment" tooltip in inventory.</p><p>- Significantly increased the quantity of Shape Stabilizer you own.</p><p>- Improved the map to show the location of records needed to be found when progressing Descendant related quests.</p><p>- Made improvements by adding a Tracking On tab when researching, making it easier to view the tracked target.</p><p>- Improved the Intercept Battle screen to display the number of Linked Amorphous Materials players have at each Intercept Battle.</p><p>- Improved the ability to view "Mission Details" through the mission tooltip on the map.</p><p>- Improved the display of the red dot when there are unacquired Battle Pass items.</p><p>- Improved the ability to purchase a one-time, large quantity of enhancement materials at the shop.</p><p>- Improved the ability to preview each component of a bundled product without moving the screen.</p><p>- Improved the ability to view each Evolution Stage of an evolving skin in the shop.</p><p>- [Console] Added attributes and Arche keywords, by type, to the Descendant and Weapon Module screens, making it easier to find modules on console platforms as well.</p><p>(3) Descendants</p><p>- Jayber</p><p>ㄴ Fixed an issue where some stats were not reflected in Jayber"s "Turret."</p><p>Skill Power Modifier, Additional ATK for skills when attacking Colossus/Legion of Darkness/Order of Truth/Legion of Immortality, Incoming Damage Modifier</p><p>ㄴ Improved Jayber's "Turret Sync" effect to apply to summoned turrets.</p><p>ㄴ When equipping skill module "Turret Engineering," instead of improving summoned turrets to create a "Turret Zone," increased cooldown of "Turret Engineering."</p><p>- Blair</p><p>ㄴ Improved Blair's "Pitmaster" Skill so it now increases the Critical Hit Rate by the number of "Flame Zones" he has, up to a maximum of 5.</p><p>ㄴ Increased Blair's "Flame Zone" Skill DMG.</p><p>ㄴ Increased the DMG dealt by Blair's "Burn" Skill effect.</p><p>ㄴ Made changes so that Blair's "Extinguish" Skill no longer retrieves "Flame Zones."</p><p>ㄴ Improved "Taste of Aggression" effect to stack for the "Extinguish" Skill.</p><p>ㄴ Improved the MP Heal per "Flame Zone" from the "Taste of Aggression" and "Power of Fire" effects to be proportional to Blair's Max MP.</p><p>ㄴ Increased the maximum amount of "Flame Zones" that can be absorbed through the "Extinguish" Skill.</p><p>ㄴ Increased the duration of the "Blaze Up" Skill, reducing its MP cost.</p><p>ㄴ Improved the "Burn Taste" Skill so that the skill can be halted when pressing the button during use.</p><p>• Increased skill DMG of the "Burn Taste" skill and improved it to be affected by duration-related modules.</p><p>• Increased the Max Stack when equipping the "Incendiary Bomb" skill module, and reduced MP cost.</p><p>• Increased the number of "Small Fireballs" for the "Deadly Cuisine" skill when the "Classic Chef" skill module is equipped, and increased the effect of the "Pitmaster" skill based on the Flame Zone count.</p><p>- Ajax</p><p>• Improved Ajax's "Orbit Barrier" and "Hyper Cube" barrier to be affected by attribute resistances, and increased the barriers' HP and DEF ratios.</p><p>• Increased the ratios of barrier-related stats when the "Life Barrier" and "Void Barrier" skill modules are equipped.</p><p>• Fixed an issue with continuously recovering shield for "Void Walk" and "Matrix Recomputation" skills and increased the Max Shield Up ratio.</p><p>• Improved the "Void Walk" skill to have faster motion transitions when used while enhanced.</p><p>• Modified the "Body Enhancement" skill to increase HP, DEF, and Shield, and improved it to grant 100% Void Energy when used, but increased the Cooldown and Skill Cost.</p><p>• Changed the "Void Walk" skill so that it can be stacked when the "Void Charge" skill module is equipped, and increased the damage dealt proportional to DEF when using the "Void Walk" and "Expulsion" skills.</p><p>• Improved "Void Charge" to restore "Void Walk" stacks and reset the Cooldown of "Expulsion" when used while enhanced.</p><p># Director's Comment</p><p>In this update, we've made balance adjustments to Ajax, Blair, and Jayber. We've been closely analyzing feedback from the community and continue to monitor all Descendants and Ultimate Weapons. As we move forward with this Invasion Season, we'll continue to balance more Descendants and Ultimate Weapons based on your feedback.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/-a-rising-tide-floats-all-boats-xbox-on-the-universal-benefits-of-accessible-design<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Around six years ago, Xbox took a leap of faith. The company unveiled the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2018/05/16/xbox-adaptive-controller/">Xbox Adaptive Controller</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a new type of gamepad that defied traditional design conventions in service of a singular mission: make video games accessible to all.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The console maker has devoted itself to that goal in the subsequent years, rolling out new accessibility options for its video game software, bringing external developers into the fold so they can test their own accessibility features, waiving the licensing fee for accessible hardware developed through its 'Designed for Xbox' program, and building entirely new devices such as the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/console/microsoft-unveils-new-accessibility-hardware-including-xbox-adaptive-thumbstick">Xbox Adaptive Joystick</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discussing those initiatives with Game Developer at Gamescom 2024, Xbox senior accessibility product manager Kaitlyn Jones and principal designer Chris Kujawski explain the benefits of accessible design–whether you're talking about hardware of software–are profound but can often be easy to miss.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We define accessibility as 'ensuring that anybody who wants to be able to use or play can do so.' It can mean a lot of different things [...] so it does vary, but our general philosophy is that a 'rising tide floats all boats.' When it comes to accessibility, we don't compete. We just want anyone to play regardless of the title or platform," says Jones.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Collaboration a &quot;core part&quot; of Xbox's accessible design process">Collaboration a "core part" of Xbox's accessible design process</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In practice, Microsoft applies that philosophy by working directly with disabled players. Kujawski explains there's a saying within that community: "nothing about us, without us." That, he says, influences every decision Xbox makes.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's why, for example, the company took a myriad of Xbox Adaptive Joystick prototypes to a hospital in Seattle so they could be put through the wringer. The team have to understand use-cases that might not be immediately apparent. In this instance, that testing slalom highlighted the need for the Joystick to be mountable on solid surfaces, allowing it to be used by people who might not be able to hold it in their hand.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We are not designing something and then handing it over," adds Kujawski. "It's a co-design process. So throughout the process there are many different checkpoints and many different departments–whether that's individuals or charities or hospitals.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The team has built a huge network where folks can get feedback from, so that's a very core part of the design process. In addition to that, the halo effect [of our work] has meant that accessibility has become a part of our game design process. We don't make products now without doing an accessibility check."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Those checks means Xbox now strives to make everything down to the cardboard boxes that house its consoles accessible. No detail is too small, and no compromise is too big.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The Xbox Adaptive Controller debuted in 2018</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That wasn't always the case. Kujawski explains each new accessibility concept has to be pitched up the chain. The team has a fluctuating roadmap of products that are "always competing for space," and will often cook up experimental 'proof-of-concept' projects before entering the pitching room.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[Pitching] has gotten easier since the Adaptive Controller," says Kujawski. "There's more of a pull. [The Adaptive Controller] wasn't a hard sell, necessarily, but there was a lot of explaining to do. Because leadership gets pitched ideas all of the time, so at the beginning it's just one of many. But because of the unique nature of [our projects] and the match to Microsoft's mission, it has become easier."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Jones adds there's now a "better understanding" internally about how accessibility can have a positive impact on an entire playerbase. "For example, our co-pilot feature, [now called] '</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/help/account-profile/accessibility/copilot">Xbox Controller Assist</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">,' was pitched to leadership as something that would allow a parent and a child that was just learning to game to be able to play together," she continues.&nbsp; "Now we know it's also a really fantastic accessibility feature, so I think discussing those alternative use cases that just make experiences more viable for anyone is really important."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Notably, Jones says there's never any pressure on the accessibility team to "sell a certain number of units," although pricing is very much a consideration. "What we do want to do is ensure that product is as low cost as possible," she adds. For example, in a bid to keep costs down for consumers, Xbox chose to make its Adaptive Joystick wired instead of wireless.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[That way] we don't have to pay for battery," says Kujawski. "It also makes it lighter. There have been other joysticks on the market like this, that are hardwired to USB. With those, you have one length of cable. We ship with a two meter cable but we made it removable on purpose, so if you're playing right next to the Xbox Adaptive Controller you can switch that out. We're always making those trade-off and asking 'what gives us the most flexibility, what helps us with cost, and what expands the reach of the products?.'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Building products that are accessible, flexible, and affordable is evidently paramount. But what about products that last? Kujawski reiterates that Xbox is in this for the long haul. That means it won't be refreshing its slate of accessibility hardware on a whim. These are devices built to transcend console generations (and whatever comes beyond). "We would definitely get a lot of negative feedback if, say next generation, this [device roster] doesn't work," he adds. "That's a real bad look and it's just a bad policy. The longevity of it is super important."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/community/for-everyone/accessibility">You can learn more about Xbox's range of accessibility tools and hardware on Xbox Wire</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p>Back in March, Bungie <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-replace-marathon-director-amid-reports-of-creative-leadership-shake-up">announced a leadership reshuffle</a> on their Marathon reboot project, with former Valorant dev Joe Ziegler replacing veteran Bungie designer Christopher Barrett as director. It seems there was more to that story than concern about the progress of Marathon. According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/-marathon-video-game-director-barrett-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behavior">new Bloomberg report</a> citing anonymous sources, Barrett was in fact fired this spring after he was accused by several female Bungie staff of inappropriate behaviour.</p> <!--more-->
<p>What does "inappropriate behaviour" mean? According to two of Bloomberg's sources, it means unwanted comments upon the appearance of lower-level employees, requests to hang out together, suggestions that he could use his wealth and power to advance their careers, and invitations to play truth-or-dare.</p>
<p>According to Bloomberg's sources, Barrett would befriend women in various Bungie departments and bombard them with text messages which, the site says, "blurred the lines between professional and personal". Several people interviewed described Barrett's advances as unwanted, and said that they felt uncomfortable given Barrett's greater seniority at Bungie. Bloomberg have reviewed some of the text messages in question, but aren't sharing details to avoid exposing their recipients. </p>
<p>Bloomberg claims that Barrett was eventually let go following an internal investigation in which at least eight women raised complaints about him. That last bit is according to eight sources, including both some of the women who reported Barrett and others who were involved with the investigation or spoke to the women who raised complaints. Barrett's departure was kept quiet: certain Bungie staff apparently thought that he had gone on sabbatical, but then discovered that his company accounts had been disabled.</p>
<p>In a statement to Bloomberg, Barrett both pushed back against the claims and apologised for his behaviour. "I feel that I have always conducted myself with integrity and been respectful and supportive of my colleagues, many of whom I consider my closest friends," he wrote. "I never understood my communications to be unwanted and I would have never thought they could possibly have made anyone feel uncomfortable. If anyone ever felt that way about their interaction with me, I am truly sorry."</p>
<p>Bungie parent Sony Interactive Entertainment, meanwhile, have told Bloomberg that they take "all complaints of misconduct very seriously" and that "it is our policy and practice to investigate every complaint promptly and take action based on the findings of our investigation", without commenting on Barrett's case in particular.</p>
<p>It's not clear how far back Barrett's alleged misbehaviour goes, but this isn't the first time we've heard about predatory behaviour at Bungie. Back in 2021, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-report-battle-soul-work-culture-harassment-crunch">IGN</a> published an extensive report on life at the Destiny studio, citing 26 current and former staff. Those interviewed shared experiences of "overt sexism, boys' club culture, crunch, and HR protection of abusers, as well as more complex stories of microaggressions, systemic inequalities, and difficulties in being heard".</p>
<p>The news about Barrett comes as Bungie "reposition" for an uncertain future, following what leaders have described as a period of "overly ambitious" expansion and "misfires" in a time of general economic precarity. The studio recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">laid off hundreds of people and formed a new studio within Sony</a> to shore up their finances.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>News for Bungie continues to be bleak, especially for Marathon, the upcoming PvP extraction shooter set in the sci-fi franchise created in the 1990s.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, Jason Schreier <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/-marathon-video-game-director-barrett-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behavior?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcyNDg2NDU0OCwiZXhwIjoxNzI1NDY5MzQ4LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTSVhUWktEV0xVNjgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.lJDK2mJTGM2v8mjO2siujiOigS68jyckaTagfGlXp_A" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a story on Bloomberg to reveal why Game Director Christopher Barrett was <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-directed-valorant-director/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced</a> earlier this year by former Valorant Game Director Joe Ziegler. According to Schreier's sources, Barrett was fired following a misconduct investigation prompted by at least eight female employees reporting inappropriate behavior from the Game Director.</p>
<p>The investigation verified that Barrett made advances and suggested that, thanks to his power within Bungie, he could help advance the female employees' careers. Schreier also shared a statement from Barrett:</p>
<p><em>I feel that I have always conducted myself with integrity and been respectful and supportive of my colleagues, many of whom I consider my closest friends. I never understood my communications to be unwanted and I would have never thought they could possibly have made anyone feel uncomfortable. If anyone ever felt that way about their interaction with me, I am truly sorry.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, other Bungie employees weren't initially told of the circumstances of Barrett's departure. They were led to believe that he was on a sabbatical year, but that wasn't actually the case.</p>
<p>While this is just a single person leaving the Marathon team, there's more problems bubbling under the surface, at least according to insider Tom Henderson, who <a href="https://twitter.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1828872921168916612?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1828872921168916612%7Ctwgr%5E85321f9de4618fd7479349abb24eabce6358fef8%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.everyeye.it%2Fnotizie%2Fmarathon-spacciato-gioco-bungie-pericolo-secondo-tom-henderson-738593.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> that the game is 'cooked' based on his info. The game was originally meant to launch in 2024, but Bungie <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-is-the-latest-gaming-studio-to-suffer-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> it to 2025 alongside the delay of Destiny 2: The Final Shape.</p>
<p>The design of Marathon is ambitious, with the developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-wants-players-actions-to-affect-everyone-in-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning</a> to create a world of persistent zones where player actions actually matter and influence everyone else in the game. Perhaps they're having problems executing that high-level vision.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/no-space-for-dino-crisis-when-monster-hunter-exists-says-shinji-mikami<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Resident Evil and Dino Crisis creator Shinji Mikami said he doesn't "feel like there's a whole lot of space" for a new Dino Crisis game thanks to the success of Capcom's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter">Monster Hunter</a> series.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> with regards to the forthcoming Shadows of the Damned remaster, Mikami discussed the topic of a new Dino Crisis game - it's the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dino-crisis-is-the-series-most-capcom-fans-want-to-see-get-a-new-game">series most Capcom fans want to see make a return</a>, according to a recent survey.

</p>
<p>
Mikami said he was surprised at the fan reaction to Dino Crisis, but it seems the popularity of Monster Hunter has put him off continuing the series.

<p>

"I'm very surprised to hear that," said Mikami in relation to fans wanting more Dino Crisis. "The awesomeness of dinosaurs and the stuff you can do with dinosaurs, that's been kind of really nailed down by Monster Hunter in recent years. 
</p>
<p>
"So even if I were to decide to make a remake or a new version of Dino Crisis, I don't really feel like there's a whole lot of space for that kind of game right now, just since Monster Hunter has become such a big game. But yeah, it is surprising."
</p>
<p>
When Capcom announced <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/exoprimal">Exoprimal</a>, its online dinosaur-inspired shooter, many fans jumped to Dino Crisis, only to be disappointed.
</p>
<p>
"The concept is pretty different from that of Dino Crisis," said Mikami, when I compared the games. "I guess the fans got their expectations up, but here we are."
</p>
<p>
The last game in the series was Dino Crisis 3 released in 2003 and since then it's reached cult classic status. However, there's no official word on any form of remake, remaster, or new game in the series.
</p>
<p>
And, despite rumours, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-dino-crisis-ridge-racer-2-and-soulcalibur-are-heading-to-ps-plus-premium">Dino Crisis is yet to appear on PS Plus</a>.
</p>
<p>
Mikami, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-creator-shinji-mikami-left-tango-gameworks-to-break-free-from-survival-horror">left Tango Gameworks</a> ahead of its closure and has opened a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-director-shinji-mikami-founds-new-company">new studio called KAMUY</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/marvel-rivals-preview-a-new-better-overwatch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Last week I managed to get some time with Marvel Rivals, the next big PvP shooter set to (excuse the pun) rival games such as Overwatch and the like. Marvel is obviously a licence to print money and generally, you can slap Marvel branding on anything these days and you know it will do well to some degree. Of course, there’s an element of burnout as well. People are just a little bit sick of Marvel, because let’s face it, it’s everywhere.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marvel Rivals | Stars Aligned - Official Launch Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a49DJ2bj9Gs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NetEase Games doesn’t care one bit about all that, and has set out to make an actual banger of a third-person PvP shooter. I have to use Overwatch as a comparison because, for all intents and purposes, it’s Overwatch with a Marvel skin. Well, sort of.</p>
<p>The key difference is the switch-up from first-person to third-person, and to be quite honest, this feels a lot better. Overwatch was littered with fancy skins which you only saw in key moments during gameplay. In Rivals, you get to see them all the time, which, if you’re spending money to see these skins, is kind of a big deal.</p>
<p>The starting roster is already enjoyably large, with lots of your favourite Marvel characters involved. Some of the more obvious ones such as Iron Man, Hulk and Thor make an appearance, but then you have some not-so-well-known characters make an appearance too which is nice, such as Jeff the Baby Land Shark and Luna Snow.</p>


<p>I must have put about fifteen to twenty hours into Rivals so far and still didn’t manage to play the whole roster, trying to give ample time to the ones I did try. Surprisingly, despite being a fan of the big green guy, my go-to main quickly became the thunder goddess Storm. Her ability to stay in the air and hurl the elements at enemies from above just appealed to me. And when she drops her ultimate ability, oh man, things get messy. I was regularly dropping at least three to four enemies at a time in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>So yeah, much like Overwatch, ultimate abilities play a big part of matches, with them building up as you play, and then dropping them at key moments to pull back control from the enemy team. Most of them feel very well designed and perfect for the character pulling them off. One of my favourites was Magik, who, when activating her ultimate, transforms into the Darkchylde version of herself, dealing more damage with her attacks and abilities. Hulk’s ultimate works in a different way and is honestly brilliant. It works in stages; he starts as Banner and can immediately activate his ult from the beginning to ‘Hulk out’, then, charging the ultimate again lets him Hulk out even further, turning him into Monster Hulk, an even stronger version. During this mode, he gets an ultimate called World Breaker, which sees him do a move on a single enemy which you may have seen in a popular Avengers movie. It’s truly great!</p>

<p>During the Gamescom beta, NetEase threw two new characters into the mix, Captain America and the Winter Soldier. Cap felt as he should, quite defensive and a great support for the team. One of the games I had with him saw our team hold the enemy at their spawn point. Maybe we got lucky, but I felt Cap’s leadership skills helped. Winter Soldier on the other hand feels very strong. A little too strong at the moment. His ultimate has the chance to trigger multiple times and feels very oppressive. I’m not too worried about this now as there’s just over three months to release so he can be adjusted by then, but if he does release in that state… We are all in trouble.</p>
<p>He’s not the only character that needs adjusting as some do feel like auto-inclusions in team lineups and it would be nice to see a bit more variety. I lost account of the amount of Venoms and Doctor Stranges I would see on opposing teams.</p>
<p>As for the game modes, well, you’d be forgiven for thinking that you are playing Overwatch. It’s pretty egregious, but I’ll be honest, they pull it off well. It’s unapologetically similar, but it works so well and dare I say it, is done better here. Of course, it could use a little tuning to make sure things like the Overtime mechanic don’t last for ages but aside from that, it’s pretty much there.</p>

<p>The other big question on everyone’s lips is how will this game be monetized? Right now we don’t know. A battle pass system was put in place during both betas letting you unlock new cool skins for characters. Blizzard have been very aggressive with their monetisation to the point where the fan base has had enough. Corporate greed won the battle over at Blizzard and now players are being charged £20 and upwards for skins for their favourite heroes.</p>
<p>Nothing has been announced yet for Marvel Rivals but my fingers are crossed that NetEase doesn’t get too greedy, because Rivals has the potential to be amazing and bad monetisation practices have the potential to ruin the experience. Time will tell, but as always, I’ll remain hopeful.</p>
<p>Right now, Marvel Rivals has the potential to take up a lot of my time. I’m gagging to play more and the 6th of December cannot come soon enough.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-changes-black-ops-6/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Activision recently hosted Call of Duty NEXT, the showcase designed to present the future of the COD ecosystem. During the show, countless changes were revealed to be coming to Warzone in the next few months, with a pivotal makeover taking place when Black Ops 6 is released at the end of October.</p>



<p>The team revealed a new small-form map, Area 99, and they confirmed that in 2025, Verdansk will make a return as a large-scale map, but elsewhere, some sizeable changes are in the pipeline.</p>



<p>Read on to learn about everything changing in Warzone soon.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-refreshing">Refreshing</h2>



<p>Area 99 promises to be an exciting, fast-paced map for those who love a bit of Resurgence. It’s an ‘atomic-themed’ map centred around a nuclear power plant, which links it quite nicely with Black Ops’ Nuketown map. </p>



<p>When Black Ops 6 is released on October 25, Warzone will prepare to receive a stack of updates, including the adoption of the new ‘Omnimovement’ mechanics being introduced with the next iteration of the Black Ops series. As you’d expect, every weapon and most of the equipment from Black Ops 6 will also be brought into Warzone.</p>



<p>With the ‘Carry Forward’ mechanism applying this time around, Activision’s teams will be porting almost every weapon from MWII and MWIII into the newest version of Warzone. </p>



<p>On the topic of weapons, players will now be able to carry a melee weapon into Warzone as a third selection. When it comes to Perks, users will be able to pick three Perks that they drop into the Warzone with, as well as a ‘Wildcard’, which hasn’t been seen in the Call of Duty ecosystem for several years. It’s the first time Wildcards will be available in Warzone’s five-year history.</p>



<p>For completionists, Activision will be stacking up the challenges in Warzone. This will give players something to grind for, and the assortment of challenges will include weapon mastery tasks, reticle challenges, and ‘Dark Ops Calling Card’ challenges, the nature of which is being kept under wraps.</p>



<h2 id="h-but-there-s-more">But There’s More</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>It doesn’t end there.</p>



<p>Raven Software revealed that the backpack mechanic is being stripped from the game and that the inventory management function is going back to basics. Everything from money to your armour plates will be kept in an easily accessible menu that makes cumbersome backpacks a thing of the past.</p>



<p>Satchels are making a return, though. When you pick them up, you’ll either boost your armour plate storage <strong>or </strong>your ammunition capacity.</p>



<p>Raven has also tweaked many of the in-game mechanics tied to movement and quality-of-life features. For instance, using ziplines and ascenders has been made much more streamlined, and live ping duration has been decreased to stop the markers from obscuring your vision. </p>



<p>Finally, it was confirmed that when the first season of Black Ops 6 and Warzone arrives later this year, it’ll bring with it Battle Royale Ranked Play, which is good news for the more competitive players on the platform.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Verdansk Is Returning To Warzone In Spring 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-return-warzone-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/verdansk-is-returning-to-warzone-in-spring-2025.966795/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-return-warzone-2025/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Activision has announced the grand return of Verdansk to Call of Duty: Warzone. It’ll arrive in the game in just a few months, making a reappearance more than three years after it was last seen on the platform. It might have popped back up in Warzone Mobile, but let’s face it, it wasn’t ever <strong>the same</strong>.</p>



<p>Verdansk is where it all began for every Warzone player. In 2020, it served as the first Warzone map, and it became an instantly recognisable environment for tens of millions of players pouring onto the battle royale platform.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-return-of-the-king">Return of the King</h2>



<p>In 2025, Verdansk is coming back to Warzone, but there are still a lot of unknowns up in the air.</p>



<p>It’s unclear what ‘form’ Verdansk will take. The general assumption is that it won’t look like the ‘OG’ Verdansk map, but nobody can say what evolution it may have undergone over the last three-and-something years. When it was the defining Warzone map, it underwent a few changes, including a facelift (and a time travel sequence of sorts) for Black Ops Cold War.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>All Activision has shown so far is an outline of the region. It was enough to spark intense excitement within the community, though. Verdansk has an iron-like grip around the nostalgia centres of millions of gamers worldwide. It’s where we lived out the COVID-19-induced lockdowns of 2020 and beyond. In Verdansk, we made friends and enemies, and for some of us, we made <strong>a name </strong>for ourselves.</p>



<p>It’s a side note, but I fell in love with Verdansk and Warzone so hard that I secured a Guinness World Record for the longest battle royale marathon, going the distance on the map and entering the history books. My name is still against that record and I was the first person in history to secure it.</p>



<p>Are you excited about the return of Verdansk in Warzone?</p>

Like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-spring-crops-in-stardew-valley/1100-6525125/" data-ref-id="1100-6525125">spring</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-summer-crops-in-stardew-valley/1100-6525175/" data-ref-id="1100-6525175">summer</a>, fall has a few crops that are very valuable and a few that just aren't worth growing.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Best fall crops</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4340519-fallcrops.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4340519" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4340519-fallcrops.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4340519"></a><figcaption>Corn fields are only worth growing if done at the start of summer, not fall.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4340519-fallcrops.jpg"></figure><p>The<strong> most profitable crops to grow in fall are cranberries, grapes, artichokes, and pumpkins</strong>. Artichoke seeds aren't sold until year 2 and grapes are grown on trellis, making those slightly more difficult options. Sweet Gem Berries are the most valuable crop, but the seeds are sold individually at the Traveling Cart, so it would take several in-game years of continuously growing them and turning them into seeds to have a full field's worth.</p><p dir="ltr">If you <span>want to complete the community center bundles to unlock the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-how-to-unlock-the-greenhouse/1100-6524916/">Greenhouse</a>, you will need to grow some less valuable crops, like corn. Corn continuously produces, but it's really only worth growing if it's done at</span> the beginning of summer.</p><p dir="ltr">Cranberries are the easiest crop to go for, since the plants continue to produce all season long, so you don't have to worry about replanting at any point. Pumpkins have high value, but you can only get two harvests in a single season, so if you want your paydays more spread out, they aren't the best option.</p><p dir="ltr">Below you can find a table containing every fall crop, the cost of their seeds, time it takes to harvest, and sell prices. All of these numbers don't include potential bonuses, like faster growth time or better sell prices. Seed costs are based on Pierre's Store, unless it's noted that they come from a different vendor.</p><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Crop</th><th scope="col">Seed Price</th><th scope="col">Growth Time (days)</th><th scope="col">Sell Price</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Amaranth</td><td>70G</td><td>7</td><td><p>Normal: 150G</p><p>Silver: 187G</p><p>Gold: 225G</p><p>Iridium: 300G</p></td></tr><tr><td>Artichoke</td><td>30G</td><td>8</td><td><p>Normal: 160G</p><p>Silver: 200G</p><p>Gold: 240G</p><p>Iridium: 320G</p></td></tr><tr><td>Beet</td><td>20G (Oasis)</td><td>6</td><td><p>Normal: 100G</p><p>Silver: 125G</p><p>Gold: 150G</p><p>Iridium: 200G</p></td></tr><tr><td>Bok Choy</td><td>50G</td><td>4</td><td><p>Normal: 80G</p><p>Silver: 87G</p><p>Gold: 105G</p><p>Iridium: 140G</p></td></tr><tr><td>Fairy Rose</td><td>200G</td><td>12</td><td><p>Normal: 290G</p><p>Silver: 362G</p><p>Gold: 435G</p><p>Iridium: 580G</p></td></tr><tr><td>Pumpkin</td><td>100G</td><td>13</td><td><p>Normal: 320G</p><p>Silver: 400G</p><p>Gold: 480G</p><p>Iridium: 640G</p></td></tr><tr><td>Sunflower</td><td>200G</td><td>8</td><td><p>Normal: 80G</p><p>Silver: 100G</p><p>Gold: 120G</p><p>Iridium: 160G</p></td></tr><tr><td>Sweet Gem Berry</td><td>1,000G (Traveling Cart)</td><td>24</td><td><p>Normal: 3,000G</p><p>Silver: 3,750G</p><p>Gold: 4,500G</p><p>Iridium: 6,000G</p></td></tr><tr><td>Wheat</td><td>10G</td><td>4</td><td><p>Normal: 25G</p><p>Silver: 31G</p><p>Gold: 37G</p><p>Iridium: 50G</p></td></tr><tr><td>Yam</td><td>60G</td><td>10</td><td><p>Normal: 160G</p><p>Silver: 200G</p><p>Gold: 240G</p><p>Iridium: 320G</p></td></tr><tr><td>Corn</td><td>150G</td><td>14 for initial growth, produces every 4 after</td><td><p>Normal: 50G</p><p>Silver: 62G</p><p>Gold: 75G</p><p>Iridium: 100G</p></td></tr><tr><td>Cranberries</td><td>240G</td><td>7 for initial growth, produces every 5 after</td><td><p>Normal: 75G</p><p>Silver: 93G</p><p>Gold: 112G</p><p>Iridium: 150G</p></td></tr><tr><td>Eggplant</td><td>20G</td><td>5 for initial growth, produces every 5 after</td><td><p>Normal: 60G</p><p>Silver: 75G</p><p>Gold: 90G</p><p>Iridium: 120G</p></td></tr><tr><td><p>Broccoli</p></td><td>Foraged</td><td>8 for initial growth, produces every 4 after</td><td><p>Normal: 70G</p><p>Silver: 87G</p><p>Gold: 105G</p><p>Iridium: 140G</p></td></tr><tr><td>Grape</td><td>60G</td><td>10 for initial growth, produces every 3 after</td><td><p>Normal: 80G</p><p>Silver: 100G</p><p>Gold: 120G</p><p>Iridium: 160G</p></td></tr></tbody></table>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/preserving-the-past-with-charles-cecil-game-developer-podcast-ep-46<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite existing in one form or another since the early 80s, people still have room in their hearts for a good ol’ fashioned point-and-click adventure game. In fact, some folk (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>cough </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">zoomers </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>cough</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">) are just now learning how rewarding it can be to patiently peruse a plethora of pixels in hopes of finding the precise one that matters, or how frustrating it can be to come to grips with the developers’ unique interpretation of human logic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To learn more about bridging this generational gamer gap, Editor in Chief Danielle Riendeau sat down with adventure game designer and Revolution Software co-founder Charles Cecil to discuss Revolution’s forthcoming 4K remake of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2544110/Broken_Sword__Shadow_of_the_Templars_Reforged/">Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Produced by Jordan Mallory and with music by Mike Meehan, this is episode 46 of the Game Developer Podcast.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As was the case 30+ years ago, adventure game designers in 2024 must walk a bit of a tightrope when it comes to difficulty management. Cecil’s approach is to provide hints when necessary, but be sparing. Too little help and you risk frustrating the player, but too much and you rob them and their all-important sense of accomplishment.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“It would be better to provide these little hints too infrequently than too frequently, because if a player is close to a solution, and they’re really excited by the fact that they’ve worked [it] out, and then we give you a hint – they’re going to find that very, very frustrating,” Cecil explains. “Ultimately, people play these story games and they feel smart because they’re the ones driving the whole thing forward.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Cecil, writing that player-driven story is a separate but symbiotic process from designing the various puzzles that ultimately underpin the experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“I’ll come up with a two or three page story,” Cecil says, “which obviously imagines how the gameplay can fit into that, and then in parallel, I will start designing the puzzles.” And while these two halves of the project “stay as separate documents,” they are also in constant conversation with each other as “the story is always affected and is complemented by the puzzles. … We'll be looking for great moments where the story and the puzzles come together in some sort of climactic moment.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the specific case of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, not only does the remake provide a chance for younger players to experience the magic of the 90s computer classic, it also gives Cecil a chance to right the wrongs of the past.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“In [a] particular scene, something that’s irritated me for nearly 30 years is that there is a drainpipe,” Cecil says. If the player decides to yank on the pipe, “it comes away from the wall, and [the protagonist] says ‘Well, the clown didn’t escape that way.’” But in the original 1996 artwork for this scene, the pipe isn’t actually connected to anything, which means that the clown </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>obviously</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> couldn’t have used it to escape, even if he somehow fit inside.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“It’s really irritated me for so long, so I go to the artist: ‘Please, just make me happy. Just draw the drainpipe so it looks like it goes up, beyond the top of the screen.’ There are so many little things like that.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You too can experience the delight of finally finding the right pixel when </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Broken Sword - Shadow of the Templars: Reforged</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> launches on September 18. In the meantime, we recommend you listen to our charming little podcast, and then check what’s going on with the similarly forthcoming </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://showcase.gdconf.com/">GDC Showcase</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Editor-in-Chief, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Danielle is the editor-in-chief of Game Developer, with previous editorial posts at Fanbyte, VICE, and Polygon.
