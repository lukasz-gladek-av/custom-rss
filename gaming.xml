		<p>Capcom’s latest <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> showcase has delved into more biome and monster reveals for the much anticipated new game, as well as confirming an open beta test that will take place next week across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC.</p>
<p>Watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxYKTXuoxXQ">the full showcase here</a>, or just catch the latest snazzy trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds: 5th Trailer | The Black Flame" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ahy0AO8WwRc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Let’s cut to the chase, the Monster Hunter Wilds Open Beta Test will take place at the following dates and times next week, with PS Plus subscribers getting a two days early access window.</p>
<ul>
<li>PlayStation 5 with&nbsp;PlayStation Plus Early Access – October 29 at 03:00am GMT – October 31 at 02:59am GMT</li>
<li>PS5 (Non-PlayStation Plus), Xbox Series X|S and PC via Steam – November 1 at 03:00am GMT – November 4 at 01:59am GMT</li>
</ul>
<p>PS Plus and Xbox Game Pass subscriptions are not required for the wider open beta from 1st November, but will be for the full game next year.</p>

<p>The open beta test will feature three parts: the complete character creation tool (which you can transfer to the full game), a Story Trial from the opening of the game with tutorials and a Chatacabra hunt, and the free-roaming Doshaguma Hunt where you can pursue the Doshaguma pack or explore the Windward Plains.</p>
<p>It will feature full cross-play between all platforms, and take part will award players with a bonus pendant to decorate their weapons or Seikret mount in the full game.</p>
<p>We’ve already tried out this content with our hand on time in early September. Check out our preview!</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/10/monster-hunter-wilds-preview-a-seikret-ride-on-the-wild-side/">Monster Hunter Wilds Preview – A Seikret ride on the wild side</a></h2>
<p>And then for the new gameplay reveals and details from the stream. Capcom dipped a toe in to the Oilwell Basin, &nbsp;named after the boiling oil wells that feature in this region. These can cause firestorms during periods known as Firespring, making the world dangerous in its own right!</p>
<p>Here the newly revealed Brute Wyvern Rompopolo (not as cute as it sounds) is on the prowl, expelling toxic gas to weaken prey, both from its mouth and by injecting gas into the tar on the ground. Lovely. Ajarakan also live here, the two species often vying for terrirory. The Ajarakan is a fanged beast with a thick shell to cover itself in high temperature armour.</p>
<p>Within this region, you’ll be able to visit the village of Azuz, which features a massive forge at its centre, and where you’ll hear tale of the Black Flame that lies beneath the basin.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> is set for a 28th February 2025 release date, the long-awaited monster hunting sequel coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-day-before-developers-fntastic-scrap-failed-kickstarter-announces-a-new-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It comes as no surprise <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-day-before-team-fntastic-are-back-asking-for-15k-to-develop-new-game/">that the Kickstarter</a> that Fntastic put out failed. The developers behind The Day Before came back with a statement, talking about how they deserved a second chance and that their game Escape Factory would be just that. However, the Kickstarter didn't go according to plan, and they decided to postpone any work on Escape Factory and cancel the Kickstarter. Luckily, it means those who donated to Kickstarter will be able to get their money back. It's been specified that no funds have been collected, so those who donated don't need to panic about what happens next.</p>
<p>However, that isn't all for The Day Before developers, as they are surprisingly persistent. Despite the fact that their return wasn't accepted with open arms, they are announcing that they are developing a new game. This title is an "action-horror prop hunt," similar to Propnight, mostly likely. Propnight was one of their more popular titles and was well-received by audiences who played it. However, they lost the rights to that game and are now working on making their very own prop hunt game called Items.</p>
<p>Fntastic said that the community was asking for a prop hunt game, so this time, they are working on delivering exactly that. Considering that they had a Kickstarter to try and be able to make Escape Factory, it begs the question of whether or not they will now boot up one for this game. In the announcement for Items, they've stated that the development of the game will "require significant resources," and as a result, they will be releasing mobile games parallel to the development of Items to ensure that they can support the progress of the prop hunt game.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/FntasticHQ/status/1848982250316304734" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their statement on X</a>, they also mentioned that they "may launch a new Kickstarter campaign or explore other options for release." While they sound optimistic and rather hopeful about their upcoming project, it doesn't mean that it is being well-received by the gaming audience. It's going to be hard for Fntastic to build up any sense of trust with their audience after what happened with The Day Before, and rely heavily on the community to fund their projects that may never even come to light.</p>
<p>Whether or not Items takes off and manages to become a full-fledged game remains to be seen, and we're just going to have to sit back and watch this unfold.</p>

            <p>
The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> open beta will launch next week, Capcom have announced. It’ll be live on Steam from 31st October to 3rd November 2024, allowing the more impatient Capcommandoes amongst us to get a taste of the new setting and combat mechanics ahead of the game’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-releases-28th-feb-2025-which-gives-modders-enough-time-to-silence-the-uncanny-talking-palicos">full release in February next year</a>.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
As detailed <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-us/obt/">on the official site</a>, the beta includes the game's character creator and a couple of hunts. The first hunt is a story trial mode, in which you get to watch the opening cutscene, complete some tutorials, and hunt a Chatacabra. The second is a Doshaguma hunt.</p>
<p>I’m not acquainted with the Chatacabra – a cursory wiki inspection reveals it to be a frog made of boulders - but I’m sadly familiar with the Doshaguma. It’s the huge woofy bovine creature they ritually murdered at Summer Games Fest, so that they could show us all the new terrain elements in action. That Capcom presenter is the real monster here, and so are you if you try do anything to the Doshaguma except give it a nice gentle pat on its big floppy head.
</p>
<p>
In the event that you accidentally pat the Doshaguma’s head with your greatsword, causing it to sit on you with extreme prejudice, 1) that’s what you deserve, you filthy trouser-crafting carnist, and 2) you can summon up to three other hunters to help using SOS flares. The beta will include NPC bots but also supports multiplayer. Last but not least, it’ll allow you to ride about a large desert map on your Seikret – think Chocobo, but toothier - and switch between two different weapons on the fly.
</p><p>
The beta isn’t just a disposable prelude: you’ll be able to import your custom character and accompanying Palico (read: prancing cat minion) to the full game. Which, going by what I saw of it at SGF, should be pretty good fun, given the customary Monster Hunting prerequisites of a heart blacker than pitch and a frankly unreasonable urge to turn everything into pants. You can read my full preview <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rip-alpha-doshaguma-the-doomed-dragonfighting-guinea-pig-of-my-monster-hunter-wilds-demo">here</a>.

It is masterful in its creation of a cursed ship, a missing crew, and the unwitting insurance investigator who gets to the bottom of its compelling mystery. <em><strong>Return of the Obra Dinn </strong></em><strong>is also crucially discounted to $13.39 until November 1 on Steam, PlayStation, and the Nintendo Switch.</strong> It’s a game best enjoyed over a few nights while you’re huddled under some blankets in the dark, making it a perfect game to enjoy as Hallloween draws closer.</p><p>In <em>Obra Dinn</em>, you are cast as an investigator sent to unravel the mystery of the titular ship, which has unceremoniously appeared in the harbor after having been believed to be missing. Except when it turns up at port, the Obra Dinn is missing every member of its crew, and shows signs of having been through hell to get there. With a ledger that accounts for everyone that should’ve been on the ship, you begin poking and prodding at corpses on the vessel in order to discover the fate of everyone aboard, as well as that of its missing goods.</p><p>In order to help piece things together, you use a pocket watch that the game refers to as a Memento Mortem. When opened, the world gets enveloped in a void that comes from within the watch, transporting the player to the moment of the corpse’s death. These frozen scenes are the bulk of <em>Obra Dinn</em>, and a key component in how utterly cool the game is. Once you’re dropped into them, these immaculately choreographed scenes welcome you to begin connecting names to faces thanks to morsels of dialogue and situational awareness. The game is one big logic puzzle where you are literally just trying to deduce who died and how, but the greater mystery and story that unfolds as you piece that together is nothing short of epic.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="2435db98e7be98e71a014e7c83e20c58" data-recommend-id="image://2435db98e7be98e71a014e7c83e20c58" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Return of the Obra Dinn, showing the Memento Mortem pocket watch as well as two figures in a bloody brawl in the middle of a frozen scene." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Return of the Obra Dinn, showing the Memento Mortem pocket watch as well as two figures in a bloody brawl in the middle of a frozen scene." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lucas Pope</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2435db98e7be98e71a014e7c83e20c58" data-recommend-id="image://2435db98e7be98e71a014e7c83e20c58" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Return of the Obra Dinn, showing the Memento Mortem pocket watch as well as two figures in a bloody brawl in the middle of a frozen scene." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Words cannot express how much joy I got out of <em>just </em>that. At first, everyone but the captain of the ship is a mystery to you and little more than a name in a book. But over the course of the story, certain characters step up and become more than just another crew member. Even if they aren’t the primary focus of the scene, there are plenty of folks in <em>Obra Dinn </em>who largely operate in the background, and studying them and their motivations is just as compelling as the central mystery. At times, the two are even intrinsically linked, and it can pay off to be particularly studious, especially when it comes to making breakthroughs in the late-game stretch. I spent an entire holiday guffawing at the actions that some characters took and cheering on the breaks in the case that I made by following certain folks closely.</p><p>Much like this year’s wonderfully weird <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-indie-pc-switch-review-1851476967&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-indie-pc-switch-review-1851476967"><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em></a></span>, <em>Obra Dinn </em>is a big-ass puzzle box telling a swashbuckling tragedy in an arresting style. <em>Obra Dinn </em>is a fully 3D game that invites you to walk all across the derelict ship, but it’s presented in 1-bit-style graphics. The monochrome style of older PC games is alive and well in <em>Obra Dinn</em>, and the distinct look gives this otherwise deceptively cutting-edge title a vintage feel.</p><p>If you’re looking for a game that welds classic and modern adventure games into a succinct and stylish package, you can’t go wrong with <em>Return of the Obra Dinn. </em>It’s got a simple but electrifying premise, and it isn’t long before it gets its claws into you. Deciphering who’s who on such a large ship can feel like a daunting task, but once you get to know a handful of characters, the game really comes alive, and before you know it, you’ll be ripping through it. My advice: savor it as much as you can by spreading it out over the week. Give yourself the time and space to ponder the faces and words of this enigmatic crew and really live on board the Obra Dinn. By the time you’re done, you’ll almost have wished you were aboard for its final, cursed voyage. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A blend of old-school and modern design, the <em>RE2</em> remake thrills and terrifies at every corner and will make a horror fan out of you in no time.</p></div><div><p>If you are a horror aficionado who’s seen every movie there is then <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-quarry-guide-until-dawn-horror-video-game-1849055831&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-quarry-guide-until-dawn-horror-video-game-1849055831"><em>The Quarry</em></a></span> might be perfect for you. From developer Supermassive Games, <em>The Quarry</em> is pure ‘80s B movie goodness. You (and a group of friends in multiplayer mode) get to control a handful of camp counselors trying to stay alive over the night when attacked by mysterious creatures. The best part of <em>The Quarry</em> is that you can turn it into the biggest gore fest ever by purposefully making bad decisions, which is always fun.</p></div><div><p>What could be more fun than running around trying to kill your friends (in a video game)? Not much. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dead-by-daylight-dungeons-and-dragons-castlevania-dlc-1851477094&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dead-by-daylight-dungeons-and-dragons-castlevania-dlc-1851477094"><em>Dead by Daylight</em></a></span> is perfect for a night in with friends (lights off, of course). The asymmetrical multiplayer game lets you live out your horror movie dreams and prove that you could actually escape the crazed killer, or be the best killer in the group.</p></div><div><p>Resident Evil 4 is likely the popular pick for the best <em>Resident Evil</em> game. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891"><em>RE4</em></a></span><em> </em>got the remake treatment last year and the seminal action-horror title still holds up incredibly well, probably because most modern action games are inspired by it. This is the franchise at its best. It has camp, action, horror, and hotties (just look at Leon and Ada).</p></div><div><p>Not only one of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-horror-games-ps5-xbox-steam-pc-silent-hill-2-1851671021&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-horror-games-ps5-xbox-steam-pc-silent-hill-2-1851671021">best horror games</a></span> in the past decade, but also an amazing sequel to one of the best horror movies ever made. Taking place after the events of Ridley Scott’s <em>Alien</em>, <em>Isolation </em>expertly captures the helplessness that film’s titular monster instills in its victims. For the majority of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-the-i-cant-believe-i-waited-seven-year-1846817646&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alien-isolation-the-i-cant-believe-i-waited-seven-year-1846817646"><em>Isolation</em></a></span>, you will not have any way to fight back against the monster, only hide and hope for the best. It’s utterly horrifying in ways few games are.</p></div><div><p>For something a bit more unique, try out this amazing 2023 indie. Instead of running from monsters, you take on the role of a radio DJ fielding calls from listeners being hunted by a serial killer. In<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/killer-frequency-best-survival-horror-game-steam-fnaf-1850410187&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/killer-frequency-best-survival-horror-game-steam-fnaf-1850410187"><em>Killer Frequency</em></a></span>, rescuing these callers turns into unique puzzles you can only solve through finding useful information in your small recording studio or calling phone numbers. It plays like a single-player version of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/a-bomb-defusing-video-game-tested-my-relationship-1736320189&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/a-bomb-defusing-video-game-tested-my-relationship-1736320189"><em>Keep Talking And Nobody Explodes</em></a></span> and infuses the horror elements with a dose of ‘80s camp.</p></div><div><p>In 2014, <em>Resident Evil</em> was a series that had leaned into action over its survival horror roots. Thankfully series creator Shinji Mikami delivered a classic take on the genre with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-evil-within-the-kotaku-review-1649303587&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-evil-within-the-kotaku-review-1649303587"><em>The Evil Within</em></a></span>. Great gunplay and a truly terrifying atmosphere make this one of the best <em>Resident Evil</em> games there is, even if it doesn’t bear the franchise’s name.</p></div><div><p>While the <em>Pinocchio</em> Soulsike isn’t strictly a horror game, the gothic vibes are still plenty spooky. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lies-of-p-review-pinocchio-soulslike-bloodborne-sekiro-1850857903&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lies-of-p-review-pinocchio-soulslike-bloodborne-sekiro-1850857903"><em>Lies of P</em></a></span> is a fantastic iteration of the <em>Dark Souls</em> formula that emphasizes movement and discovering your own playstyle. Come for fantastic gameplay and stay for a gripping retelling of the classic fairy tale that is better than it has any right to be.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zero-sievert-is-%E2%80%98graduating%E2%80%99-into-a-1-0-release-today.1017480/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/zero-sievert-graduation-1-0-release/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Zero Sievert, originally released in early access two years ago, is launching as a full, 1.0 product <strong>today</strong>. This exciting news comes directly from CABO Studio and Modern Wolf, who confirmed a lineup of developments coming to the 1.0 release of Zero Sievert. This is one of my favourite extraction shooter titles, simply because it’s so unique.</p>



<p>If you’ve never played Zero Sievert, read on to learn about the 1.0 release and why you should give it a shot.</p>



<hr>







<p>Zero Sievert is a charming game marketed as a ‘top-down survival extraction shooter’, and as a single-player game, it ticks so many boxes for me as a player. When you start playing Zero Sievert, you’re walked through the base mechanics and then thrown into a harsh and unwelcoming world ravaged by mutated creates and nuclear fallout.</p>



<p>Every time you load into a map, you’ll be exploring something procedurally generated, which keeps things fresh and unpredictable. From wildlife and raiders to horrifying mutant creatures, you’ll need to be on your toes if you’re going to get in, loot up, and get out with your life intact.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>Following the 1.0 release of Zero Sievert, players will be able to access an ‘endgame zone’ of the Zakov City map, which allows them to finally complete the story. The overall gameplay loop has been polished, and community-led improvements have been applied across the board.</p>



<p>In a statement, the lead developer at CABO Studio, Luca Carbonera, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are beyond excited to finally bring ZERO Sievert out of Early Access into the hands of our players. This Early Access period has given us a fantastic opportunity to really listen to everyone’s comments and opinions and make some great changes. We’re now super proud of where we have the game. Existing fans will love the 1.0 update, and we hope to see new faces drop into Zakov!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Zero Sievert can be purchased exclusively on Steam for $24.99, which is a small price to pay for infinite replayability. </p>

On Monday, a whistleblower had <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1g95e9o/rumor_the_wolf_among_us_2_facing_major/" rel="nofollow ">claimed on Reddit</a> that the project was at risk of being shelved due to financial difficulties and internal pressure.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced that you'll get a chance to try out&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>via an open beta that's being held at the start of November, and if you're a PlayStation Plus member, your chance will come even earlier.</p>
<p>During today's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>showcase, we got to see some of the monsters and geographical features of the Oilwell Basin ecosystem, including a brand new and terrifying-looking monster known as the Black Flame.</p>
<p>Other monsters we got a glimpse of include the bulbous Rompopolo, which often finds itself embroiled in territorial struggles with the fanged and thick-shelled Ajarakan. You'll be able to encounter both of these monsters in the Oilwell Basin.</p>

<p>It'll be available across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, but if you're subscribed to PlayStation Plus, you can enjoy an early access test period, which runs from October 29th at 3am GMT until October 31st at around the same time.</p>
<p>According to Capcom, the open beta will consist of three parts: character creation, the opening part of the game's story, and an open hunt for the Doshaguma, which will also let you explore the Windward Plains area.</p>
<p>You can either experience the latter two parts solo, enlist the help of NPC hunters, or team up with players online during the open beta.</p>

<p>Participating in this open beta will net you a special Pendant to decorate your weapons or mount, and you'll also get a "helpful item pack", although Capcom doesn't say what that pack will contain.</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>is set to launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date">February 28th</a>.

Velvet 89 is a free hidden object game that tells the story of communist Czechoslovakia's "Velvet Revolution" in 1989, which brought an end to 41 years of one-party rule and led to the founding of a parliamentary republic. The game released earlier this month, and you can find it on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3133340/Velvet_89/">Steam</a>, iOS and Android. I know nothing about the Velvet Revolution, but I do have some quick thoughts on the use of a format I associate with Where's Wally to capture a process of extraordinary political change.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Velvet 89 is the work of Charles Games, creators of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-flare-path-czechs-and-choppers">Attentat 1942</a>. It explores five protests in four cities, moving from "cautious ecology-themed protests" to the "moments before police brutally attacked a peaceful demonstration". Each chapter is introduced with a mix of captions and archive footage, and consists of a zoomable view of the crowd, rendered in "a style reminiscent of paper cut-outs". There's some gentle animation and an enveloping burble of background noise, but the scene is overall static.
</p>
<p>
The first thing I noticed is that everybody is looking up at the viewer, as though you were some local governor who has appeared on a balcony to address the citizens. It's interestingly eerie. Also eerie: nobody has a face. I'm not sure how I feel about this, but Velvet 89 seems to be trying for a balance of connection and impersonality, rediscovering individuals while keeping the emphasis on the collective and the community.
</p>
<p>
In each chapter you must find a small number of individuals and hear their stories. You can track them down by way of the portraits along the bottom: click on them, and you'll be given a hint such as (paraphrasing) "she came as soon as she'd picked her daughter up from school" or "he stepped back from the advancing police line". Find that person, and you can click on them to zoom in further and hear their reasons for joining the march. Again, there's a slight sense of foreboding here. If the zoomed-out view suggests a mayor on a balcony, zooming in calls to mind a surveillance operative working their way down a list of names.
</p><p>
The stories give you a sense of the growing solidarity between different generations and demographics - punk rockers, students, elderly dog-walkers, even the cops. The writing is didactic but not deflatingly so. It's based on testimonies gathered by the Czech project Stories of Injustice. As the press release explains, it seeks to show "how the revolution gained momentum, from the border regions onto the squares of Prague and further". 
</p>
<p>
Disquieting undertones aside, I like the staggered intimacy of the game's hidden object structure. The hints break up the monolithic facelessness of the crowd, guiding you into somebody's story in a simple but effective way. I'm not sure I 'trust' the experience, however, inasmuch as it edits out the movement of bodies during protest marches, the way the mood surges and falls away, and the perilous shifting proximity between protestors and police. Still, I'm quite compelled by the game. It makes me want to write something longer about the political and historical framing of hidden object experiences at large. I'd be interested to read your thoughts. Again, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3133340/Velvet_89/">you can download Velvet 89 for free on Steam</a>.

Some people hate clowns. Some are troubled by the unknown of a dark space under the bed. And some (my old flatmate) will run away if a wooden spoon gets too close to brushing against their skin. The same broad range of fears can be found in video games as well. Sure, there are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/the-last-of-us-part-2-how-naughty-dog-created-its-most-terrifying-monster-art-of-the-level">jumpy moments in The Last of Us Part 2</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/bloodborne/Old_Yharnam">Bloodborne’s Yharnam</a> is dressed to the nines in gothic horror, but here we’re looking at those <em>entirely</em> scary experiences – those games that chill us to the core and are purely horrific, yet brilliant. With an emphasis placed on what we find the scariest, here are the 25 best horror games of all time. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 25 Best Horror Video Games Ever</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong></strong></h2><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>25.

With a library of over 20 developed and published games, there’s no shortage of gory and intense homages to the era of the VHS or PS1 to choose from, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/stay-out-of-the-house">Stay Out of the House</a> is the standout entry of the one-man studio’s work. A mix of immersive sim and survival horror, you’re put to the test as you attempt to escape the disgusting lair of a cannibal butcher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You have three days to plan your escape: will you scramble for a weapon?; set the serial killer’s traps against him?; or maybe help other survivors? All of these are viable options but unfortunately for you, the killer will adapt to all of them, barricading once-unlocked rooms, hiding items, and more, all to offer you an unforgettable CRT-filtered nightmare.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>24. Slender: The Eight Pages</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/18/24-slender-the-eight-pages-1729264346513.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>Who knew that in 2012 a simple sentence like “<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/slender/Pages">Collect all 8 pages</a>” would leave such a lasting imprint on the imagination of all those who read it?</p><p>Inspired by the success of its creepypasta’s namesake, Slender: The Eight Pages arms you with just a flashlight and tasks you with sneaking through a park at night to collect a series of increasingly creepy notes. Sounds easy, until you realise you need to stay one step ahead of the “Slender Man” – <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/slenderman-explained">a tall, faceless, tuxedo-wearing terror</a> that stalks you throughout the ten or so minutes it’ll (hopefully) take you to escape. It’s simple but effective, and its stalking threat stays with you far longer than it takes to play.</p></div><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>23. The Evil Within</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/18/23-the-evil-within-1729264346513.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami’s return to survival horror came in 2014 with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/16/the-evil-within-review">The Evil Within</a>, and its warped world didn’t disappoint. The Evil Within offers challenging gameplay, limited resources, an engaging story, and brilliantly horrific enemy design – The Keeper, Laura, Zehn, and Neun, to name just a few that have haunted one or two of our nightmares since.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This wickedly creative, tense, and yes, tough game does not suffer fools gladly, yet you’d be an even greater one not to give it a chance. We may have seen that bleeding game over the screen a few more times than we’d like, but it never made us not want to jump straight back in. That is the definition of great survival horror.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/16/the-evil-within-review">See our review of The Evil Within</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>22.

Combining survival horror action with detective work, it builds a great sense of atmosphere that always makes you feel on edge and uncomfortable, and that's the best part about it. Even if you're squeamish, we recommend you play this alone at night with all the lights off, even if it’s just once, to fully appreciate just how frightening it really is. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>21. Manhunt</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/18/21-manhunt-1729264346512.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">While many games on this list have you playing an unwilling victim of horrors, Manhunt stands out by making you the architect (albeit under slight duress) of the terror. Hot on the heels of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-story-behind-grand-theft-auto-iiis-ground-breaking-radio-station-chatterbox-fm">worldwide success of Grand Theft Auto 3</a> and Vice City, Rockstar surprised the world by choosing to take its controversial games to the next level. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">James Earl Cash, a criminal sentenced to death row for crimes too heinous to mention, is given a second chance in the form of a “starring” role in a mysterious director’s snuff film. Bloody, violent, and questionably sick, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/11/18/manhunt-2">Manhunt is M-rated for a reason</a>, and that’s largely because of its graphic depictions of murder. Death by crowbar to the face, wire chokes, and machete hackings are just some of the gruesome things you’ll see.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You may have seen this kind of thing in movies, anime, and the like, but no video game at that point (or arguably since) had gone as far as Rockstar's Manhunt.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2003/11/18/manhunt-2">See our review for Manhunt.</a></p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>20.

That’s perfectly understandable, Inside has one of the finest finales of any game of the past 15 years. But the focus on those final minutes means attention is drawn away from the real treat that’s the three or four hours prior.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Inside is a side-scroller dripping with an oppressive, unsettling atmosphere. Playing as a young boy in a world filled with ever-increasing danger, you must solve elegantly designed puzzles and escape all sorts of horrors as you push onward. It’s the fear of the  unknown that keeps tensions high. As you gain the ability to control others and put them to work in the game’s best conundrums, Inside’s incredible art direction really comes alive, showcasing a dark, twisted world where humanity has been reduced to faceless shadows of their former selves. It’s unforgettable stuff. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/inside-review">See our review for Inside.</a> </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>19.

This includes Sad Square Studios’ first psychological horror, Visage. Set in the 1980s, you play Dwayne Anderson, a resident of a large home tormented by the supernatural, as he tries to find a way out and learn more about what is causing the paranormal activity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you explore the dark and eerily silent house, entities taunt you by breaking light bulbs, turning on and off lights, and slamming doors. This constant barrage of sensory terror, combined with the pressure to maintain Dwayne’s sanity, makes Visage one of the more challenging horror games released in recent years. It’s very much trial-and-error, but your patience is rewarded with a fascinating story and plenty of jump scares. While it may not be <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/how-pt-became-a-modern-urban-legend">Silent Hills</a>, the legacy of Konami’s unreleased game courses through the veins of Visage while also successfully establishing its own identity.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>18. Phasmophobia</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/18/18-phasmophobia-1729264346512.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Phasmophobia came onto the scene like a bat out of hell. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/phasmophobia-first-time-ghost-hunting-goes-terribly-wrong">Four players join together as amateur ghost hunters</a>, armed with tools like night-vision cameras, holy water, and radios. Wander through haunted homes and abandoned prisons, calling out for spirits from the beyond, as you gather clues in an attempt to successfully identify what kind of ghost is haunting your location.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the clock ticks the chances of running into a ghost increase, and so does the danger. Nothing beats that moment when you suddenly see your friend twist and contort after being caught by one of Phasmophobia’s many evil spirits, as you desperately scramble to the exit for a hasty escape. As scary as it is, it also delivers laughs in equal measure, eliciting those involuntary emotions only horror and comedy can provide.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>17. Dead by Daylight</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/18/17-dead-by-daylight-1729264346512.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-by-daylight-review">Dead By Daylight </a>launched in 2016 as a meagre but well-meaning asymmetrical slasher horror game where various bumbling teenagers avoided gnarly eviscerations from archetypal slasher movie villains. By 2021, it had become the Super Smash Bros. of horror games. Bringing in iconic killer characters from the movies like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/26/freddy-krueger-joining-multiplayer-slasher-dead-by-daylight">Freddy Kreuger</a> and Michael Myers to legendary horror game villains like Resident Evil’s Nemesis and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-by-daylight-silent-hill-pyramid-head-heather-mason-dlc">Silent Hill’s Pyramid Head</a>, Dead By Daylight continues to evolve on its premise, routinely adding new characters, features, and more to its rock-solid foundation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing remains constant, though: it’s just as fun to play the game as a group of seemingly helpless survivors in one round as it is to play as a huge, powerful, horror movie monster in the next. It’s deservedly established itself as the best in its field.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-by-daylight-review">See our review for Dead By Daylight.</a></p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>16.

Its game world – the Blackwood Mountain lodge – is relatively small, but developer Supermassive made it as entertainingly hostile as possible. This bitter landscape is captured with a keen eye on isolation, and Until Dawn does a great job of encouraging the sense that you’re always being watched as the teens split off from one another both physically and emotionally.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-2024-review">Until Dawn is a gleefully cheesy homage to slasher movies</a>, set in a world built by a developer who clearly adores the genre. Its (often replicated) robust choice-and-consequence system was been genre-defining and allows players to truly experiment with the gruesome horrors hidden beneath its corny surface.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/24/until-dawn-review">See our review for Until Dawn.</a></p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>15. Alan Wake 2</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/18/15-alan-wake-2-1729264346512.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-2-the-movies-and-tv-shows-that-inspired-remedys-survival-horror-ign-first">Taking cues from the likes of David Lynch, Stephen King, and David Fincher</a>, Alan Wake 2 is a deeply cinematic dive into the surreal. It’s a game of two halves and follows the intertwined journeys of titular writer Alan Wake and FBI agent Saga Anderson. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/alan-wake-2/Initiation_1:_Talk_Show_(Alan)_Walkthrough">In Alan’s chapters</a>, you’ll blast ghostly figures and solve Resident Evil-esque puzzles in a nightmare version of New York City. But the further you venture, the stranger things get; you’ll write new pathways through reality, witness a bizarre Finnish horror movie, endure an anxiety-inducing chat show, and take part in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/alan-wake-2-walkthrough-initiation-4">the best rock opera you’ve ever gunned your way through.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things are more grounded but similarly mechanically fascinating when taking control of Saga. Her chapters see the story transform into a blend of Hannibal and Zodiac, with Silent Hill-like exploration and combat sitting neatly next to police procedural work. As you investigate a chilling chain of ritual murders, you’ll need to arrange clues on your evidence board and drill deeper into the minds of your many suspects. This all adds up to a deeply ambitious, frequently disturbing experience, but one that’s never afraid of derailing the tension to deliver an unexpected comedy punchline.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alan-wake-ii-review">See our review for Alan Wake 2.</a></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>14.

But equally scary classic that’s less well known is Forbidden Siren 2. The story follows a group of stranded survivors on a remote Japanese island.

The first in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-games-in-order">long-running (and extremely successful) series</a> arrived in 1996, letting players explore the zombie-infested, puzzle-riddled Spencer Mansion, and it’s fair to say the survival horror genre hasn’t looked back since.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although primitive by today’s standards, Resident Evil set the mould for everything that followed. The isolation, the limited resources, the relentless sense of dread, and jump scares… These are all things Resident Evil pioneered in video games, and without it the survival horror genre simply wouldn’t exist. Yes, Clock Tower outlined the blueprint, but Resident Evil masterfully executed the ideas and propelled survival horror to the masses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the formula has since been regularly improved upon and the original is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/every-ign-resident-evil-review">arguably weaker than most of its sequels</a>.

It’s rare to have a game series that can cater to both young and adult horror fans, but it’s mostly because it features a thing we can all agree on: animatronic animals are <em>terrifying</em>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>9.

This random lottery keeps things unpredictable even if you’ve played the map in question 70 times already. Maybe it’ll surprise you with an unexpected Boomer, which explodes into a fountain of green goo that baits other infected.

On paper, it’s a concept not easily translated into video game form, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/in-defence-of-alien-isolation">developer Creative Assembly absolutely nailed it with Alien: Isolation.</a> Eschewing pulse rifles, gung-ho Colonial Marines, and gallons of acid blood in favour of stealth, creative solutions, and raw terror, Alien: Isolation demands that you outwit a single, indestructible xenomorph that stalks you around the sprawling Sevastopol space station.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alien: Isolation is a first-class licensed game thanks to its unrivalled attention to detail when it comes to replicating the film’s universe; everything from computer interfaces and poster fonts to lighting and sound effects are authentic to the original movie’s visual style.

Dead Space personifies our fear of the unknown and graphically illustrates the deep space horrors we’d only ever<em> really</em> seen in the movies. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Necromorphs, the zombies of the series, are the epitome of terror and their gruesome designs and unpredictable nature made them a formidable foe. And unlike horror game enemies, a bullet to the brain won’t put them down so you need to learn the art of dismemberment instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dead Space forces you to unlearn familiar habits then, and it made you feel vulnerable despite being armed to the teeth.

But the playable teaser – hence the name P.T. – is one of the scariest games ever made and as such, deserves recognition.</p><div data-cy="paragraph"><p>The result of a cross-industry, once-in-a-console-generation collaboration between acclaimed creators Hideo Kojima and Guillermo del Toro, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/12/gamescom-2014-pt-announced-for-playstation-demo-available-now">P.T. was revealed via a nondescript teaser at Gamescom 2014</a>, followed by an otherwise quiet release on the PlayStation Store. Hours later, the enigma was solved, and P.T. was revealed to be Silent Hills. But despite the code being cracked, the solution wasn’t entirely clear and P.T. would go on to become an obsession for players across the internet. Twitter, Reddit, Twitch, YouTube, NeoGAF, and other forums all attempted to piece together exactly how to reach its true ending.</p><p>Then there was the game itself, which was as terrifying as its reveal was fascinating. P.T. was set in a single, beautifully rendered looping hallway. Turning a corner remained as scary the first time as it was on the fifteenth. The subtle changes to the environment on each loop preyed on players' expectations of familiarity and added disturbing life to a seemingly restricted play area. Of course, Silent Hills would never come to fruition with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/27/silent-hills-has-been-officially-cancelled">Konami officially cancelling the project</a> a day after P.T. was removed from the PS Store.

With gameplay mechanics that helped spur a rebirth of the survival horror genre that had drifted into action-game territory, modern horror games are indebted to Dark Descent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starting with the protagonist, Daniel, waking up alone in the dark castle of Brennenburg, he has no memory of how he got there, hence the name. As he explores his surroundings he realizes there’s a shadow stalking him, and wandering about the castle are other creatures that will give chase if they spot you. This wouldn’t be a huge problem if you could fight back, but the thing is, you just can’t. Your only defence is to run and often hide in the dark – a stark contrast to more action-oriented horror games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2009/03/07/resident-evil-5-review-2">Resident Evil 5 which had come out the year before</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But here’s the kicker: stay in the dark too long and you’ll lose your mind.

You’ll need to balance the game’s use of light to see what the hell you’re even doing with hiding in the darkness to avoid monsters, the same darkness that is slowly driving you insane.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amnesia’s sequels and follow-ups all build upon The Dark Descent’s mechanics in smart ways, and other developers have taken notice, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/22/resident-evil-7-was-originally-much-more-like-resident-evil-6">Resident Evil 7’s decision to switch to a first-person perspective</a> owing a lot to Amnesia’s success. The Dark Descent still holds up today, even if the controls and interface are a little rough on consoles, so if you’re in the mood to sit in the dark for 10 hours, take a trip to Brennenburg.

The adventures of Leon and Claire in Raccoon City not only became a benchmark for Resident Evil but for the genre as a whole (until our next entry came along a few years later). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In every way that 1998’s Resident Evil 2 improved on its predecessor, the remake also replicated in kind. It’s a prime example of how to take an older game and reanimate it for a new generation of players.

The mounting feeling that you are fleeing from an inescapable mistake, all leading up to the haunting revelation at the end and a devastating fight against one of video gaming’s most menacing antagonists, makes <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-is-utterly-miserable-and-thats-why-its-great">Silent Hill 2 the scariest game of all time.</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/09/25/silent-hill-2-2">The original Silent Hill 2</a> is perhaps the bleakest, most sombre game ever made and Bloober Team has successfully recreated its miserable magic, ensuring the remake is a deeply effective descent into genuinely uncomfortable terror. With the 2024 remake, Team Silent’s nightmarish vision is preserved. It’s a modern reminder not just of an era where Konami was a master of survival horror, but also of the significant power of Silent Hill 2’s unrelenting misery. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s just something about that PS2 version, though, that keeps us coming back to its slightly pixelated fog and uniquely haunting atmosphere.

A new planet—the largest in <em>Astroneer</em>—awaits, complete with new biomes, technology, gameplay features and the game’s first true villain. </p><p>But that’s not all, “Glitchwalkers” will also mark the long-requested return of Storms in both the expansion and the base game. Glitched Storms have appeared in the solar system, and players will have to prevent themselves from getting hacked by these digital tempests to give themselves any chance of succeeding in their mission.</p><p>Players seeking new challenges are in for a treat with the introduction of Lyn, a disgruntled member of the ESS Elysium crew who has taken to tinkering with the <em>Astroneer</em> Training Program’s (ATP) code. Players must work with the Elysium’s Head of Maintenance, Frank, to stop Lyn and her nefarious plans before she dismantles the ATP from the inside.</p><p>“Glitchwalkers” will transport players to Aeoluz, an enormous new planet born in a glitched solar system, where they’ll be tasked with counter-hacking Lyn and breaking firewalls to return the ATP to normal.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Aeoluz plays host to a number of new surface and cave biomes for players to explore, while a new tech tree and modules offer up new ways to progress and unlock both new and old technology.</p><p>“Glitchwalkers” will expand <em>Astroneer</em>‘s universe while maintaining all of the crafting, building and exploration that existing Astroneers know and love. For players unprepared to leap into the unknown, there will also be a free companion update to the base game that introduces new gameplay, quality-of-life improvements and bug fixes.</p></blockquote><p><em>Astroneer</em> is available now for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/361420/ASTRONEER/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>DLC “Glitchwalkers” Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Astroneer - DLC &quot;Glitchwalkers&quot; Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6DaapCPjAl0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/green-yuri-nana-shojo-girls-love<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In my 27 years on God’s green earth, I have never encountered a more soul-crushing recreational experience than discovering a revolutionary manga, only to follow its wondrous narrative to the end of its rainbow and find no conclusion. I’m once bitten with the late, great Kentaro Miura’s <em>Berserk</em>, twice shy with Takehiko Inoue’s <em>Vagabond</em>, and irreparably fucked up from Ai Yazawa’s best-selling shojo manga, <a href="https://www.viz.com/nana" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Nana</em></a>, being <a href="https://kotaku.com/hunter-x-hunter-berserk-nana-vagabond-hiatus-manga-1849184744" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suspended in an indefinite hiatus</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>After years of resigning myself to a 'crab in a barrel' existence, plunging friends and strangers alike into the depths of <em>Nana</em>'s<em> </em>devastating 15-year-long cliffhanger like a siren's call to a weary sailor, I've lucked upon novel escape from mutually assured destruction: putting folks onto Yen Press’ brand new “Green Yuri” manga. This manga not only stands as the closest spiritual successor to <em>Nana</em>, it also ventures where Ai Yazawa's masterpiece never tread: Letting its girls be in lesbians with each other.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Nana Official Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xXbJzu7zF8E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><h3><em>Nana </em>will break you (like a rose)</h3><p><em>Nana</em>'s elevator pitch is pretty straightforward. It centers on two disparate women named Nana, who become roommates in Tokyo, develop a close friendship, and e<a href="https://www.fanbyte.com/legacy/nana-teaches-readers-how-to-mourn-a-friendship" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ventually drift apart as they chase their dreams</a>. While the effervescent and naïve Nana Komatsu and the cynical punk rockstar vocalist Nana Osaki personify the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/black-and-pink-meme-houses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">black and pink houses meme</a>, they both deeply long to be loved. While Komatsu pursues love through comfort from people—deserving or otherwise—Osaki safeguards attachments with a chosen few by confining them to her orbit. Despite inevitably winding up in hetero relationships, Osaki and Komatsu frequently reminisce about their platonic love.&nbsp;</p><p>Outside of the manga, <em>Nana</em>’s success spun off into an anime adaptation by <em>Trigun </em>and <em>Death Note</em> animation studio Madhouse and two criminally underappreciated (and hard to find by legal means) live action movie adaptations. <em>Nana</em>’s impact expands beyond anime and manga by having a cultural cache in the fashion world thanks to Yazawa kitting out its cast in Viviene Westwood’s lavish clothes and accessories. The <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thewestwoodarchives?igsh=YXZ2Y2J3NG5xNnE3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vivian Westwood Archives Instagram account</a> constantly posts <em>Nana </em>anime<em> </em>screenshots and manga panels while chronicling the fashion icon’s legacy.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">no way i just saw someone say that nana and hachi give off “platonic bestie” vibes and we’re forcing “romantic love” onto them im… ahhh yes platonic love  <a href="https://t.co/qMemCIdJyM">pic.twitter.com/qMemCIdJyM</a></p>— avary 🤍 (@kyoruyeye) <a href="https://twitter.com/kyoruyeye/status/1693619900672295294?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2023</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>As many a <em>Nana </em>fan will protest, Yazawa’s magnum opus would have been shorter <a href="https://x.com/_forbisexuals/status/1846142339426681261" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had the two hooked up</a>. Lord knows them kissing, regularly sharing a bed and bathing together, fantasizing about the other doing the beast with two backs with other people, and admitting that they’d fall in love with the other “if they were a boy” doesn’t help fans' long-held exasperation with <em>Nana. </em>It also doesn’t help that it was nearly impossible to acquire legally until Sentai Filmworks, Hidive, and Hulu made it available in 2022 in the U.S.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, the problem with <em>Nana </em>now that it's available in America is that it's hard to recommend to people in good conscience knowing it's still going to ruin their lives forever. Both the manga and the anime end with Osaki and Komatsu not talking to each other for years. What’s more, the poignant narration from them throughout the series are letters the two wish they sent to each other as they recount their friendship. Forget boy’s comics or shonen, girl’s comics, also known as shojo is where real heartbreaking storytelling resides. I’ve shed my fair share of tears thinking about the girls from apartment 707. Enter <em>The Guy She Was Interested In Wasn’t A Guy At All</em>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><em>Green Yuri</em> will fix you</h3><p><a href="https://usa.kinokuniya.com/the-guy-she-was-interested-in-wasnt-a-guy-at-all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Guy She Was Interested In Wasn’t A Guy At All</em></a>, by Sumiko Arai, might have the naming convention of sentence-long run-of-the-mill isekai anime, but contained within the covers is one of the most refreshing, feel-good queer manga on the market right now. <em>TGSWIIWAGAA</em> (we’re calling it <em>Green Yuri</em>&nbsp; for its Brat green cover from here on out) is a yuri manga, meaning it’s a romance between two women. Yuri, otherwise known as Girls Love, are shojo series that follow queer romances between women. While it isn’t as obscure as its Boys Love counterpart, Yaoi, titles like <em>Bloom Into You</em>, <em>How Do We Relationship</em>, and Whisper Me a Love Song have to fight for retail bookstore shelves against popular shonen battle manga like <em>One Piece</em>, <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em>, and <em>My Hero Academia</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Like <em>Nana</em>, <em>Green Yuri</em> follows a stylish teenage girl named Aya Oosawa and a punk girl named Mitsuki Koga, who start crushing on each other after Oosawa stumbles into Koga’s record shop.&nbsp;</p><p>As its name implies, Aya initially believes she’s crushing on a cute emo clerk obscuring his visage behind a face mask—until she discovers she’s been macking on her dorky Clark Kent-looking classmate she sits beside. What follows is an unfolding romance where the two share their love for rock music just like <em>Nana</em>’s Osaki and Komatsu. Only, replace Nana’s affinity for punk bands like The Sex Pistols with Mitsuaya’s zoomer love for grunge and new-age rock bands like Nirvana, Weezer, My Chemical Romance, and Willow. <em>Nana</em> super fans have enjoyed the songs from that series’ fictional bands through the soundtracks and the movies. Taking that baton, <em>Green Yuri</em>’s referential songs can be enjoyed sonically through its <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2hvxjH2Xa8LWZ8lXIEXlQd?si=rhf_IC5yQaujGx6vDMlcew&amp;pi=TS3_QKfjRX-3a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Spotify playlist</a>, which updates with each chapter.&nbsp;</p><p>The similarities between <em>Nana </em>and <em>Green Yuri</em> are so uncanny that I often feel like <em>Ratatouille</em>’s Anton Ego or Leonardo Di Caprio’s Rick Dalton whenever I spot them. For one, both series include scenes where one of the girls refers to the other’s unflinching sense of loyalty and codependence to Japan’s best boy, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hachik%C5%8D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hachiko</a>, a loyal shiba inu who waited for his master at the train station, even after his master’s death. The two also share an identical moment where Mitsuki and Osaki perform on <a href="https://x.com/kyoruyeye/status/1846341611199856833" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stage for their muses</a>, leading the more conventional girls to profess their undying love for their songstresses (in their heads, of course).&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>On a grander scale, what makes <em>Green Yuri</em> so special as a new-age shojo manga—a genre that doesn’t get nearly as much attention as its male-oriented counterpart, shonen—is its popularity. The series went from being an <a href="https://x.com/agu_knzm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ongoing weekly Twitter series</a> Arai would frequently update every Sunday in 2021—utilizing the platform’s four-image limit to <a href="https://x.com/agu_knzm/status/1845375992971620442" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">create easy to follow chapters</a>— to getting serialized in Pixiv Comic and published and printed by Kadokawa Shonten, to receiving an official English release by Yen Press on October 22. While much of its success is due to the raw artistic talent of Arai, it also owes its rise to prominence with its queer readership who propelled the series from being a word-of-mouth manga darling to an undeniable work of art to big money publishers.&nbsp;</p><p>Witnessing <em>Green Yuri</em>’s grassroots support from the girl’s love community who went from making scanlations of the series for folks to read it in their native language to having <em>Green Yuri</em> break into the mainstream with its <a href="https://x.com/yenpress/status/1827058757064446245" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">artwork gracing the convention floors</a> of pop culture events like New York Comic Con is an inspiring sight to behold. Especially for a manga subgenre that—like its queer readership—are regularly overlooked and constantly have to fight for their right to exist.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Why the manga LOVE BULLET was supported on a global scale" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NAXKth-y9Jw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>What’s more, the same readership who willed <em>Green Yuri</em> into the limelight have been paying it forward by rallying on Twitter to get the word out on <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/love-bullet-manga-inee-sapphic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other ambitious girl’s love series</a> struggling to stave off cancelation like fellow Kadokawa writer and illustrator Inee and their series, <a href="https://x.com/inee/status/1836642815545348099" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Love Bullet</em></a>. Through social media campaigns that stretched across Twitter and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yurimemes/comments/1fjjh10/attention_yuri_lovers_love_bullet_needs_your_help/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.cbr.com/love-bullet-sell-out-release-worldwide-fan-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">various yuri Reddit communities</a>, <em>Love Bullet</em>’s first volume sold out worldwide across online retailers. The yuri community’s outpour of support. Now the world will have a chance to read a manga about a queer girl who <a href="https://youtu.be/swWm522mnaM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;transforms into a gun-wielding cupid</a> upon her untimely death who is tasked with helping her first love find happiness with someone else.&nbsp;</p><p>Just like <em>Love Bullet</em>, <em>Green Yuri</em> is a success story not only for queer manga, but for their passionate fandom. These series experienced continued success through the concerted effort of its readership willing it into the public consciousness by flooding social media with fantastic fan art and testimonials on them being a must-read.. In the case of <em>Love Bullet</em>, the fandom is the only reason why the series continues to be published. Hopefully, these manga won’t have the same ignoble ending as <em>Nana</em>, whose two leads are still in stasis, longing for each other. If you’re still waiting for the two Nanas to kiss, then <em>Green Yuri</em> is here to pick up where they left off.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/forever-skies-full-release-delayed-to-2025-extending-early-access-period/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Forever Skies was set to have its full release in 2024, with 1.0 launching on PC and PlayStation. This isn't the<a href="https://wccftech.com/forever-skies-early-access-has-been-delayed-to-first-half-of-2023/"> first delay</a> that the game has experienced, unfortunately. This time, Far From Home, the developers behind Forever Skies, have decided that the full launch needs to be delayed to early 2025 to ensure that the game has enough polish time. The reason behind the delay is that they've started doing new designs and implementing "substantial changes to many existing systems." Therefore, the delay was needed to make sure the game is the best it can be upon full release.</p>
<p>For those who have been getting stuck into the Early Access period of Forever Skies, there is still more to come. The team behind this game has confirmed that the highly requested 4-player co-op will still be launching on PC Early Access in 2024. While there is no given date, the first Beta tests for the co-op will be starting in the coming weeks, suggesting that it's closer than you may think. Additionally, the game is receiving a 30% discount starting today. If you want to check out the game before the overhaul happens, this is the perfect time to dive into it.</p>
<p>If you are worried about the changes that Far From Home is planning on making to Forever Skies, they've detailed everything in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1641960/view/4505380324428152777" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam blog post</a> that tells you all of the changes and tweaks they're making to ensure that Forever Skies is a great game for those riding solo, or are together in a team.</p>
<p>One of the major things they're changing is the progress overhaul. Currently, the players follow a path naturally that allows them to unlock specific technologies and upgrades. However, this is now being changed so that players can become "much more self-sufficient, especially in the opening hours, while putting more focus on surviving aboard their airship instead of hopping from location to location."</p>
<p>Originally, Forever Skies was going to have procedural generation to place locations on the map. Instead, they are now doing away with that feature and are creating groups of biomes that will spawn specific locations within them. This may seem like an odd choice, as procedural generation can provide a sense of replayability and variety, but the developers feel that it can "sometimes lead to disjointed landscapes and progression."</p>
<p>For those who want to test out the co-op feature, there is a link at the bottom of the Steam blog post that will allow you to sign up for the beta tests. At this time, the co-op is only being planned for PC release, with no word of when co-op will be arriving to PlayStation 5, but it's possible it won't arrive until the full release of the game.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-london-mod-hits-a-million-downloads-on-fallout-day.1017402/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-london-mod-million-downloads<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ambitious mod&nbsp;<em>Fallout: London&nbsp;</em>has hit a major download milestone, developer Team FOLON has announced, and the milestone couldn't have come on a more auspicious day for the studio.</p>
<p>As announced by Team FOLON <a href="https://x.com/TeamFOLON/status/1849075003565703208" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on X (formerly Twitter)</a>,&nbsp;<em>Fallout: London&nbsp;</em>has officially crossed a million downloads since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-london-out-now">its release back in July</a>, which feels like a pretty good way to celebrate&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>Day if you ask me.</p>
<p>Just in case you're wondering, October 23rd is widely regarded by&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>fans as&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>Day because it's the day on which nuclear weapons were fired in the series' setting, devastating life around the world and creating the post-apocalyptic landscapes in which the games take place.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fallout-london-1m-downloads-saint-pauls-sanctuary.jpg?itok=iE06M3mi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fallout-london-1m-downloads-saint-pauls-sanctuary.jpg?itok=jKPePl3Y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fallout: London&nbsp;</em>has proven pretty popular among&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>fans.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Fallout: London</em>'s success feels especially poignant given that&nbsp;<em>Fallout: Vault 13</em>, a&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4&nbsp;</em>mod that sought to recreate the entirety of the first game in the Bethesda shooter's engine, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fallout-vault-13-mod-development-suspended">recently suspended by its developers</a>.</p>
<p>It's also perhaps a better&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>Day celebration than Bethesda's official offering, which so far consists of <a href="https://x.com/Fallout/status/1849101170742067581" rel="noopener" target="_blank">some goodies</a> for&nbsp;<em>Fallout Shelter&nbsp;</em>players on mobile. Be still, my beating heart.</p>
<p>To be fair to Bethesda, the studio is also planning a special (or perhaps that should be S.P.E.C.I.A.L.) <a href="https://x.com/Fallout/status/1846567292991099192" rel="noopener" target="_blank">broadcast later today</a> that will show off some "new content in&nbsp;<em>Fallout 76</em>", but I have a feeling that probably won't cut it for&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>fans either.</p>
<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Fallout: London&nbsp;</em>is, it's a total conversion mod for&nbsp;<em>Fallout 4&nbsp;</em>that contains an entirely new map to explore. You'll never guess which city it is.</p>

<p>The mod also features a new storyline to pursue, as well as new enemies, new items, and much more. Make no mistake: this is a serious endeavor, so you should go into it prepared to play what is essentially an entirely new&nbsp;<em>Fallout&nbsp;</em>game.</p>
<p><em>Fallout: London&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/fallout_london" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via GOG</a>. The GOG page also contains instructions for how to install the mod on Steam, but they can be a bit involved, so make sure you set aside a little time if you're planning to play on Valve's platform.</p>

It’s not the most intuitive or groundbreaking horror game to strike fear in our hearts, but it provides a consuming atmosphere that brings the film universe to life.

Does it overlap? Do you need to have seen the movies to enjoy the game, or does the game spoil the movies? Here is how <em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</em> fits into the movie universe!</p><h2 id="h7588"><a id=""></a><strong>What’s <em>A Quiet Place </em>all about?</strong></h2><p>The original <em>A Quiet Place</em>, directed by John Krasinski (<em>The Office</em>), showcases a world in which blind extraterrestrial creatures—Death Angels—crashland via meteors all across the globe. Seemingly within days, they’ve spread across the planet, even into the countryside, and hunt anyone or anything making too much noise.</p><p>In the first film, a mother and father work tirelessly to protect their family and homestead while eking out a living at the end of the world. In the second film (also helmed by Krasinki), we follow the same family as they traverse the land, avoiding the extraterrestrials and searching for safety. Finally, the most recent film, <em>A Quiet Place: Day One </em>(this time directed by Michael Sarnoski), is a spin-off prequel of sorts, detailing the earliest days of the alien invasion in New York City.</p><p>As I said, these beings hunt via sound. They have evolved hearing, allowing them to pick up a twig snapping from great distances. Upon hearing any noise, they hunt relentlessly until they find, kill, and seemingly consume their prey. <em>A Quiet Place</em> created an apex predator that instills fear, which translates shockingly well to video game form.</p><h2 id="h7589"><a id=""></a><strong>How does <em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead </em>fit into this story?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="8994a1152d2550a44cd0028671a83fb0" data-recommend-id="image://8994a1152d2550a44cd0028671a83fb0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Death Angel in the hospital parking garage in A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Death Angel in the hospital parking garage in A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Stormind Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8994a1152d2550a44cd0028671a83fb0" data-recommend-id="image://8994a1152d2550a44cd0028671a83fb0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Death Angel in the hospital parking garage in A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>On the surface, <em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</em> is a standalone story set in the same world as the movies, but with little connection to the current three films.<br></p><p>Canonically, the video game takes place before the events of the original movie, but after the story of <em>Day One</em>. By this point, according to the prequel film’s events, humanity understands its enemy and their weakness—namely water—along with how to skirt around them using sound or a lack thereof.</p><p>Like the first two films, the game is set in upstate New York, a decision made to allow a few flashback segments that correspond with the films’ storylines.</p><h2 id="h7590"><a id=""></a><strong>Do I need to have seen the <em>A Quiet Place</em> movies to enjoy this game?</strong></h2><p>Not at all, surprisingly. <em>Kotaku</em>’s own Zack Zwiezen hadn’t watched any of the films, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/quiet-place-new-game-road-ahead-review-is-it-good-scary-1851678522&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/quiet-place-new-game-road-ahead-review-is-it-good-scary-1851678522">had a thoroughly good time with the game</a></span>.

I took my time, walked everywhere, and checked my surroundings for potential noise sources.</p><p>To help you navigate the environment, the game provides a phonometer early on that measures sound within the environment, and the sound <em>you</em> make. You’re golden if you ensure the latter is quieter than the former. You can walk up to a Death Angel, crouch, and completely melt into the environment. It’s a little too easy in spots, and the game’s overall difficulty spikes feel artificial, but the tension and immersion are second to none!<br></p><p>Before diving into <em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</em> yourself, you should know that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/quiet-place-new-game-long-road-mic-hear-you-scream-ps5-1851669208&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/quiet-place-new-game-long-road-mic-hear-you-scream-ps5-1851669208">a setting allows the creature to hear your mic in-game</a></span>.

The multiplayer action-RPG continues to look <em>very</em> good (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-hands-on-preview-1851633107&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-hands-on-preview-1851633107">you can find our hands-on impressions here</a></span>). </p><p>The good news is that fans won’t have to wait until <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>’ February 28, 2025 release date to get their hands on it and check out its world for themselves. An open beta test free to all players on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC kicks off on Halloween and runs into early November. There are three segments to it, including a character creator (with characters transferable to the main game), opening story missions, and a free-roaming Doshaguma Hunt. Here’s the full schedule:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>PlayStation 5 PlayStation Plus Early Access: </strong>October 28 at 8:00pm PT – October 30 at 7:59pm PT</li><li><strong>Non-PlayStation Plus Subscribers: </strong>October 31 at 8:00pm PT – November 3 at 6:59pm PT</li><li><strong>Xbox Series X|S: </strong>October 31 at 8:00pm PT – November 3 at 6:59pm PT</li><li><strong>Steam: </strong>October 31 at 8:00pm PT – November 3 at 6:59pm PT</li></ul></blockquote><p>You’ll notice that PS5 players who subscribe to PS Plus get a three-day head start while everyone else has to wait until October 31. Also worth noting is that PS Plus and Xbox Live, now part of Game Pass Core/Ultimate, aren’t required to play the online beta. The test also features cross-play, so you can meet up with your friends even if they’re on a different platform. Everyone who participates gets a pendant and item pack that can be used in the final game. </p><p>Capcom’s partnership with Sony for the game runs a little deeper than early beta access, however. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/23/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-test-launches-on-ps5-next-week/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/23/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-test-launches-on-ps5-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Over at the PlayStation Blog</a></span>, the company highlighted DualSense-specific features for <em>Monster Hunter Wilds </em>including Tempest 3D audio support as well as integration of the integrated speaker, adaptive triggers, and the built-in accelerometer and gyroscope, which can be used to aim long-range weapons and abilities. Hopefully, there’s an option to turn all of those features off, or at least the integrated speaker.

            <p>The Day Before developer Fntastic has called it a day on the Kickstarter it hoped would secure funding for Escape Factory, a physics-based multiplayer co-op escape game.</p>
<p>In a post shared on social media platform X, the studio said the project had not "generated enough interest" and was "unlikely" to reach the goal initially set out. As such, Fntastic has decided to postpone work on Escape Factory and cancel the Kickstarter. No funds have been collected, it said. </p>
<p>But, don't go thinking the developer is actually going to call it a day. Rather, in announcing the end of one game, it has also announced the start of another one: an "action-horror prop hunt" game called Items.</p>

<p>Yes, in that very same post where Fntastic admitted there simply isn't enough interest in its Factory game, it said the community had been asking for a prop hunt game, so that is what it is going to do now.</p><p>Fntastic added the development of Items will "require significant resources", and therefore the team has "decided to release mobile games in parallel to support the process". It also suggested another Kickstarter could be on the cards further down the line, stating it is "important to us that our players get the chance to play and test the game in advance" of a release.</p>
<p>In response to one less than convinced social media follower who scoffed at the developer's ongoing attempt to win back some favour, Fntastic said: "We know our decisions and projects might not be for everyone, but we’re working hard to create a game that our supporters will like and enjoy."</p>

<p>It is fair to say that Fntastic does not have a good track record when it comes to releasing games. It finally launched The Day Before back in December last year, after a rocky road to release which included delays, the developer being forced to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-day-before-dev-insists-zombie-mmo-is-not-a-scam-following-latest-delay">state its game wasn't a scam</a>, and criticism for its use of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/delayed-steam-pre-order-hit-the-day-before-developer-defends-use-of-unpaid-volunteers">unpaid volunteers</a>. It even got tied up in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/calendar-app-company-confirms-the-day-before-trademark-dispute">bizarre trademark dispute with a calendar app</a> also called The Day Before.</p><p>However, in the end, The Day Before didn't last long. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-day-befores-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-seem-deserved">Its debut was a mess</a>, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-day-before-developer-fntastic-suddenly-announces-its-shut-down">studio shut down a mere matter of days after the game's release</a>, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-day-before-publisher-apologises-for-game-as-steam-refunds-open">players' receiving refunds for the product</a>. Fantastic announced its 'comeback' last month, with an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-day-before-developer-returns-with-fntastic-20-and-is-asking-for-your-money-again">attempt to refresh itself with a 'Fntastic 2.0' push</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-launching-this-october-on-pc-and-ps5/">Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a> is a worthwhile upgrade, being a robust remaster that greatly enhances the original game's visuals while introducing options seen in its sequel, according to a new tech review.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-review-the-upgrades-are-worthwhile" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> took a good look at the remaster of the first entry in the series by Guerrilla, developed primarily by Nixxes, highlighting how the many improvements included in the game made it a worthwhile upgrade over the original. Like Forbidden West, Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered features three performance options - 30, 40, and 60 FPS - which balance visual quality and resolution to achieve the target framerate. All three modes use dynamic resolution scaling, with quality mode aiming for native 4K resolution and the other modes below 1800p. All three modes are roughly the same, and image quality in performance mode is good enough to make it the recommended display mode for most players. In addition, all three display modes hit their target performance perfectly.</p>
<p>While the new display modes are welcome, it's the visual changes that make Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered a worthwhile upgrade, according to Digital Foundry. Almost every aspect of the game has been tweaked and improved, from the terrain system and foliage to the detail of man made areas, water rendering, which is not as good as in the sequel but definitely improved over the original, lighting, character models, and animations, especially in dialogue sequence. Audio was also improved, with a new mix featuring better surround and 3D audio support.</p>
<p><iframe title="Exclusive: Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered - PS5 DF Tech Review - Is The Upgrade Worthwhile?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yNkC2BOaboM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered launches on October 31st on PC and PlayStation 5. The remaster will be available for only $10 to owners of the original release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-evershine-skipping-early-access<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pathea Games has announced that it's skipping an Early Access phase for&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>and going straight to a full release thanks to the staggering sum of money the game has raised via Kickstarter.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/MyTimeEvershine/status/1848934908787576843">a message on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Pathea reveals that&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine</em>'s hugely successful <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mtae/my-time-at-evershine-the-next-my-time-tale" rel="noopener" target="_blank">crowdfunding campaign</a>, which was fully funded <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/my-time-at-evershine-kickstarter-fully-funded">less than an hour after its launch</a>, has hit the $2.5 million milestone. Not bad, considering its initial goal was a humble $200,000.</p>
<p>As a result of that milestone being reached,&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>will skip Early Access, and two pairs of "non-core characters" will now have optional Rival Romances to pursue. That's in addition to already-hit stretch goals like body customization, expanded wardrobe options, and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/my-time-at-evershine-early-access-skip-gliding.jpg?itok=h5rHjrF1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/my-time-at-evershine-early-access-skip-gliding.jpg?itok=bG4FDitB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>has been a runaway Kickstarter success.</figcaption></figure><p>Since the $2.5m milestone has been reached, it now remains to be seen whether further stretch goals will be hit. At $2.75m, Pathea will add a new core romanceable NPC with the opposite gender to the $1.7m stretch goal's bachelor or bachelorette.</p>
<p>$3m in funding means that you'll get to build your own zoo, which can then be visited by tourists to give you some extra income. Five additional sidequests will also be added if this funding goal is reached.</p>
<p>Finally, Pathea says that if it reaches $10m funding, it'll create a full remake of&nbsp;<em>My Time at Portia&nbsp;</em>with&nbsp;<em>Evershine</em>'s art style and quality-of-life improvements. It's unlikely the game will reach this goal, but hey, there's still a day or so to go!</p>

<p>This announcement means that&nbsp;<em>Evershine&nbsp;</em>will become the first game in its series not to launch in Early Access, since both of the game's predecessors,&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/my-time-at-portia">Portia</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/my-time-at-sandrock"><em>Sandrock</em></a>, did so.</p>
<p>Right now,&nbsp;<em>My Time at Evershine&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date, but when it does arrive, it'll be released for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto 5 might be more than a decade old, but it’s still a powerhouse of game, particularly where content creation is concerned. It might just be a year until Grand Theft Auto 6 is finally released, and that anticipation is driving more people to GTA 5. In a recent report published by Streams Charts, it was revealed that GTA 5 is <strong>still </strong>the world’s most popular game to watch on stream.</p>

<p>In a report highlighting streaming performance through Q3 2024, <a href="https://streamscharts.com/news/most-watched-games-livestreaming-q3-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steams Charts revealed</a> that GTA 5 secured a whopping 533.3 <strong>million </strong>hours watched. It was the most popular game on Twitch but also across other sites such as Nimo and Kick. It would have been the most popular game on YouTube, but it was edged out by ML:BB and the recent MPL esports event.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>What makes this achievement more remarkable is that almost every other title in the top ten is only popular because of an esports event. From the League of Legends World Championship to IEM Rio, some of the biggest esports events in the world have taken place in the last quarter or are still unfolding, bolstering these numbers immeasurably.</p>



<p>GTA 5 (obviously) doesn’t have an esports scene – it’s just pure, unadulterated entertainment. It helps that the GTA RP scene has been running wild for years, and that’s the biggest draw to this platform.</p>



<p>It was also revealed by Streams Charts that in the last quarter, Black Myth: Wukong was <a href="https://streamscharts.com/news/black-myth-wukong-has-taken-crown-most-popular-game-release-live-streaming-q3-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the most popular new game</a> in terms of streaming. It secured a massive 39.3 million watch hours, while the second-place game, EA Sports FC 25, netted just 14.7 million watch hours.</p>

<p>Having the best AK-74 loadout attachments for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-release-date-time-countdown-launch-date-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> will give you the best chance of victory with the Assault Rifle. The iconic gun returns to the franchise, joining the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-weapons-every-gun-and-how-to-unlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BO6 arsenal</a> as one of the most powerful weapons in its category. </p>



<p>With incredible damage and fairly easy-to-control recoil, the AK-74 dominates the mid-range, and can even best opponents at longer lines of sight too. Here’s all the information you need to build the best Black Ops 6 AK-74 loadout, including the optimal attachments, Perks, Equipment, and more.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-ak-74-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-ak-74">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-secondary-for-ak-74">Best Secondary for AK-74</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-how-to-unlock-ak-74-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock AK-74 in Black Ops 6</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-is-the-ak-74-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the AK-74 any good in Black Ops 6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-alternatives-to-the-ak-74-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-ak-74-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best AK-74 loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong>&nbsp;Volzhskiy Reflex</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong>&nbsp;Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong>&nbsp;Long Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong>&nbsp;Extended Mag I</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods:</strong>&nbsp;Rapid Fire</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip:</strong>&nbsp;CQB Grip</li>
</ul>



<p>You’ll want the best attachments possible to get the most out of the AK-74 in Black Ops 6. The <strong>Volzhskiy Reflex </strong>is a clean Optic to replace the bulky iron sights, while the <strong>Suppressor </strong>will allow you to shoot freely and not worry about popping up on the enemy radar. </p>



<p>The <strong>Long Barrel</strong> extends the AK-74’s damage range, allowing you to take on enemies at longer distances, while the combination of <strong>Rapid Fire</strong> and the <strong>Extended Mag I </strong>attachments increases the AR’s TTK.</p>



<p>Lastly, to take full advantage of <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/08/call-of-duty-next-black-ops-6-reveal-global-systems-key-innovations-announcement#omnimovement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Omnimovement</a>, you’ll want to use the <strong>CQB Grip</strong>, which improves the AK-74’s sprint-to-fire, slide-to-fire, and dive-to-fire speed.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-ak-74">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for AK-74</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1:</strong>&nbsp;Ghost</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2:</strong>&nbsp;Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3:</strong>&nbsp;Bankroll</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4:</strong>&nbsp;Dexterity</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard:</strong>&nbsp;Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal:</strong>&nbsp;Frag Grenade</li>



<li><strong>Tactical:</strong>&nbsp;Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade:</strong>&nbsp;Trophy System</li>
</ul>



<p>We’ve chosen Perks that help you stay mobile and undetected while using the AK-74 in Black Ops 6. <strong>Ghost </strong>will keep you off enemy radars, while <strong>Gung-Ho</strong> lets you reload and use equipment while sprinting. <strong>Bankroll </strong>gives you a boost in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-scorestreaks-black-ops-6-and-how-to-unlock-them/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Scorestreaks</a> and the <strong>Perk Greed Wildcard</strong> allows you to choose a fourth Perk, so <strong>Dexertity </strong>fills the final spot to further boost movement.</p>



<p>Having three red Perks means you get the <strong>Enforcer Combat Specialty</strong>, which provides a&nbsp;temporary movement speed and health regen buff after getting a kill.</p>



<p>As for Equipment, you can’t go wrong with a <strong>Frag Grenade</strong>, especially if you like to cook and throw them at just the right time for an easy kill. The <strong>Stim Shot</strong> is an essential Tactical for me, as the ability to regen health quickly and get back in the fight is vital for playing aggressively. </p>



<p>Lastly, the<strong> Trophy System </strong>is a great Field Upgrade choice for objective-based game modes, allowing you and your team to stay on the point without the need to avoid enemy Equipment.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-ak-74">Best Secondary for AK-74</h2>



<p>Any Pistol will serve you well as a Secondary weapon for the AK-74. Without Overkill, Pistols are the best Secondary option for finishing off a kill when you need to reload or you run out of ammo. </p>



<p>Launchers are great for taking out Scorestreaks and enemies in powerful positions, but they’re not as reliable in terms of being a backup option.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-ak-74-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock AK-74 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You can unlock the AK-74 in Black Ops 6 by <strong>reaching Level 10</strong>. This shouldn’t take too long, and you can check out our guide on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to level up quickly</a> if you’re eager to start using the AK-74.</p>



<p>Further, progression is universal across Black Ops 6’s modes, so you can even enjoy some Zombies to level up and unlock the AK-74 and use it in the multiplayer.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-ak-74-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the AK-74 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes</strong>, the AK-74 is a meta option in Black Ops 6. It’s one of my favorite weapons to use due to its sheer damage output and heavy-hitting feel. The Assault Rifle excels in medium to long-ranged engagements, and it holds its own in close-quarters combat too. </p>



<p>It packs a mean punch, with consistent damage and fairly easy-to-control recoil. It’s easily one of the most effective Assault Rifles in the game, and with the attachments in our best loadout for the Assault Rifle, you’ll be able to come out on top in any gunfight in BO6.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-ak-74-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the AK-74 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>If you’re looking to use an alternative to the AK-74, the <strong>XM4 </strong>is a strong option, especially since it’s immediately available for players to use once they unlock Custom Loadouts at Level 4. If you want to move away from Assault Rifles, give the <strong>KSV </strong>SMG a go, as it has similarities to the AK-74 but its stats are tuned for medium and close-quarters combat.</p>
