Two mobile games were released simultaneously, <em>Cube Escape: The Lake</em> and <em>Cube Escape: Seasons</em>. Each, at first glance, appeared to be part of the current trend for both digital and real-world escape room games, in which you solved puzzles to set yourself free from some kind of intricately locked enclosure. But very quickly it became apparent that this was something <em>different</em>. Rusty Lake is not the sort of place from which anyone escapes. And ten years later, with a brand new game to celebrate, we’re still trapped within its Lynchian aberrations.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196086" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Dark Knights And Dark Princes" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196086,196663,196345" data-current="196086"><div><p>The Week In Games: Dark Knights And Dark Princes</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196086/196086_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21614.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Ten years and an extraordinary 18 games, one film, and a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rustylakeuntold.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rustylakeuntold.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">table-top RPG</a></span> later, people are still trying to piece together the mysteries of Rusty Lake, the various buildings in the very small town (the Cabin, the Chapel, a Cave, a Mill, the Vanderboom home, and of course the Hotel), and the unsettling figures who appear throughout its history like Mr Crow and Mr Owl. We know the Lake needs our memories, and we know that once the negative ones are extracted from people—in the form of black cubes—they become Corrupted Souls. And we know there’s a damned weird obsession with shrimps. But the real joy of <em>Rusty Lake</em> is that, as with the David Lynch films that heavily inspired it, we also know complete, coherent answers will always be just out of reach.</p><figure id="" data-id="706a308e894d1480bf015c30b9ab972f" data-recommend-id="image://706a308e894d1480bf015c30b9ab972f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character holds eyeballs up in front of her eyeballs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A character holds eyeballs up in front of her eyeballs." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rusty Lake / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="706a308e894d1480bf015c30b9ab972f" data-recommend-id="image://706a308e894d1480bf015c30b9ab972f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1200" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A character holds eyeballs up in front of her eyeballs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Earlier this year, with the 10th anniversary looming, I thought it would be a good time to replay every game in the series, in release order, to try to get myself on top of what these games are about. I’m genuinely delighted to report that at the end of this process, from <em>Cube Escape: The Lake</em> through to <em>Underground Blossom</em>, and indeed the shadow-dropped-as-this-post-goes-live <em>The Mr. Rabbit Magic Show</em>, I’m none the wiser. I can tell you these are games about burdened families, dark secrets passed through generations, and a lake with an insatiable desire for memories, but the “why” and the “how” fade into irrelevance in the shadow of such an incredible atmosphere of haunting malevolence, and a permanent wicked glint in the series’ eye.</p><p>On a more pragmatic level, these are games created in that modern, touchscreen-driven style of a point-and-click puzzle game. You explore locations, gather items for your inventory, and listen to the peculiar utterings of the inhabitants, attempting to solve puzzles that usually end up pointing toward the appearance of mystical cubes. But rather than the genre’s usual predictable results, in a <em>Rusty Lake</em> game you’re far more likely to discover that using the hammer on the nail causes a crack in a wall to unveil a fish, which when used on the right character will cause them to die, falling to the ground with their mouth open, into which you then travel to discover an impossible chamber within their body. There’s one game in which you slice off a man’s nipple in order to travel into the bizarre realm hidden behind it.</p><p>Yet despite this overtly surreal approach, the <em>Rusty Lake</em> games maintain a sense of order, a notion that—even if you can never quite grasp their wraith-like tendrils—there <em>is</em> an internal coherence here. (The wonderful Mike Fahey (RIP) <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/rusty-lake-paradise-is-my-kind-of-creepy-1822134955&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/rusty-lake-paradise-is-my-kind-of-creepy-1822134955">wrote about that aspect here</a></span>.) In the same way as  Lynch’s <em>Lost Highway</em> confidently casts a dream-like spell on you such that you understand why watching a video of a man murdering his wife would mean the same events now have to have happened in reality, these peculiar games sweep you up in their own internal rationale.</p><figure id="" data-id="4427e57539f58c6f700dada6c650efa8" data-recommend-id="image://4427e57539f58c6f700dada6c650efa8" data-format="jpg" data-width="2177" data-height="1225" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A corrupted soul appears in front of a crowd of humanoid animals." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A corrupted soul appears in front of a crowd of humanoid animals." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rusty Lake / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4427e57539f58c6f700dada6c650efa8" data-recommend-id="image://4427e57539f58c6f700dada6c650efa8" data-format="jpg" data-width="2177" data-height="1225" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A corrupted soul appears in front of a crowd of humanoid animals." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Over the years I’ve been covering the series, I’ve commented that <em>Rusty Lake</em>’s weakness is that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rusty-lake-paradise-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rusty-lake-paradise-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it wears its Lynch influences too clearly on its sleeve</a></span>. Sharing an interest in the inherent spookiness of owls is one thing; writing “THE OWLS ARE NOT WHAT THEY SEEM” on a wall in <em>Rusty Lake Paradise</em> was pushing it too far. But, importantly, the series has established so many of its own distinctive themes that crop up throughout, giving that sense of timelessness to a collection of games that can be set a hundred years apart.</p><p>So in the end, it’s really rather incredibly lovely that the new game, surprise-released today, features a small, lovely tribute to the late filmmaker. And fittingly, it’s hidden outside of the game within the game...Yeah, it’s appropriately strange.</p><figure id="" data-id="35dd6ed7e07e2743790abf0450d0f8b0" data-recommend-id="image://35dd6ed7e07e2743790abf0450d0f8b0" data-format="jpg" data-width="2543" data-height="1431" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mr Rabbit has had his arm bitten off by a tiger." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mr Rabbit has had his arm bitten off by a tiger." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rusty Lake / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="35dd6ed7e07e2743790abf0450d0f8b0" data-recommend-id="image://35dd6ed7e07e2743790abf0450d0f8b0" data-format="jpg" data-width="2543" data-height="1431" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mr Rabbit has had his arm bitten off by a tiger." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>The Mr. Rabbit Magic Show</em> is seemingly a game dedicated to the rabbit-headed character who first appeared in <em>Rusty Lake Hotel</em>, and indeed is served as the game’s second dinner. (Seriously, you have to play it.) It’s presented as a series of mini-puzzles, a stage show being put on by the magician rabbit, in which you must arrange objects and colors or successfully sproing baby rabbits from a top hat such that they land in another hat on the floor (rather than miss and land in a bloody splat), in order to bring on the next scene. And honestly, as I was playing, I was thinking—hmmm, this isn’t quite it. But the game knew that, and then a whole bunch of other stuff happens, and it’s yours to discover.</p><p>But it’s safe to say it’s a fittingly unnerving celebration of ten years of these  unnerving games, deliberately indulgent, and packed with fun callbacks to the series. It’s going to be fun to discover if it’s ever considered canon, but since Mr. Rabbit has been haunting the Lake in his altogether more unpleasant form since 1894, we have to assume that his magic act took place before he arrived in the Hotel, so pre-1893.</p><figure id="" data-id="c16e280720ed39f68b5181dcd268069d" data-recommend-id="image://c16e280720ed39f68b5181dcd268069d" data-format="jpg" data-width="2541" data-height="1430" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An error message pops up in front of Mr Rabbit on stage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An error message pops up in front of Mr Rabbit on stage." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rusty Lake / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c16e280720ed39f68b5181dcd268069d" data-recommend-id="image://c16e280720ed39f68b5181dcd268069d" data-format="jpg" data-width="2541" data-height="1430" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An error message pops up in front of Mr Rabbit on stage." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>What’s so fun here is <em>Magic Show</em> allows the developers to let their usual sly winks come to the forefront, break the frame a little, and make sure you know that they know that you know they’re playing you. In fact, despite ostensibly having finished it, I’m still plugging away at a few remaining—extremely difficult—puzzles, to try to find every Easter egg hidden within.</p><p>And, at the same time, there’s also a new short film—<em>The Intern—</em>to complement the new game! It’s 10 minutes long, and has the developers wonderfully spoofing themselves as an intern tries to publish <em>Mr. Rabbit</em>, but discovers the Rusty Lake office is as much of a series of weird puzzles as the games they make.</p><p>If you want to get started with the <em>Rusty Lake</em> games, there’s no better place to begin than the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rustylake.com/room-escape-games/cube-escape-collection.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rustylake.com/room-escape-games/cube-escape-collection.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Cube Escape </em>Collection</a></span>. Because those original games were made in Flash, and Flash is no more, they’ve been remade in a modern engine, and re-released in one package which—ludicrously—only costs $5 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.RustyLake.CubeEscapeCollection&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.RustyLake.CubeEscapeCollection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Steam</a></span>, and is a free download on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cube-escape-collection/id1555267021&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cube-escape-collection/id1555267021" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iOS</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.RustyLake.CubeEscapeCollection&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.RustyLake.CubeEscapeCollection" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android</a></span>, with similarly priced in-app purchases to unlock the all nine games.</p><p>Beyond the <em>Cube Escape</em> series, there are what seem to be known as the “Premium Games,” all of which are included in Steam’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/3669/Rusty_Lake_Bundle/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/3669/Rusty_Lake_Bundle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Rusty Lake </em>Bundle</a></span> alongside the <em>Cube Escape</em> Collection and the separately released <em>Cube Escape: Paradox</em>. The latter is something quite extraordinary—a two part game that’s emboldened by a live-action short film. You can also watch that film for free via Steam, or indeed on YouTube, immediately below.</p><p>Of those premium games, not all have “Rusty Lake” in the name. So make sure not to miss <em>The White Door</em> (an incredible  story of a man trapped in an asylum), <em>Underground Blossom</em> (the most recent full game, entirely set on a train platform), and 2022's <em>The Past Within</em>, a co-op puzzle game set in the <em>Rusty Lake</em> universe in which each player sees a completely different version of the game, requiring you to coordinate to solve its puzzles. (And don’t forget the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281800/Samsara_Room/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281800/Samsara_Room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">remastered <em>Samsara Room</em></a></span>, a game originally released in 2013 before <em>Rusty Lake</em>, but very much in the same universe.) They’re all on Steam and mobile, and personally, I prefer to play them as mobile games, ideally on a good-sized tablet.</p><p>I have so much fondness for this series, and am constantly impressed by the lengths to which the Dutch developers have gone to innovate within their deranged little world. I love how chilling it can feel, despite being a cartoonish series filled with tongue-in-cheek goriness. I love that every time I see a Corrupted Soul, no matter how much they appear in every game, I get the shivers. I also love how many questions I have, and how much I don’t want them answered. Congrats on ten years, Rusty Lake, now please make me many more games.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In advance of the Switch 2's planned June launch, Nintendo has <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/22525/~/nintendo-switch-system-update-information#current">released a system update</a> for the original Switch that, among other things, activates <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/nintendos-new-system-for-sharing-digital-switch-games-explained/">the company's new Virtual Game Card system</a> for sharing digital downloads. But Switch owners are finding that this new sharing system is a bit more limiting when it comes to sharing a single digital purchase for online play across multiple consoles.</p>
<p>For those who missed <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/nintendos-new-system-for-sharing-digital-switch-games-explained/">Nintendo's March announcement of the Virtual Game Card system</a>, the new setup allows players to easily "unload" a digital game license from one Switch (or Switch 2) console and "load" it onto another console connected to the same Nintendo Account (or <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/28815/~/what-is-a-nintendo-account-family-group%3F">one in the same family group</a>). An Internet connection is required for the initial loading and unloading process, but after that, the system with the Virtual Game Card can play the downloaded game completely offline.</p>
<p>For those who don't want to constantly load and unload their virtual games between systems, Nintendo also offers an "Online License" feature deep in the Switch's system menu. When this feature is turned on, if you load a digital game without a Virtual Game Card present, the Switch will perform an online check to confirm that your Nintendo Account actually has access to that game. Nintendo recommends this feature for players who want to share games across three or more Switch units.</p>
<h2>Forget the old ways</h2>
<p>Both the Virtual Game Cards and the Online License feature represent a significant change from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/how-do-you-manage-software-and-saves-on-a-second-switch-its-complicated/">Nintendo's previous system</a> for managing digital games across multiple Switch units. Under that now-defunct setup, any number of users on a Switch designated as the "primary" console could play digital games without the need for an online check-in. Only users on any number of "secondary" consoles would need online access to confirm ownership when a game was launched.</p>

<p>While that old system could be cumbersome to set up, it actually allowed for quite a bit of flexibility when it came to game sharing. As Nintendo noted on its official FAQ <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/47524/~/how-to-play-your-games-across-multiple-nintendo-switch-systems">as recently as last week</a>, two users could play a single digital game purchase <em>at the same time</em>, as long as the Nintendo Account that purchased the game was playing on the secondary console (with an active Internet connection).</p>
<p>But Nintendo's FAQ explanation for "how to play the same digital game at the same time with different Nintendo accounts" has been removed from <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/47524/~/how-to-play-your-games-across-multiple-nintendo-switch-systems">the current version of Nintendo's Switch digital game sharing FAQ</a>. In its place is a link to <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/67891">a new page detailing the Virtual Game Card system</a>. While the new FAQ also discusses the Online License feature for sharing games "even if you don't have a virtual game card loaded," there is no longer any discussion of how to access a single digital game on two consoles <em>simultaneously</em>.</p>
<p>Ars' own testing confirms that trying to load a digital game while another Switch is actively playing <em>the same game</em> results in <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/41190">a "play is being suspended" error</a> on one console. This seems to be true even if one console has a loaded Virtual Game Card for the game being played and even if the consoles use different Nintendo Accounts from the same family group.</p>
<p>Players can simultaneously play <em>different</em> games from the same digital library on two different Switch systems, but only if at least one of those games is on a loaded Virtual Game Card.</p>

<h2>A partial workaround</h2>
<p>Players who want to play a single digital game purchased across multiple Switch consoles simultaneously can still use a partial workaround. A Switch console with a Virtual Game Card currently loaded should be set to Airplane mode (or have Wi-Fi disabled), and the user's Online License feature should be enabled for the game's original purchaser. The first system will still be able to play that Virtual Game Card offline, while the Online License feature will allow the same game to be played at the same time on a second system.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>The major drawback of this workaround, of course, is that one Switch has to be completely offline for it to work. That means two players wanting to share a single digital copy of <em>Mario Kart 8</em> for an online race won't be able to do so, for instance. It also means <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/mario-kart-8-deluxes-new-expansion-is-good-so-far-but-is-it-worth-25/">certain DLC tied to a Switch Online subscription</a> won't be loadable on the offline system.</p>

<p>In a way, it's a bit surprising that Nintendo took this long to close what can be seen as a convenient loophole in its digital game sharing system. After all, players who buy a single copy of a physical game can't simultaneously play that game on two separate consoles. The fact that Switch owners <em>could</em> do that with digital games until now was something of an officially acknowledged bonus for players who opted for downloadable games.</p>
<p>With the impending launch of the Switch 2, though, Nintendo seems intent on making sure that each player owns their own copy of a game when playing together online (with the minor exception of the few games that use <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/features/gameshare/?srsltid=AfmBOoph7oDqGjKTQ_gWuqNAdKkI1O49rvPlVKC_K6kYQrupbFaYmHaZ">Nintendo's GameShare system</a>). As Nintendo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/will-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-become-gamings-new-normal/">starts asking $80 for a single copy of <em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, that closed loophole could end up being costly for some multi-Switch households.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft has outlined the Year One roadmap for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, which will kick off in May with several big new features being added to the game. In a dev diary, Ubisoft confirmed that early May will see new story content added to the game--focusing on Portuguese scholar Luis Frois--alongside a new ally, abilities, and quality-of-life updates.</p><p>Late May will see a major upgrade made to the parkour gameplay, as Naoe will be able to wall-vault and grab a low ledge, plus she'll have a few other new moves at her disposal. This includes height-gaining back-eject and fully reanimated height-gaining side-eject moves.</p><p>Another nice upgrade coming at the end of May will be an enhanced photo mode, as you'll be able to make Yasuke or Naoe strike a pose before you take a photo. Ubisoft is also teasing special collaborations in late May, but it remains to be seen who you'll meet in your trek across Japan. Moving ahead to June, you can expect more story content, a fresh face joining your league, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-developers-are-considering-an-even-tougher-difficulty-option/1100-6530486/">and a new difficulty mode</a> that Ubisoft had previously teased.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LLB-WNvQEQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1LLB-WNvQEQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game will also be updated with more immersion options--like turning off the outline that appears on a character when they enter stealth--optional headgear in cutscenes, and the alarm system from castles will be applied to the entire game world. Beyond that, Ubisoft is working on lots more additional content, like New Game Plus mode, more codex updates, new Animus content, and the Claws of Awaji expansion. This will still be free to anyone who preordered the game, and it adds a new island to explore and a bo staff weapon category for Naoe to master.</p><p>Ubisoft has been steadily working on Assassin's Creed Shadows since it launched in May, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-patch-adds-quality-of-life-updates-and-ps5-pro-upgrades-this-week/1100-6530661/">with major title updates adding PS5 Pro upgrades</a>, an auto-follow option for players when they're on horseback, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-assassins-creed-shadows-update-fixes-more-bugs-and-ps5-pro-graphical-issues/1100-6530897/">and bug fixes</a>.

Game of Thrones the TV show might have farted out of existence with a dribble, but that doesn't appear to be of much concern to the beancounters; Game of Thrones: Kingsroad - the free-to-play action-RPG from South Korean developer Netmarble that's looking to reanimate the HBO series' corpse - is leaving paid early access and launching for PC and mobile on 21st May.

Game of Thrones: Kingsroad promises to take players on a "truly immersive journey" through the TV series' version of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, taking in some familiar sights - from the northern Wall's Castle Back to King's Landing, Highgarden, and beyond - as they freely roam an open world of "vivid landscapes, massive cities, backwater towns, untamed wilderness, and the uncompromising lives of the people that inhabit them."
</p>
<p>
Players start their adventure as an illegitimate child from a small noble house in the North who, following the death of their brothers, sets out to "solidify [their] political position, navigate the complex power struggles between the noble houses of Westeros, and seek out... allies" - all while preparing for the White Walkers' arrival. It's got classes (players can adopt the role of either Knight, Sellsword, or Assassin), co-op, and familiar series characters too.

<p>
Game of Thrones: Kingsroad launched into paid early access in March and it's garnered plenty of criticism on Steam since then - and not just because playing it is bringing back terrible flashbacks of show's tumble from grace. Most of the complaints - it's currently sitting at a "mixed" rating on Steam - revolve around Kingsroad's monetisation, with players lambasting its "filthy microtransactions", and calling it "greedy", a "money grab", and "like a mobile game on steroids", with talk of $20 dollar battle passes, $15 subscriptions, paid progression, and more.
</p>
<p>
Still, if you fancy doing a little wave at Jon Snow, Game of Thrones: Kingsroad will be available for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3183280/Game_of_Thrones_Kingsroad/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-e19c7c">Epic,</a> and the Windows Store when it gets its full free-to-play launch on 21st May. And if you'd prefer to play on mobile (cross-saves are supported), you can also pick it up on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/game-of-thrones-kingsroad/id6483917232">iOS App Store</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.netmarble.got">Android Google Play Store</a>. If nothing else, it's one way to pass the time waiting for George R. R. Martin to finish up The Winds of Winter.

            <p>
In another sign of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> and Disney cosying up under the covers, you can now unlock a free First Order Stormtrooper skin by linking your MyDisney account to the game. 
</p>
<p>
This isn't your Disney+ account, to be clear, and there's no need to be subscribed elsewhere. And it provides another sign-in option for Fortnite, just like when the game added Lego account sign-ins as an option previously.
</p>
<p>
The likely intended benefit of this freebie is that Fortnite itself is now being flooded by players showing off their new Stormtrooper skin, setting the vibe for the game's impending Star Wars season that's set to take over later this week and run until early June. 
</p>
<p>
The next battle pass will feature Emperor Palpatine, Poe Dameron and General Grievous, as well as Chewbacca-styled Cuddle Team Leader and a Sith/Jedi remix of Evie. There's no sign of Darth Jar Jar here, so my guess would be you'll need to stump up for him separately via the in-game shop.
</p>
<p>
As well as all that, Fortnite will be hosting an early watch party and premiere of the first two episodes of the next Star Wars: Tales of the Underworld season from 2nd May, before their arrival on Disney+. If you're a fan of Asajj Ventress from The Clone Wars and The Bad Batch, you should probably tune in. (And if you do, you'll unlock a free Asajj Ventress loading screen.)
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-wont-police-ai-generated-thumbnail-images-and-epic-games-says-detecting-them-will-likely-become-impossible">Fortnite recently confirmed it won't block AI-generated thumbnail images</a>, as Epic Games says detecting them will eventually become impossible.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-adds-balatro-ark-survival-ascended-and-warhammer-40k-boltgun-for-may-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>PS Plus subscribers will add <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2024-full-house/">Balatro</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-premium-mods-on-consoles-qa-by-2030-time-spent-on-ugc-will-be-way-bigger/">Ark: Survival Ascended</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-boltgun-old-school-fps-2023/">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a> to their libraries for May 2025.</p>
<p>PS Plus subscribers on every tier, including the base-level Essential tier, will be able to add these games to their libraries beginning <strong>May 6, 2025</strong>, a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/30/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-may-ark-survival-ascended-balatro-warhammer-40000-boltgun/">PlayStation Blog</a> announced. The final day to grab the games for April 2025, which are RoboCop: Rogue City, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth - Hacker's Memory, is <strong>May 5, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>It's a pretty strong month overall for PlayStation Plus subscribers, who can at least look forward to trying these games after the most recent PS Plus news. Sony recently confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-removing-20-games-from-ps-plus-including-some-first-party-titles-just-after-the-latest-ps-plus-price-hike/">over 20 games would exit</a> the game catalogs for PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Premium subscribers, including first-party titles like the first two Resistance games. Neither of which are playable on PS5, except through the PS Plus Premium classic's game catalog.</p>
<p>Removing first-party titles from its own subscription service isn't anything new for PlayStation, but it did feel even more egregious since this happened after the latest price hike for the service in over 20 countries. The United States has been left out for now, but Canada, Australia, Mexico, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, Colombia, Chile, and others are all already dealing with the higher prices.</p>
<p>Other notable games exiting soon are Grand Theft Auto V, Ghostrunner, and Infamous: Second Son, which is another first-party title, but at least it is still playable on PS5 and PS4 without having access to it through a PS Plus subscription.</p>
<p>The three games for May 2025 will be available to grab until June 2, and by then, we'll know which games PlayStation will use to try and keep players happy for June 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-rumble-global-release-delayed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has announced that upcoming free-to-play battle royale-style party game&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>has been delayed, and the studio hasn't announced a new release date for the game either.</p>

<p>The game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-rumble-release-date" rel="nofollow">originally due to launch</a> on May 8th, but in <a href="https://x.com/Sonic_Rumble/status/1917453885326688412" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post on X</a>, Sega says it's made the "difficult decision" to delay the game's release indefinitely. The studio says it wants to "build the kind of high-quality, long-lasting&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>game" its players deserve.</p>

<p>Sega says it knows the news of <i>Sonic Rumble</i>'s delay will be "disappointing" to fans, but that it thinks taking the extra time to work on the game is the "right choice for the future of&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble</em>".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-rumble-release-date-delayed-death-egg.jpg?itok=9oRVUmcG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-rumble-release-date-delayed-death-egg.jpg?itok=lvLlKF54 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>won't be coming in early May as originally planned.</figcaption></figure><p>Although no new release date is forthcoming at the moment, Sega says it will update fans "as soon as we get closer", so hopefully, you won't be waiting too long for a new&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>release date.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble</em>, it's a&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>-esque free-to-play battle royale party game coming to PC and mobile...well, at some point in the near future, apparently.</p>

<p>The game comes with a range of modes, including a classic-style Run mode, which sees players racing against one another, as well as Ring Battle and more.</p>

<p>Sega says the game has been designed with shorter games in mind, ensuring that anyone can pick up and play&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>"in their spare time".</p>




<p>As you'd probably expect, a range of&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>characters will be available for you to play as, including Sonic himself (naturally), as well as Shadow, Tails, Amy, and many more.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>when it launches at some point in the future on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2951690/Sonic_Rumble/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sega.sonicrumble&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/ph/app/sonic-rumble/id6511215584" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>. Hopefully, Sega will announce a new&nbsp;<em>Sonic Rumble&nbsp;</em>release date sometime soon, so stay tuned for more.</p>

Generally, for the vast majority of the game, <strong>when you step into a new area, most of the enemies will all be weak to one specific element</strong>.You’ll want to build around that.

In addition, <strong>every skill also can activate a modifier for itself depending on if particular Stains are on the board</strong>. </p><p>For example, Immolation is Lune’s bread-and-butter Fire Skill.

But you’re easily 20 hours in before you have to factor that in. In the early going, it’s best just to get familiar with which Pictos to pain up to maximize weaknesses. Speaking of…</p><h2 id="h247431"><a id="synergy"></a>Recommended builds/synergy</h2><p>In the early going, Lune will be drowning in Fire-focused Pictos/Lumina, so by all means, build Pictos/Lumina around that up through the Gestral Village. Keep at least three burns on at any given time and you’ll be doing your part. The Lighterim Weapon allowing you to build up Burns without a specific skill is also going to be a huge help, especially when Maelle joins and a single burning enemy is all it takes to put her in Virtuose mode. Even later, though, Fire is gonna be your go-to element. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-how-long-to-beat-1851777481&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-how-long-to-beat-1851777481">How Long Of A Journey Are You Signing Up For With <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><div><p><strong>While Ice won’t do much to damage every enemy, it does generate Stains that boost Fire attacks</strong>, and even better, <strong>Ice actually slow enemies down no matter what they’re weak to</strong>, which is a huge help when facing off against baddies fast enough to schedule two turns in a row. That also means speedsters are a damn fine excuse to get a board of four Ice Stains, then unleash Hell at your leisure. Way later, that can be very literal, but, we’re here just to get you on your way.</p><p>All this stuff does cost quite a bit of AP, though, and Lune’s base attack isn’t always able to generate enough. <strong>Energizing Attack and Dead Energy Pictos/Lumina can help</strong> with that, especially the latter since an enemy that dies from Lune casting the spell that set it on Fire still counts, giving her a nice AP bonus when you least expect it.</p></div><h2 id="h247432"><a id="skills"></a>Skills to aim for</h2><figure id="" data-id="29fc598343ac7de39c5b3ec29af509a5" data-recommend-id="image://29fc598343ac7de39c5b3ec29af509a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lune casts a spell at an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lune casts a spell at an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="29fc598343ac7de39c5b3ec29af509a5" data-recommend-id="image://29fc598343ac7de39c5b3ec29af509a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lune casts a spell at an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><br><strong>If there’s any one skill you want to get your hands on as soon as possible, it’s Mayhem.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shotgun-cop-man-review.1177731/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/shotgun-cop-man-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">With your hands full of guns and a warrant for the Devil’s arrest in your pocket, Shotgun Cop Man sends you on a nonstop blitz of new ideas. This short and sweet action-platformer continually reinvents itself across 10 clever worlds, leaving little room for a good idea to get stale. Once I mastered its distinct style of projectile-based movement, barrelling through the circles of hell turned into a pure power fantasy. Even though it’s harder than it should be to chase high scores and better times, I still had a blast gunning for a more optimized run after the credits rolled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shotgun Cop Man’s goofy vibes, flashy acrobatics, and time attack setup transported me back to my middle school days of bypassing the browser security settings in the computer lab to sneak in runs of Flash games like Fancy Pants Adventures or Electricman 2. Granted, this would blow many of those study hall time killers out of the water, but I could still easily see myself racing to the end of its first world with a friend while we’re supposed to be working on a research paper or math homework. It shares the same tight scope and paired back tone, but here those mask a surprisingly deep platformer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Shotgun Cop Man isn’t just a standard run-n-gun shoot-em-up. Instead, the recoil from your shotgun serves as the driving force behind most of the movement. Need to take out some demons to your right? Well, you better make sure the coast is clear to your left when you pull the trigger. This challenging, but ultimately rewarding, system of ballistic blowback fills in for genre-standards like jumping or dashing midair, while firing your sidearm — which ranges from a satisfyingly snappy but weak pistol to a powerful gatling gun — allows you to hover midair or make more precise hops.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can’t just spray and pray you wind up on the next platform, though. Each weapon has limited ammo, keeping Shotgun Cop Man relatively grounded: the shotgun itself only holds three shells at a time, so he needs to touch terra firma to reload. That said, sidearms tend to have bigger magazines, allowing for a reliable second option to fall back on when you need to get to the ground and take another shot at a tough jump. This restrained approach brings a levelheaded balance to Shotgun Cop Man that encourages mayhem and speed without leaving precision and skill in the dust.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Shotgun Cop Man bets big on its platforming acumen, and it pays off.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">To make matters more difficult, Shotgun Cop Man also has to contend with the armies of Hell as he chases down their leader. Aside from a few combat-focused levels that blend each circle of Hell’s unique mechanics into an arena-style showdown, as well as the requisite boss that shows up at the end of each 17-level world, Shotgun Cop Man is all about movement. Because of that, enemies play second fiddle here, being treated as platforming obstacles masterfully woven into each level. They act like the bright-red explosive barrels of a 3D shooter, providing the satisfaction of popping them while offering direction on where and when to shoot. Shotgun Cop Man bets big on its platforming acumen rather than falling in-line with other action platformer successes like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/04/18/katana-zero-review"><u>Katana Zero</u></a>, and it pays off in spades.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, this unique movement takes quite some time to get used to, especially if you’re playing with a controller: Pointing in two different directions like a twin-stick shooter (left for walking, right for aiming) makes for an unnatural platformer control scheme. Wrapping my head around it felt like being asked to rub my belly and pat my head at the same time. Unfortunately, there’s really no better way to make this specific type of movement work on the sticks, though it is much more comfortable with a keyboard and mouse. Thankfully, Shotgun Cop Man’s accessibility features allow you to skip certain inputs, like making it so you pick up new sidearms automatically, so you can tweak things to be much more comfortable. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was halfway through the roughly five hour campaign by the time I felt like I’d fully climbed its relatively steep learning curve, mastering this propulsion-based blend of combat and movement. Normally, this initial struggle would be a knock against it, but Shotgun Cop Man constantly introduces and innovates on new ideas while rewarding your growing mastery of them. It also sets up systems that successfully encouraged me to obsessively replay levels in an attempt to shave nanoseconds off my time. This potent blend dangles an appetizing carrot-on-a-stick to gnash at in bite-sized speedruns once you’ve found your footing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When he inevitably takes a hit, Shotgun Cop Man’s heart comically pops out of his body. Running into it will pick it up and restore health, but he’ll die in one hit without it. When that happens, the camera zooms in on his oddly detailed face as he says, “I die,” in a goofy, computerized voice. This minimal, self-aware sense of humor sets the tone overall, as there’s otherwise not much of a premise to explain here (and developer Dead Toast Entertainment even pokes fun at this in the credits by putting quotes around the word “Story”). You’re a cop with a shotgun trying to arrest the Devil. Naturally, Old Scratch doesn’t play ball. Each time our hero catches up to him, Satan tells the boy in blue to shove it, and you continue on your chase once more. It’s thin, but it works, and is just amusing enough to keep things moving.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Charlie's Favorite Action Platformers</h3><p>these are some of my favorite action platformers!</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, that sense of humor eventually becomes Shotgun Cop Man’s Waterloo. Each time it zooms in on his face as he points out the obvious, it takes far too long to get back into the action. It takes as many as three button presses to respawn, and even longer to restart a level. I know how silly this sounds in the face of everything Shotgun Cop Man gets right, but in a game where you’ll be dying and trying again quite a bit, these add up to completely hamper any sense of momentum. That’s especially glaring when every level in Shotgun Cop Man grades your performance on whether or not you killed every enemy, beat the par time, took any damage, or did all three of those in the same run. In what feels like a big oversight, there’s no quick level restart button when you die, so to chase that perfect run, you need to resume the level after that death, pause, and then hit the retry option from there. Because Shotgun Cop Man trades in seconds and milliseconds (most levels took me less than a minute to complete), this otherwise small bump in the road became an outsized, unnecessary part of mastering each level.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, for a game that only took me about five hours to see from end to end, Shotgun Cop Man crams in a staggeringly impressive range of innovations and spins on its seemingly simple run-and-shoot formula. It ricochets from idea to idea, never allowing a mechanic to get old — in fact, there are quite a few I wish got some more time to shine, like reactive floors, which alternate between safe and deadly each time they’re shot, or clever box-moving puzzles that put your understanding of each weapon’s power to the test. Most mechanics get a chance to shine before being woven into more new mechanics later on, but there’s also an impressive level creator (exclusive to the PC version) that lets you toy with some of these ideas yourself if you feel like your favorite didn’t get its time in the sun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m not much of a level designer myself, but the creation suite provides a robust toy chest for dedicated designers to mess around with. It doesn’t just feature tools that enable you to recreate or expand upon any clever idea found in the campaign, it even includes wholly unique mechanics that aren’t found there, like extra enemy and NPC types. I didn’t get to try any user-created levels during the pre-release period, but I’m really excited to see what people think up once Shotgun Cop Man is out in the wild.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Shotgun Cop Man is a left field nostalgia trip that hits just about every shot from the volley it unloads — from its engaging, refined movement to its distinct level design ideas to its compelling time trials. That makes it all the more disappointing that it’s missing a couple of load-bearing features for any game that’s all about sanding down your runs to the last second, like a way to quickly restart from the start of a level after each death. Still, using firearms to fly through the air is a total blast, and I’m excited to get back to chasing better times and more precise runs through the underworld.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s something Activision has monetized for years now, doubling down on the fanbase’s reputation for kicking back and relaxing while going for those killstreaks. But with Black Ops 6 and Warzone, the 4/20 microtransactions have leveled up, and now Seth Rogen is in the game some fans have had enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-3-to-roll-out-seth-rogen-operator-with-reloaded-update-later-this-week">The Season 03 Reloaded update</a>, out tomorrow, May 1, is pretty much all about 4/20 culture, even though it arrives 11 days after the day itself. The Joint Operations (I see what they did there) Limited Time Mode is a Black Ops 6 multiplayer variant that adds modifiers, including a +420 Score Bonus (I see what they did there), 3rd Person, Visual Impairment, Double Health, Hardcore, Paranoia Sounds, Low Gravity, Double Jump, and Increased Movement Speed (I see what they did there, etc).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a similar situation over in battle royale Warzone. The Verdansk Limited Time Mode High Trip Resurgence (I’m not saying it again) challenges players to “smoke” the competition (nope, I’m not saying it).</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/30/bo6-s03r-announcement-024-1746023010288.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Yes, it's 4/20 time again in Call of Duty. Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there’s the High Art event, which includes yet another 1,100 COD Point-premium event pass (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activisions-costly-call-of-duty-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-crossover-has-some-players-saying-black-ops-6-should-just-go-free-to-play-at-this-point">we’ve been through this before with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>). This time, world famous pothead Seth Rogen is the actual star of the event pass, with exclusive skins in the premium track. Take that, Jay &amp; Silent Bob.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The event Blaze of Glory (MP, ZM, WZ) runs from May 6-15, and tasks players with collecting Blaze Bucks dropped by eliminated enemies and found in supply caches in Warzone. Even Nuketown, perhaps Call of Duty’s most popular map, is getting a 4/20 makeover as it becomes Blazetown. Check it out in the video below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">OK so, that’s <em>a lot</em>. Multiple 4/20 events, 4/20 modifiers, a 4/20 Nuketown, and, for the first time, a 4/20 premium event pass. Is it all a bit… much? Is it time for Call of Duty to move on?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ahead of the Season 03 Reloaded update going live this week, 4/20 has become the big talking point within Call of Duty's online community, particularly within the online Black Ops 6 community. “What's with the 420 obsession?” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1kaxlm9/whats_with_the_420_obsession/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">asked redditor 12MillionDollarMan</a> in a post upvoted over 1,100 times.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was funny like 15 years ago in MW2 with the joint ops and high command titles but now it’s f*** obsessed levels it’s not even funny anymore, just over done.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/30/bo6-s03r-announcement-025-1746023080604.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Will you pay out for that Seth Rogen skin? Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“It was just recently 4/20 and they lowkey suck at scheduling stuff properly,” added ih8atlascorp. “I personally don't care for it, and do think it's getting overplayed, but at the same time, there's a clear market if they keep releasing more, so power to those who choose to spend their money on this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I do think the Host Rogen skin is at least cool looking though. Feel like they could've easily just done a celebrity event pass for this with him. First one just looks goofy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yea; I don't mind 420 or weed; it just feels weird that this year's COD has felt glued to it,” commented  Hambino0400. “I'm sure it sells stupid good which is why but still; I just would like some variety.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It just keeps getting worse with the 'Weed' stuff. Now Seth Rogen is in on it?” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1kb4rcz/it_just_keeps_getting_worse_with_the_weed_stuff/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">complained ShortPeaness4074 in another post</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others have no problem with COD’s ongoing 4/20 obsession, and suggest players shouldn’t be surprised to see Activision continue to lean into it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don't know why anyone is shocked in any capacity, if you've played the game longer than five minutes almost every lobby has a 420 in at least one person's name, a good portion of this demographic is potheads,” said RedHatRogue. “People are buying this shit, hell I bought the weed wizard with rewards points I had lying around because he looked funny.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As has been pointed out, Activision would ditch the 4/20 updates if they weren’t popular enough to justify the time, effort, and expense it takes to put them together. Call of Duty players love this stuff, and they probably always will.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warzone, with its recently launched return to Verdansk, is generally speaking in a good place, with fans loving the nostalgia fuelled return to the map that started it all.

        <p>And some big fan requests.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft has finally lifted the lid on what to expect from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' post-launch plans, which will include "regular" dollops of extra story missions, fan-requested features and a New Game Plus option. 
</p>
<p>
New story "drops" will be free, provide new allies for your base, fresh abilities and activities, and "additional backstory that will permanently impact the game", Ubisoft has said.
</p>
<p>
There will also be a focus on further fleshing out side characters, as evidenced by the first mission, due early next month, which will centre on Portuguese character Luis Frois.

<p>
Other upcoming free content includes new difficulty settings, photo mode updates (including poses), extra parkour options, plus additional Codex updates and battle pass-esque Projects. There's also mention of "special collaborations" - which sound a lot like Assassin's Creed is dipping its toe back into crossover territory. (Remember when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-assassins-creed-origins-will-get-a-chocobo-horse">Chocobo turned up in Assassin's Creed Origins</a>?)
</p>
<p>
There's less detail, for now, on Shadows' first major expansion Claws of Awaji. Ubisoft noted today that the add-on - provided free to those who pre-ordered Shadows - will be set after the game's current epilogue, and pick up both Naoe and Yasuke's ongoing stories. When will it arrive? Ubisoft isn't telling - instead saying simply it'll launch "later this year".
</p>
<p>
Other gameplay changes coming include a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-fans-have-a-list-of-features-ubisoft-should-add-next">slew of fan-requests that Eurogamer noted shortly after Shadows' launch</a>, including the ability to remove your headgear in cutscenes. Additional parkour options such as height-gaining back and side ejects plus a new vertical ledge jump are also on the way.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Assassin's Creed Shadows free post-launch roadmap:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Early May:</strong> The Works of Luis Frois story mission, codex update, quality of life improvements</li>
<li><strong>Late May:</strong> First "special collaboration", parkour update, photo mode update</li>
<li><strong>June:</strong> Second story mission including new ally, new difficulty settings, gameplay immersion options, open world alarm system, headgear in cutscene option</li>
<li><strong>Future:</strong> New Game Plus, more story missions, additional community feedback updates, further special collaborations, codex updates, rewards and Animus content</li>
</ul>
<p>
"Majestic in scope, impressive in detail, Assassin's Creed Shadows honours the beauty of feudal Japan," I wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-review">Eurogamer's Assassin's Creed Shadows review</a>, "even if its strongest moments are saved for the personal stories of its two protagonists."

<ul>

</figure>
<p>A particular highlight here is the poker-themed roguelike Balatro. Released last year, Balatro <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poker-themed-roguelike-balatro-deals-out-1m-sales-in-first-month">sold 1m copies in its first month</a> and then proceeded to  scoop up numerous awards, most recently including a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-is-this-years-big-winner-at-the-bafta-game-awards">BAFTA for Best Debut game</a>.</p>
<p>"A poker roguelike is such a brilliant idea you almost don't need to make it to see how clever it is. There are a few of these, and Balatro is comfortably the best I've played. It really is ingenious - and it's also ingeniously simple," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-review">Eurogamer's Balatro review</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we quite enjoyed the boltgun in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/warhammer-40000-boltgun">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a>, with Rick Lane stating it "earns a place in the pantheon of great video game weapons" in Eurogamer's review. However, he didn't feel the rest of the game's arsenal could quite live up to the thrill of the boltgun.</p>
<p>"If you want to make a big ol' mess with one excellent gun and several other decent ones, Boltgun satisfies this desire. A few design tweaks and a little more attention to detail would elevate it from a good shooter into a great one, but as a throwback starter course to the hotly anticipated main that is Space Marine 2, Boltgun does an acceptable job of stimulating the tastebuds," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warhammer-40k-boltgun-review-a-signature-weapon-so-good-it-breaks-the-game">Eurogamer's Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun review</a>.</p>
<p>Last up, we have <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-survival-ascended">Ark: Survival Ascended</a>, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-2-delayed-survival-evolved-official-servers-to-shut-down-later-this-year">Unreal Engine 5 "next-generation remake" of the original Ark game</a>. Our Matt took the souped up Ark for a whirl on its release, calling it "a striking upgrade", but one that still has some flaws.</p>
<p>"Ark has long felt like a game that came into being through sheer fluke rather than any notable design acumen on the part of Wildcard, and it's a sense only exacerbated in Ascended. There just doesn't seem to be any consistency of vision here; you get new dinosaurs and new building pieces, a photo mode, cross-platform support - but tutorials are non-existent; I'm still stuck laboriously faffing around with an awkward, unintuitive inventory system; balance is all over the place, and on it goes," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ark-survival-ascended-is-a-striking-upgrade-but-old-problems-set-alarm-bells-ringing">Eurogamer's Ark: Survival Ascended feature from 2023</a>.</p>
<p>"Ark: Survival Ascended is just an incredibly weird beast, a remake absolutely in thrall of the shiny stuff but with minimal regard for the fundamental annoyances that have long plagued the game."</p>
<p>The above three games will be available for PS Plus subscribers until 2nd June.</p>

<p>As a reminder, with the approach of a new month, it does mean this is your last chance to get your mitts on April's PS Plus games.</p>
<p>PlayStation Plus members have until 5th May to add <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-your-ps-plus-games-for-april">RoboCop: Rogue City, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth – Hacker’s Memory to their game library</a>.</p>

Shortly after its win at The Game Awards, Quebec-based developer Sabotage Studio announced that more than<a href="https://wccftech.com/classic-turn-based-rpg-sea-of-stars-surpassed-4-million-players-across-all-platforms-and-subscription-services/"> 4 million players</a> had jumped into Sea of Stars.</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons to love Sea of Stars, and there's soon going to be another one. The release date for its upcoming free DLC, Throes of the Watchmaker, has just been announced for <strong>May 20, 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Players who own Sea of Stars across all platforms will be able to download the DLC once it launches in a few weeks' time (from time of writing) and enjoy an extra 8 hours of gameplay, with a side-adventure for the sibling solstice warriors Valere and Zale.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sea of Stars: Throes of the Watchmaker DLC | Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgFi2jXwzVI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Throes of the Watchmaker takes the two heroes on a miniature adventure to the land of Horloge, which is currently overrun by an evil carnival. By the look of the trailer, Valere and Zale will also have to contend with evil versions of themselves in their quest to cut short the carnival's sadistic fun on the innocent people of Horloge.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/12/sea-of-stars-dawn-of-equinox-devs-deep-dive-into-3-player-co-op-and-combat-2-0-live-today/">last major update</a> Sea of Stars received added three-player co-op, both locally and online, and made sweeping changes to combat that all seem to be present in Throes of the Watchmaker. The DLC will also introduce new classes for Valere and Zale, and a new playable character called Arty. Sabotage Studio also confirmed that this DLC will be playable in three-player co-op.</p>

            <p>"A beautifully made retro-inspired <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> that will instantly transport you back to the 16-bit golden years, for better or worse," was how Katherine Castle (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sea-of-stars-review">summarised</a> Sea Of Stars, a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>-style pixelart sojourn down memory lane from Sabotage Studios, creators of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-messenger">The Messenger</a>. I imagine it's better rather than worse for the addition of some sizeable, circus-themed free DLC, Throes Of The Watchmaker.</p>
<p>Out 20th May, the expansion adds a new playable character, Arty, together with an estimated eight hours of new areas, music, dungeons, minigames, enemies, bosses, puzzles, and playable classes for original protagonists Valere and Zale. Run your rose-tinted retinas over this trailer.</p><!--more--> <figure>

</figure>
<p>Throes Of The Watchmaker is designed to be played after you've completed Sea Of Stars itself, with a "self-contained progression loop featuring completely new classes, skills and combos". If I'm interpreting that last bit correctly, what you do here won't affect your progression elsewhere in the game.</p>
<p>The setting is basically: what if somebody turned the Backrooms into a creepy clockwork carnival? Zale and Valere must master various funfair talents to prevail: Zale swaps his sword for the ability to juggle, while Valere trades her staff for a crash-course in circus tumbling. The aforesaid Arty, meanwhile, is a jaunty robo sharpshooter with hot pink fittings. He puts me a little in mind of the Casino Night Zone. Bet there's some kind of small fluffy animal inside that carapace.</p>
<p>The DLC apparently benefits from a cinematic budget equivalent to that of the main game, with a new soundtrack contributed by Eric W. Brown and original Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Even as a stranger to the base game, I like the frolicsome wackiness of it all. The DLC has a touch of Majora's Mask to it, I reckon. Here's a story blurb with more:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Throes of the Watchmaker returns to one of the most intriguing characters encountered in Sea of Stars' main adventure - the genius inventor known as the Watchmaker, architect of the Clockwork Castle and creator of Wheels, a tabletop pastime enjoyed throughout Sea of Stars' world. The DLC explores a fascinating invention by the Watchmaker, the miniature clockwork world of Horloge, a land threatened by a cursed carnival. Zale and Valere must adapt to Horloge's peculiar rules to fully realize their mastery of Sun and Moon powers, the abilities they've refined since the beginning of Sea of Stars' central journey to stop the Fleshmancer with Eclipse Magic."</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, it's out 20th May. Throes Of The Watchmaker follows the addition of local co-op in Dawn of Equinox. Did you get a chance to try that?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

All PS Plus members will be able to claim a trio of freebies starting May 6--<strong>Ark: Survival Evolved</strong>, <strong>Balatro</strong>, and <strong>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</strong>.

The game is deceptively simple at first, but as you dig deeper into it, you'll find several twists and turns that require you to create various synergies and builds with the cards you have on hand. All of this adds up to an immensely satisfying experience as you run through various strategies, and it was one of our picks for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamespots-10-best-games-of-2024/2900-6045/">10 best games of 2024</a>.</p><p>One of the big names in the survival genre, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ark-survival-evolved-review/1900-6416754/" data-ref-id="1900-6416754">Ark: Survival Evolved</a> gives you all the tools you need to thrive in a world of prehistoric creatures and alien mysteries. This version of the game has been rebuilt from the ground up with Unreal Engine 5, and it features numerous quality-of-life upgrades as well. You'll also have access to all of Ark’s worlds here, and there's public online multiplayer for up to 70 players.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4485249-ps-plus-may-2025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485249" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4485249-ps-plus-may-2025.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485249"></a><figcaption>PlayStation Plus games for May 2025</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4485249-ps-plus-may-2025.jpg"></figure><p>Finally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/warhammer-40000-boltgun-review-purge-and-tear/1900-6418066/" data-ref-id="1900-6418066">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a> is a boomer-shooter that looks like it was ripped straight from a PC running a Windows 95 operating system on it. It goes all in on its Warhammer 40K setting, offering fast-paced action and a satisfying arsenal of weapons to wield against the enemies of humanity, like Chaos Space Marines and the daemons who follow them into battle.</p><p>As a reminder, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/these-are-the-games-leaving-ps-plus-premium-and-extra-in-may-2025/2900-6499/" data-ref-id="2900-6499">several games will also be leaving PS Plus Premium and Extra in May</a>, so you have a short amount of time to check out GTA V, Ghostrunner, Batman: Arkham Knight, and several other titles.</p><h2>PlayStation Plus free games for May 2025</h2><p><em>Available May 6 until June 2.</em></p><ul><li>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun (PS5, PS4)</li><li>Ark: Survival Evolved (PS5)</li><li>Balatro (PS5, PS4)</li></ul>
