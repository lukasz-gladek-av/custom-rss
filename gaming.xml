			<p>It’s always sad to see great games receding back into the mists of time, whether they’re all-time greats trapped on defunct consoles and operating systems, or smaller indie titles under the sheer weight of modern game releases. At least some of these games are given the opportunity to leap back to the forefront and relevance, and thankfully it means that Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is back to be enjoyed by a brand new generation.</p>
<p><iframe title="Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door – Overview Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gCV-uTRULn8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Through the Nintendo Switch’s life, Nintendo has been far from consistent in how it’s treated the GameCube. After largely ignoring it for the first few years, there’s then been emulator-based ports, enhanced HD ports, and full remakes. Thankfully, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door is getting the full works, a ground-up rebuild of the game in a new engine, making one of, if not the best entry in this beloved series available to play on the latest Nintendo hardware.</p>


<p>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door typifies the kind of individuality that the earlier games in the series were able to cultivate. Sure, there’ Goombas, Koopas and Toads all over the shop, but they’re joined by new and original characters and creatures throughout. From the small secretive critters known as Punies, to the X-nauts, the Three Shadows and beyond, they stand out when compared to later games –&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/15/paper-mario-the-origami-king-review/">The Origami King</a>, for example, felt like it was almost entirely Toads wearing different hats. Having this breadth of characters also helps to feed into a script that’s wonderfully humorous and quirky throughout.</p>


<p>There’s also a darker twist to the world you’re exploring. The Thousand-Year Door opens with Paper Mario summoned to Rogueport, a town which is as rough as you could imagine for a Mario game, from the graffiti and background gang encounters, to the fact that there’s a literal hanging frame right in the middle of the town square! There’s massive shifts in the visual design of the places you visit, when comparing Rogueport to the charming village of Petalburg, and then the utterly distinctive Boggly Woods with its colourful floor pattern contrasting with black tree trunks, white foliage and grey creatures.</p>
<p>The whole game has been remade with a crafted appearance that’s more in keeping with the last few entries in the series. You can see card edges and folds in so many objects and through the scenery, while Mario and other characters have the appearance of thick card stock –&nbsp;Card Mario isn’t quite as catchy, though –&nbsp;and the battle scene in particular now feels like a pop-up diorama, still with the theatre curtains and audience members watching on.</p>

<p>The one jarring element of this makeover for me remains the shiny and reflective floor, which doesn’t feel in keeping with the rest of the art style –&nbsp;it makes sense for a metal floor, sure, but less so for grass or woods. It’s the one effect that I’d like to have been used more sparingly, but it’s a small quibble when we have the loveliness of dynamic lights, or the floor in Boggly Woods going from a static colour gradient to a colour-shifting iridescence.</p>
<p>Another important factor for a Paper Mario game is the combat, and here we get to go back to the good old turn-based with timed actions from the original. This is an RPG of small numbers, with health measured in the tens, damage dealt in the single digits, and with one partner character at a time. It’s a refreshing simplification after the more puzzle-like combat of the most recent game, Paper Mario: The Original King, or the cards system from the 2010s. Thanks to the widescreen view, the UI has been made less cluttered, and all of the attack button timings have refreshed graphical elements.</p>

<p>There’s also a relatively minimalist character progression system. Every 100 Star Points earned in battle lets you level up and increase health points, flower points (for special attacks), or badge points. It’s the latter one that is generally more important to get, as everything beyond your core abilities and items you earn (like better boots for jumping) depends on applying badges.</p>
<p>The more badge points you have, the more badges you can apply, which will either buff you or your allies in combat, add new attacks… or make your attacks sounds different. You’ll want to try and explore every nook and cranny to find Star Pieces, which is one way that you can buy more badges, find chests that can net you extra badges, or just use regular coins at certain shops.</p>

<p>Really the main foible of The Thousand-Year Door was and is the amount of backtracking that can be involved in some areas and chapters. You can feel it seeping into the game fairly early on as you go hither and tither, and it’s maybe made a little more noticeable by how broken up some areas are into separate rooms and through various pipes. This remakes quality of life improvements feel more subtle than certain other remasters, but there are still plenty of good improvements. The Warp Pipe room is overhauled to make switching regions quicker and easier to access, you can nudge Goombella for advice with a single button press, switch partner characters without dipping into menus, and there’s some more helper characters sprinkled through the world for those that need them.</p>

					<p>It seemed like we’d never see another game like <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a>. While there have been plenty of Paper Mario games over the past couple of decades, Nintendo has intentionally steered the series away from the RPG mechanics, original characters, and sharp-edged humor it was initially known for. As a result, Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door has taken on a certain symbolic importance to some spurned fans even though it wasn’t a particularly big hit in its day. Needless to say, it came as a bit of a shock when Nintendo announced a full remake of the game last year.</p>
<p>Does Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door still stack up in 2024? Or should Nintendo have left this paper filed under “N” for Nostalgia? Time to see if this remake is still a cut above…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd13.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As in the original game, the events of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door are set in motion when Princess Peach’s holiday gets sidetracked in the sketchy town of Rogueport. There she’s given a map that points toward The Thousand-Year Door, which is located beneath the town and said to contain some sort of powerful and ominous “treasure.” Peach invites Mario to dig into this mystery, but by the time he arrives in Rogueport, a mysterious group known as the X-Nauts has kidnapped her. From there, the story follows Mario as he collects the Crystal Stars that power the Thousand-Year Door, with occasional check-ins with Bowser as he attempts to head off both Mario and the X-Nauts and Princess Peach as she gets dragged into a, shall we say, <em>unique</em> relationship with the X-Nauts’ HAL-9000-like computer.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd10.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While I'll admit don’t have an encyclopedic memory of every line in the original version of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, the writing in the remake is largely unchanged, down to NPCs making now-very-dated references to hot new games like Fire Emblem on the GBA. There are a few minor tweaks, such as party member Vivian’s characterization now being truer to the original Japanese version of the game, but that clever snap you remember remains. You could argue the writing doesn’t <em>quite</em> stand out like it once did as the kind of self-deprecating meta humor found in The Thousand-Year Door is now a much more common ingredient in Nintendo games. That said, I still spent a good portion of my time with the new TTYD smiling and chuckling at various fun moments I’d forgotten.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd9.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In terms of gameplay, this is Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door as you remember it. If you’re afraid Nintendo may have secretly cut out all the tasty RPG bits, breathe easy. Leveling up by earning Star Points and customizing your play style with badges is still very much a thing. As before, combat combines turn-based decisions with well-timed button presses that either increase your offense or reduce the damage you take from enemies. The UI during battles is significantly cleaner and more readable now, but beyond that, not much has changed.</p>
<p>The game's level design also seems largely identical, perhaps to a fault. While more recent Paper Mario titles arguably backslid in terms of story and combat, they offered undeniable improvements in level design. By contrast, most of the areas in The Thousand-Year Door consist of a series of very straightforward linear paths littered with respawning enemies and the occasional puzzle, with players frequently having to engage in repetitive tasks and backtracking.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd11.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Thankfully, a certain degree of effort has been made to tone down some of the more laborious aspects of The Thousand-Year Door. A better-designed quick-travel warp pipe room that can be accessed directly from the main plaza in Rogueport makes getting around later in the game a bit less of a hassle and some of the more repetitive chapters have had extra warp pipes added that eliminate some, but not all, the shlepping back and forth (I’m only halfway joking when I say the new Chapter 4 pipe shown above added a solid half-point to my score all on its own). That said, while developer Intelligent Systems has sanded down some of TTYD’s rough edges, there’s still a lot of repetitiveness baked into the game’s design. Part of me can’t help but dream of a more ambitious remake of TTYD where, say, the game’s great-in-concept pro-wrestling-themed chapter wasn’t such a deja-vu-inducing grind to get through.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpapermariottyd12.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>When it comes to actual substantive changes, it seems Intelligent Systems mostly focused on The Thousand-Year Door’s visuals. While this may look like a simple remastering at first glance, the game has actually been fully rebuilt from the ground up. In addition to generally looking shaper, the paper theme is pushed harder, with almost everything in the game now looking as if it’s made of cardboard and origami. Improved lighting makes some of the moodier sections of the game, like Twilight Town, really pop, and little touches like reflective cobblestones in Rogueport or the background scenery during battles folding out like a popup book add some extra razzle-dazzle. The game is now capped at 30fps, but it doesn’t matter all that much as this isn’t exactly a hardcore action game and the various quick time button inputs during battles still feel just fine. Unlike some other recent Nintendo titles, that 30fps mostly remains solid, with only very brief hiccups during some of the flashier cutscenes.</p>
<p>Beyond the pretty new visuals, you have to dig into The Thousand-Year Door remake’s UI and menus to find any other new additions. A new quick-select wheel makes switching characters much less irritating and there’s now a “Notes” section where you can keep track of Trouble Center tasks, Star Pieces, Shine Sprites, and fortunes. There are also new Art and Sound Galleries, with the former being unlocked if you collect all the Star Pieces in an area.</p>

<p>While I may have come off somewhat critical of Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door in this review, there’s still an undeniable richness and depth to its world that no other game in the series has quite managed to achieve. Rogueport, with its varied cast of ne’er-do-wells and weirdos and countless secrets, is still one of my favorite locales I’ve ever visited with Nintendo’s plumber. Even with its minor streamlining, the new TTYD still serves up a solid 25-hour story with plenty of side content to clean up, including perhaps some small new post-game treats. This papery adventure definitely isn’t a lightweight.</p>

<p>While the new Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door preserves the gonzo charm that made the original game a cult classic, not a lot has been done to deal with its padding and other design quirks. If you’re a hardcore Thousand-Year Door fan, worry not, you’re going to love this spiffy new version. If you’re new to the game or weren’t entirely sold the first time around, you’re still likely to find plenty to enjoy here, but you may also notice a few tattered edges.</p>

  <p id="lgjP0h">If you’re looking to add some <a href="https://www.polygon.com/deals/24152211/pokemon-center-bean-bags-shop-order-lechonk-gengar-jigglypuff">big-headed cutie patooties</a> to your <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24063771/life-size-psyduck-the-pokemon-center-buy-pre-order">Pokémon plushie collection</a>, well, you’re in luck. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon">The Pokémon Company International</a> announced Tuesday that it is bringing the colorful and playful Pokémon Soda Pop Plush collection stateside. Starting now, U.S.-based fans can purchase the toys exclusively via the <a href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/">Pokémon Center</a> website. </p>
<p id="IvUIGw">The Pokémon Soda Pop Plush line is launching with the three Kanto starters: Bulbasaur, Charmander, and Squirtle. Each toy costs $19.99, and all three Pokémon are available for purchase starting Tuesday. Those are the only Pokémon for now, but the company said that new additions will be “coming soon” to the Pokémon Center store. </p>
<p id="4zh1C0">It’s the first time The Pokémon Company International will sell this particular line of plushies outside of Japan. Each one was designed with Japanese illustrator and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/fkaorism/?hl=en">graphic designer F*Kaori</a>, and each plush reflects the playful and colorful designs of the artist. These starter Pokémon have adorably large eyes to match a disproportionately large head, and lean into a cute pastel color palette. On first glance, they almost kind of look like stuffed versions of Funko Pops of plushies, except these are cuter and they don’t look dead inside. You can view a full photo gallery of the plushies below. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24159333/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-remake-nintendo-switch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="py1weo">There’s an apocryphal folktale that fans of Mario RPGs are fond of sharing. Somewhere along the line, the internet urban legend goes, someone at Nintendo — Miyamoto himself, maybe — had it out for Paper Mario. As a result, everything fans loved about the series — the RPG mechanics, the fun twists on classic Mario characters, the elaborate character-driven stories — became verboten. </p>
<p id="5Fu4mS">Nintendo can be an opaque company; it is very selective in what it shares and quite zealous in its secrecy, so any suggestion of palace intrigue can take on a life of its own in the fandom’s imagination. If there’s any truth to this tale, it’s mostly inferred from <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/paper-mario-origami-king/">a 2020 interview with Paper Mario series developer Intelligent Systems</a>, in which two things are noted: (1) that former Paper Mario producer Kensuke Tanabe embraced a philosophy from Miyamoto to “challenge yourself to create new gameplay,” and (2) that “since <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2012/11/6/3611372/paper-mario-sticker-star-review"><em>Paper Mario: Sticker Star</em></a>, it is no longer possible to modify Mario characters or create original characters that touch on the Mario universe.” These mandates, coincidentally, were opposed to the two things the Paper Mario games seemed best at. </p>
<p id="tTRcFI">The new remake of <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door</em> is bound to reopen this wound. Almost immediately hailed upon its debut as the pinnacle of Mario’s journey into RPGs that began with the Nintendo/Squaresoft collaboration <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23960636/super-mario-rpg-2023-switch-remake-review"><em>Super Mario RPG</em></a>, the 2004 game was beloved for fine-tuning the Mario RPG experience in a colorful world chock full of strange new characters and goofy variations on the usual assortment of Goombas, Bob-ombs, and Koopas, with a witty story to match. </p>

<p id="DU7auo">While nostalgia has papered over (ha) some of <em>The Thousand Year Door</em>’s shaggier aspects — finicky platforming, a pretty slow start, and battles that can drag before you have a suite of fun abilities to deal with them — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24134021/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-preview-nintendo-switch-ttyd">the remake makes its considerable bright spots shine brighter</a>. It’s largely a faithful 1:1 reconstruction of the original; most meaningful nonvisual additions are quality-of-life features meant to keep things moving. Multiple new hint systems make the game’s more byzantine puzzles and obscured objectives easier to parse (if desired), switching out party members is snappier, and the script gets some minor touch-ups.</p>
<p id="Uu0Vlc">Mostly, <em>The Thousand Year Door</em> will likely bum you out about modern Mario games, and how they seem like they’ll never again be this strange. While subsequent Paper Mario games (and its now-defunct sister series, Mario &amp; Luigi) would display comparable wit and charm, they would also feel hamstrung in retrospect, in complying with the aforementioned narrative limitations and Nintendo’s stated desire to largely have each new franchise entry be mechanically distinct. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2020/7/15/21324388/paper-mario-the-origami-king-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Paper Mario: The Origami King</em></a>, for example, isn’t a <em>bad</em> game; it’s just the clearest example of a Paper Mario that would immediately be improved were it free to more fully remake Mario’s world in its image, much like <em>The Thousand-Year Door</em> did. </p>
<p id="K7VljC">Because even with its 20-year-old quirks, <em>The Thousand-Year Door</em> dazzles with its large cast of oddballs, from the gossip-hound Goombella to the perpetually nervous Koops and the way-too-horny Madame Flurrie. (And she is <em>far </em>from the only one. <em>Every lady</em> in this game wants to jump Mario’s bones.) It’s got goofy new villains, the X-Nauts, that offend the sensibilities of classic villains (Bowser and his minions). It is a game where you want to talk to everyone to see if they have something funny to say — you could meet the Koopa who’s hooked on Fire Emblem,<em> </em>or learn just how much <em>no one cares </em>what Luigi is up to, even if he’s saving a whole other kingdom. In short, it uses its deviations from Mario canon to make the vanilla Mario cast shine that much brighter. </p>

<p id="C0fmi3">Of course, Mario is not in trouble currently. Far from it — he might be more popular than he’s ever been, with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23669990/super-mario-bros-movie-review-references">a top-grossing movie in the books</a>, a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23546586/super-nintendo-world-universal-studios-hollywood">theme park</a>, and a regular cadence of critically acclaimed games across genres. Mario and his world are some of Nintendo’s most elastic creations, somehow making just as much sense behind the wheel of a go-kart or in a board game as they do in a 3D adventure. The embittered tenor of Paper Mario fans gets at something important, though: While there is plenty of fun to be had with Mario in 2024, none of it feels <em>daring</em>. </p>
<p id="2jJp9w"><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> is one of the last times that Mario didn’t feel like a carefully managed pop star, never allowed to appear even remotely unlikable. In <em>The Thousand-Year Door</em>, however, he can be a little prick, should you so choose, telling people to “beat it, loser!” as if a little paper mustachioed man was capable of intimidating anyone. The fact that this game is returning on its 20th anniversary, hot off the heels of a remake of the similarly idiosyncratic and beloved <em>Super Mario RPG</em>, hearkens back to a time when a big Mario game could be for a specific kind of person, and not necessarily for everyone. </p>
<p id="wQ6rNL"><small>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</small><small><em> will be released May 23 on Nintendo Switch.

There are certainly some duds like <em>The Uncanny X-Men</em> on the NES from 1989, but by and large, the mutant team has been the star of some pretty important moments in Marvel’s interactive offerings.<br></p><p>A <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wolverine-ps5-insomniac-games-leak-rhysida-hack-sony-1851111188&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wolverine-ps5-insomniac-games-leak-rhysida-hack-sony-1851111188"><em>Wolverine </em>game</a></span> is on the way from <em>Spider-Man </em>developer Insomniac Games, and the studio has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-x-men-wolverine-insomniac-deal-leak-1851111368&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-x-men-wolverine-insomniac-deal-leak-1851111368">exclusive rights to the heroes for the next decade</a></span>.The future looks bright for the X-Men, but let’s look back at some of the best games from their past.</p></div></div><div><p>Professor X’s gifted youngsters have been in several fighting games over the years. <em>X-Men: Mutant Academy </em>and its sequels weren’t the first time a developer put two mutants on opposing sides of a screen, but it is, perhaps, the best one in which the X-Men weren’t sharing the spotlight with someone else.</p><p>The first <em>Mutant Academy </em>was mostly a tie-in for the 2000 <em>X-Men</em> movie, but the sequel doubled the roster and included some wild picks, like the wheelchair-using Professor X in one of his rare playable appearances. 2002's <em>Next Dimension </em>was quite a step forward with more characters (though Professor X did not return, unfortunately), interactable 3D maps, and a story mode to make it a more robust, feature-complete fighting game. The X-Men have shown up in other fighting games like <em>Marvel vs. Capcom </em>(though <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-vs-capcom-infinite-belongs-to-the-fighting-gam-1823043570&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-vs-capcom-infinite-belongs-to-the-fighting-gam-1823043570"><em>Infinite</em></a></span> notably didn’t include them, or any other Marvel superheroes that were part of rights disputes at the time), but the <em>Mutant Academy </em>games are a reminder that they don’t have to be in a crossover with anyone else. These characters make up a stunning fighting roster all by themselves.</p></div><div><p>The <em>Legends </em>games were an <em>X-Men </em>fan’s dream in the mid-2000s because they captured that special feeling where you and your friends play together as the titular group teaming up to overcome something no one person can defeat on their own. The action RPGs let up to four players play through a high-stakes <em>X-Men</em> story full of twists, turns, and a sizable roster of heroes and villains. The beat-em-up style combat is pretty rote by today’s standards, but each character had their own unique powers, so that playing as Wolverine felt distinct from playing as Magneto. Though the second game ended on a cliffhanger, we unfortunately never got a third game. <em>Legends </em>and <em>Rise of Apocalypse </em>understood that the appeal of a superhero game with as vast and varied a team as the X-Men is always how they differentiate themselves from one another, but still forma cohesive unit. Not many games capture that feeling like <em>Legends</em>.<br></p></div><div><p>The <em>X-Men Origins: Wolverine </em>game has no right to be as good as it is. Not only was it a movie tie-in in the midst of the flood of bad licensed games getting churned out to capitalize on popular films, it’s also based on what is arguably the worst film in the <em>X-Men </em>film franchise (and those movies have a few stinkers). The <em>Origins: Wolverine </em>game, though, is a blast. Though it lacks the same depth as other character action games of the era, such as <em>Devil May Cry</em>, Raven Software’s take on Logan’s origin story has over-the-top style, frenetic combat, and a viciousness you don’t often find in Marvel games. There’s even an M-rated “Uncaged Version” that ups the gore to something you’d expect, considering Wolverine can just tear dudes to shreds. It kinda rules.<br></p></div><div><p>Everyone knows the <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> franchise, but the <em>Vs.</em> branding began with<em> X-Men vs. Street Fighter</em> in 1996. Sure, its roster isn’t as expansive, but it’s still a pretty impressive fighter that acted as launch pad for some of the best games in the genre. The 2D fighter draws from Capcom’s iconic fighting series, but also riffs on <em>Street Fighter</em>’s core concepts like letting you tag in a secondary character. This was the basis for the<em> Vs. </em>games that would follow and were far less restrained by <em>X-Men vs. Street Fighter</em>’s parameters, but even so, it’s still a great fighting game with gorgeous sprite work that holds up to this day.<br></p></div><div><p>When it came to vibrant, appealing arcade beat-em-ups in the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, Konami absolutely dominated the scene. While the company’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tmnt-ninja-turtles-best-games-teenage-mutant-mayhem-1850719693&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tmnt-ninja-turtles-best-games-teenage-mutant-mayhem-1850719693"><em>TMNT </em>games</a></span> and 1991’s <em>The Simpsons </em>are perhaps the most widely remembered today, for my money, nothing can top the sheer spectacle and excitement of 1992’s <em>X-Men</em>. Sure, the <em>TMNT </em>games and <em>The Simpsons </em>let you and three friends clobber enemies to your heart’s content, but <em>X-Men </em>arcade came in two variations: a standard four-player cabinet, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/sEwDIJQ9Kio?si=F2Y-enOKNCNH_02l&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/sEwDIJQ9Kio?si=F2Y-enOKNCNH_02l" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a deluxe, widescreen option</a></span> that let all <em>six </em>of its playable characters tackle Magneto’s forces at once. The six-player support allowed for considerably more onscreen mayhem, and boy, did the game’s wonderfully vivid visuals benefit from all the extra real estate the widescreen effect afforded. Even in a busy arcade in 1992 that was packed with games like <em>Mortal Kombat </em>and <em>Street Fighter II Turbo</em>, this bad boy stood out from the crowd.</p><p>By today’s standards, the gameplay may seem a bit on the simple side, but “simple” was not a bad thing when you and some buddies just wanted to hop into a game and enjoy slashing baddies as Wolverine or flinging tornadoes at them as Storm. The colorful, detailed graphics made it all look like a cartoon, and who could ever forget when Magneto, self-proclaimed “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/gjuWKAMAlQU?si=xo6v8uMBkNwYjdH9&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/gjuWKAMAlQU?si=xo6v8uMBkNwYjdH9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">master of magnet</a></span>,” struck fear into the hearts of players by declaring, “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/IdAmkx8eAos?si=o2qAHTPQO9vickui&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/IdAmkx8eAos?si=o2qAHTPQO9vickui" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X-Men, welcome…to DIE</a></span>!”? I kid, but <em>X-Men </em>really was a spectacular beat-em-up that made great use of its source material.</p></div><div><p>It’s wild to think about how <em>Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite </em>tossed the X-Men out the window when looking through Capcom’s Marvel fighting game history. <em>X-Men: Children of the Atom </em>is often forgotten when talking about Marvel and Capcom’s relationship over the years. It’s a shame because before there were any <em>Vs. </em>games, there was this 1994 fighting game. <em>X-Men: Children of the Atom</em> was the first fighting game Capcom made that featured Marvel characters, and it was loosely tied into the <em>X-Men </em>animated series from the ‘90s that’s getting a second wind with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/x-men-97-creator-beau-demayo-season-2-disney-marvel-1851488316&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-97-creator-beau-demayo-season-2-disney-marvel-1851488316"><em>X-Men ‘97</em></a></span>.</p><p>Capcom put what it had learned from <em>Street Fighter</em> into a solid X-Men fighting game that still looks slick today. The 2D sprites and animation are on-par with some modern sprite-based fighters, and its roster is so well-realized it’s like they’re coming right off a comic book page. </p></div><div><p><em>X-Men Mutant Apocalyps</em>e is one of the more limited X-Men games in terms of who you can play, but the beat-em-up was a triumph for the series on the SNES. It includes different missions for each of its playable characters, all of whom have different abilities, objectives, and challenges to overcome. Its mix of platforming and tough-as-nails make up for its relatively short runtime, and for the time, it was one of the strongest summations of the X-Men that had been put to a game cartridge.</p><hr><p>Looking back, it’s all-too-apparent Marvel hasn’t given the X-Men a lot of video game love in the past decade. Though they’ve made appearances in games like <em>Midnight Suns</em>, the team is due for a starring role soon. Luckily, at least one of them will get the spotlight when Insomniac’s <em>Wolverine </em>comes to PlayStation 5.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1792722028354818287" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter/X today, the official Kingdom Hearts feed announced that multiple entries in the hit series are finally coming to Steam on June 13, 2024.</p>



<p>The content will include Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX, HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue, and Kingdom Hearts 3 + Re Mind. The first two each include multiple titles, while Kingdom Hearts 3 also comes with the Re Mind DLC.</p>



<p>These titles feature the beloved Dark Seeker Saga, so that newcomers can catch up on Sora’s signature adventure.</p>



<p>According to Square Enix’s <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/news/kingdom-hearts-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official blog</a>, players can also purchase the Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece. It’s a bundle of all three experiences, and it also comes with the platform-exclusive Keyblade “Dead of Night.” </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Previously, Kingdom Hearts was only available on PC via the Epic Games Store. Players can also find the games on Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and cloud versions on the Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>Fans are already hoping for a Steam Deck experience, mods, and more with the Steam release. However, Square Enix did not confirm the exact pricing for any of Kingdom Hearts’ Steam versions, or the Integrum Masterpiece bundle.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Kingdom Hearts fans are also waiting for the fourth installment of the hit series. Square Enix has not confirmed very much about the next game, nor a release window. However, rumors from last April suggest Kingdom Hearts 4 could potentially <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-hearts-4-release-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release in 2025</a>.</p>

The studio was previously owned by Embracer.</p><p>"Nintendo will acquire 100% of the outstanding shares of Shiver and make it a wholly owned subsidiary. By welcoming Shiver's experienced and accomplished development team, Nintendo aims to secure high-level resources for porting and developing software titles," Nintendo said.</p><p>The company added that Shiver's focus will "remain the same" after joining Nintendo, and that is to continue porting and developing games for multiple platforms, including Switch.</p><p>Nintendo did not specify a purchase price for Shiver. The company said the buyout will have "only a minor effect" on Nintendo's business results for the fiscal year.</p><p>Shiver's CEO is John Schappert, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-schappert-6bb816/details/experience/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">who was the founder of EA Tiburon</a>, the game development giant known for the Madden and NCAA Football franchises.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Senua's Saga: Hellblade II - Official Launch Trailer (ft. 'Animal Soul' by AURORA)</p>
      </div>
<p>Hellblade II is exclusive on console to Xbox Series X|S thanks to Microsoft owning developer Ninja Theory and the game franchise. The game is available now on Game Pass for Xbox and PC, or it can be purchased outright for $50 USD. While Microsoft is bringing some of its first-party games to rival platforms, like PlayStation 5, Hellblade II has not been confirmed for Sony's system.</p><p>You can see a sampling of the review scores for Hellblade II below.

There are a few memorable set pieces I won't spoil, but even compared to its predecessor--which led players through tombs, razed towns, haunted woods, chamber halls, and let them face off against giants, a rotting boar, towering stag-headed monsters, and the god of illusions--there is surprisingly little variation in Hellblade 2's settings and monsters." -- <em>Jessica Cogswell </em>[<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-review-hell-and-high-water/1900-6418229/" data-ref-id="1900-6418229">Full review</a>]</p><h2>GamesRadar -- 5/5</h2><p>"Haunting, confrontational, and deeply cathartic all at once, Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2 is a stunning feat of video game art. Ninja Theory doesn't tiptoe around its heavy themes but welcomes them with well-honed empathy, tempered by an even keener creative edge this time around to deliver an unforgettable narrative adventure experience that's hard to watch, yet harder to turn away from." -- <em>Jasmine Gould-Wilson </em>[<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/adventure/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-review/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Metro UK -- 5/10</h2><p>"A joyless slog of barely interactive entertainment and a muddled portrayal of mental illness… that just so happens to have the best graphics ever on a video game console." -- <em>no author byline provided </em>[<a href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/05/21/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-review-best-console-graphics-ever-20874219/?ico=mosaic_gaming" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Press Start Australia -- 9/10</h2><p>"Senua's Saga: Hellblade II is the only first-party Xbox game this generation that has screamed, with any confidence, 'next-gen' to me. All at once it’s an audiovisual tour de force, a tremendous next chapter in Senua's battle that strikes many disparate moods, and although it doesn't take enormous swings to reinvent itself, its refinements make Saga a worthwhile successor to Senua's Sacrifice." -- <em>Brodie Gibbons </em>[<a href="https://press-start.com.au/reviews/xbox-series-x-reviews/2024/05/21/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-review-a-new-hope/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>Game Informer -- 9/10</h2><p>"Senua's Saga: Hellblade II's conclusion ends on another strong note, and despite my initial reservations about continuing Senua's story, I walked away happy to see her conquer new monsters, both literal and metaphorical. I'm pleased Ninja Theory avoided the temptation to blow up this formula into something far bigger than needed--this isn't Xbox's God of War; it's a better Hellblade. The first game is a famous example of not needing to be fun in the traditional sense to be engaging. This sequel sprinkles more broadly appealing thrills while retaining the thoughtful storytelling and artistry few triple-A games possess." -- <em>Marcus Stewart </em>[<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii/conquering-old-demons" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p><h2>IGN -- 8/10</h2><p>"Senua's Saga: Hellblade II is another Viking-worthy feast for the senses that meets the high bar set by its predecessor, even if it never really manages to clear it." -- <em>Tristan Ogilvie </em>[<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full review</a>]</p>

<p data-characters="245" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">My time as a Nintendo fangirl playing on a GameCube feels like the halcyon days. Between <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-metroid-prime-remastered-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metroid Prime</a></em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker</em>, <em>Eternal Darkness</em>, and <em>F-Zero GX</em>, I was always deep into something that would endure as an all-time favorite.</p> <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="233" data-injectable="false">Then I remember those were also the years I was in high school, which were years of trauma that helped shape me into the mess I am today. That’s maybe why those games shine brightly in my memory; they were backed by total darkness.</p> <p data-characters="122" data-current-count="355" data-injectable="false">Speaking of which: <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>. A 20-year-old high-water mark that the series may never return to.</p> <figure data-current-count="655" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="146" data-current-count="146" data-injectable="false"><strong><strong><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> (<a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch</a> [reviewed])<br>Developer:</strong> Intelligent Systems<strong><br>Publisher: </strong>Nintendo<strong><br>Released: May 23, 2024<br>MSRP: $59.99</strong></strong></p> <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="true"><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> is the second in the series, and the follow-up to – bear with me here – 2000’s <em>Paper Mario</em>. The series started off as something of a successor to <em>Super Mario RPG</em>. In fact, the original working title of <em>Paper Mario</em> was <em>Super Mario RPG 2</em>, and that’s how I first saw it in an issue of Nintendo Power.</p>
 <p data-characters="135" data-current-count="135" data-injectable="false">What the series have in common is a simplification of the JRPG format. Aside from that, they’re almost entirely different approaches.</p> <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="497" data-injectable="true">However, the story is rather familiar. Mario has to collect seven stars. Stars tend to be the solution to all of Mario’s problems. At this point, the narrative framework has been so well-trodden that it actually points fun at it, by having Luigi embark on an extremely similar MacGuffin gathering quest that he’ll tell you about at the start of each chapter.</p>
 <p data-characters="185" data-current-count="185" data-injectable="false">Luigi’s quest actually sounds a bit more interesting. Not that the one in <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> is terrible or anything. But everything is better when Luigi is involved.</p> <figure data-current-count="485" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door – Overview Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gCV-uTRULn8?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="390" data-current-count="390" data-injectable="false">The story kicks off (and largely takes place) in Rogueport. The characters describe it as a wretched hive of scum and villainy, which is already kind of a hilarious concept in a Mario game. Sure enough, the infrastructure is crumbling, people who skulk in dark alleys talk about how much they love crime, and gangs talk about holding dominion over a small chunk of the town’s four blocks.</p> <p data-characters="342" data-current-count="732" data-injectable="true">The town sits on top of ancient ruins, and in these ruins is the eponymous spooky door. Allegedly this door holds great treasure, so Princess Peach, like all monarchs, wants this treasure for herself. But also like all monarchs, she doesn’t want to do it herself, so she mails it to Mario while she pursues her passion of getting kidnapped.</p>
 <p data-characters="367" data-current-count="367" data-injectable="false">Mario, the ever-obedient working-class hero, sets off and immediately starts solving people’s problems in return for Crystal Stars and things you can just find on the ground. Really, the story doesn’t throw any huge curveballs that you can’t see telegraphed from a mile away. In fact, one of its best pieces of exposition has you guessing the twist in dialogue.</p> <p data-characters="445" data-current-count="812" data-injectable="true">But it’s the journey, and not the reason for it, that makes <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> so memorable. Each of the game’s chapters could be their own episodic game, as while they’re linked by the central mechanics, they are each largely self-contained and entirely unique. I don’t want to spoil it for anyone who didn’t play the original ‘04 release, but you’ll probably come away with your own rankings of all the chapters.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="432" data-current-count="732" data-injectable="true">The combat uses a unique system where everything is played out in front of a live audience. Your party consists of Mario and his partner, though that partner can be swapped out mid-combat. It brings in the hallmark of all Mario RPG systems, by which I mean “timed hits” or “actions” as they’re simply called. You perform these by either pressing a button at the correct time during an attack, or playing a short mini-game.</p>
 <p data-characters="351" data-current-count="351" data-injectable="false">There are also stylish moves for appealing to the crowd. Your ultra-special moves require star power to perform, and that means exciting the audience. The more audience members you have, the more star power you get when you rile them up. It’s not as complex as it maybe sounds, but it’s a fun extra layer on the otherwise simple turn-based combat.</p> <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="628" data-injectable="true">Outside of combat is similarly simple. Dungeons don’t get too devious, though there are plenty of secrets enticing you to stick your finger into every nook. It makes use of the paper aesthetic to have you peel away scenery or turn into a boat to traverse water hazards.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="635" data-current-count="635" data-injectable="true">What I find interesting is that, while <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> lacks complexity, it’s also not as signposted as modern games. You can get a hint from your partner, but there are times when it will stop you and force you to think about what you’re supposed to be doing. I don’t just mean when solving puzzles, either. It will sometimes ask you to recall where you met a specific character or what happened earlier. You can always ask for a hint from your partner, but sometimes they’ll just tell you to think hard about one particular spot. It struck me that a lot of modern mainstream games won’t ask this of you.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="574" data-injectable="true">The dialogue is what makes <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> really excel. Like most RPGs, the world is infested with NPCs, but most of them here are given a loving touch to bring them alive. Each one has its own priorities and fixations, and they’re all just so bitchy.</p>
 <p data-characters="511" data-current-count="511" data-injectable="true">You generally expect that a <em>Mario </em>game is going to keep on its kid gloves, and to an extent, <em>The Thousand-Year Door</em> does. There’s nothing graphic or explicit, but some of it pushes the line. It can often be quite cutting, or just extremely clever. There’s a depth to it that makes even <em>Mario’s</em> bizarre, fungal-centric world seem real. But most of all, you can tell that the writers had a lot of fun with it. It’s awash with personality, something else that tends to be lost in mainstream games of today.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="627" data-injectable="true">For those of us who did play the 2004 original, there’s enough in the Switch version to make it worthwhile. While much of what made the original so special remains unchanged (though, I didn’t see the scene where the robot spies on Peach showering), there are some additions that go beyond just being a simple upscaled port.</p>
 <p data-characters="545" data-current-count="545" data-injectable="true">The weirdest is actually the graphical upgrades. A lot of small details have been redone, which is nice. But for some reason, part of the overhaul is to make everything slightly reflective. Like, it’s still paper, but it’s glossy or laminated for some reason. To be fair, it looks really good. It was very pleasing to my brain to see these gentle reflections on every surface. However, I think the idea behind the <em>Paper Mario</em> aesthetic is that it’s a collection of hand-crafted dioramas. I don’t know anyone who crafts with glossy paper.</p>
 <p data-characters="675" data-current-count="675" data-injectable="true">The new soundtrack is extremely helpful, however. There’s a badge you can get early on that allows you to change to the original soundtrack, but I don’t think the nostalgia is worth it. The new compositions generally stick to the tracks from the original, but it’s greatly expanded. This is best demonstrated through the battle theme, which changes depending on the section of the game you’re in. It’s always the same tune, but the instrumentation is different in each area, providing a new twist. Considering <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> can take around 40 hours to complete, not having to listen to the exact same music every time combat starts is welcome.</p>
 <p data-characters="175" data-current-count="175" data-injectable="false">Beyond that, there are other tweaks to the gameplay, some of which I can’t really get into. It’s not a complete overhaul, but it is a slightly more comfortable experience.</p> <figure data-current-count="475" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false"><em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> is the series’ concept delivered with maximum effectiveness. The games have seen their ups and downs since then, and that’s partially because they had to find a new direction. They could keep revisiting the same formula, but it’s hard to improve on perfection, and even that would get old after a while.</p> <p data-characters="422" data-current-count="767" data-injectable="true">But the fact that <em>Paper Mario</em> did diverge after <em>The Thousand-Year Door</em> makes this remaster even more effective. It’s been absent for 20 years, and the new territory that has been covered since then hasn’t resulted in the discovery of the same magic. It’s a new opportunity to see the series’ apogee. It’s a reminder that while the JRPG-lite approach has its limitations, with the right voice, it can really sing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-shiver-entertainment-purchase<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that it is to purchase&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>porting studio Shiver Entertainment from former owner Embracer Group.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/240521e.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">notice announcing the acquisition</a>, Nintendo says it will acquire "100% of [Shiver's] outstanding shares", making the company a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Japanese gaming giant.</p>

<p>According to Nintendo, Shiver is an "experienced and accomplished" porting studio, although given the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-for-switch-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank">response</a> to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2023-mortal-kombat-1-is-an-excellent-console-game-but-switch-simply-isnt-good-enough" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Switch version</a> of&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>, I suspect there are some out there who will disagree.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-shiver-entertainment-mortal-kombat-1.jpg?itok=ABc56L6n 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-shiver-entertainment-mortal-kombat-1.jpg?itok=vQ1y7GdL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Shiver Entertainment is perhaps best-known for porting&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>to Switch (although the PC version is pictured here).</figcaption></figure><p>The notice goes on to say that Nintendo will utilize Shiver's talents as "high-level resources for porting and developing software titles".</p>

<p>From Shiver's perspective, it doesn't sound like much will change; Nintendo says Shiver's "focus will remain the same" and that the studio will continue to take "commissions that port and develop software for multiple platforms including Nintendo Switch".</p>

<p>Nintendo also says that the Shiver acquisition will have "only a minor effect" on its fiscal results for the year, so although the amount for which Shiver was acquired hasn't been disclosed, it's unlikely to be a devastatingly expensive transaction for Nintendo.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-switch-nintendo-shiver-entertainment.jpg?itok=2t3UhA6Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hogwarts-legacy-switch-nintendo-shiver-entertainment.jpg?itok=b4RX_QUc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You may also know Shiver's name from its&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy&nbsp;</em>Switch port.</figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's purchase of Shiver comes at a time when Embracer Group is undergoing a rather drastic restructuring that will see it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-splitting-three-companies">split into three different companies</a>.</p>

<p>The first, Coffee Stain and Friends, will handle IPs like&nbsp;<em>Goat Simulator&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Satisfactory</em>, while Middle-earth and Friends will oversee major IP like&nbsp;<em>The Lord of the Rings</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>, and more.</p>

<p>Finally, tabletop giant Asmodee will constitute the third company in Embracer's restructuring effort, and the studio has already been <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-saddled-with-eu900-million-debt-by-embracer-group">saddled with almost a billion euros in debt</a> as a result of the restructuring.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Nintendo's purchase of Shiver Entertainment will yield, but you can expect to see the studio's name on more ports in the future, it seems. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Drift playlists have also been added to PVP and Free Roam.</li>
<li><strong>Drag Mode:</strong> This mode redefines racing in Need for Speed Unbound with a fresh approach when players need to take a break from the track.

This feature also introduces a community challenge that requires a collective effort to unlock the final boss and claim a new custom. With Rival Racers appearing regularly and new leagues on the way, this is where strategy, skill, and community come together to push players to earn their place among the legends of street racing.</li>

            <p>
After completing this morning's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wordle">Wordle</a> I found myself drawn to a "New!" link advertising WordleBot, a smart-sounding addition to The New York Times app which promised to analyse my puzzle solution and compare it with others. (I got today's word in six, for which I'm still feeling a little shameful.)
</p>
<p>
Scrolling through its results I was impressed - not only does WordleBot show how other players began today's game and then narrowed down the solution over subsequent guesses, it also shows how WordleBot itself, programmed with a set of rules and likelihoods, fared too. (WordleBot only got today's word after five guesses, which immediately made me feel a little better.)
</p>
<p>
This was my first experience of WordleBot, a program I now understand has existed for some time online, but has <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/16/crosswords/wordlebot-games-app.html">only this week been added to the New York Times puzzle app</a> - where I play a set routine of Wordle, the Mini Crossword and then (if I'm not running too late by this point) Connections as well.

<p>
Writing back in 2022, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/17/upshot/wordle-wordlebot-new.html?pgtype=Article&amp;action=click&amp;module=RelatedLinks">The New York Times</a> described its work-in-progress Wordlebot as "the tool that sometimes uplifts you when you think your Wordle performance has been terrible, and sometimes chides you when you think you've played superbly". And after a pretty poor six-guess run today, I do feel a little better. 
</p>
<p>
To begin with, Wordlebot says my starting guess was strong - but unlucky with today's word. I always pick TEARS, which is a relatively popular choice in the grand scheme of things (a subsequent screen tells me it's 17th out of all possible starting words, though most people pick either ADIEU or AUDIO.
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Untitled-1_sX1BT4B.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>A set of Wordlebot results showing partial guesses to today's Wordle. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer / The New York Times</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Wordlebot always starts with CRANE, a word The New York Times has chosen specifically and has changed over time (it <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/01/10/upshot/wordle-wordlebot-starting-word.html">used to be TRACE</a>, and in hard mode is now TROPE). Interestingly, though, Wordlebot's CRANE was an even tougher pick today, requiring 3.6 guesses to solve versus TEARS' 3.3. (So, at least at that point, I should have beaten Wordlebot! Darn.)
</p>
<p>
<strong>Spoiler warning:</strong> From here on out, we show the solution to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wordle-answer-today-21-may-1067-9433">today's Wordle puzzle</a>. Beware!
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Untitled-2_uGeyx6F.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>A set of Wordlebot results showing partial guesses to today's Wordle. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer / The New York Times</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Delving on through each guess, I came to my fourth attempt - PILON - which I'm pretty sure was me just trying random placements for the vowels at this point and not expecting anything to work. Wordlebot is impressed by my knowledge of the word, though happy to tell me it was probably too obscure to be a likely result. Hard agree! 
</p>
<p>
After an unlucky start and some mid-game stumbles, I'm cheered to see Wordlebot also went for BINGO before the ultimate answer DINGO, which I initially discounted for being too obscure to Americans. Ah, well. But, as mentioned, WordleBot still took only one fewer guess to arrive at the right result. It feels like today was a tricky one in general?
</p>
<p>
All in all, it's fascinating stuff - and something I'm going to use in future as I play.  One downside, though - after your first look, Wordlebot reveals itself to be a paid-for feature, so you'll need to stump up £2.99 a month from here on out for more. But hey, if it helps you feel better about your results - and I think I need do - then maybe give it a try?

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-hearts-steam</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-hearts-steam-releases-confirmed-for-next-month.877077/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-hearts-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has revealed that the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>series is making its way to Steam next month, marking the first time it's been available outside of the Epic Games Store on PC.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/kingdom-hearts-pc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog post</a> announcing the Steam releases, Square Enix announces the games will be available on Steam from June 13th and provides a rundown of the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>series as it currently stands (or as close to one as it's possible to provide, anyway).</p>

<p>The three major&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>releases you can currently buy on the Epic Games Store will be available on Steam, but it looks like rhythm-action title&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/kingdom-hearts-melody-of-memory">Melody of Memory</a>&nbsp;</em>is missing out on a Steam release, at least for now.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-hearts-steam-frozen.jpg?itok=9cAWwOG- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-hearts-steam-frozen.jpg?itok=1JjcLajH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Hearts 3&nbsp;</em>and its predecessors are coming to Steam soon.</figcaption></figure><p>So, which games in the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>series are heading to Steam? You'll have to bear with me, because this can get a little complicated.</p>

<p>First up, there's the&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX&nbsp;</em>collection. This includes&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts 2</em>, as well as spinoffs <i>Re:Chain of Memories</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Birth by Sleep</em>. It also includes&nbsp;<em>358/2 Days</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Re:Coded&nbsp;</em>in cinematic form.</p>

<p><em>Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue</em>, meanwhile, includes&nbsp;<em>Dream Drop Distance HD</em>, a rework of a game that originally appeared on 3DS in 2012. It also includes an HD movie by the name of&nbsp;<em>Back Cover</em>, as well as a short sequence starring&nbsp;<em>Birth by Sleep</em>'s Aqua.</p>

<p>Lastly, you'll be able to grab&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts 3&nbsp;</em>and its&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/kingdom-hearts-iii-remind-review"><em>Re Mind&nbsp;</em>DLC</a>, which are packaged together in the Steam version.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-hearts-steam-birth-by-sleep-cast.jpg?itok=2FJfSwkG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-hearts-steam-birth-by-sleep-cast.jpg?itok=sJ0ZKjU4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Birth by Sleep&nbsp;</em>is just one of the many&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>spinoffs you'll need to play to fully understand the series' story.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll be able to purchase all of the aforementioned collections separately, but a bundle containing all of them will also be up for grabs. It's called&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece</em>, because of course it is.</p>

<p>If you buy that bundle, you'll get yourself a bonus Keyblade called the Dead of Night. You'll also get that Keyblade if you pick up&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Hearts 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Re Mind</em>, so presumably, the Keyblade is specifically for use in that game.</p>

<p><em>Kingdom Hearts&nbsp;</em>and its many sequels and spinoffs (although not all of them, unfortunately) make their way to Steam on June 13th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p data-characters="306" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you were expecting a new <em>Helldivers 2 </em>patch to drop today, don’t. In fact, developer Arrowhead Game Studios can’t confirm when its next patch will arrive, with community manager Thomas ‘Twinbeard’ Petersson saying the team wants to “take some more time for this one.”</p> <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="409" data-injectable="true">When asked on Discord (as highlighted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1cx45ru/no_patch_today_dont_know_when_next_one_will_be/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>) when players can expect the next patch, Twinbeard only answered with “When it’s done,” adding that future patches may potentially come out less frequently. He explained that the team has felt it’s been putting out patches too often, which risks making it difficult to “maintain the quality standard we want and you deserve.”</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="424" data-current-count="724" data-injectable="true">Twinbeard’s not exactly wrong. <em>Helldivers 2</em> has seen a near-constant stream of patches since its February launch to address bugs and glitches as well as add new content to the game. As an ongoing live-service, this regularity does seem like it can only be a good thing, but some feel that<em> </em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/is-helldivers-2-pushing-forward-far-too-quickly-for-its-own-good/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Helldivers 2</em> has been growing and updating too quickly</a>, and pushing out so much so often is affecting the quality of the updates.</p>
 <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="268" data-injectable="false">Twinbeard also explained how patching a lot can “easily disrupt work flow and takes more resources than you might think.” This is why the studio is opting to slow things down a bit and stretch the next patch out, “hopefully with a good result.”</p> <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="725" data-injectable="false">Players would need to adjust not having patches drop at least once a week, but it may be beneficial for <em>Helldivers 2</em> in the long run, and allow for more meaningful updates and content additions. It’s strange, though, that what seems like a pretty significant notice for players has been delegated to the Discord channel. There’s no mention of this on the official Twitter account or Steam page, with it falling to fans to spread the word around.</p>

            <p>PlayStation's London Studio has shared a short goodbye with its community, following the announcement of its closure by Sony.</p>
<p>"For over 20 years London Studio has been home to some exceptionally talented and wonderful people in the games industry," it wrote on social media platform X. "As we close the doors, and all go forward to new adventures, we wanted to say a heartfelt thank you, to all our past and present, players and colleagues who have supported us over the years.</p>
<p>"We've had one wild and wonderful journey!"</p>
<p>The studio then signed off with a waving emoji, and a single blue heart.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-laying-off-900-playstation-employees-london-studio-to-close-in-its-entirety">Sony announced it was laying off 900 people</a>, equating to eight percent of its workforce. At this time, it announced it would close London Studio as part of these layoffs.</p>
<p>Ahead of its closure, London Studio was working on an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstations-london-studio-working-on-ps5-online-game">online game for the PlayStation 5</a>, which was going to be set in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstations-london-studio-working-on-online-co-op-combat-game-set-in-fantasy-london">fantasy version of the UK's capital</a>.</p>
<p>In 2022, co-studio heads Stuart Whyte and Tara Saunders shared more details about this game, calling it the team's "most ambitious project to date".</p>
<p>"With this project, we really wanted to explore some new avenues and set ourselves some new challenges," Whyte said. "We definitely wanted to try something a little bit different, and I think this new project really channels our 'brave' value and allows us to push ourselves on the 'curious' front, too. It's an exciting future, it really is."</p>
<p>The studio's earlier games, meanwhile, include the SingStar and EyeToy series, to name but two.</p> <div>

            <p>
Microsoft has shown off how its Copilot AI feature will soon be able to give players a helping hand in games such as Minecraft by offering up real-time advice. 
</p>
<p>

The company shared two videos to its social media account on X last night, demonstrating this feature. In the first video, a person playing Minecraft needs some assistance crafting a sword. 
</p>
<p>

"To craft a sword, you'll need some materials," Copilot says, prompting the player to open their inventory. The Copilot notices the player does not have all the necessary resources available, so offers a suggestion of what to do next.

<p>

A second video shared, still with Minecraft as an example, shows the player being besieged by a zombie. The Copilot once again offers up some useful advice to the player. "Run! You need to get away from it fast. Either sprint away or quickly build a tower of blocks straight up to get out of its reach."

Microsoft's AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman stated this feature is "taking Copilot to the next level" thanks to its real time assistance. 
</p>
<p>
"Real personality. Effortless interactions. The ability to see what we see. I've long argued that AIs with EQ, IQ and AQ are coming. Here's the first real glimpse of what it's gonna feel like," Suleyman wrote. "It's a magical experience: smart, intuitive, natural, and useful."

AI remains a hot topic within the industry, and earlier this year, a report by game engine maker Unity found <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">62 percent of studios use AI at some point during game development</a>.

            <p>
A new report states that 46 percent of players use gaming for self-expression, to ignite their imagination, and for creation.
</p>
<p>
That's according to this year's fifth annual Inside Gaming Report, published by entertainment and gaming wiki Fandom.
</p>
<p>
As well as indicating the prevalence of character creators in games, the results come as little surprise considering the popularity of live-service and sandbox games like Minecraft, Fortnite, and Roblox in which creativity is paramount.
</p>
<figure><div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</div><figcaption>Newscast: Is the closure of Hi-Fi Rush and Redfall's studios a sign the Xbox Game Pass publishing model is failing?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dx4fu4H6us" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>

While the top reason why people play games is for stress relief and to unwind at 54 percent, creation and self-expression is the second most likely reason at 46 percent - an increase of 10 percent compared to last year's report. 
</p>
<p>
More specifically, the most popular form of customisation used for self-expression is character personalisation (76 percent), followed by Gamertags and usernames (48 percent) and communication (35 percent).
</p>
<p>
Further, 80 percent of players claim their gaming personality differs from real life, while 64 percent believe it's easier to be themselves online than in person. Of course, games offer a level of fantasy to players, but they're also a powerful way for players to explore an idealised version of themselves.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, 72 percent of respondents surveyed would think more favourably on a brand that allowed a player's online and real-life presence to be aligned, especially players from minority backgrounds.
</p>
<p>
The findings are from a survey of 5000 entertainment and gaming fans, as well as an analysis of first-party data.
</p>
<p>
Key games offering self-expression, according to the report, include the likes of Roblox, Minecraft, Genshin Impact, Grand Theft Auto, Fortnite, The Sims, and Stardew Valley.
</p>
<p>
These rank among the most popular games of the moment, so it's unclear if they are popular due to the inclusion of self-expression, or if self-expression has become more integral for players due to the popularity of these games.
</p>
<p>
Either way, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-might-the-ultimate-character-creator-look-like">character creators are a primary way for players to explore creativity and identity</a>, though diverse representation is required.

</p>
<p>
What's more, these stats play into the popularity of live-service games and developers' concern over their sustainability. 
</p>
<p>
A survey by the Game Developer Collective reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/70-of-developers-concerned-about-sustainability-of-live-service-games-new-study-suggests">70 percent of developers have concerns over the sustainability of live service games</a>, particularly with players losing interest over time as well as competition with other live-service games and rising user acquisition costs.

</p>
<p>
So while players may enjoy these types of games to express themselves, for developers it's a crowded and highly competitive market.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/21/microsoft-announce-ai-copilot-for-pc-and-xbox-games-shoving-ai-into-minecraft/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Microsoft has presented their next generation AI enhanced PC’s and Surface tablets, and along with it the reveal that their AI Copilot software will soon be embedded in PC and Xbox games. The first will be Minecraft and you can see it in action in the short video below.</p>
<p>https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1792630909151133768</p>


<p>Microsoft has been aggressively pursuing AI over the past couple of years, investing billions into OpenAI, adding it to their Bing search engine and trying to find ways to apply it to Windows, Office and now Xbox gaming.</p>
<p>As you can see form the Minecraft demo, the player can simply use their own voice to ask for help within the game and Copilot will tell them exactly what they need to do with natural language interactions. In this instance, Copilot can be asked for a crafting recipe and the AI will check you have everything needed in your inventory, guide you through collecting anything else you need, and take you step-by-step through the process of crafting a sword.</p>
<p>it’s a clever demo that will send a shiver down the spine of gaming sites that rely on guides to be profitable, but there’s a lot of question marks for how this will actually work. Microsoft is putting an emphasis on privacy, which will mean that Copilot tools will try to run locally before polling the cloud, and that will require dedicated hardware with new chips featuring an NPU (Neural Processing Unit) – the demos used PCs with Qualcomm’s new Snapdragon X Elite chips featuring a hefty built-in NPU.</p>

<p>There’s also other things to overcome. For an AI to be useful, it also needs to be all-knowing and always available. While AIs can analyse what they see on screen, that will be a much more intensive process than having APIs and direct hooks into the backend of a game – otherwise they can’t really know what’s in your full inventory, where you are on the world map you are, what the quest steps are or anything else that they need. Game developers and engine developers will probably need to put in the systems for AI to interact with.</p>
<p>And at the end of the day, gaming AIs will also need to have all the answers, and who’s going to give these to them? If game guides become unprofitable (which they would do if everyone just asked AI what to do instead of visiting websites) then sites would stop publishing them… but without the game guides, the AI has nothing to reference and could give players the wrong information. And so it’ll then be up to the game developers to provide them, but devs have enough on their plate just making the games. Sony already has a developer-led video hints and tips system built into the PS5 system software for trophies, but they’re far from universal.</p>
<p>Then there’s Microsoft’s rivals. They can put this into all their games and systems, but they’re in third place this generation, and who knows what their future games business is going to look like? If Sony and Nintendo don’t put AI assistants in their future games consoles and chipsets, then third party developers almost certainly won’t bother. It’s not like Sony or Nintendo are going to use MIcrosoft’s AI for that anyway.</p>
<p>This definitely feels like the way things are going, but Microsoft’s vision for what AI assistants will be like when added into video games still has a long way to go.</p>

            <p>The music in haunting 2D <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/norco">Norco</a> was so good it’s one of the few soundtracks I’ve actually bought on Steam, so I’m deeply intrigued to learn that developer Geography of Robots are putting music - and dancing - front and center in the new demo for their next project, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silenus">Silenus</a>. You can bop your way between screens, reader!</p>

<p>Swapping out Norco’s Southern gothic for techno industrial (also somewhat gothic) vibes, Silenus offers the chance to “uncover the secrets of an oil refinery operated by an obscure organization in this short, atmospheric narrative adventure.” Don’t take my word about Steam’s word about the developer’s word on it, though, that’d be sheer madness. There’s a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2927440/Silenus/">free demo </a>available. I initially thought the choice to name it the ‘Umbilical Pre-Release Demo’ was just the devs being arty. But it actually refers to the album Umbilical from contributors Thou, who did loads of Norco’s soundtrack. By playing the demo, you’ll be able to unlock the entire album to listen to in-game. Creatives creatively boosting the creative work of other creatives? What is this, some sort of good timeline?</p>
<p>Here are some more Steam deets:</p>
<blockquote><p>Rubens Link, an enigmatic company with an unclear agenda, has taken control of the Gulf Flow oil refinery. Officially, they're introducing new automation technologies, but the changes they've implemented suggest something more confounding. In this narrative micro-adventure, you play as Titian, Rubens Link's flagship android. Explore the refinery’s machinery, tank farms, and offices, deciphering clues from computer logs, discarded journals, and the remnants of vanished workers. Solve puzzles, absorb the atmospheric soundscapes of FmAura &amp; Gewgawly I, interact with unique characters, and wander deeper down the rabbit hole of Gulf Flow Oil.</p></blockquote>
<p>I was going to do a bit about ‘Reuben’s link’ but I already linked the demo. Not a massive loss for comedy, honestly. For what it’s worth, I loved Norco to haunted little bits. It was a brilliantly written 2D adventure set in  South Louisiana that makes me want to use words like 'hauntological' and such. Silenus is in 3D and takes a completely different visual approach, but as much as I’d have eaten up another offering in Norco’s vein, it’s great to see Geography of Robots not pigeonholing themselves this early. Silenus is currently “very early in development”, which gives you enough room to go play Norco. Twice!</p>

            <p>I could pretend I understand Square Enix's action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> series Kingdom Hearts, but I don't need to, 'cos what I do understand is how popular it is. Until fairly recently the nearly 15-game-strong series, where Disney characters cross over with Final Fantasy and go to war alongside a child wielding a key (I said I don't properly understand it), wasn't on PC. After some games arrived on the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/browse?q=kingdom%20hearts&amp;sortBy=relevancy&amp;sortDir=DESC&amp;count=40">Epic Games Store</a> in 2021, Squeenix <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/kingdom-hearts-pc">have confirmed</a> that multiple Kingdom Hearts games are coming to Steam next month, on June 13th. Unlucky for some, maybe, but not Donald Duck and Goofy, two of the main characters. Long has Goofy been seen as just a joke character in the minds of people people who didn't watch A Goofy Movie. Hopefully this brings his heroism to a wider audience.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The titles coming to Steam are Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX, Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue, and Kingdom Hearts III + Re Mind DLC, which doesn't sound like a lot until you realise they're compilations that each contain several games therein. You could also get the Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece, a bundle containing all three. At this point making jokes about Kingdom Hearts' naming conventions is about as tired as calling the actor who plays Dr. Strange "Englebort Cucumberthatch" or whatever, so I will just point you to <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/kingdom-hearts-pc">Squeenix's post about it</a>, which has a pretty comprehensive breakdown of what is in which compliation. </p>
<p>To expand on my glib summary in the intro, Kingdom Hearts is actually about a young man with huge gloves called Sora, who becomes a hero in the first game when his homeland is almost consumed by a faction of evil goons called the Heartless. The Heartless are also encroaching on the Disney kingdom (ruled by King Mickey, obviously), and Donald Duck and Goofy are sent to find Sora. The series continues from there with many subplots involving Disney villains, new enemies, quests for special weapons, and so on. The popularity of the series, which plays quite like Final Fantasy, as I understand it, is in part because there are extremely dramatic scenes featuring love, loss, sacrifice, and so on, and, like, a cartoon duck without pants on is just there. Which, to be fair, is a good pitch.</p>
<p>Look out for Kingdom Hearts on Steam on June 13th</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-may-only-deliver-4k-30-fps-with-nvidia-dlss-but-it-would-be-a-%E2%80%9Cmisuse%E2%80%9D-of-the-upscaler.877017/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-4k-30-fps-dlss-misuse/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 may be able to deliver only 4K resolution, 30 frames per second gameplay with NVIDIA DLSS, but we are unlikely to see this scenario much, as it would be a "misuse" of the upscaler.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel">Digital Foundry</a> discussed if the next Nintendo console could be able to deliver 4K, 60 FPS gameplay with NVIDIA DLSS in a new video. The consensus seems it won't be able to for a few reasons. Upscaling to 4K resolution is more expensive than upscaling to 1080p and 1440p resolutions, and it would be an extremely large part of the frametime of a game, leaving 60 FPS off the table. Given how Nintendo tries to go for 60 FPS in most of its games, it is unlikely they will go for 30 FPS to have NVIDIA DLSS upscale to 4K resolution.</p>
<p>How 4K, 60 FPS is likely not viable on the Nintendo Switch 2 was also highlighted in a previous test where Digital Foundry attempted to replicate the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-chip-hardly-match-xbox-series-s/">T239 chip</a> that will power the system. In this test, upscaling from 720p to 4K with DLSS Ultra Performance in Death Stranding added 18.3 milliseconds to frametime over native resolution, which would fail to deliver a 60 FPS experience. Upscaling to 1440p, on the other hand, looks way more viable, as it only added 7.7 milliseconds over native 720p resolution. As such, 4K, 30 FPS could be doable, but it would be a misuse of the upscaler, having over half GPU time spent on just upscaling. Such a high fixed cost on the GPU would also be difficult for developers to work around and greatly limit what they could achieve on the system.</p>
<p><iframe title="Will Switch 2 REALLY Deliver 4K DLSS Visuals?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8CHz0iBN_7A?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is said to support Ray Reconstruction alongside NVIDIA DLSS, which would make it the best ray tracing-capable gaming console to date. Hopefully, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-release-march-2025/">it won't take much longer</a> to see how these technologies will be used to deliver a next-gen Nintendo gaming experience.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Getting developers started with GameMaker]]></title>
            <link>https://www.gamesindustry.biz/getting-developers-started-with-gamemaker</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/getting-developers-started-with-gamemaker.877014/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/getting-developers-started-with-gamemaker<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>Gurpreet Singh Matharoo talks us through how the company is making it easier for newcomers to get to grips with the 2D-centric game engine</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>It’s been almost 25 years since Dutch professor Mark Overmars created GameMaker, a game engine primarily devoted to 2D graphics and sprites.</p>
<p>While major engines like Unity and Unreal Engine also offer 2D tools in addition to cutting-edge visuals, GameMaker keeps things simple with its drag-and-drop visual scripting tool. Its 2D focus has helped small teams create incredible experiences like Hyper Light Drifter, Hotline Miami, Chicory: A Colorful Tale, and Undertale.</p>
<p>GameMaker also saw a boost in awareness and use last year; just as Unity walked into a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/unitys-pricing-is-a-symptom-not-the-cause-of-tougher-times-ahead-for-the-games-industry-opinion">massive pricing controversy</a> last year, GameMaker flipped the script and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gamemaker-offers-more-free-options-for-non-commercial-use">made its tech free</a> for all non-commercial use.</p>
<p>We sat down with Gurpreet Singh Matharoo, a lead technical writer at GameMaker, to discuss how GameMaker plans to entice developers who weren't fans of the Unity fiasco. Matharoo works in the team responsible for the company’s documentation in addition to video content on their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GameMakerEngine">YouTube channel</a>, "aimed primarily at first-timers to GameMaker."</p>
<p>Matharoo was quick to state that it’s "not particularly hard to create documentation and fill it with information"; instead the challenge lies in "making it easily digestible for new users, while keeping it informative for seasoned developers."</p>
<p>"For new users, I ensure that my writing (and that of my staff) is made up of short paragraphs, uses simple words that a fourth-grader could understand, and gets to the point," he said.</p>
<p>Nurturing new talent is an imperative that is becoming increasingly important as established studios engage in layoffs across the industry. Despite rising profits and popularity, the age-old question of '<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-gieditorial-061006">What's a young person hoping for a career in this sector meant to believe?</a>' rears its ugly head.</p>
<p>While an indie gold rush would be held back by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-current-state-of-games-investment">investor caution</a>, there’s no denying that making games and creating them is becoming more accessible outside Western markets. GameMaker has its sights on a larger slice of an expanding pie.</p>
<p>"Developers can now export their [GameMaker] games to all desktop platforms, web, Android and iOS for free, for non-commercial use,’ Matharoo notes.</p>
<p>"Commercial exports are now a $100 one-time purchase, and half the price on Steam for Indian users. With GameMaker more financially accessible, I hope more people will adopt it as one of their engines."</p>
<blockquote><p>"The time cost for making 3D games and financial cost of learning the required skills is high. 2D development is easier and achievable on more affordable machines"</p></blockquote>
<p>Regional pricing can make all the difference, especially in countries that are beginning to embrace game subscriptions and digital purchases. But <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/not-everyone-bows-to-the-inevitability-of-subscription-models-opinion">not everyone’s sold</a> on this mode of expansion. Even fewer creators are optimistic about emerging tech like AI and NFTs.</p>
<p>As GameMaker’s parent company <a href="https://press.opera.com/2023/02/27/opera-openai-collaboration-announcement/">Opera collaborates with OpenAI</a>, the game engine is also poised to implement AI, reportedly without sacrificing individual expression. The official GameMaker roadmap suggests that this AI assistant is still a work in progress. If done right, it could help novices as they build their first game. But there’s enough <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ai-online-platform-regulation-and-loot-boxes-legal-trends-to-watch-in-2024#section-1">evidence of malpractice and talent theft</a> that any AI implementation warrants extra scrutiny.</p>
<p>Another aspect of GameMaker’s approach to accessibility is effective documentation. Matharoo mentions that, for newcomers and experienced users alike, "you don’t want to hide anything." When it comes to deconstructing technical concepts, Matharoo relies on one word: dissection.</p>
<p>"When a set of features is presented to me [to document], it’s usually a full page of information presented in no particular order," he tells us. "It’s a substantial task to digest all that information and understand it fully. Once I have an understanding of the subject matter, I create a document and compartmentalize everything into separate sections and sub-sections."</p>

 </a>
<figcaption>GameMaker made its engine free for non-commercial use in the wake of the Unity Runtime Fee fiasco</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Focusing on "crucial steps to use the system for the first time" and "anything that impacts their use of the system" helps Matharoo design a "beginner-friendly guide that even non-beginners can benefit from."</p>
<p>"I first make a high-level plan of what I’m going to document. I usually divide all information into separate pages. I ensure each page is clean and digestible, and don’t hesitate to add another page if it makes things simpler. Using links is also important, as it’s an invitation to the reader to read more."</p>
<blockquote><p>"I hope more people within the industry educate others about game development and push schools to include game-making in their curriculum"</p></blockquote>
<p>Matharoo likens it to going "deep into a Wikipedia rabbit hole."</p>
<p>As an engine geared towards 2D development, it’s no surprise that GameMaker is finding a user base in emerging markets.</p>
<p>"The time cost for developing 3D games and the financial cost of learning the required skills is high," Matharoo tells us. "2D development, on the other hand, is easier to kickstart and is achievable on more affordable machines. For developers with a passion for 2D games, that is all they need. That is where GameMaker supports the indie heart of India. The program is easy to access (Windows, Mac, and Linux) and does not require a particularly strong system. We even have a Chromebook beta!"</p>
<p>Despite the layoffs and the turbulent weather faced by the gaming industry, Matharoo remains optimistic. He believes that game development is "an incredibly fun hobby, and as an ever-growing industry, a perfectly viable career path."</p>
<p>"As a fun way to learn problem-solving, programming, art, music, and many other skills, it’s incredibly fruitful," he concludes. "I hope that more people within the industry educate others about game development and push our schools to include game-making as part of their curriculum."</p>

<p data-characters="282" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Zombies</em> players are some of <em>Call of Duty</em>‘s most passionate fans, but with the release of the <em>MW3</em> Season 4 roadmap, those fans are slamming Sledgehammer for the lack of content for the mode, calling it “pathetic” and claiming that the dev has given up on the game. </p> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">Activision dropped the Season 4 roadmap on Monday, May 20, giving fans a look at what’s coming to both <em>MW3</em> and <em>Warzone</em>. With the major <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/yes-its-real-gundam-is-coming-to-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Gundam</em> crossover</a> and the return of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-is-the-kar98k-coming-to-warzone-mw3-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kar98k</a> sniper on the way, there’s been big disappointment among <em>Zombies</em> fans who got just one small square in the roadmap. </p> <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="683" data-injectable="true">Unstable Rift is the sole addition to <em>Zombies</em>, which will see players go through a portal and head to a new location to fight off a large horde of zombies to earn rewards during matches. Not only are <em>Zombies </em>fans disappointed in this offering, but the fact that it’s an in-season inclusion and won’t be available when <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mw3-season-4-early-patch-notes-new-maps-modes-killstreaks-and-equipment-items/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 4</a> launches has really riled them up. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>You’ll need to search for <em>Zombies</em>. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="555" data-injectable="true">In a post on the official <em>Zombies</em> subreddit, players were quick to slam Sledgehammer for the lack of content, with punchrockchest calling it the “worst update ever,” while –ULTRA– labeled the lack of content “pathetic.”</p>
 <p data-characters="519" data-current-count="519" data-injectable="true">“This is just sad at this point,” bemoaned Fall_Cake. “I feel so depressed looking at that.” For many, the fact that <em>Zombies</em> as a mode takes up less space on the roadmap than Ranked Play rewards and even new Killstreaks for multiplayer is a sign of how little the dev team cares about the mode, with one particularly frustrated player writing: “Remember when they said that the amount of Zombies content in Season 1 is what we should expect for every season? Aged like f**king milk.”</p>
 <p data-characters="320" data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false">Unfortunately, it doesn’t look like things are going to get better either, with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/treyarch-focusing-on-cod-2024-not-working-on-mw3-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Treyarch no longer working on the mode</a> as they focus on this year’s <em>Call of Duty</em> release. For <em>MW3 Zombies</em>, it seems like time is truly up, and no major updates are coming down the pipe for the rest of the game’s lifespan. </p>

            <p>Nintendo has made its first acquisition in two years.</p>
<p>The company has entered a deal with embattled Swedish games company Embracer to purchase Shiver Entertainment, a studio responsible for porting the likes of Mortal Kombat 1 and Hogwarts Legacy onto Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>On the deal's completion, which is "pending satisfaction" of all relevant customary closing conditions, Nintendo will acquire 100 percent of Shiver's outstanding shares, making it a wholly owned subsidiary.</p>

<p>"By welcoming Shiver's experienced and accomplished development team, Nintendo aims to secure high-level resources for porting and developing software titles," Nintendo said in its <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/240521e.pdf">notice of acquisition</a>.</p>

<p>
The first of these bundles, Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 + 2.5 ReMIX will feature improved textures, while purchasing either Kingdom Hearts 3 + ReMind DLC or the Integrum Masterpiece bundle will add a platform-exclusive Keyblade called Dead of Night.

<p>
Phew. That's <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/kingdom-hearts-pc">a lot of games</a>. We don't yet know the prices as they're currently not listed on Steam for pre-order or wishlist.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the next question is which of these to start with? Maybe just start from the top and work down?

<p>
If you're completely unfamiliar with the series, it originated on PS2 as a unique Final Fantasy meets Disney action-RPG, but has since expanded into a huge series of other games with a twisting, convoluted storyline that's taken on a life of its own.
</p>
<p>
The games are already available on PS4, Xbox One and Switch (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-back-catalogue-coming-to-nintendo-switch">poorly received cloud gaming versions</a>), as well as PC via the Epic Games Store.

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingdom-hearts-4-is-officially-on-the-way">Kingdom Hearts 4</a> is also on the way, revealed in 2022 with a new trailer for the series' 20th anniversary. Director Tetsuya Nomura has said his team is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nomura-trying-to-find-a-good-balance-of-final-fantasy-characters-in-kingdom-hearts-4">"trying to find a good balance" of Final Fantasy characters in the game</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/risk-of-rain-2">Risk Of Rain 2</a> is one of my fave <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> roguelikes, as it's a good time with pals and has all the hallmarks of things I enjoy most in my games: shooting and looting. That's why the latest free update excites me so, as it introduces an artifact that makes chests malicious and another that lets you hatch angry lizard companions. Oh, and there's a new map, too.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/632360/view/4184483630843392751">The Devotion Update</a>, AKA version 1.10, adds two new Artifacts - run modifiers, basically. The first of these is called the Artifact Of Delusion, which resets all chests once a teleporter event has finished (i.e., once you've killed a stage boss). You'll have a chance to return to chests you'd previously cracked open, but if you do, you'll be presented with three options: the item you were originally granted, and two you definitely weren't. If you remember what that specific chest gave you, then you'll get another! But if you don't, you'll lose the item entirely. My short term memory couldn't cope with this.</p>
<p>The other Artifact sounds like a winner, though. It's called the Artifact Of Devotion and it replaces drones (turrets, helpful healy bots etc.) with eggs that spawn Lemurian pals (little lizard guys). You'll need to sacrifice an item to hatch a lizard friend and if multiple Lemurians are present, items are shared between all of them. If a Lemurian survives a teleporter event, it'll grow stronger, giving them new attributes, plus an extra stack of whatever item you sacrificed to birth them. If they die, they'll drop a scrap of the same tier of item they were given and their item is straight up removed from the pool (ouch?). As someone who loves AI companions, I can't wait to raise my own lizardy guy.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, there's a new map called Verdant Falls to explore. It looks all lush and green with the odd waterfall, so that's me sold on it. There's also a new Mercenary skin that lets you dress up as the guy from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a>, and that I'm sort of indifferent about, but hey, it's a nice touch if you are a fan of Dead Cells Man.</p>
<p>Risk Of Rain 2's next DLC, Seekers Of The Storm, is "coming soon," so you may want to keep up with its progress over on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2306620/Risk_of_Rain_2_Seekers_of_the_Storm/">Steam page</a>. It'll add new maps, playable characters, items and more.</p>

            <p>The neighbourhood citizens of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-by-you-release-date">Life By You</a> are positioning themselves as bright-eyed pretenders to The Sims. But in this ultimate game of keeping-up-with-the-Jones, the life sim from Paradox has slipped on a wet kitchen tile. The game has been delayed for a third time, and the developers are reluctant to set a new date for the planned release into early access. "[We] believe it is more prudent to hold off while we plan ahead," said Mattias Lilja of Paradox Interactive, "rather than committing to a new date that we cannot be certain to meet." </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"After much consideration, we regret to announce that we have decided to retract Life by You’s Early Access release date, previously set for June 4th," said <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/media/update-on-life-by-yous-early-access-release-date">the announcement from Paradox's deputy CEO</a>. "This was not an easy decision, especially since we understand the anticipation and excitement that many players have for the game. However, we believe that additional development time is needed."</p>

<p>Announced in March last year, the game was originally set to launch in September 2023. But was then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-by-you-early-access-launch-delayed-until-march-2024">delayed into March 2024</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-by-yous-early-access-release-gets-another-delay-to-june-4th">once again to June</a>. </p>
<p>This might be understandable, given the scope of the game's goals to create a town-sized simulation in which all NPCs can be possessed at a moments notice. Life By You is hoping to distinguish itself from The Sims with deeper customisation and pawns whose powerful command of actual human language (as opposed to Simlish babble) allows them to live out deep and fulfilling lives. Katharine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-by-yous-humans-are-always-watching-you-and-some-of-them-can-be-real-creepy-about-it">saw a demo last year</a> in which she witnessed "a conga line of complete strangers who followed our demo character home and stood around her in an ominous circle while she was trying to do some gardening". Uh.</p>
<p>But she was also impressed by the scale and ambition of the sim. According to the developer, players will be able to edit and create quests, write their own character dialogue, come up with new traits, and directly control the characters in a third-person view, among many other mod-friendly tools. When you'll be able to do this, of course, we no longer know.</p>
<p>The Sims 4 was one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-management-games">best management games</a> but we don't yet know when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sims-5-everything-we-know">The Sims 5</a> will be coming out either, so I guess Paradox technically is keeping up. Life By You isn't the only one treading on EA's toes, however. There is also indie contender <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paralives">Paralives</a> to consider, which is due out some time next year. </p>

			<p>CD Projekt RED proudly announced that Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty has won awards for Best Polish Game and Best Polish Narrative at this year's Digital Dragons.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar, the <a href="https://conference.digitaldragons.pl/dd-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Dragons Awards</a> are the oldest and most prestigious awards in the Polish games industry. The winners are selected by the votes of experts appointed to the jury and the entire game development community. The gala, which took place on Monday, May 20, was right in the middle of the three-day-long Game Development Conference, one of the largest events of its kind in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>The Best Polish Narrative Award was received by Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty Open World Designer Jakub Tomczak and Quest Designer Maria Mazur. The game was also nominated for Best Polish Game Audio, Best Polish Game Visual Art, and Best Polish Game Design awards.</p>
<p>Here's the full list of Digital Dragons winners:</p>
<ul>
<li>Best Polish Game - Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty</li>
<li>Best Polish Game Design - Against the Storm</li>
<li>Best Polish Game Visual Art - Inkulinati</li>
<li>Best Polish Game Audio - The Invincible</li>
<li>Best Polish Narrative - Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty</li>
<li>Best Polish Mobile Game - Hero Legacy</li>
<li>Best Foreign Game - Baldur's Gate 3</li>
</ul>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty launched in late September to great reviews, completing the game's comeback alongside the free 2.0 update. I <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> in my review:</p>
<p><em>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty builds upon what was an already great game to deliver more fantastic storytelling (with a spy thriller theme, this time around), exciting combat, and very high-quality side content. The perk tree overhaul is a major improvement to progression, and additions like vehicle combat and the overhauled police system are very welcome, albeit not game-changing. If you've been holding out on Cyberpunk 2077 until now, you'll find a huge game with over 120 hours of quality content and an incredibly immersive game world to literally lose yourself in. On top of that, it's by far the most beautiful and technically advanced game available if you have the hardware for it (PC and RTX 40 GPU).</em></p>
<p>The game went on to sell <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-has-sold-more-than-5-million-units-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">over five million units in 2023</a>. CD Projekt RED is now busy with the next The Witcher game, but they are also already planning the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel currently codenamed Project Orion. It will be made at their Boston studio, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-project-orion-gets-high-profile-hires/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently bolstered</a> by recruiting many high-profile industry veterans.</p>

Why a mustache-sword? </em><a href="https://jackson-tegu.itch.io/sword-loser"><em>You’re about to find out.</em></a><em>”</em></p>
<p id="u6o3Uy">Back in 2010, I had one of the best interview experiences of my journalistic career: two hours talking to cartoonist and author Lynda Barry about <a href="https://www.avclub.com/lynda-barry-1798223619">what it takes to get adults comfortable with making art</a>. Barry’s signature work, <a href="https://isthmus.com/arts/looking-back-at-ernie-pooks-comeek-by-lynda-barry/"><em>Ernie Pook’s Comeek</em></a>, was a quirky, often dark, often joyous four-panel experience that was <a href="https://drawnandquarterly.com/press/the-new-york-public-library-chooses-a-lynda-barry-work-as-their-june-read/">like nothing else in the comics space</a>. But it had been published primarily in independent newspapers, and those were drying up all across the country. With the comic ended, Barry shifted to <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Making-Comics-Lynda-Barry/dp/1770463690?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Making-Comics-Lynda-Barry/dp/1770463690?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23924994__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23924994__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">writing books</a> inspired by her time <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08XQYVZ55?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08XQYVZ55?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23924994__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23924994__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">teaching art classes for adults</a> who came from “many different circumstances, from prison to graduate students.”</p>

<p id="teUv1j">Over and over, she found that adults would flinch when asked to draw something, out of a fear that they weren’t objectively talented enough to impress other people. Where a kid can sit down with crayons or paints without any sense of self-consciousness, she said, adults assume that if they create something that isn’t technically competitive with professional work, they’re exposing a weakness.</p>
<p id="0LNNrf">As Barry put it, if you give a 4-year-old a paper and paint, and they refuse to touch it, “we worry about her emotionally” — but the same refusal in an adult just seems normal. Barry was fascinated with figuring out why at some point, drawing for fun stops seeming like a natural impulse, and starts to seem — well, <em>childish</em>.</p>

<p id="Zlu29g">I’ve thought about that conversation a lot over the years, especially as I encounter more and more small indie RPGs built around creating artifacts of play at the table, whether it’s cutting out paper snowflakes in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/23997106/best-rpgs-zero-no-prep-dnd-alternative-indie-tabletop"><em>To Serve Her Wintry Hunger</em></a>, making a conspiracy string-board in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/22967708/the-slow-knife-indie-rpg-kickstarter-count-of-monte-cristo"><em>The Slow Knife</em></a>, or creating an entire journal in prompt-based solo games like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/3/26/22352414/field-guide-to-memory-keepsake-game-impressions-interview"><em>The Field Guide to Memory</em></a>. Games like these offer adults a framework for crafting, writing, and drawing to tell a story. But they also offer an excuse to experiment creatively, without high-level expectations. There’s a sense of shared, distributed burden in these games, with the whole table collectively dissipating any lingering guilt or awkwardness around drawing just for satisfaction and relaxation. <em>If we’re all doing this, and we’re all adults, this is an adult thing to do, right?</em></p>
<p id="YHkgSZ">Which brings me to the enjoyably awkward, hilarious experience of playing Jackson Tegu’s <em>Sword Loser</em>, a storytelling RPG fundamentally about creating a library of “badly drawn pictures of swords,” then weaving a tale around them. Tegu, a <a href="https://www.photographsoflightning.com/">Pacific Northwest-based designer</a> whose games can be found at a <a href="https://alexandria.dk/en/data?person=1904">variety of sites</a> where <a href="https://jackson-tegu.itch.io/permanence">indie games are published</a>, including for <a href="https://www.patreon.com/jacksontegu">subscribers on Patreon</a>, created the first iteration of <em>Sword Loser</em> for backers in 2018, expanded it for convention play, then eventually <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jacksontegu/sword-loser-and-tool-user">funded an illustrated zine version via Kickstarter in 2019</a>, along with a companion drawing-based RPG, <em>Tool User</em>. <em>Sword Loser</em> is  <a href="http://itch.io/">currently available for purchase at Itch.io</a>.</p>
<p id="EXH3Bc">In <em>Sword Loser</em>, players sit down together and draw some cool swords on index cards. The definition of “cool” is entirely up to the artist; in my original playthrough, at the 2019 <a href="https://www.originsgamefair.com/">Origins Game Fair</a>, one person lovingly drew a triple-bladed, flaming, black-hued, skull-hilted weapon, while others drew cartoony swords that doubled as, respectively, a trebuchet, a corkscrew, and a mustache. There’s no sense of ownership around these sword drawings — they all go into a common Sword Pool.</p>

</p>
<p id="VztvS9">The point of the game isn’t just to draw cool swords, although that’s plenty of fun on its own. The game does have a short rulebook that players are meant to read through together; it includes the backstory on the titular “sword loser,” Tyngauld, a lovable, frequently intoxicated rake who’s terrific at using swords, and terrible at keeping track of them.</p>
<p id="1aINFM">Play rotates around the table. During their turn, players can either pull any sword drawing from the Sword Pool, telling the story of how Tyngauld acquired it, and moving it to a play area called Tyngauld’s Chambers, or take a sword from the Chambers and narrate how Tyngauld lost it. Maybe he fought a ferocious dragon with that three-bladed, skull-handled monster, and was forced to bury the sword afterward, still embedded in the dragon’s iceforged crystalline heart, preventing the monster’s resurrection. Maybe he got drunk and left that three-blade sword at one of the many taverns on his latest pub crawl, and was deeply embarrassed the next morning when he went looking for it and found out it had burned down his favorite inn. Either way, it’s gone, and you move on to the next sword story.</p>
<p id="hwNRzt"><em>Sword Loser</em> is extremely freeform, with no set amount of play time: Tegu suggests somewhere between 20 minutes and an hour, depending on the number of players and how long everyone’s still enjoying the game. As the rules put it:</p>
<blockquote><p id="N6LJPF">There is no gaining of points, no keeping of score. There’s no winner, or rather, there’s only one loser and we’ve already met him. You’ll know the game is over when there’s a general feeling of having had enough.</p></blockquote>
<p id="PVn3tK">Even five years after my own hour-long game, I still remember <em>Sword Loser</em> vividly and fondly. It made an impression on me because its structure so neatly gets around the barrier Lynda Barry was exploring and trying to smash through. This style of RPG expressly invites grown-ups to sit down and create something, with no expectations of world-class talent, and no sense of competition or comparison.</p>

<p id="azlodh">No one expects high artistry out of a quick index-card sketch of a sword. All the game is looking for is creativity, specificity, and interactivity. Two swords tied together at the hilts to make sword-chucks, a sword spotted like a Dalmatian, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23921769">a ludicrously large sword</a> or a ludicrously tiny one — those are fun to come up with and fun to draw. They’re also fun to hand over to everyone else at the table as a subtle challenge: <em>Can you make something memorable and enjoyable out of this particular prompt? I dare you to try.</em></p>
<p id="LTc8Wu">The game is also expressly designed for collaborative creativity, and to foster a shared sense of participation and engagement. The rules encourage players to listen to other participants’ stories — and draw more swords for the Sword Pool while they listen. There’s a relaxing communal feeling to sitting around doodling swords while listening to other people’s Tyngauld tales, somewhere halfway between modern art therapy and the ancient ritual of spinning tales together around a fire. But in this case, it’s expressly clear that doodling isn’t checking out, it’s opting in. Every new piece of sword art on the table gives the next storyteller more options.</p>
<p id="m6oZtB">For players steeped in past roleplay experiences, swords are the perfect subject for this kind of game. They suggest adventure and intrigue — enemies to overcome, fighting skills to acquire or sharpen, sparring and competition, or combat and survival. Games like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/dnd-dungeons-dragons">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> and its many imitators are packed with diverse, exotic weapons options, but the sword is iconic and cross-cultural. (There’s a reason nobody makes<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23943781/blue-eye-samurai-netflix-review"> bittersweet, thrilling animated shows</a> about the best mace-maker in a country, and their relationship with the best mace-wielder.)</p>

<p id="wdbxrI">What I love most about <em>Sword Loser</em>, though, is that it invites adults to play exactly like kids do, by making up a thing and telling a story about it, without any self-consciousness or shame. You could certainly play this game with children without any rules modifications, but my experiences with it have all been with adults — some of whom, as Barry foreshadowed, came to the table apologetic or reluctant because they weren’t confident about their art skills. Making <em>Sword Loser </em>a silly icebreaker game about over-the-top swords certainly helps defang that anxiety: People have more space to be self-deprecating about their art in a game no one’s taking too seriously.</p>
<p id="USRiYM">Like most storytelling games, however, <em>Sword Loser</em> can adjust to any tone the players can agree on. Tyngauld is written as a bit of a twit, but he’s also meant to be a master swordsman. You can certainly turn <em>Sword Loser</em> into a dramatic story about heroism and battle. He might be a frustrated adventurer whose epic-class battles are so onerous that they inevitably destroy his weapons. He might be a fighter under a powerful curse, prone to losing weapons just before the fight where he most needs them, and constantly struggling to survive long enough for the next battle. </p>
<p id="mQgkmx">It all just depends on what you want to draw, and what kind of story you most want to tell. Just a word of advice: If you want to play <em>Sword Loser </em>as a straight and serious game about lost swords and lost hopes, maybe don’t sit down and draw yourself a mustache-sword.</p>
