			<p>Valve believes the new Steam Machine can succeed where the first models failed, and according to two senior engineers, the reason is simple: the software finally caught up, leading to a wider game catalogue.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-a-new-steam-machine-when-the-first-ones-flopped-because-this-time-valve-say-itll-actually-have-games">Rock Paper Shotgun</a>, Yazan Aldehayyat stated that one of the reasons the original Steam Machines failed was the lack of software, as very few games were compatible with SteamOS (based on Linux), and only a few games could run well using other compatibility tools like Wine.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"We learned from the first Steam Machines that we needed to make our developers’ lives a lot easier," </em>Aldehayyat said. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"So now we have Proton, right? Which is essentially just a compatibility layer that lets games run on Linux, that are originally meant for Windows.</em>"</p>



<p>Pierre-Loup Griffais echoes the sentiment, saying that the small game catalogue was the reason the older Steam Machines failed, highlighting that many of the features of the new Steam Machine, such as the ease of use that's closer to a console than a PC, were already there. And with the system seeing limited adoption, developers had no incentive to develop Linux ports of their games. The work done on Proton since the launch of the Steam Deck has now ensured the new Steam Machine will have a big game catalogue from launch.</p>



<p>SteamOS has also been improved a lot since the launch of the original Steam Machine, and plenty of performance optimization work has been done on the operating system to improve the Steam Deck performance. For the new system, Valve has done <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"a tonne of work on desktop performance, ray tracing, and all that stuff,"</em> and now, it is expected that the same performance advantages introduced on Steam Deck over time after its launch with work on SteamOS will be available on the new Steam Machine as well.</p>



<h2 id="h-with-good-software-optimization-the-new-steam-machine-could-punch-well-above-its-specs">With Good Software Optimization, the new Steam Machine Could Punch Well Above Its Specs</h2>



<p>The new Valve system won't be a powerhouse exactly. Its official technical specifications, revealed earlier this week, which you can find below, position the system between the Xbox Series S and the PlayStation 5.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>Specification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>I/O</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Displays</td><td><strong>DisplayPort 1.4:</strong><br>- Up to 4K @ 240Hz or 8K@60Hz<br>- Supports HDR, FreeSync, daisy-chaining<br><strong>HDMI 2.0:</strong><br>- Up to 4K @ 120Hz<br>- Supports HDR, FreeSync, CEC</td></tr><tr><td>USB</td><td>- Two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 (front)<br>- Two USB-A 2.0 High speed (back)<br>- One USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 (back)</td></tr><tr><td>Networking</td><td>Gigabit ethernet</td></tr><tr><td>LED Strip</td><td>17 individually addressable RGB LEDs for system status and customization</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Size &amp; Weight</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>152 mm tall (148 mm without feet), 162.4 mm deep, 156 mm wide</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>2.6 kg</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Software</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Operating System</td><td>SteamOS 3 (Arch-based)</td></tr><tr><td>Desktop</td><td>KDE Plasma</td></tr><tr><td><strong>General</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>CPU</td><td>Semi-custom AMD Zen 4 6 Cores /12 Threads<br>- Up to 4.8 GHz, 30W TDP</td></tr><tr><td>GPU</td><td>Semi-custom AMD RDNA3 28 Compute Units<br>- 2.45GHz max sustained clock, 110W TDP</td></tr><tr><td>RAM</td><td>16GB DDR5 + 8GB GDDR6 VRAM</td></tr><tr><td>Power</td><td>Internal power supply, AC 110-240V</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>Two models, both with a high-speed microSD slot:<br>- 512GB NVMe SSD<br>- 2TB NVMe SSD</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Connectivity</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Wi-Fi</td><td>2x2 Wi-Fi 6E</td></tr><tr><td>Bluetooth</td><td>Bluetooth 5.3 with a dedicated antenna</td></tr><tr><td>Steam Controller</td><td>Integrated 2.4 GHz Steam Controller wireless adapter</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Although the new Steam Machine is expected to run games at 4K@60Hz, early tests suggest some games, such as Cyberpunk 2077, may struggle to hit these performance targets. The system, however, is still far from launch, and with further improvements to its software side, the new Steam Machine could deliver better performance than in its current pre-release state, although the 8 GB of VRAM is definitely a limiting factor, and will be even more so in the future.</p>



<p>And if the new Steam Machine becomes as popular as the Steam Deck, it wouldn't be surprising to see either presets dedicated to the machine or even Steam Machine native builds that deliver better performance, as we have seen with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-steam-deck-native-performance-act-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-native-steam-deck-build-performance/">Cronos: The New Dawn native builds.</a></p>



<h2 id="h-price-will-determine-the-steam-machine-s-success">Price Will Determine the Steam Machine's Success</h2>



<p>With the game catalogue issue of the original Steam Machines solved, it will likely be the price that determines the success of the Steam Machine. Valve is well aware of this, and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-pricing-will-be-really-competitive-with-building-a-similar-pc/">Yazan Aldehayyat confirmed it will be very competitive</a>. How much it will be remains to be seen, as the cost of the system when <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/">it launches early next year</a> has yet to be confirmed.</p>

Cicadamata" - yes the rogue apostrophes are part of the official title, yes I will exclude them in future because they make my thalamus itch - is one of those games that makes me incandescently sorry I didn't spend the past 20 years studying graphics design so that I could, for example, tell you what exactly is going on with that icecream bar HUD, those landscapes of bright diodes and cubes sliding through checkerboard obelisks, those twirling android digits, that wrist-rolling Muji paperweight of a shotgun.

The best I can do is defensively blurt words like "stylish" and "stylised" and fish desperately into my decreasing pocketful of "Cool" pop and gaming precedents and trends. This looks like... a frantic arena <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> set inside the menu of a classic WipEout game? Like, er, a playable vaporwave album? I feel like we've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-cant-stop-trying-to-go-faster-in-neon-white-even-with-a-record-time">invoked</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ok-normal-is-a-psx-era-nightmare">vaporwave</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/broken-reality-out-now-with-demo">a lot</a> on here, and need to start identifying subgenres of vapors and waves. Look, why don't you watch the trailer while I try to nail down a gloss. Usefully for my dignity, you will not be able to read the words below the video embed because your eyes will have popped out of your skull.

<p>
Hello again! Assuming you still have connected retinas, I have some updates: people on the socials have been comparing Cicadamata to nu-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, and it seems the developer, flowergarden, is <a href="https://x.com/onaeire/status/1989042466876485726">some kind of fan</a>. I can certainly see a little of the upcoming Bungie game's art direction in there, though thankfully, none of its extraction-shooteriness. As <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3817250/CICADAMATA/">the Steam page</a> explains, this is a mix of platformer, shooter and speedrunning game in which you "hop, skip, and jump to become one with joyeuse, until you are no longer you". At the risk of blunting the hyperactive swagger of that Steam page, it looks like you play some kind of robot rabbit, Fawn-A2, and you'll be "tearing flesh from bone" in "15+ freeform levels across 6 spheres".
</p><p>
Hang on, robot rabbits! I know what this reminds me of: Jumping Flash! All those downward-looking ground-slams in the trailer are a dead ringer for the 1995 PS1 game, as are the chirrupy whoops and bops of the kill and platforming effects. Robbit wasn't this lethal, though - it's like he's been modded into Ultrakill. Cicadamata is out in 2026.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tp-link-dual-band-wifi-7-3-pack-is-practically-pennies-per-unit-the-cheapest-way-to-upgrade-your-whole-home.1353931/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Slow internet speeds aren’t just frustrating. They can affect everything from your work to late-night streaming sessions. If you’re done dealing with dead zones and calls dropping off mid-sentence, you need a solid mesh Wi-Fi system.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5582/">The TP-Link Deco BE25 WiFi 7 is a great option to consider, and right now, its 3-pack system is going for $200 on Amazon.</a> You’re saving $70 on a solution that delivers the speeds you’re actually paying for, in every corner of your house. It’s an early Black Friday offer, which means it is most likely going to wrap up soon, before the actual event begins. Grab it for less while the discount is still live!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5582/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Stable Connection for All Your Devices</h2>
<p>This 3-pack setup offers coverage up to 6,600 sq. ft. The 4 high-gain antennas and 4 high-power FEMs are capable of supporting over 150 devices without compromising performance, which means you can connect all your essentials – smartphone, laptop, PC, gaming console, tablet, and more – without experiencing lags or slowdowns.</p>
<p>As for the speed, the Deco BE25 taps into Wi-Fi 7 with a 4-stream dual-band setup that reaches up to 5 Gbps combined; that’s 4,324 Mbps on the 5GHz band and 688 Mbps on 2.4GHz. Those on a multi-gig service will finally be able to take full advantage of their internet plan with exceptional, ultra-fast speeds. It’s actually the kind of performance that makes a lot of difference while working on resource-intensive creative projects or playing some cutting-edge online games. Multiple 4K streams or back-to-back video calls won’t be a problem either. Each unit also comes with two 2.5G WAN/LAN ports, which you can use for high-performance wired connections.</p>



<p>Deco Mesh works by creating a unified network with a single network name and then uses AI-Roaming technology for optimal speeds throughout your property. You can move around your house without manually switching between networks, as your devices will automatically stay connected to the fastest node.</p>
<p>You’ll also have access to TP-Link’s HomeShield platform, which offers a bunch of free security features like network security scans, IoT device identification, parental controls, and quality of service tools. As for compatibility, the units work well with any internet service provider (requires a modem) and are even backward compatible with all previous Wi-Fi standards.</p>
<p>All in all, this mesh system offers impressive coverage and fast performance. Don’t wait too long to grab it, as discounts this good tend to wrap up fast.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-previews-trailer-ncps-companion-2000644368</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metroid-prime-4-has-a-chatty-companion-who-won%E2%80%99t-shut-up.1353928/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Fresh previews just dropped for <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-release-date-motorcycle-open-world-2000625308"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a>, that big Nintendo holiday blockbuster we still haven’t <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-trailer-nintendo-switch-release-date-2000641104">gotten a dedicated Direct for</a>, and they document a troubling discovery. At least for the game’s opening areas, the stoic bounty hunter Samus Aran isn’t alone. Instead, she’s accompanied by what is reportedly a very annoying Galactic Federation trooper named Myles MacKenzie. A new trailer reveals he’s not the game’s only sidekick, either.</p> <p>“Oh wow! Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow. What a mess. You’re alone, on a planet, with no hope of survival. But, you’re also not sitting next to Phil anymore in that cubicle…So…Win?” That’s apparently how Myles introduces himself in <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, according to a recent <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-the-final-preview"><em>IGN</em> preview</a>. <em>Metroid</em> fans are used to quiet, creepy adventures investigating strange mysteries on alien planets. The last thing most of us want is an NPC constantly babbling nonsense in our ears.</p>

 <p>But it sounds like that’s exactly what Myles does, at least in the early part of the game. He sounds full of cringe-y, MCU-style quips and the most obvious tips, like telling you to use missiles to damage armored enemies. “I was in complete disbelief at how Myles was <em>constantly&nbsp;</em>talking during gameplay, to the point where I dug around the settings menu to see if I could tone it down,” <em>IGN</em>‘s Logan Plant writes. “The only option I found was to mute voice acting entirely…”</p>

 <p>Not good! Potentially even worse, Myles isn’t alone either. A new trailer today revealed even more trooper companions:</p>  <p>The overview introduces three additional humans Samus will come into contact with, seemingly in different parts of <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>‘s world. With previews stating that the game features four main biomes forking off of the central desert hub area, this heavily implies that Samus will be working with one of the stranded troopers in each of the different areas.</p>

 <p>“Like Samus, some Galactic Federation troopers were also transported to Viewros,” we learn from the new trailer. “Follow distress signals to help the troopers, and occasionally battle alongside them. They can provide useful upgrades. Teamwork is key if any of you hope to escape the planet alive.”</p>

 <p>Will they all be as chatty annoying as Myles apparently is? Hopefully not. It’s still a major red flag, though.</p> <p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/so-far-metroid-prime-4-doesnt-feel-like-metroid-at-all/"><em>VGC</em>‘s Andy Robinson</a> was equally critical of<em> Metroid Prime 4</em>‘s opening hours, finding an escort mission that required him to defend Myles particularly off-putting. “By itself, these feel like pretty uninteresting mechanics,” he wrote. “But inside a <em>Metroid</em> game, it feels particularly disappointing.<em> Beyond</em>’s opening section felt like a solid, if predictable, <em>Prime</em> game drenched in a puddle of gameplay and narrative tropes, each sabotaging what makes the franchise beloved by fans. <em>Metroid</em> games are essentially sci-fi horror, but so far, <em>Beyond</em> feels like <em>Indiana Jones</em> – and not the good ones, either.”</p>

 <p>You don’t have to be a diehard <em>Metroid</em> fan to be turned off by overly yappy NPCs. <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-atreus-hints-puzzles-suljic-ps4-ps5-1850300067"><em>God of War</em>‘s Atreus</a> constantly interrupting quiet moments with unwanted hints was one of the bigger knocks against <em>Ragnarök</em> until an option was later patched in to make his suggestions less frequent. Even when the writing isn’t annoying, I still get tired of NPCs constantly talking to fill the lulls between action. Just because nothing is happening in the game doesn’t mean nothing is happening for me as the player.</p> <p>We’ll find out if it’s as big of a drag in the rest of <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-red-samus-trailer-date-switch-2-1851772697"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em> once it’s out on December 4</a>. And if it is, well, I hope Retro Studios is already working on a way to patch in an option to cut Myles’ mic.</p>

              <p>Losing your keys, wallet or backpack happens to the best of us and Apple just made the solution super affordable. The company kicked off a serious Black Friday sale on AirTags, dropping prices to record lows we have never seen on these trackers before. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">four-pack now sits at $64 instead of the usual $99</a>, while <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4215/">a single AirTag costs just $18 down from $29</a>. What really makes this deal great is that <strong>AirTags now cost less than the main competitors</strong> like Samsung and Tile, despite offering significantly more reliable tracking thanks to Apple’s massive network of devices.</p>

<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See 4x AirTag at Amazon</a></p>

<p>AirTags work by tapping into the <em>Find My</em> network, which includes <strong>hundreds of millions of Apple devices around the world</strong>. When you misplace something with an AirTag attached, nearby iPhones, iPads, and Macs anonymously relay its location back to you without those device owners even knowing. This network density gives AirTags a serious advantage over rival trackers that rely on smaller user bases. You get precise location data in crowded areas where Apple devices are everywhere, from airports and shopping centers to coffee shops and office buildings. The <strong>whole system works completely anonymously and securely</strong>&nbsp;so your location data remains private while still helping you find your lost items.</p>



<h2>Precision Finding That Works</h2>
<p>Setting up an AirTag takes all of ten seconds with your iPhone or iPad: you pull the tab to turn it on, hold it near your device and it automatically pairs with one tap. You assign it to something, such as keys or a backpack, and it immediately shows up in the Find My app alongside your other Apple devices. It’s a completely frictionless process compared to trackers that require separate apps and fiddly Bluetooth pairing routines.</p>
<p>Precision Finding leverages Ultra Wideband technology to take you directly to your AirTag when nearby. On-screen directions on your iPhone feature distance and arrow indicators, almost like a game of hot and cold, that take you straight to your lost item. This works incredibly well in your home or office when something slides between couch cushions or ends up buried under a pile of papers. You can also <strong>let the AirTag play a sound to help locate it by ear</strong>&nbsp;which proves useful when Precision Finding narrows it down but you still need that final audio cue.</p>



<p>And if someone actually does lose something far from home, the<em> Find My</em> network keeps working in the background. When any Apple device comes near your lost AirTag, it securely and anonymously updates the location in your<em> Find My</em> app. You’ll get a notification showing you exactly where to find it on a map. The system even works when your AirTag is in Lost Mode, which lets you add contact information so someone who finds your item can reach you directly.</p>
<p>AirTags are built for <strong>real-world conditions with IP67 water and dust resistance</strong>. Attach them to a gym bag, drop them into a travel backpack, or clip them to your dog’s collar; rain and dirt aren’t going to ruin them. They’re small enough to slip into a wallet’s card slot or attach to your keychain without adding bulk. Apple designed them to be durable and practical for everyday use, not fragile gadgets you need to baby.</p>
<p>That means the $64 four-pack provides coverage for your most important items at only $16 per tracker, cheaper than buying four single AirTags separately, even at the discounted $18 price. You can tag your keys, wallet, backpack, and car keys all at once, creating a complete tracking system for everything you regularly misplace. The peace of mind from knowing you can locate your essentials in seconds pays for itself the first time you avoid being late because you couldn’t find your keys.</p>

<p>NCSoft’s and PlayStation’s Horizon Steel Frontiers is not the only multiplayer game on the horizon; Guerrilla Games has something cooking in this space as well. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Horizon Steel Frontiers is a new MMORPG that was revealed yesterday. It is launching for PC and mobile devices, but we do not have a release date yet. Also, a new interview recently revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-developers-used-ai-extensively/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI was used ‘extensively</a>‘ in the development process of the upcoming multiplayer game. </p>







<h2 id="h-guerrilla-s-horizon-multiplayer-title-is-their-next-big-project">Guerrilla’s Horizon Multiplayer Title is their ‘Next Big Project’</h2>



<p>The clarification about Guerrilla’s Horizon multiplayer title came through a post by Jason Schreier on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m5jd6otif22v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BlueSky</a>. Schreir stated, “Just to clear up some confusion I’ve seen,’ Horizon Steel Frontiers’ from NCSoft is different from the multiplayer Horizon game that’s in development at Guerrilla Games.” Schreier added that Guerrilla Games’ upcoming Horizon multiplayer title is their “next big project”. He also thinks that NCSoft’s MMO is “meant for Asian markets”. </p>



<p>The Horizon franchise has been in the news a lot lately. Earlier this year, it was all about Sony’s Horizon clone <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-files-lawsuit-against-tencent-for-allegedly-copying-the-horizon-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lawsuit against Tencent</a> for the latter’s upcoming title, Light of Motiram. Then the focus shifted to NCSoft and PlayStation’s Horizon Steel Frontiers, which dropped an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bN-NNgWIyIQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 10-minute video</a> revealing some gameplay and other elements of the title. And now, we have been informed that another Horizon multiplayer game is on the way; it seems the series fans have a lot to look forward to in the coming years. </p>







<p>In other news, court documents have revealed that the Horizon Zero Dawn movie is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-zero-dawn-movie-planned-to-release-in-2027-court-documents-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planned to release in 2027</a>. Additionally, Tencent recently responded to the lawsuit, stating, “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-responds-to-sony-horizon-clone-lawsuit-fame-does-not-create-a-trademark/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fame doesn’t create a trademark</a>.” What are your thoughts on another Horizon multiplayer game being worked on by Guerrilla Games?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"It's about to get reeeal nerdy in here!"</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hands-on impressions of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> have hit the internet, bringing stinging criticism of an early human sidekick. And now, a new trailer published by Nintendo shows Samus will also interact with a wider cast of human characters throughout the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In IGN's just-published <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-the-final-preview">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond hands-on preview</a>, we described Galactic Federation trooper Myles MacKenzie — who Samus gets lumbered with for a lengthy chunk of the game's opening area — as "mildly annoying to downright infuriating" with "cringey" dialogue and contstant chattering through gameplay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alongside Myles, three other human troopers are highlighted in Nintendo's new 7-minute Overview Trailer (which feels as close as we're going to get to a dedicated Direct) seemingly from later sections in the game. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond is structured with four major areas accessible via its desert hub (a forest area where you meet Myles, then an electrical power plant, frozen research center, and firey volcano area). The suggestion is that Samus will meet more of the main quartet in each.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Like Samus, some Galactic Federation troopers were also transported to Viewros," the trailer states. "Follow distress signals to help the troopers, and occasionally battle alongside them. They can provide useful upgrades. Teamwork is key if any of you hope to escape the planet alive."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A montage then shows the other troopers in action, chatting away about getting back to their families, donning a mech suit to smash a wall for Samus, and even prising open a door. Huh — couldn't Samus have just done that with a new suit upgrade?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, Metroid games have featured other human characters before — even while Samus is typically a silent protagonist. But the real concern here, beyond it interrupting the core solitary exploration of most Metroid adventures, is that the human characters on offer in Beyond are simply too distracting, and too unlikable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we discovered in our hands-on preview, gameplay with Myles features escort-style sections and moments where you need to defend the hapless trooper while he hides behind the rock. Allow him to perish in a firefight and you're given the chance to revive him using Samus' psychic powers. Fail to do so (or try and refuse) and you get a Game Over screen. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of all the things Metroid Prime 4 could’ve been, I never would’ve guessed it would include outdated escort missions with a companion that never stops talking," we wrote.

But GTA 6 is not a magic bullet and cannot solve the wider issues within gaming as it relates to health and stability, according to analyst and NYU Stern professor Joost van Dreunen.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-has-been-delayed-again-how-does-this-impact-the-rest-of-the-industry" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">He told IGN </a>that people should not look to GTA 6 to help address the wider, more systemic issues impacting the video game business. GTA 6, of course, is expected to have a gargantuan debut, with one firm modeling sales of 40 million and revenue of $3 billion in the first year alone. Van Dreunen concurs that GTA 6 will be a massive launch, but said people are overly optimistic if they think GTA 6 is a magic bullet.</p><p>"After the high comes the hangover," he said. "I realize that many in the industry are looking forward to this undoubtedly pivotal moment. There's even a somewhat naive expectation that this one release will reverse the industry's current direction. It won't."</p><p>When GTA 6 comes out, gamers and investors alike with "enjoy their respective highs," but the painful comedown may come next.</p><p>"I expect a period of sobriety to follow. In the absence of any similar releases in the near future especially investors are likely to redeploy their capital elsewhere, thereby lowering the industry's overall valuation," he said.</p><p>The video game industry has faced cuts and setbacks in recent years, including a spate of mass layoffs, price increases, and numerous game cancellations.</p><p>People like former PlayStation executive Shawn Layden have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-says-aaa-game-development-/1100-6478908/" data-ref-id="1100-6478908">saying time and again that the AAA scene is unsustainable.</a> In 2012, Assassin's Creed III director Alex Hutchinson said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pursuit-of-aaa-is-a-cancerous-growth-ac3-dev/1100-6365381/" data-ref-id="1100-6365381">the pursuit of AAA games represents a "cancerous growth." </a>Because of this, Hutchinson said he expects AAA games to die out. "I think that will leave the AAA blockbusters as nothing more than the last of the dinosaurs," he said.</p><p>GTA 6 is set for release in November 2026 on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, following a delay from May 2026.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/round-up-the-final-previews-are-in-for-metroid-prime-4-beyond</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/round-up-the-final-previews-are-in-for-metroid-prime-4-beyond.1353889/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Believe it or not, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is almost upon us. That <strong>4th December</strong> release date is Morph Balling ever closer, and today, we've got our latest round of hands-on previews to give us a taste of what we can expect.</p>
<p>Our very own video producer extraordinaire, Alex Olney, was lucky enough to attend an extended preview event for Samus' latest adventure, and it sounds like he had a jolly good time. In the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/metroid-prime-4-beyond-is-great-but-i-want-to-kill-one-of-its-characters">preview</a>, Alex sings the praises of the game's fun new psychic abilities and gorgeous environments, though one of the new Galactic Troopers firmly got on his nerves.</p>
<p>Here's a snippet from the full hands-on:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One of the biggest and most important parts of the Prime series (and the Metroid series as a whole) is the feeling of isolation, loneliness, and that you’re being forced to fight against the environment that doesn’t want you there to begin with. That notion is entirely destroyed once you introduce a character that blathers away at you incessantly, and it'll be a crying shame if this is something that is present throughout the full game’s runtime</p>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:193706 @ 1763136004 -->
<p>But Mr. Olney wasn't the only one to share his preliminary thoughts on the game today; quite the opposite, in fact! Other outlets have also had the chance to play through an early section of the game, and we've assembled the following round-up to see what a selection of them made of it.</p>
<p>We'll kick things off with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-delivers-the-series-trademark-gameplay-in-spades-but-i-fear-one-very-annoying-addition-might-derail-the-whole-thing">Eurogamer</a>, where the outlet's preview mirrored many of the same concerns as ours: the game looks and plays wonderfully, but gosh, that Trooper is annoying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I enjoyed the puzzles, the shooting, and very much appreciated the game's control options and visual flair. A huge amount of trepidation about Metroid's usually glorious atmosphere being wrecked now runs through that anticipation, though, like lettering through a stick of seaside rock.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Things went much the same way in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-the-final-preview">IGN</a>'s preview, too, where the gorgeous environments and classic puzzles were overshadowed by a chatty companion:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Classic Metroid Prime exploration and combat, an intriguing setup, gorgeous art direction, and great technical performance on Switch 2 are coming together to create an adventure that likely won’t redefine Metroid in any meaningful way – or live up to the unrealistic hype built by nearly a decade of waiting – but one that could serve as a great return for a subseries that hasn’t seen a new mainline entry in 18 years, as long as annoying sidekicks don’t keep getting in Samus’ way.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/so-far-metroid-prime-4-doesnt-feel-like-metroid-at-all/">VGC</a>'s worries about these features ran even deeper, with the outlet's preview cautiously warning that the opening section "didn’t feel much like Metroid at all":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What Metroid Prime 4 is seemingly trying to be is a far less interesting, and more dated, type of first-person action game with none of the mood the series is known for.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's not all doom and gloom, mind you. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-samuss-psychic-abilities-are-more-than-a-gimmick/1100-6536193/">GameSpot</a> didn't find Myles MacKenzie nearly as annoying as other outlets, even going as far as to call him "endearing", and instead focused much of the preview on Samus' cool new psychic powers:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nintendo and Retro Studios appear to understand the fundamental core of what makes a Metroid Prime game, with satisfying exploration, tense combat puzzles, and meaningful new abilities that change how you look at the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/metroid/after-18-years-metroid-prime-4-beyond-is-a-surprisingly-magical-return-to-nintendos-legendary-series-and-im-all-in-on-psychic-abilities-and-the-power-of-friendship/">GamesRadar+</a> felt a similar way, it seems, writing that Samus' companions and abilities might make for a nice surprise in the long run:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Metroid Prime 4: Beyond demo I played, then, suggests an unexpected direction for the Metroid Prime series – possibly more whimsy than isolation. It's nothing like what I expected. But with the demanding life Samus has lived, I'm glad for all the butterflies she can get.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Wrapping things up, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-preview-switch-2/">Polygon</a>'s preview remains optimistic, noting how, despite the new features, the game still feels distinctly <em>Metroid</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Metroid Prime 4</em> is not just a rehash of Retro’s original run. It’s a tonal divergence, a bit sillier in places, a bit more gruesome in others. But <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> still plays the series’ greatest hits.</p>
</blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Just days ago, <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-is-a-full-fledged-mmorpg-for-pc-and-mobile/">NCSoft and Guerrilla Games revealed the long-anticipated MMO</a> set within Sony's Horizon universe, Horizon Steel Frontiers, and it looked like just about everything you might've expected from a Horizon MMO, which is to say that it looks like it'll be extremely fun and exciting to play. But, surprisingly, the reveal carried one glaring omission: it's not coming to PS5; it'll only launch on PC and mobile.</p>



<p>Why a new game made in collaboration with one of Sony's first-party PlayStation Studios, based on a Sony-owned, first-party IP, is not coming to Sony's flagship console is the million-dollar question surrounding Horizon Steel Frontiers, and in an interview with <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/960/G096074/20251113059/">Japanese publication 4Gamer</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-steel-frontier-developer-wants-playstation-release-but-its-not-something-we-can-decide-on-our-own">Eurogamer</a>), we get a bit of insight into the answer behind that million-dollar question.</p>



<p>According to NCSoft executive producer Lee Song, the studio has no problem bringing Horizon Steel Frontiers to PS5. In fact, it wants to deliver the game on PS5. So why wasn't PS5 one of the listed platforms when it was revealed? Well, it appears we'll have to ask Sony.</p>



<p>NCSoft has "<em>no reason</em>," Song said, not to bring the game to PS5. "<em>We would like to do it,</em>" he added, "<em>but it is not something we can decide on our own, so we would like to proceed with discussions</em>."</p>



<p>So if NCSoft is gun-ho to bring Horizon Steel Frontiers to PlayStation consoles, the remaining conclusion is that Sony is, for reasons unknown, blocking the game from its flagship console. </p>



<p>Perhaps it will eventually come to PS5, but Sony wants it to launch elsewhere as part of its plans to expand its reach outside of the PlayStation ecosystem on other platforms. Perhaps it figures that there's already a fan base of Horizon fans who will play Steel Frontiers on PS5 whenever it arrives on the console, but it would prefer to try and build a base of players on mobile and PC first, before going to the players it knows will buy into Steel Frontiers whenever it arrives on PlayStation.</p>



<p>Or perhaps Sony doesn't want Steel Frontiers on PlayStation at all, to keep a differentiating line between the experiences it delivers to console and the ones it'll bring to PC and mobile. All we can do is speculate, until Sony provides an answer, if it ever does. But at least we know who to ask.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-amd-ryzen-7-gaming-mini-pc-is-back-to-its-all-time-low-stock-is-being-cleared-before-black-friday-hits.1353877/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Mini PCs offer a third option from laptops and desktop PCs if you’re looking to run Windows without spending too much cash. They work brilliantly as dedicated work stations, supplemental devices to your other devices to get work done, or as your main device if you don’t want to take up too much space. They even make for handy little gaming units. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5581/">This GMKtec mini gaming PC happens to be on sale right now too. Amazon has the GMKtec K12 Gaming Mini PC discounted by 31% ahead of Black Friday.</a> For a limited time, you can grab this mini gaming PC for $220 off, bringing the price down from $720 to just $500.</p>
<p>As the name of the product category implies, a mini PC takes up substantially less room than a standard PC would. Heck, you can even reduce it’s footprint to zero by mounting it to the back of your display or monitor.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5581/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Designed for Gaming</h2>
<p>Taking a peak into the specs, The GMKtec mini PC is working with a Ryzen 7 H 255 processor. That has eight cores and 16 threads, an can run at up to 4.9 GHz. Paired with the powerful Radeon 780M iGPU, you can even get some decent gaming done with this hardware. The K12 mini PC is equipped with dual 16GB RAM, totaling to 32GB. It comes with a 512GB SSD but three SSD slots are available, each capable of reading up to 8TB for a max of 24TB. You get both Wi-Fi 6E support and Bluetooth 5.2 support built in.</p>
<p>The OCuLink port can take your gaming even further. You can actually plug into a beefier graphics card externally to get the gaming boost you’re looking for. Just know the mini PC doesn’t support hotswapping it. You’ll need to turn off the power first before plugging to or unplugging from a graphics card connection.</p>



<p>The base hardware is still pretty powerful, able to display in resolutions up to 8K if you need. It allows for connecting to up to four screens at once. The HDMI 2.1 will grant you up to 8K at 60Hz, the DisplayPort will grant you up to 4K at 60Hz, and the two USB-C can be used for display, though the product page doesn’t specs for those two.</p>
<p>Dual cooling fans help keep the rig from overheating. The two can deliver silent, ultra-efficient cooling at just 35dB. Plus the fans have cool lighting. Wouldn’t be a gaming PC without cool lighting.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/surprise-call-of-duty-black-ops-7%E2%80%B2s-campaign-is-multiplayer-only-and-doesn%E2%80%99t-let-you-pause.1353874/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In a massive departure from the series norm, the campaign in the newly released <i>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </i>is an online co-op experience from start to finish. Not only is the campaign always online, but as if it thought it was <i>Elden Ring</i>, you can’t pause it, and you’ll get booted for idling.</p> <p>Maybe it’s secretly an experimental art project on the nature of entropy.</p> <p><i>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</i> comes out today with a full campaign and multiplayer mode. The campaign, it seems, goes all in on co-op play. The <i>option </i>to play campaigns in co-op is usually a welcome one but here, co-op is so inherent to the experience that it’s making solo play really hard, with a lack of checkpoints and an expectation that you’re always online and never AFK (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-is-online-only-with-no-checkpoints-or-pausing-and-will-kick-you-if-youre-idle-for-too-long">h/t <i>IGN</i></a>).</p>

 <p>Apparently, trying to complete this campaign on your own ramps up the tedium, with you having to do things like repeat objectives scattered around an environment–such as placing explosives in certain spots–that were clearly designed to be handled by multiple players all working together.</p>

 <p>It’s an unfortunate situation for those who enjoy a straightforward, linear solo campaign with objectives that feel designed to accommodate solo play. Maybe go back and play 2022’s <i>Modern Warfare II</i>? It was kind of a snoozefest in some ways, but hey, at least you wouldn’t get kicked for idling.</p> <p>It kind of reminds me of that one time me and two friends of mine managed to somehow make it through a <i>Destiny </i>raid without the extra three players by running around like crazy people to accomplish certain objectives that were clearly made with more people in mind. It felt like we were getting away with something we shouldn’t’ve been. Maybe tackling <i>Black Ops 7</i>’s campaign solo at least offers some of these transgressive thrills?</p>

              <p>The announcement of a new&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> game would usually be something that came with a great deal of fanfare and publicity, which makes the strange, quiet appearance of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft Blast</em> quite peculiar. This mobile project, which is apparently a collab between <em>Minecraft</em> developers Mojang and&nbsp;<em>Candy Crush</em> creators King, has only come to anyone’s attention after it appeared on the Apple store for people in Malaysia. Huh.</p> <p>When Microsoft so controversially bought Activision in 2023, understandably most of our attention was on how this seemingly monopolistic move meant the Windows and Xbox owner now controlled everything from <em>Call of Duty</em> to <em>World of Warcraft</em>. But less focused on was the simultaneous acquisition of King, which Activision Blizzard had previously bought for $5.9 billion. That’s now suddenly being brought into the light with the sudden announcement of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft Blast</em>, a match-3 game in the manner of King’s mega-hit&nbsp;<em>Candy Crush Saga</em>, but based around the blocky world of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>.</p>

 <p>Oh yes, because as hard as we might try to forget, Microsoft owns <em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>too, after that 2014 purchase for $2.5 billion. And if I’m a besuited Microsoft exec, and I’m looking at the miniature model on my table of all the empires I own, at a certain point I’m definitely going to want to see if there’s money in combining them together.</p>

 <p>The result on this occasion is a free-to-play matching puzzle game set in <em>Minecraft</em>‘s world with <em>Minecraft</em>‘s art and tools. You have a sort of 3D mini-world in which you can craft, but to get the “energy” to do this you need to play the block-tapping 2D puzzle game. Here you tap matching groups of colored blocks to break those around them, revealing TNT and fireworks and so on as you attempt to clear a level. Although, not having played it myself and given the scant information <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/about-minecraft-blast">on the game’s site</a>, it’s hard to provide you with much clearer guidance.</p>

 <p>You might imagine a video of someone playing the game would be more informative, but&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em> YouTuber PatarHD’s footage is so frustratingly edited and so painfully scripted that it feels like the world’s most confusing ad.</p>  <p><em>Minecraft Blast</em> is currently being playtested in Malaysia alone, and apparently this test will only last for a week or two. But Microsoft promises more locations and longer tests will be coming soon, stating that right now it is in “extremely early days with this project,” and that it plans “to start rolling out small, limited-run tests in select markets to help us gather early feedback and involve our community from the start.”</p>

 <p>However, in the YouTube video above, PatarHD claims that if you have an iOS device, you can just change your region to Malaysia and download the app now.</p> <p>It looks like the full version of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft Blast</em> is still a fair way off. Although given it’s F2P, perhaps we can enjoy the wait.</p>

<p>An insider has revealed that the arrival of Red Dead Redemption on current-gen consoles doesn’t mean that Red Dead Redemption 2’s enhanced version will not be coming. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Rockstar Games came with some massive announcements about Red Dead Redemption yesterday. It was revealed that the game will not only be available for current-gen consoles as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-owners-on-last-gen-consoles-are-eligible-for-free-upgrades/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free upgrade</a>, but will also be playable on iOS and Android devices through <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-coming-to-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a>. </p>







<h2 id="h-the-new-announcements-do-not-negate-rdr2-from-happening">The New Announcements Do Not Negate RDR2 From Happening </h2>



<p>Reliable insider NateTheHate was recently told on <a href="https://x.com/natethehate2/status/1989053149097976264" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) that they should change their insider sources, as they didn’t predict the announcement of Red Dead Redemption’s current-gen port. However, NateTheHate responded to this post, stating that this announcement “doesn’t negate” the fact that Red Dead Redemption 2 is also receiving the current-gen upgrade. </p>



<p>When asked about what he knows regarding the release window for Red Dead Redemption 2’s enhanced version, Nate revealed that he was told it should arrive “a few months after” the release of the Nintendo Switch 2. This was the information he had since the beginning of this year, but since then, GTA 6 has been delayed, and Rockstar is known for doing “whatever they want”. Hence, the release timelines for these games are always subject to change. </p>







<p>In other news, Red Dead Redemption 2 recently became the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-has-become-the-fourth-best-selling-game-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fourth best-selling game ever</a>, surpassing Mario Kart 8 in units sold. Additionally, more enhanced version <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-enhanced-claims-surface/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claims surfaced online</a> as the anniversary drew close.

                <p>It's a been a long wait for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond/" data-ref-id="5000-465595">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, but the return of bounty hunter Samus Aran is just a few weeks away. Now, Nintendo has dropped an extended trailer for Metroid Prime 4 that sets up the story, shows off her new powers, and reveals that she does have allies on the planet Viewros. What she doesn't have is a way to get off the hostile world that's trying to kill her.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mBR0H1F5hs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7mBR0H1F5hs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the opening minutes of the trailer, Samus answers a distress call from a Galactic Federation research center that comes under attack by her rival, Sylux. During the battle, Samus is somehow transported to an unknown and hostile world called Viewros. And some of the Galactic Federation troops survived to make the trip as well. But without a ship, this may be a one-way journey for Samus and her allies.</p><p>Samus' standard abilities are back in this game, and she picks up a few new skills including psychic powers that can direct her shots with precision or operate the long-abandoned machinery on Viewros. GameSpot recently had a chance to try out those psychic powers during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-samuss-psychic-abilities-are-more-than-a-gimmick/1100-6536193/" data-ref-id="1100-6536193">a hands-on experience with Metroid Prime 4</a>. </p><p>There are several different biomes on the planet, abandoned factories, and an open-world desert that Samus can travel across on her motorcycle, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-finally-gets-a-release-date-coming-this-december/1100-6534699/" data-ref-id="1100-6534699">the Vi-0-La</a>. Samus can even summon the Vi-0-La while exploring the various factories, and the game shifts from first-person to third-person in these scenes.</p><p>Metroid Prime 4 will be available on both Switch and Switch 2 on December 4, but only the latter has mouse controls on the Joy-Con 2 that can give Samus even greater control of her aim. The video demonstrates how players can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-on-switch-2-will-let-you-swap-to-mouse-controls-on-the-fly/1100-6530602/" data-ref-id="1100-6530602">swap from standard to mouse controls</a> at will.</p>

                <p>After getting leaked earlier this week, Epic Games has revealed that Grammy-winning artist Tyler, the Creator will join <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> on November 14 as an purchasable skin.</p><p>The official Fortnite X account <a href="https://x.com/Fortnite/status/1989332670351102047" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted a seven-second teaser video</a> of the "Don't Tap the Glass" rapper's skin. In the clip, we get a look at two outfits for Tyler, the Creator: his green "Chromakopia" getup and an ensemble that closely resembles his "Wolf" or "Cherry Bomb" days.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/tyler-the-creator-fortnite-skin-leaked-all-cosmetics-outfits-prices-revealed/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a November 12 Vice story</a>, prolific dataminer NotPaloLeaks unveiled this Tyler, the Creator collaboration in an X post on November 11. As Vice speculates, his skins could cost 1,500 V-Bucks, and his arrival may come with cosmetics like weapon wraps, pickaxes, backpacks, jam tracks, and emotes. The official Fortnite X account hasn't confirmed this yet, but Tyler, the Creator hits the in-game shop on November 14, so it won't be much longer until everything is made clearer.</p><p>Regardless of what comes with Tyler, the Creator's arrival, the Fortnite community is losing its mind. In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1owxaqw/the_wait_is_over_tylerthecreator_is_landing_in/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a recent post in r/FortniteBR about the reveal</a>, the comments are filled with excitement. "Pretty cool. Was hoping for Chromakopia," one Redditor said. "God yes," another user chimed.</p><p>The sentiment is about the same on X. In the replies to the teaser video, users expressed their enthusiasm for the skin. "Finally," <a href="https://x.com/G_BoysAccount/status/1989336309735841871" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">one poster said with a Family Guy GIF</a>. "It's enough to make a grown man cry," <a href="https://x.com/AbrahamDia11852/status/1989333187290435877" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">replied another</a>.</p><p>Of course, not everyone is pleased with the collab. Some in that r/FortniteBR post dismissed the skin. Meanwhile, users in the replies to Fortnite's X post were taken aback by his appearance, with one poster calling the skin "<a href="https://x.com/SrSonicCraft1/status/1989333226704249240" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tyron the Architect</a>" because of the face he makes when diving from the Battle Bus in the teaser video.</p><p>Tyler, the Creator joins Fortnite just as Springlefield continues taking over the battle royale shooter. The Simpsons have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnite-simpsons-season/2900-7202/" data-ref-id="2900-7202">running all over Fortnite Island</a>, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/son-of-a-diddly-ned-flanders-has-eliminated-33000-unneighborly-fortnite-players/1100-6536031/" data-ref-id="1100-6536031">Ned Flanders in particular piling up the bodies</a>. However, Fox's cartoon won't stick around for much longer; <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-chapter-7-start-date-new-map-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6536068/" data-ref-id="1100-6536068">Season 7 is slated to start on November 29</a>, with Fortnite Island possibly taking on a distinctive LA flair and new collabs--from Kill Bill to SpongeBob SquarePants--hinted at joining the game.</p>

            <p>Indie Sims-like game Paralives has delayed its early access release following recent playtests that proved the game "isn't up to the standard we wanted it to meet for release".</p>
<p>Back in June, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indie-sims-like-paralives-launches-in-early-access-this-december">game was given an early access release date</a> of 8th December. Now, that release has shifted to 25th May 2026.</p>
<p>A lengthy statement from developer Alex Massé has detailed the reasons for the delay, as well as outlining the ambitious scope of the project.</p>

<p>"Unfortunately, we had to make the difficult decision to delay the release," it reads. "After thoughtful consideration, we feel it's best for the game and the community. This year, we ran many playtests with friends and fans, and we were confident that we could improve the game enough in time for December.</p>
<p>"In the lead-up to Early Access release, we broadened our playtests with a more varied playerbase, and the latest feedback we received made us realise the game isn't up to the standard we wanted it to meet for release."</p>
<p>Specifically, Massé noted "impactful bugs" in the Live Mode and a "lack of activities to do in the town, which dampened the enjoyment of the players".</p>
<p>Massé plans for Paralives to be a "fresh and indie take on the doll-house life simulation genre", describing it as three games in one: an "advanced and flexible build mode", a "greatly customisable character creator", and a "complex life simulation mode". It seems the latter element is what requires more time.</p><p>"We are so proud of what we have built, but now, we just need a bit more time to polish the simulation part of the game," said Massé. "This would ensure Paralives offers a great first experience when it launches, making players come back for every exciting free update and expansion that we will put out afterwards."</p>

<p>In the meantime, a 45 minute stream will take place on 25th November to show off the current state of the game. The game's website also has a <a href="https://paralives.notion.site/f138c4f6cb234604be16fe4198d17f51?v=41e2b3e389404b37b4060bc74dead4af">detailed roadmap</a> of improvements and fixes ahead of the game's release. "This will ensure that more players will be happy with the state of the game at launch when comparing it to other great life simulation games that sparked everyone's love for the genre," said Massé.</p>
<p>Last year, the developer stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-sims-like-paralives-gets-seven-minute-gameplay-video-hitting-early-access-next-year">Paralives wouldn't have paid DLC</a> but free expansions instead. "As a small team without any shareholders to please," it said, "we believe the money we make from selling the game alone will be enough to support us and the development of free updates in the long run."</p>

		<p>Paralives will not be entering early access this year as initially planned, with Paralives Studio announcing the decision to delay the release to May 25th, 2026. The delay comes after feedback from playtesters which convinced the development team the game is in a state to be sold yet, with issues including bugs in the live mode and a lack of activities for players to do in the game.</p>

<p>In a statement, Alex Massé, the lead developer of Paralives said, <em>“Unfortunately, we had to make the difficult decision to delay the release. We are truly sorry for the last-minute announcement. After thoughtful consideration, we feel it’s best for the game and the community. This year, we ran many playtests with friends and fans, and we were confident that we could improve the game enough in time for December. In the lead-up to Early Access release, we broadened our playtests with a more varied playerbase, and the latest feedback we received made us realise the game isn’t up to the standard we wanted it to meet for release. Players enjoy the flexibility and the customization of the Paramaker and Build Mode. However, there are still impactful bugs in the Live Mode and a lack of activities to do in the town, which dampened the enjoyment of the players, and we feel it is necessary to work on these before delivering the product to the community.</em></p>
<p><em>I started this project wanting it to be a fresh and indie take on the doll-house life simulation genre, which had not been tackled by many game developers. I attribute this partly to the fact that a project like Paralives is a colossal task. Life sims are really 3 games in one: an advanced and flexible build mode, a greatly customizable character creator and a complex life simulation mode. Over the last 6 years of development, starting with 2-3 developers for the first years, to growing to an average team size of only 10 people, we had to alternate long stretches of development between these 3 parts of the game. We are so proud of what we have built, but now, we just need a bit more time to polish the simulation part of the game. This would ensure Paralives offers a great first experience when it launches, making players come back for every exciting free update and expansion that we will put out afterwards. The new Early Access release date is May 25, 2026. We have updated our detailed roadmap (paralives.com/roadmap) with what we will be improving over the coming months, with a focus on fixing important issues and improving the first-time user experience. This will ensure that more players will be happy with the state of the game at launch when comparing it to other great life simulation games that sparked everyone’s love for the genre.”</em></p>

<p>Paralives is a life simulation game that could challenge The Sims. It is one of the most followed games on Steam with over a million wishlists. In Paralives, players will be able to build their own homes, create characters, and develop bonds with the other characters that populate the world.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>TCGPlayer is one of the largest virtual card retail platforms on the internet. The platform, acquired <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ebay-enters-agreement-for-tcgplayer-acquisition" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">by eBay</a> in early 2023 for the sum of $295 million, has helped dedicated card game players and aspirational competitive players obtain the cards they want for their respective game. Be it <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disney-lorcana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Disney Lorcana</em></a>, or even the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pokemon-trading-card-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pokemon TCG</em></a>.</p>

<p>The platform recently came under fire due to it quickly shutting down an authentication center down in Syracuse. This was seen by the workers as an attempt to shut down the worker's union seeking better wages. This lead to a boycott starting in May 2025 before a new contract was renegotiated by the worker's union in June.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>developer Crystal Dynamics has announced yet another round of layoffs across "various departments and projects", and the layoffs are apparently an attempt to "restructure the company and business".</p>

<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/crystal-dynamics_today-weve-made-the-difficult-but-necessary-activity-7394805539140169729-lwXF/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LinkedIn</a>, Crystal Dynamics calls the decision to lay off "just under 30" employees a "difficult but necessary decision", and blames the evolving "realities of the industry" for the need to let more team members go.</p>

<p>The studio says that the layoffs are an attempt to "optimize the continued development of [its] flagship&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>game", in addition to "shaping the rest of the studio to make new games for the future".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-crystal-dynamics.jpg?itok=_PCW5_St 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-crystal-dynamics.jpg?itok=XMhUvaNA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tomb Raider</em>'s Crystal Dynamics is laying off yet more staff.</figcaption></figure><p>This is the third time that Crystal Dynamics has engaged in layoffs this year; it first laid off a round of employees in March, then <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crystal-dynamics-layoffs" rel="nofollow">again in August</a> following the cancellation of Xbox's&nbsp;<em>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</em>reboot (and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">shuttering of the studio</a> chiefly responsible for making it).</p>

<p>At the time of August's layoffs, Crystal Dynamics reassured fans that&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>'s development was "unaffected" by the decision. Technically, no such reassurance has been offered for this latest wave of redundancies.</p>

<p>It's also worth noting that the next game in the&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>series has yet to be announced; there's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/amazon-tomb-raider-lara-croft" rel="nofollow">an Amazon series</a> headed up by&nbsp;<em>Fleabag</em>'s Phoebe Waller-Bridge in the works, but that's the only piece of genuinely new&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>media fans have to cling to for now.</p>

<p>As far as we know, the as-yet-unrevealed&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>title is the only thing on which Crystal Dynamics is actively working, so I'd imagine there's quite a lot of pressure within the studio to deliver on this one (although what exactly "this one" is, we don't yet know).</p>

Until then, stay tuned for more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Misery Returns to Steam Following Stalker 2 Dev's DMCA Claim]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/misery-steam-return</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/misery-returns-to-steam-following-stalker-2-devs-dmca-claim.1353817/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>Misery&nbsp;</i>developer Platypus Entertainment has announced that the game has made a return to Steam, following a DMCA claim that was issued by&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2&nbsp;</em>developer GSC Game World.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2119830/view/809086547679772954" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a> on Steam, the studio says that it has "resolved" the "misunderstanding" it had with GSC Game World, following a conversation with one of the Ukrainian developer's lawyers.</p>

<p>Specifically, Platypus makes reference to two issues it says were "not mentioned in the DMCA claim" and that the studio wasn't aware of. Both issues have now been resolved, and it seems like that's what has allowed&nbsp;<em>Misery&nbsp;</em>to be reinstated on Steam.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/misery-steam-return-room.jpg?itok=RcpZB2U2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/misery-steam-return-room.jpg?itok=SDTTJ7N1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Misery&nbsp;</em>is now back on Steam for your enjoyment.</figcaption></figure><p>The first issue revolved around a "helicopter model in the files" of&nbsp;<em>Misery</em>. Platypus says the game is "an evolution of education, non-commercial projects", and that the model, which has now been removed, "was unintentionally left in [<em>Misery</em>''s] resources as a legacy leftover".</p>

<p>Platypus goes on to say that the helicopter model in question can't be seen anywhere in&nbsp;<em>Misery&nbsp;</em>itself, but the studio doesn't actually state exactly where it got the model from. Still, this appears to be one of the key points of contention for GSC Game World.</p>

<p>The second point pertains to some of the guitar-based folk songs being played in&nbsp;<em>Misery</em>. Platypus says that for the&nbsp;<em>Stalker&nbsp;</em>games, GSC Game World "used popular folk songs" for ambient guitar-playing NPCs, and that someone affiliated with Platypus "wrote original covers of some of these songs".</p>

<p>However, it turns out that some of the songs used by Platypus "were specifically written or exclusively licensed by GSC", so those songs have been removed. However, the studio is adamant that "no original files from GSC games were used".</p>




<p>If you need a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Misery&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-dev-strikes-down-copycat-game-misery-with-dmca-claim" rel="nofollow">taken down</a> from Steam earlier this week following a DMCA claim by&nbsp;<em>Stalker 2</em>'s GSC Game World, which alleged that Platypus Entertainment's game infringed GSC's copyright.</p>

<p>This led to a rather unfortunately slur-laden <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/stalker/comments/1or39zs/comment/nno4g7j/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Discord message</a> from developer Maewing, who subsequently <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/survival-crafting/stalker-dev-gsc-game-world-dmcad-a-stalker-inspired-indie-off-steam-and-the-devs-are-crying-foul-this-is-an-abuse-of-power-against-small-independent-developers-by-a-large-corporation/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">apologized</a> for their "past words" and "old posts", although that doesn't really apply to a message that was clearly posted after the strike was filed.</p>

<p>That, however, is an issue that Platypus has addressed in its most recent Steam news post; the studio says it has "established a strict policy on Discord moderation", which means it's no longer an "anarchy dumpster fire".</p>

<p>In any case, if you'd like to check out&nbsp;<em>Misery</em>, you can do so right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2119830/MISERY/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-nightmare-before-christmas-funko-pop-advent-calendar-is-a-dream-come-true-at-just-42-2000643656</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/funko-is-letting-the-last-advent-calendars-go-for-pennies-the-nightmare-before-christmas-fans-get-lucky.1353811/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’ll tell you what a real nightmare before Christmas is. It’s shopping for all those gifts. Finding the right gift can be a struggle, and with lots of folks to shop for ranging across your friends, family, and loved ones, that bill can add up pretty quickly. That’s why it’s great to keep an eye out for a good deal during the holiday season. And right now, Amazon happens to have this Funko Pop advent calendar on sale featuring vinyl mini figures of beloved characters from Tim Burtons’s <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas</em>. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5580/">The mystery box filled with toys is normally priced at $50, but right now you can grab it for 19% off for a limited time. That brings the price down by nearly $10 so you only end up paying $40.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5580/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>24 Days of Surprises</h2>
<p>Now, advent calendars make for a great Christmas gift* with a asterisk on it. The asterisk is to call out that by Christmas day, it’s already too late to give someone this gift. Unless there joy comes from just ripping open each door and having the instant gratification of all toys at once, which I guess more power to ya. But ideally, they should receive this before November 1 so they can enjoy beginning each day with a new treat in the form of Jack, Sally, or many of the other <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas </em>characters. Perhaps they can pair opening one of the doors with completing their daily Connections in The New York Times.</p>
<p>Okay so there’s another weird caveat I need to call attention to. At the time of writing this, all throughout the item page on Amazon, it calls out to, “Open the tiny doors to 13 unique collectable Funko Pocket Pops!” Now, there are 24 doors so I don’t know what’s going on. I’m not sure if that 13 is a typo (though it comes up twice on the page) or if more than half those little compartments are empty.</p>



<p>What I do know is the box in the images calls attention to it being a “24-piece holiday calendar.” Maybe they’re not all unique and there are some repeats in there or maybe someone on the Funko marketing team just copy/pasted this part of the description and forgot to edit it. There’s only one way to know for sure.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5580/">Buy yourself the Funko Pop <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas </em>countdown calendar for the reduced price of $40 and find out what’s inside for yourself.</a> Then come back to the comments here and let me know your findings.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-witcher-3s-most-important-player-choice-wasnt-always-part-of-the-game-2000644323</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-witcher-3%E2%80%98s-most-important-player-choice-wasn%E2%80%99t-always-part-of-the-game.1353805/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>The Witcher 3</em> lets you make a lot of choices as Geralt, the open-world RPG’s titular monster slayer, but its biggest strength is in how subtly they’re woven into the broader fabric of the world. None of the choices ever feel like they’re being telegraphed with big blinking signs. The long-term consequences are yours to parse. So it is with the game’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-witcher-3-geralt-yennefer-triss-kiera-romance-love-1849487104">big love triangle</a>, a branching path that CD Projekt Red recently revealed was a late edition to the best-seller.</p> <p>The sorceress Yennefer is who Geralt begins the game with, during a flashback at Kaer Morhen. The red-headed mage Triss Merigold doesn’t show up until halfway through when he gets to Novigrad, at which point players have the option of rekindling their past relationship or moving on as friends, depending in part on their choices during the prior game. Eventually, the player has to make their mutant playboy choose between the two, with their future partner eventually joining them at a cute little cottage at the end of both expansions.</p>

 <p>“It wasn’t [there] from the beginning, but at some point we understood that this lack of kind of conflict, personal conflict—of course, there’s Ciri—but there was a lack of <em>something</em>.” CD Projekt Red co-CEO Adam Badowski <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/the-witcher-3-didnt-originally-make-you-choose-between-romancing-yennefer-or-triss-this-decision-was-made-pretty-late/">told <em>PC Gamer</em></a>. “This decision was made pretty late, but it was great. It was a great decision.”</p>

 <p>While Yennefer is Geralt’s canonical love interest, she’s not actually in <a href="https://kotaku.com/first-witcher-game-remake-unreal-engine-5-1849816995">the first two games</a>. Triss, however, is, leading to a weird scenario&nbsp; in which many players actually have a stronger connection to her than to the witcher’s ongoing on-again, off-again partner. It would have been easy to steer him back to her for the duration of the third game, but playing up Geralt’s divided heart does a lot to give the otherwise gruff and sardonic mercenary a more emotionally engaging mini-arc within the final game.</p> <p>While Geralt will still make an appearance in <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-2027-release-window-investor-call-ps6-cdpr-1851772310"><em>The Witcher 4</em></a>, CDPR’s next sequel will pass the baton to Ciri as the main hero instead. Fortunately, fans of the grey wolf will get another chance to revisit the beginning of his journey in a <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-remake-open-world-rpg-cd-projekt-red-cyberpunk-1849832000">remake of <em>The Witcher 1</em></a> that is also in the works. Neither project has a release window just yet.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-launches-major-black-friday-deal-on-ipads-selling-2025-wifi-model-at-new-all-time-low-2000644324</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-launches-major-black-friday-deal-on-ipads-selling-2025-wifi-model-at-new-all-time-low.1353802/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’ve been waiting for the right time to pick up an iPad, that time is now. Apple just kicked off most of its Black Friday deals on Amazon and spans everything from iPads and MacBooks to Apple Watches and AirTags. But perhaps the star of the show <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">is the 11-inch iPad with the A16 chip (WiFi + 128GB) which is now down to $299 from its original $349 sticker price</a>. This <strong>model launched in early 2025</strong> and quickly became the best-selling tablet on the market so to see it drop to an all-time low this quickly almost feels too good to be true.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Apple redesigned this iPad to handle the kind of multitasking most of us throw at our devices daily. The A16 chip powers through photo editing, gaming and streaming without hesitation. You get 128GB of storage right out of the gate and gives you plenty of room for apps, photos, videos, and documents before you even think about cloud storage.</p>



<h2>Best Value for Money Tablet</h2>
<p>It’s an <strong>11-inch Liquid Retina display</strong> that brings colors to life in such a way that streaming movies or editing photos becomes genuinely enjoyable. True Tone technology changes the color temperature of the screen with respect to your surroundings, so you are not squinting at a harsh blue glow by night or straining to see details by bright sunlight. This may sound minor until you realize how much easier it makes long reading sessions or late-night work sessions go on your eyes. The screen hits that sweet spot where it’s large enough for serious work but compact enough to toss in a bag without thinking twice.</p>
<p><strong>Wi-Fi 6 connectivity</strong> keeps you moving at full speed when you’re downloading files, uploading content, or jumping between video calls. The USB-C connector finally standardized charging and data transfer, meaning you can use the same cable for your iPad that you use for most of your other devices. There are 12MP cameras on both the front and back of the device, giving you solid options for video calls, document scanning, or just quick photos when you don’t have your phone handy. An important addition is Center Stage, a technology in the front camera that automatically pans and zooms to keep you in frame during video calls.</p>



<p>Touch ID built into the top button gives you quick access without typing passwords constantly. You unlock the iPad, sign into apps, and authorize Apple Pay transactions with just your fingerprint. The <strong>iPadOS uses hardware to full capacity</strong>, and allows you to run multiple apps side by side, use the Scribble to handwrite in any text field with an Apple Pencil, and organize your workflow in ways that actually make sense.</p>
<p>For $299, this iPad offers good value to anyone who needs a capable tablet that can handle real work without compromise.</p>
