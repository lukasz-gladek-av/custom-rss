As files and information gradually surface, most of what we’ve seen so far has been early assets and concept art for old games over the franchise’s many years. But there have been a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1845560379428024713&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1845560379428024713" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">few details about upcoming games</a></span> being rounded up by every <em>Pokémon </em>leak and fan account, including next year’s <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> and beyond. Here’s a rundown of what we know based on the leaks, but it is important to note that all this information should be taken with a grain of salt, as projects may have changed, been canceled, or this information could be otherwise proven false.<br></p></div><div><p>There isn’t too much information about upcoming games yet, but a few details about next year’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-kalos-war-az-switch-teaser-trailer-1851290552&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-kalos-war-az-switch-teaser-trailer-1851290552"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a></span> have been released that aren’t story spoilers. Specifically, the fact that the game will include Mega Evolutions for Zygarde and Zeraora. The former isn’t surprising, as Zygarde will likely play an important role in <em>Legends: Z-A </em>story, which takes place in the Kalos region from which the legendary Pokémon is based. Zeraora is more surprising, however, because it has no connection to the region, as it was introduced in Generation VII.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0b55d2bba7e922064c9631bd20406316" data-recommend-id="image://0b55d2bba7e922064c9631bd20406316" data-format="jpg" data-width="1241" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ash and Pikachu hug." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ash and Pikachu hug." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0b55d2bba7e922064c9631bd20406316" data-recommend-id="image://0b55d2bba7e922064c9631bd20406316" data-format="jpg" data-width="1241" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ash and Pikachu hug." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>We do know a little bit more about the next generation of <em>Pokémon </em>games thanks to the leaks, though they haven’t been officially announced as of this writing.

These Generation X games will apparently take place in an archipelago of several islands. Fans are speculating it may be modeled after Greece as <em>Scarlet </em>and <em>Violet</em>’s Paldea region is based on the Iberian Peninsula. The pair of games are internally called <em>Pokémon K </em>and <em>N </em>in Japanese.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b8df2db231c9005d840c31ebb379ad90" data-recommend-id="image://b8df2db231c9005d840c31ebb379ad90" data-format="jpg" data-width="1462" data-height="822" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Several Pokemon try to stop Pikachu from dunking into a goal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Several Pokemon try to stop Pikachu from dunking into a goal." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b8df2db231c9005d840c31ebb379ad90" data-recommend-id="image://b8df2db231c9005d840c31ebb379ad90" data-format="jpg" data-width="1462" data-height="822" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Several Pokemon try to stop Pikachu from dunking into a goal." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Also revealed in the leak is a game codenamed <em>Pokémon Synapse</em>, which is a multiplayer title (not an MMO, according to Centro Leaks) being developed by Game Freak in collaboration with <em>Pokémon Brilliant Diamond</em> and <em>Shining Pearl </em>studio ILCA. The game has been compared to Nintendo’s turf war shooter <em>Splatoon</em>.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="46eda18a285d3f0d3d568f5a0e1e0419" data-recommend-id="image://46eda18a285d3f0d3d568f5a0e1e0419" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Liko and Sprigatito cuddle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Liko and Sprigatito cuddle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="46eda18a285d3f0d3d568f5a0e1e0419" data-recommend-id="image://46eda18a285d3f0d3d568f5a0e1e0419" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Liko and Sprigatito cuddle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While Game Freak doesn’t make the <em>Pokémon </em>anime itself, it plays a crucial role in its creation, so there is some information about anime projects in the leaks, as well (though the status of these are more nebulous than the games). This includes details about the 24th animated movie codenamed “Project Bauer,” presumably a reference to television series <em>24</em>’s protagonist Jack Bauer. The project has apparently been in development hell since 2021, but was pitched as a reboot for the movie universe and would feature a different protagonist from original hero Ash Ketchum or current leads <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-horizons-anime-netflix-liko-roy-captain-pikachu-1851326504&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-horizons-anime-netflix-liko-roy-captain-pikachu-1851326504">Liko and Roy</a></span>. The movie would take place entirely in the original Kanto region and only feature Pokémon that debuted in the first games, with Mew the main mythical character.<br></p><p>Also in the works is an animated series internally called “Project Reload,” which will consist of a dozen 21-minute episodes. It has been in development since 2022 at Studio Colorido, who previously worked on the <em>Pokémon: Twilight Wings</em> limited-run series.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="51572d425c53bd7d245dfd073a152ff9" data-recommend-id="image://51572d425c53bd7d245dfd073a152ff9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1500" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Pikachu and Tim look at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Pikachu and Tim look at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="51572d425c53bd7d245dfd073a152ff9" data-recommend-id="image://51572d425c53bd7d245dfd073a152ff9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1500" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Pikachu and Tim look at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Two live-action projects are also mentioned in the leaks, including the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/report-netflix-is-making-a-live-action-pokemon-series-1847363481&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/report-netflix-is-making-a-live-action-pokemon-series-1847363481">previously reported Netflix series</a></span>. The only details are that the first season will be eight episodes long and that up to five seasons are currently being considered, but nothing’s been greenlit at this moment.<br></p><p>The most important project, however, is a sequel to the 2019 live-action <em>Detective Pikachu </em>film starring Ryan Reynolds.

<p>Bethesda Game Studios is collaborating with Fallout for Hope to bring gamers a special ‘Fallout Day 2025’ broadcast on October 23. Known in the Fallout universe as ‘Bombs Drop Day’, October 23 has been an important date for fans for many years.</p>



<p>Fallout for Hope is a charitable endeavour that sees hundreds of fans, cosplayers, streamers, and creators join forces once a year to raise money for St Jude Children’s Hospital. It has grown exponentially over the years and is preparing to celebrate the fifth iteration of the special event.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-apocalypse-isn-t-all-bad">The Apocalypse Isn’t All Bad</h2>



<p>In 2020, Fallout for Hope hosted its first fundraising event, using Fallout as a creative platform. Today, the ecosystem has blossomed, and more than 750 creators and personalities take part in raising money for an extremely deserving cause once a year. </p>



<p>This year, on ‘Fallout Day’, Fallout for Hope will roll out a four-hour showcase spanning everything from cosplays to in-game fanmade films.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s being put together hand-in-hand with Bethesda Game Studios. Also on October 23, the creative team at BGS will host a broadcast diving into the future of Fallout 76, which saw massive growth this year because of the success of the Fallout TV show.</p>



<p>Creators are being invited to <a href="https://falloutforhope.com/join/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">join the Fallout for Hope stream team</a> and help make a difference by hosting their own fundraising initiatives. To date, Fallout for Hope has helped to raise more than half a million dollars for charity, and the network that supports the event is made up of representatives from more than 80 countries.</p>



<p>Bethesda Game Studios is preparing to go big for Fallout Day this year. It’s already more invested than in previous years, and some fans are holding out hope for an announcement of some kind. Perhaps Fallout 3: Remastered is on the horizon…</p>



<p>Are you going to tune in on Fallout Day? Let us know in the comments.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/">Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred</a> adds a ton of new content to the loot-driven dungeon crawler, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-all-tenets-of-akarat-locations-in-nahantu/1100-6527052/">new region</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-all-mercenaries-and-how-to-unlock-them/1100-6527178/">mercenaries</a>, and Runewords. Runewords are created when you combine two runes in an item with two sockets, giving you powerful bonuses. These new items are only available if you have the expansion and there is a large variety, giving you plenty of options, once you unlock them.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to unlock Runewords</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4385804-diablorunewords.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4385804" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4385804-diablorunewords.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4385804"></a><figcaption>Ritual Runes gather offering, which activates the ability of the invocation rune when the required amount is reached.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4385804-diablorunewords.jpeg"></figure><p>You unlock Runewords during the main Vessel of Hatred questline, during the Madman, Crowned quest that takes you to speak to Ormus in the Council Chambers. After speaking to him, you'll receive a briefing on the Runewords mechanics, and an initial set of Runes to begin experimenting with. <strong>Runewords don't start dropping as loot until you complete this quest, </strong>so you try and prioritize getting through the Vessel of Hatred campaign, or at least through this mission<strong>.</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr">How Runewords work and where to find more</h2><p dir="ltr">For a Runeword to work, you need to combine two halves into a single item. This means it needs to be an item that can have two sockets, a two-handed weapon, pants, chest, or helm. There are ritual Runes and invocation Runes. The ritual Runes create offerings by performing a specific task. For example the Yul Rune grants 50 offering each time you use a skill with a cooldown. Invocation runes activate a special ability when enough offering is collected. Sometimes it's something as simple as reducing any active cooldowns you have, but it can also activate an ability from another class. Combining one of each Rune in a single item creates a Runeword. <strong>You can only have two Runewords activated at once, </strong>but you can unsocket them at a Jeweler at any time to make changes or swap Runes.</p><p dir="ltr">Farming for specific Runes isn't possible currently, but you can farm for Runes in general. Runes can drop from any loot source, but they seem to drop more frequently from activities with a large chest as a reward. Infernal Hordes and summoned bosses seem to typically offer at least one if not a few, and activities like Helltides can drop them as well. While they can drop from almost anywhere, the best place to farm them is the Undercity in Kurast.</p><p dir="ltr">Using Tributes that specifically state they will drop Runes will reward you with Rune for completing an Undercity run, so long as you reach attunement level 1 by clearing enough enemies across the three floors prior to the boss fight. These also drop randomly, although <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-whispers-grim-favors-guide/1100-6514621/">Tree of Whispers</a> caches seem to drop them the most consistently and in the largest quantity. Once you have four of the same Rune, you can reroll them at the Jeweler for a random Rune, with a decent chance for it to be a higher rarity than the Runes you rolled. <strong>Be careful rerolling Runes, </strong>as Runes are required for crafting specific Mythic Uniques. You can check with the Jeweler to see which Runes are required for which Mythic, so you can save them.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/facebook-marketplace-has-incredible-deals-and-i-despise-it.1011531/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/facebook-marketplace-is-not-fun-to-use<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>People who know me know that I love a good deal, whether it is <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-best-gaming-chair-is-a-used-office-chair-from-craigslist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$1000 dollar office chairs I found on the street</a>, or surprisingly well made C<a href="https://aftermath.site/chinese-fountain-pen-hongdian-jinhao-asvine-delike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hinese fountain pens</a>. Thrifting is in my blood, and there are few resources for deals quite as robust as Facebook Marketplace. It is also one of the single worst shopping experiences ever devised by god or man. There is no incentive for Meta to fix it, and at this point it should either be destroyed or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/4/22456313/facebook-marketplace-european-commission-formal-antitrust-investigation-eu-uk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">heavily regulated</a> by the government, because it has taken the ambient flow of good deals and funneled them into an evil, impossible to navigate labyrinth.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Welcome to the Marketplace, it sucks real bad in here man. Credit: Meta.</figcaption></figure><p>Before I got into Marketplace, my Facebook account had been largely dormant for the better part of a decade. As a platform, Facebook has deteriorated so aggressively that it has become supremely irritating to use. Everyone under the age of 40 moved over to Instagram. Though the endless fountain of <a href="https://aftermath.site/facebook-ai-tiny-house" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI slop</a> grabs the most <a href="https://www.404media.co/where-facebooks-ai-slop-comes-from/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">headlines</a>, the bigger issue is that you are constantly forced to interact with feeds you do not subscribe to. In addition to the feeds of your grandma and a guy from high school you don’t talk to anymore because he moved to New Hampshire to become more racist, you now have a random assortment of strangers, niche fan groups, influencers, and an endless stream of content that even TikTok would not touch. While this deterioration – a forced intrusion into your digital life by strangers and grifters to juice interaction –&nbsp; is not unique to Facebook, Facebook manages to take all of the worst algorithmic choices from other platforms and somehow deliver them to you with none of their benefits.&nbsp;</p><p>That Facebook can have any redeeming qualities given its precipitous slide is a testament to how good Facebook Marketplace can potentially be. What makes this possible is that the best deals are often from people who are either clueless or apathetic about what their belongings are worth. This usually takes the form of bored rich people, who are either too lazy or old to use Google. What makes Facebook Marketplace an engine for finding those people is that those are the exact demographic who still actively use Facebook. Putting a big button on it that says “sell that stuff you’ve been meaning to donate to Goodwill” is an incredible engine of commerce, because nobody involved in the process has to register a new account.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately it is a Meta product, and as a result the process of using it is like an ironically designed torture in hell. I loathe it deeply for the following reasons.</p><h2>I do not want to buy a couch in Salem.</h2><p>The process of using Facebook Marketplace is a lot like Craigslist if Craigslist lied to you constantly. If you ask Facebook Marketplace for results for “Milo Baughman couch” within a 20 mile radius of your house, you will get whatever results match that, plus several other listings hundreds of miles away, plus a bunch of stuff you were searching before that are unrelated to what you are currently searching for. This is not unique to Facebook, but it is the core of the experience that Facebook helped usher in. The modern internet abhors a void, and so any product designed by an evil tech startup will never say “sorry, we don’t have any of those.” Instead it will provide an endless stream of OK results mixed with slightly imprecise suggestions algorithmically tailored to your online profile.&nbsp;</p><p>You can technically narrow this down by distance, price or date listed, but the second you do any other search, it will reset these suggestions. Mercifully, you can save searches with filters, but this feature is nowhere near as intuitive or exact as Craigslist’s.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Eventually if you ask it for a vintage designer it will give you a horse. Credit: Meta</figcaption></figure><p>Most infuriating of all, it will almost always ignore any distance parameters you give it, insisting that all of its out-of-the-way listings are “worth the trip”! Really, Facebook? Is it “worth the trip” to drive to Philly to pick up an OKish bookcase I would need to refinish? No other app like this (like Craigslist, Mercari and Offerup) manages to so aggressively fight and attempt to bamboozle the user every step of the way, and I hope that one day government regulators decide that this behavior is illegal, because it feels like the shit that would cause you to get a class action check in the mail for 25 cents eight years from now.&nbsp;</p><h2>You have to go on Facebook to use it.</h2><figure><figcaption>I don't know who any of these people are but I think they meant to quote H.G. Welles. Credit: Meta</figcaption></figure><p>When and if government regulators<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24265983/doj-google-search-remedies-monopoly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> finally break up Google</a>, I need them to come for Facebook Marketplace next. This is because Facebook Marketplace itself requires that you interact with the Facebook app or website in order to use it. Unlike Messenger, there is no dedicated app that lets you ignore every other part of the site. And while there are some shockingly useful Facebook groups, having to go through the worst skinner box on the internet to get to the deals feels like going into a particularly dead mall because there’s one solid thrift store sandwiched between the shell of a Suncoast Video and a TJ Maxx that looks like it just survived a flood. There are many unpleasant ways to buy things from the internet, but nothing crawls in your gut and dies like logging into Facebook. This is also exacerbated by the fact that contacting strangers for deals is not just done in Facebook Messenger, but in an easy to miss sub-tab of Facebook Messenger, thus confusing any person you would theoretically wish to contact. Even though Meta owns Instagram and WhatsApp, it boggles my mind that such a clearly broken site as Facebook still has perceived value and is allowed to operate the way it is.</p><h3>It makes me realize how much I miss what Craigslist and junk stores used to be.</h3><figure><figcaption>I should have never doubted you. Credit: Craigslist.</figcaption></figure><p>In an ideal world, none of us would have ever left Craigslist, but unfortunately Craigslist as an ecosystem can be a mixed bag. This is a shame, because the actual experience of using Craigslist rocks – it doesn’t lie to you (although the people do) and it treats you like an adult, allowing you to have precise control over what you are searching for. There are still deals to be had, but a lot of the time if you are on Craigslist you probably know what your stuff is worth. The golden years of Craigslist feel distant. Perhaps some of this is the convenience of not just Facebook Marketplace, but also competing marketplaces like Mercari and Offerup. Part of it feels like they never got over <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/03/23/596460672/craigslist-shuts-down-personals-section-after-congress-passes-bill-on-traffickin" target="_blank">the loss of the personals section</a> following the <a href="https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/4/13/17172762/fosta-sesta-backpage-230-internet-freedom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passing of FOSTA-SESTA</a>, an ineffective bill package that did nothing except make the lives of sex workers actively more dangerous.&nbsp;</p><p>Facebook Marketplace’s dominance is made worse by the fact that many of the good thrift and junk stores I used to go to are long dead. There are a few holdouts I still frequent and love, particularly far away from the city center, but the ones that remain are often overpriced and over-curated. A good junk store should look like a hoarder’s house that just so happens to have a cash register set up. It should smell like water damage and black mold. These kinds of junk and vintage stores are too low margin to exist in any place with high commercial rent. What’s more, the topography of most cities has been thoroughly mapped – everywhere is a known quantity ruined by overexposure. This is not Facebook Marketplace’s fault. But every single time I log into it, I am reminded of the joy of digging through crates and getting low level lung damage to find a jewel. Maybe one day, if the real estate market collapses violently enough, we will return to those days.</p><figure><figcaption>This is what bliss looks like: The Thing in Greenpoint. Credit: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/Cv4499yrPwW/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Thing.</a></figcaption></figure><p>None of this is a recommendation for Facebook Marketplace. This is an unfortunate statement of where we are at. You can buy some incredible stuff on that site (I do regularly) but every single time you do, it will take a little part of you. To be on Facebook Marketplace is to experience that feeling of trying to run through mud that permeates every single engagement-optimized platform, that lack of precision that feels like your mind is slipping. Maybe Marketplace should be reformed, but honestly it’s probably best if it continues to spiral due to neglect until the entire thing becomes so precarious that nobody logs on any more.&nbsp;</p><p>I pray that one day we will all be forced to return to Craigslist. But until then, there’s a guy near me with a pretty good looking vintage bookshelf and I hope he remembers to check his inconveniently-placed Marketplace inbox.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/warframe-1999-demo-out-now-on-all-platforms/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Digital Extremes has announced a demo release for the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-1999-is-out-this-winter-will-add-romance-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warframe: 1999 update</a>, due later this Winter. The demo is available starting today on all platforms where Warframe is playable. Any player can access the Warframe: 1999 demo after completing the Awakening and Vor's Prize tutorial quests. They just need to find a mysterious infested terminal in the main ship's flight deck.</p>
<p>Stepping into the shoes of Arthur (played by Ben Starr) and his trustworthy Atomicyle, the demo lets players check out a small slice of the twisting alleyways of downtown Höllvania in a replayable Exterminate-style mission. You'll find the new enemy faction, the Scaldra, and their toxic goo weapons, barring your way. Those who manage to complete the Warframe: 1999 demo before the full update launches this Winter will get the Protokol Longsword Skin.</p>
<p>New cosmetic items are also hitting the Warframe Market today to celebrate the in-game Halloween event, Nights of Naberus. Get spooky with the Lycanblight Syandana Backpiece and Shoulder Armour or the Charger Liset Ship Skin.</p>
<p>By the way, as promised at TennoCon, Digital Extremes has now released the full musical track originally featured in the TennoCon demo. "The Call" by Matthew Chalmers and featuring vocalist Francesca Hauser is now available on Spotify, Apple, YouTube Music, and Bandcamp.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Warframe: 1999 will see the introduction of a romance system. Players can send email messages to other members of the Hex Squad and, if they 'play their cards right,' even receive a New Year's kiss. Hex Squad will be voiced by an amazing cast: Amelia Tyler (Baldur's Gate 3's narrator), Kevin Afghani (Luigi in Super Mario Bros. Wonder), Melissa Medina (Zanuhali and Nitowikwe in Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail), Trieve Blackwood-Cambridge (one of the available player voices in Forza Horizon 5), and Alpha Takahashi (Hanako Arasaka in Cyberpunk 2077).</p>

Perhaps you’ve realized that gathering them all can be an overwhelming task. Maybe you’ve had a cry. Luckily, we can take the guesswork out of <em>one </em>of those many currencies in this guide by telling you the ways you can obtain the all-too-rare Ornate Coins.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h114087"><a id=""></a><strong>What are Ornate Coins?</strong></h2><p>Ornate Coins are one of two main currencies you use in <em>Throne and Liberty’s</em> Shop tab. Unlike Lucent, the game’s premium currency that is purchased by breaking out your credit card and paying up, Ornate Coins can’t be bought with real money. Instead, these special coins are obtained in-game or via another odd method we’ll explain further down.</p><p>As for what you can buy with Ornate Coins—well, there’s a lot, actually. There are some <strong>exclusive Amitoi</strong> (pets) and titles for your character, as well as limited weekly stocks of important materials like <strong>weapon growthstones, armor growthstones, accessory growthstones, and fishing bait chests</strong>. You can even buy dyes and sewing threads to customize your armor and outfits.</p><h2 id="h114088"><a id=""></a><strong>How to get Ornate Coins</strong><br></h2><figure id="" data-id="b2c1051e2d0274ac5c61fc113cf7db9e" data-recommend-id="image://b2c1051e2d0274ac5c61fc113cf7db9e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A very big fight against a skeletal beast." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A very big fight against a skeletal beast." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NCSoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b2c1051e2d0274ac5c61fc113cf7db9e" data-recommend-id="image://b2c1051e2d0274ac5c61fc113cf7db9e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A very big fight against a skeletal beast." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are two main ways to get Ornate Coins: Finding codex entries or waiting for in-game mail from the dev team. Let’s dive into how it all works.</p><h3 id="h114089"><a id=""></a><strong>Finding codex entries</strong></h3><p>If you’ve been exploring the vast open world in <em>Throne and Liberty</em>, you’ve almost certainly noticed the purple books and pages scattered around most zones in the game. By clicking and reading these, you’ll pick up codex entries, which grant you Ornate Coin x3 each.</p><p>Since codex entries are finite, this means you have a cap of how many Ornate Coins you can find with this method. Even if you round up every single codex entry, you’ll score just over 450 coins, meaning you’ll need to patiently wait to get your hands on them in other ways. And as of right now, there’s only one of those…</p><h3 id="h114090"><a id=""></a><strong>In-game mail</strong></h3><p>So, look, <em>Throne and Liberty</em> is an MMO, which means that server issues are inevitable. Hell, at the time of writing this guide, the world server is down and making it impossible for me to access the game. But while that’s undoubtedly irritating, it has one silver lining: You may get more Ornate Coins because of it.</p><p>That’s right—the dev team will frequently send you Ornate Coins as an apology for server maintenance (particularly when it’s unexpected). So any time the game is down for a while, consider taking a look at your mail next time you log in to see if you’ve obtained some coins for your trouble.</p><p>That all being said, <em>Throne and Liberty</em> is still a new game with a lot of fresh players arriving daily to increase the server load. This means that it’s likely to have more issues early in its life cycle and unexpected maintenance periods may be less frequent in the future, so I wouldn’t count on this method being consistent. Besides, we don’t know for sure if the team will continue doling out Ornate Coins for these problems permanently, or if it’s just a temporary way of keeping folks happy. Only time will tell.</p><hr><p>Ornate Coins aren’t the only thing that can be tough to come by in <em>Throne and Liberty</em>, though. Salt is also a bit scarce—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/throne-and-liberty-how-to-find-salt-cooking-amazon-1851667910&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/throne-and-liberty-how-to-find-salt-cooking-amazon-1851667910">unless you know where to look for it</a></span>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game quickly earned a loyal fan base thanks to a phenomenal main cast of characters and a compelling narrative hook. The game puts you in the shoes of Max Caulfield, who discovers she has the ability to rewind time after saving a friend from being shot by a bully in the school bathroom. She and her friend then team up to unravel the mysteries of their quaint Pacific Northwest town, including uncovering the whereabouts of a missing girl.

You’ll microdose <em>Groundhog Day</em> throughout the game as you rewind your mistakes in order to try again and impress your friends, or do better on a pop quiz. Time manipulation also becomes a mechanic for navigating the world, as sometimes you need to move or replace objects to get into previously closed-off areas. Max’s gift, however, isn’t all powerful. You can only turn back time so far and it can’t always save you from making dumb decisions. And eventually, because of its limitations, you have to choose one version of reality to live with.<br></p><p>Beyond the fascinating central mechanic, <em>Life Is Strange</em> thrives on its characters and world. The supernatural intrigue and mystery of the town only serve to hook you in, but the characters will keep you hanging on. That begins with Max herself, a young woman on the verge of graduating and hopefully leaving her home town to pursue a career in photography. She’s somewhat of a loner and only falls into the circumstances that drive the game’s plot due to that chance encounter with her old friend in the bathroom. That friend is Chloe, who Max was close with in childhood but hasn’t spoken to in a while. Every other student, teacher, and Arcadia Bay resident you interact with has a story of their own that connects to the larger plot taking place in the town. At the end of the game, though, Max and Chloe’s relationship proves to be the beating heart of <em>Life Is Strange</em>, and each episode adds layers to the two characters and their connection until it ends in a climactic final choice that only the two of them can make. It’s a beautiful game and it’s worth brushing up on before <em>Double Exposure</em>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asmongold-steps-back-from-otk-and-starforge-as-he-admits-his-life-is-%E2%80%98in-shambles%E2%80%99.1011507/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/asmongold-starforge-otk-shambles/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Asmongold recently uploaded a lengthy apology video following controversial comments made about the Palestinian people during a Twitch stream. Following his tirade, during which he labelled Palestinians as ‘terrible people’ and ‘inferior’, he earned himself a temporary ban on Twitch, but it seems that has been something of a wake-up call for the creator.</p>



<p>In his video, he revealed he’s cutting down the amount of time he spends streaming. He also confirmed he’s stepping back from leadership positions at both OTK <strong>and </strong>Starforge.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-winding-down">Winding Down</h2>



<p>Zack ‘Asmongold’ Hoyt has seen his fair share of scandals over the years, but this latest escapade takes the prize. His recent racist rant earned him the backlash of a global community, and he has recognised in this latest video that he might have hit an all-time low.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I need to get myself in check. I need to get my mind under control. I need to fix my fucking life. It’s insane. I think about it – it’s just in shambles. Everything about my life is basically fucked.</p>



<p>I’m going to step away from my leadership position at OTK and Starforge and everything. They’re fine with that – they respect that, and I want to do this. I want to do this not only for them but mainly for myself so I can be a better version of myself.</p>
</blockquote>

</p></figure>







<p>He then went deep on his apology, explaining that he has ‘read a lot of very bad things about Islam’ and has always cast an ill light on the religion because of that. With that in mind, the 34-year-old creator plans to visit the Middle East to witness Islam first-hand. It was also mentioned that as a punishment, he’s going to clean his home without a cleaning company to back him up.</p>



<p>If you know how Asmongold lives, then you understand how immense a task that will be.</p>



<p>Stepping back from leadership positions at OTK, a streaming organisation, and Starforge, a custom PC company, is just the start.</p>



<p>Going forward, Hoyt plans to make big changes to his content:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My plan is to, when I get unbanned, I’ll keep streaming regularly, and I want to focus more on trying to do things that are fun, trying to laugh more with people rather than at people. It’s about a focus, and it’s about a tone. I listened to my tone in that clip and I just sounded like such a piece of shit. </p>



<p>I don’t want to be that person anymore.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Do you accept Asmongold’s apology, or do you think he’s going to slip back into his old ways as soon as he’s back? Let us know in the comments.</p>

Amazon is offering the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPbbGj?object_uuid=785f5fd0-470e-46d6-80e8-941cd904dd95&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">65" LG Evo C3</a> 4K OLED Smart TV for only $1,296.99.

It's a great match for the new and more powerful PlayStation 5 Pro that's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-ps5-pro">currently up for preorder</a>.</p><h2><s>6</s>5" LG Evo C3 4K OLED Smart TV: The Best PS5 TV</h2><div catalogid="395ac392-d076-44a8-84e5-568d7eb19a08" id="189727"><div id="189727" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>65" LG Evo C3 4K OLED Smart TV</h3></p></div><p>The C3 is the previous generation 2023 model among LG's highly vaunted C-series OLED TV lineup. Compared to a traditional LED LCD TV, an OLED TV offers superior image quality, near-infinite blacks, near-infinite contrast ratio, and near-instantaneous response times. The C3 uses LG's Evo panel, which offers higher brightness levels than traditional OLED TVs. Because of these advantages, the OLED TV excels at displaying 4K HDR content in all of its intended glory. Compared to other OLED TVs, LG has the most generations of updates and improvements.</p><p>The C3 also has all the features you'd want in a gaming TV. It has four HDMI 2.1 ports all capable of up to 120Hz refresh rate at 4K resolution. That's great news for PS5 (and now PS5 Pro), Xbox Series X, and PC gamers, since several games can be played at frame rates of 120fps. The C3 also supports variable refresh rate (VRR) including Nvidia G-Sync and auto low latency mode (ALLM). When connected to a PC, it supports chroma 4:4:4 for better text legibility.</p><p>A particularly nice feature that isn't advertised often is the surprisingly light weight of the C3. The 65" TV weighs in at only 36.6 pounds without the stand. That's because the rear cabinet housing is made of a composite fiber that's lighter than the plastics most TVs use. It might not matter much in the long term, but this is a welcome advantage when you are first setting up your TV, especially if you plan on wall mounting.</p><h3>What's the difference between the 2023 C3 and the 2024 C4?</h3><p>The LG Evo C3 is a 2023 model, just one year behind the 2024 LG Evo C4. So what are the differences? Aside from the $300 price difference, not much. The most important trait – picture quality – is more or less identical. Where the C4 improves on the C3 are an upgraded processor, newer WebOS smart interface, and a higher 144Hz refresh rate, all of which are updates that you may very well never notice.</p><h3>Should You Buy Now or Wait for Black Friday?</h3><p>Although this is an extremely good discount for one of our favorite gaming TVs, you may be wondering if you should wait until Black Friday to make a purchase. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday 2024</a> will definitely have more options available, however if this particular model drops in price even more, it certainly won't be by too much. Whatever you decide, this discount makes this easily one of the<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-tv-deals-labor-day-2024-sales"> best TV deals right now</a>.</p><p><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

Now, a little over a month after launch, Space Marine 2 has hit 4.5 million players.</p><p>Last month, Saber Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits told IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3"><u>how the breakout success of Space Marine 2 had “changed everything” for the company</u></a>. At the time, Willits wouldn’t go into hard numbers, either in revenue or profit terms, but did go on the record to say <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-id-software-execs-space-marine-2-is-selling-faster-than-any-of-their-games-including-doom-and-quake"><u>Space Marine 2 is the fastest-selling game he's ever worked on</u></a>, and that includes all the Doom, Quake, Wolfenstein, and Rage games id Software released over the 24 years he was at the studio.</p><p>Speaking to IGN, Willits revealed that the budget for Space Marine 2 was less than half that of Doom Eternal, the last game he was id Software studio director on before leaving to join Saber in 2019. It seems likely that Space Marine 2, whose standard edition currently costs $59.99 on Steam and $69.99 on console, is already a highly profitable endeavor for all involved.</p><p>There are already ideas floating around for the now inevitable Space Marine 3, but in the shorter term Space Marine 2 has a confirmed Year 1 roadmap of post-launch support to deliver. Speaking of which, Focus has confirmed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-dev-reveals-new-tyranid-enemy-the-huge-hierophant-bio-titan"><u>the imminent arrival of the Tyranid Hierophant Bio-Titan enemy type</u></a>, the new Neo-Volkite pistol, and the hotly anticipated Dark Angels chapter cosmetic pack.

Leveraging<em> NBA </em>2K25’s platform has given us that opportunity,” said Thomas. </p><p>Thomas described <em>Gravity Ball</em> as a “mashup of <em>American-Gladiators</em>-meets-futuristic-basketball-meets-paintball,” and added that it’s “pure off-the-walls mayhem.” </p><p>As for why <em>Gravity Ball </em>exists and will be released through <em>NBA 2K25</em>, Thomas explained that every game studio wants to “try new things” and bring “new fun” experiences to players. </p><p>“Good concepts deserve a chance to find an audience and shouldn’t die on the cutting room floor. We hope you enjoy this game as much as we do and look forward to your feedback,” said Thomas. </p><p>The reaction to <em>Gravity Ball </em>has been...not great. Across Twitter and YouTube, many players aren’t happy with paid DLC being added to<em> NBA 2K25</em> and are also upset that the basketball sim needs more updates and fixes, but is instead getting a DLC game. There were also some fans who criticized <em>Gravity Ball</em> as 2K desperately trying to turn the basketball game into <em>Fortnite</em>. </p><p>It will be curious to see if these superfans on social media represent the opinions of most <em>NBA 2K25</em> players or if, as is often the case, most of the game’s players aren’t online all the time and will be happy to check out <em>Gravity Ball </em>on October 18. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In addition to general fine-tuning and tweaks to the gameplay, the Olympic Update also adds in a ton of new gameplay content, like a new region to explore, a brand-new weapon to master, more characters to meet, new decorations, and best of all, new animal familiars to bond with. On top of that, there's also more artwork to gawk at and new music tracks to listen to, making this a hefty expansion of the game during its early access journey.</p><p>The new location--which we're not spoiling here--will take players to the peak of the Hades 2 world, while the last of the Nocturnal Arms can be unlocked for Melinoe's arsenal. This weapon--another part of the game we're not spoiling--sounds like it'll require quick reflexes to master as Supergiant teased that players will be able to guard and retaliate with powerful attacks when using it.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hades 2 Early Access GameSpot Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>Other updates in the weapons department include a reworked special attack for the Witch's Staff, a deadlier Moonstone Axe that sacrifices its blocking ability for a powerful rising slash attack, and projectiles from Umbral Flames that will spin left or right depending on your movement. Overall, weapons are going to be even more powerful with all the changes that Supergiant is making in this update.</p><p>The Dash ability will also be innately faster and more responsive, allowing players to more reliably dash out of hit-stun effects from certain foes' strikes. Supergiant didn't go into too much detail on its new region, but the studio did reveal that this will be a fully realized zone that has various locations within it. Several other regions will also receive new locations, and on a welcome note, you'll find a Pool of Purging in the space before you enter Tartarus. Fishing points should also be easier to reach, and various other fixes have been made to the locations.</p><p>This is just the tip of the Hades 2 iceberg, and if you're looking to read through the exhaustive update notes--while dodging some light spoilers--<a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/1145350/announcements/detail/7057794870234137717">you can click this link</a> to read them in their entirety.</p><p>While it's still early days for Hades 2, the current build of the game already feels like it offers enough to confidently stand as a complete product. "Hades II is an ambitious expansion of all the ideas that came before it, balancing them beautifully to create one of the best roguelites on the market even in its incomplete state," Alessandro Barbosa wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hades-2-review-witching-hours/1900-6418231/">Hades 2 review-in-progress</a> back in May 2024.</p><p>Hades 2 is currently available for $30 on Steam and the Epic Games Store, but Supergiant has mentioned that the price could increase after its full release.</p>

Thankfully, there's a little trick that might work for letting you play before your region's scheduled release time. You just need to pretend you're from New Zealand.</p><p dir="ltr">For the past few years, eager Call of Duty fans have tricked their devices into thinking they live in New Zealand. This only seems to work for consoles, and the rules will be different for PlayStation and Xbox. PC users might be out of luck unless they have some VPN method to relocate them to New Zealand, but this is usually a console only trick.</p>

As I plopped down in one of the 83 racing simulators in the new <a href="https://f1arcade.com/us/">F1 Arcade</a> location in Washington, DC, I told the company’s CEO, Adam Breeden, that I’d raced plenty of times before. I picked Semi-Pro difficulty, even as Breeden told me he recommends most first-time arcade visitors pick something simpler. I adjusted the Vesaro simulator, started the race, and caused a six-car pileup on the race’s very first corner.</p><p>Luckily for me, the F1 Arcade is designed more for fun than fidelity, so my race wasn’t over. It ended four minutes later, in dead-last place, as the onscreen timer mercifully ticked to zero. On a normal day at the arcade, this would signal it’s time for someone else to race. For me, sitting at the wheel a few days before the arcade opened to the public, it just meant my shameful drive was finally over.</p><p>The DC outpost of the F1 Arcade is the company’s second location in the US — the first opened in Boston earlier this year, after two locations in the UK have been huge hits. (Breeden says one location did twice its projected revenue in its first year.) The project started a few years ago, when Formula 1 reached out to Breeden about building a more experiential product for racing fans. Breeden has been doing this kind of thing for a while — he calls it “competitive socializing” — and has built brands for Ping-Pong, minigolf, bowling, and darts — and says he landed on the idea of racing simulators right away. Millions of people have sat in arcade chairs and driven onscreen cars in games like <em>Cruis’n World</em>, and lots of people are willing to fork over hundreds or thousands of dollars to get a wheel and pedals into their own home. A fun, social, competitive racing experience seemed like a winner.</p><div><figcaption><em>The F1 Arcade is just rows and rows and rows of simulators. And a bar.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo: David Pierce / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>All 83 simulators inside this huge DC space are the same: an all-in-one machine built by a company called Vesaro. (The company sells a modified version of the setup, which it calls <a href="https://www.vesaro.com/store/pc/viewPrd.asp?idproduct=775&amp;idcategory=645">the V-Zero Mark II</a>, for a hair under £40,000.) It has a steering wheel and two pedals and a seat that rumbles and moves as your car does in the game. “If you’re playing this thing with full manual settings,” Breeden says, “it is functionally a professional-level racing simulator.” He says his team is already working on new versions of the rig, but he’s happy with the state of things, too. And he’s trying to make sure he thinks of everything — even the F1 Arcade’s food menus were designed in part to make sure you don’t bring messy fingers into the cockpit.</p><p>Racing simulators are not, by nature, fun to watch or even particularly social. Sims are complicated and require full attention, races last for hours, and watching someone’s heads-up view isn’t fun for very long. For Breeden and his team, the most important thing about the F1 Arcade was making it a group activity.</p><p>That process started with building an entirely new game to play. Booting up 83 copies of <em>F1 24 </em>just wasn’t an option. “Ultimately, the console game is not really fit for a concept like this. It’s very complicated,” Breeden says. What the arcade needed, he thought, was a way for racers to just sit down and start racing without having to make lots of choices and wait through loading screens. It also needed to be connected so people could race against the person next to them or even everyone else in the bar.&nbsp;</p><div><p>Booting up 83 copies of <em>F1 24 </em>just wasn’t an option</p></div><p>The F1 Arcade’s game is based on rFactor 2, a well-known simulator and rendering engine that is often used and modified for various kinds of professional simulating. (It’s also the game that real-life F1 champion Max Verstappen <a href="https://www.overtake.gg/news/max-verstappen-rants-after-virtual-le-mans-debacle.909/">rage-uninstalled last year</a>, after it crashed and cost him a virtual race.) Everything other than the core racing experience has been modified for the arcade, Breeden says. “And it’s not just the software,” he says. “It’s the booking system, the points, how it leads into the leaderboards, how that fuels the virtual currency we have.” The F1 Arcade team has designed a whole online system for gameplay, too: you play the reflex game by scanning a QR code rather than dropping in a quarter, and you win that virtual currency instead of tickets. It all took years and a team of engineers. Breeden says he’s much more of a tech company CEO than he ever expected to be.</p><p>The game has several different modes designed for in-person racing. Most people will race head-to-head against the other people in their group — the arcade rents simulators in 30- or 45-minute increments, the way you’d reserve a lane to bowl. You can also team up and take turns racing against up to 19 other teams around the venue. And for the more skilled and competitive racers, the F1 Arcade will have overall leaderboards and full-length races.</p><p>You win not by taking the checkered flag but by accruing points. You get points for being in first when the four-minute timer ends, yes, but also for overtaking other racers and doing other things on the track. The idea is to give everyone a chance, even the newbies —&nbsp;each player selects their skill level, which can be anything from essentially “Full Manual Simulator” to “The Car Basically Drives Itself,” and the game should adjust to keep everyone competitive. If you just imagine playing a photorealistic, really high-end version of <em>Mario Kart</em>, you’ll understand exactly how the F1 Arcade is supposed to feel.</p><div><figcaption><em>Everything, including the decor, screams F1.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Photo: David Pierce / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>When you’re not playing, of course, the idea is you’ll eat and drink. And watch. Each simulator has two ultrawide, 49-inch ROG Strix displays, stacked vertically in front of the seat. The bottom screen shows your racing view, while the top one shows something more like you’d see on TV, so the people behind you can watch the race and cheer you on. “You get a close race, everyone’s banging the back of the simulator, screaming and shouting for their team,” he says. “And it’s just so participatory, which is what you want.”</p><p>There’s more to the F1 Arcade than the simulators. There’s a huge, upscale bar, with a menu overseen by Lauren Paylor O’Brien, the champion of the first season of Netflix’s <em>Drink Masters</em>. There are other games, like a wall of lights meant to test your reflexes. Most of the decor is F1-related in some way: the overhead lights are in the shape of various tracks or telemetry data coming from cars, and there are those iconic round red lights everywhere. Breeden is adamant that the way these places succeed is by appealing to people who don’t care about the activity and just want a place to hang out; the people who love racing will come anyway, you know? Still, it’s a room full of simulators.</p><p>So much of the arcade acknowledges the fact that everyone’s a gamer now and that modern socialization so often includes screens. This digital-IRL collision is happening everywhere you look: Nintendo built an AR Mario Kart experience at Universal Studios in Los Angeles and Osaka, Dave &amp; Buster’s is filled with mobile games and VR headsets, and kids are hanging out in <em>Roblox</em> and <em>Fortnite</em> the same way they hang out at the mall. Breeden’s fine with all that. He’s just trying to build something worth leaving the house for.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You might be able to guess what that region is based on the update’s title — “The Olympic Update” — but if you haven’t played the game yet, I’m not going to say anything else. I’m looking forward to exploring it as soon as I can and trying to take down the boss, who seems to be featured in the update’s release trailer. (I’ll probably try to get there with the new weapon, “Xinth, the Black Coat.”)</p><p>There are a bunch<em> </em>of other updates, too. Supergiant has added two animal familiars to the game: a bird and a dog (which, yes, you can pet). You can get boons from Athena and Dionysus, who were both in the original <em>Hades</em>. There’s new music; the song in the update’s trailer is <em>very</em> good. I could go on, but you should just <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DWH3jT53hIYM">watch the trailer for yourself</a> or read the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F1145350%2Fview%2F7057794870234137716">extensive patch notes</a>. </p><p>As for what’s next, Supergiant plans to add a “climactic confrontation” after the new region, additional boons, and more enemies. The company says it’s planning to launch its next major update in “early 2025.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, IO Interactive is shedding some light on its ambitious plans for Bond and a hoped for trilogy that will unveil a new origin story for the world famous spy.</p><p>IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-007-io-interactive-young-bond-for-gamers-trilogy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that Project 007 won't be based on any of the existing Bond movies. Instead, the developer is being allowed to create its own version of James Bond for the game.</p><p>"What's exciting about that project is that we actually got to do an original story," said Abrak. "So it's not a gamification of a movie. It's completely beginning and becoming a story, hopefully for a big trilogy out there in the future. And equally important and exciting, it's a new Bond. It's a Bond we built from ground up for gamers. It's extremely exciting with all the tradition and all the history there is there together to work on this together with the family of creating a young Bond for gamers; a Bond that the gamers can call their own and grow with."</p><p>Abrak didn't offer any concreate details about when Project 007 will arrive, but noted that "the production's going amazingly well." He also reiterated his hope to use it as a launching point for additional James Bond games.</p><p>"I don't want to speak too big about it, but I just hope we'll do a thing that will define James Bond in gaming for years to come," added Abrak. "And that is not only one game, but that we create a universe for gamers to own for many years to come that we can grow with that next to the Bond on the movies."</p><p>Project 007 doesn't currently have a release date. But we do know that Ubisoft veteran <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hitman-dev-hires-ubisoft-veteran-for-new-james-bond-game-and-hes-excited-to-work-on-a-non-sequel/1100-6522538/" data-ref-id="1100-6522538">Rodrigo Santoro was hired earlier this year</a> to be mission director for the game. As for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-we-know-about-the-next-james-bond-movie/2900-5158/" data-ref-id="2900-5158">the next James Bond movie</a>, chances are good that Project 007 may come out first.</p>

            <p>Archetype Entertainment and Blur Studio's space <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/exodus">Exodus</a> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ex-bioware-devs-reveal-exodus-a-sci-fi-rpg-shooter-about-time-dilation-featuring-matthew-mcconaughey">announced back in December</a>, and was broadly notable for a couple of things: 1) Matthew McConaughey plays a character, and 2) the game's story is woven around time dilation during faster than light travel, with star-hopping adventurers prosecuting a fight against evil Celestials over hundreds, perhaps thousands of years.</p>
<p>Now, it is notable for three things, the third thing being a cosmic blubber-spire of gurning faces who want to eat your ship and soul. Say hello to the Mara Yama, the ickiest Celestial faction so far. Here's a trailer, in which McConaughey does that thing where he lingers on the sibilants and makes you want to lean in and vigorously mess up his hair.</p><!--more-->

<p>And here's some blurb:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Mara-Yama, horrifying Celestials, twisted into monstrous forms, are unlike anything humanity has ever faced in the battle for survival. The Mara-Yama feed on fear, delight in cruelty, and revel in the agony of their prey. They aren't just hunters - they are sadistic predators who savor every moment of psychological torment they inflict.</p>
<p>Stalking the deepest shadows of the Centauri Cluster, the Mara-Yama strike without warning, targeting the isolated and unsuspecting. But they're after more than cargo - they harvest minds, memories, and even emotions, leaving survivors forever haunted by the terror that hides between the stars. Few escape their grip, but those who do know the frightening truth that lurks out there in the void.</p></blockquote>
<p>We've yet to see any in-game footage of Exodus. While there's definitely room for a new sci-fi yarn in the Shepard vein at the minute, I hope it's not <em>too</em> much like Mass Effect, and is able to do something fiddly and fancy with time dilation in particular. Signing up McConaughey must have cost a pretty penny - it'd be a shame if the Interstellar connection turned out to be purely a question of cutscenes. You can read more about what time dilation in Exodus involves <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-does-time-dilation-set-exodus-apart-from-mass-effect-it-supersizes-all-of-the-choices-that-you-make">here</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
