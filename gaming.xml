            <p>We don't score reviews at Rock Paper Shotgun. Some might tell you this is because we view numeric scores as stifling oversimplifications of the wonderful, strange, and personal experiences videogames can offer, but it's really because the refurbished work keyboards we're assigned when hired all have their number keys gummed up with Marmite and none of us want to touch them.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I have scored games in the past, however. Pay attention, because I'm about to divulge a tale of corruption so vile and petty that I fear my career will never recover: I have, on occasion, reluctantly docked 0.2% of a point from a game's review score for being awkward to alt+tab out of so I can take notes. I will not apologise. This is an accessibility feature. It's vital that I can access my notes doc at all times, lest I fail to capture some choice impression like "more like ASSassin's Creed: BOREigins lmao lol".</p>
<p>I've just today found out that <a href="https://youtu.be/e8jv24NjOWQ">Steam added a feature a year ago</a> that lets you pull up a notepad from the overlay tab and jot down thoughts, and I've only found out because a new update lets you now <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/notes/list">access these notes from the web</a> (cheers, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/software/platforms/steam-users-react-ecstatically-to-update-that-lets-them-access-their-heaving-game-notes-via-the-web-also-it-fixes-monster-hunter-wilds-video-recording/">PC Gamer</a>). People <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1j3z2pt/notes_are_officially_on_web/">are apparently chuffed</a> about it! My first thought was "how is this useful to anyone except me specifically?".  Then I remembered those blank sections you'd sometimes get in the back of game manuals. Then I thought about recent games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes">Lorelei And The Laser Eyes</a> or even <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suikoden-i-and-ii-hd-remaster-gate-rune-and-dunan-unification-wars">Suikoden I &amp; II HD Remastered</a>. There are thankfully still games that embrace notetaking, and this feels like a reasonably untaxing feature on Steam's end.</p>

<p>There are, I'm discovering, plenty of other use cases. "I wish we could add notes to games on the wishlist. I have so many games that I've added over the years and can't remember why," Redditor bugfix00 writes. 

</p><p>Other redditor Madnesis adds: "Trying to paste a screenshot into my notes while using the Steam overlay would result in pasting a “⍰” instead of the actual screenshot. Man, I’m so glad I got a workaround but would have appreciated it sooner - so I could’ve saved all those STALKER 2 artifact spots in my notes Steam notes directly."</p>
<p>Alongside the web notes feature, the latest <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/SteamClientBeta/announcements/detail/545602406545622946">Steam beta update</a> also offers "improved display of notifications for in-progress achievements," in big picture mode, a fix to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> video recording, and support for the <a href="https://www.8bitdo.com/micro/">8BitDo Micro gamepad</a> - a tiny lozenge of a controller that looks fun to own but awkward to use, especially if you just had to type '8' and now have Marmite on your fingers.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragonkin-the-banished-early-access-hands-on-preview-who-wants-a-pet-dragon/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite having had a sort of blueprint for decades, top-down action role-playing games are a little hard to get right. Ever since the release of the original Diablo and its wildly more popular sequel, many games have attempted to replicate the experience crafted by Blizzard, and only a handful succeeded at providing satisfying experiences powered by the simple core gameplay loop of exploring dungeons, defeating enemies, obtaining new loot, improving character build to take on even more difficult challenges. Still, <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-of-exile-2-early-access-hands-on-the-arpg-that-could-rule-them-all/">Path of Exile</a> and a few other games proved that it is possible to challenge the dominance of the Diablo series by offering what ARPG players really want, which often involves a good wealth of customization options.</p>
<p>While it is too early to say if Eko Software's Dragonkin: The Banished will indeed be able to offer an experience that will please fans of the genre, the potential is most definitely there. The Early Access version currently only features the very first chapter of the adventure and some endgame activities that will likely get expanded once the game hits its 1.0 version, but what can be experienced is definitely promising, even in its current rough state.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250304135423_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As those who tried the game's recent demo already know, Dragonkin: The Banished offers right from the beginning the chance to see the power level that the game's four characters will be able to reach, taking advantage of a prologue that sets the story up, detailing how the world was corrupted by the blood of dragons that is causing monstrous creatures to rise from the depths of the earth. While these characters do fall into the ARPG archetypes that are found in pretty much every game in the genre, they feel diverse enough. The Knight, for example, combines offense and defense for a varied playstyle; the Oracle utilizes elemental magic with different ranges and AOEs while also offering surprisingly good mobility options; the Barbarian hits harder and harder when the Rage value increases, showing his true strength when overwhelmed by enemy hordes. A fourth character that falls into the Ranger/Rogue archetype is also briefly available during the prologue but is not yet available for the main adventure.</p>
<p>While dominating enemies in the prologue using these prebuilt godlike heroes is fun for a short while, the prologue alone doesn't do a great job at highlighting some of the features that set Dragonkin: The Banished apart from similar games, as it only becomes possible to access the main menu, and thus the many customization options the game has to offer, only a few minutes after selecting the character among the Knight, Oracle and Barbarian, and reaching the City of Montescail, which serves as the main hub. One of these features is the Ancestral Grid, a massive grid that comes with different shapes that depend on the character it belongs to, and a huge number of nodes that are progressively unlocked as the character levels up, where it is possible to place Fragments, items collected from enemies that represent character skills and modifiers. What makes this system very interesting is how modifiers all have some pretty unique shapes that fit into multiple nodes and can affect multiple character skills depending on the placement, turning skill customization into a sort of engaging puzzle game that requires some serious optimization to get the best out of any modifier. The modifiers themselves look varied enough, as they grant tons of different properties to skills, including damage and speed boosts, so it definitely feels like the system has a ton of potential, even in its very first iteration.</p>
<p>Another feature that sets Dragonkin: The Banished apart from other ARPGs is the ability to bring a Wyrmling along, a small companion dragon that can be chosen among four different ones that come with their own unique elements, bonus attributes, and skills. Interestingly enough, the Wyrmlings' skills are also placed on the Arcane Grid and can be influenced by regular modifiers, further increasing customization options. In addition, when a character skill is affected by 8 or more modifiers, it enters Symbiosis with the currently equipped Wyrmling, increasing its power and granting it the elemental properties of the companion dragon. Achieving this requires perfect optimization of the Arcane Grid, which further makes the customization system way more involving than simply equipping skills and activating modifiers.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/20250304172246_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Even when it comes to its main hub, Dragonkin: The Banished attempts to do something slightly different from the norm. Instead of offering every possible service right at the start of the game, the City of Monstescail will evolve based on its Prosperity Level, which is increased by visiting the world and defeating major Dragons. Besides the Jeweler, who can produce rings with items looted after defeating enemies, the Apothecary, who can upgrade potions, and the Dark Merchant, who buys from the player unwanted items, more services will be added in future versions of the game to give players even more reasons to fully explore the world and increase the city's prosperity.</p>
<p>Despite being in Early Access, Dragonkin: The Banished already offers plenty of replay value, with multiple difficulty levels that also increase rewards and quality of loot, and proper endgame activities like hunts, unique quests of variable durations, difficulty, and rewards, and Dungeon Purification, where the player has to close a rift at the end of dungeons. All of these activities allow the player to push the limits of the current gameplay systems to the maximum, allowing them to get their hands on powerful loot and Fragments, although, with potentially huge changes on the horizon, spending too much time on these activities may not be very worthwhile right now.</p>
<p>The potential big changes coming to Dragonkin: The Banished in the future aren't the only thing that may not make it worthwhile for most players to start playing the game right away in its first iteration. The unfinished user interface, plenty of bugs, including some progression blockers that, at least, are not critical, textures loading in seconds after a new area is loaded, missing resolution options suddenly becoming available, wonky controller support and general lack of the most basic polish are only some of the issues that suggest the game wasn't exactly ready for even an Early Access release, so it may be wise to wait for a few patches before diving in.</p>
<p>In its first few minutes, Dragonkin: The Banished gives off a feeling of "been there, done that already", but the gameplay systems that come into play as the player sets off in the game's corrupted world hint at greater things to come, even in their current rough state. Eko Software is committed to updating its game with new features, and I'm really interested to see how the game's decent foundation will be improved in the future before its proper 1.0 release and if all the improvements will truly be able to set the game apart from the likes of Diablo IV and Path of Exile 2.</p>

It is a curse of death that consumes the continent. A Warlock who coveted Death, devoured people and animals and enveloped the world in despair. For thousands of years the line of kings has sealed the Abyss. But now, the king has vanished, and the world is being consumed by death, moment by moment. Resistance itself is meaningless. There is naught but to perish.</p><p><strong>Overview</strong></p><p><em>Wizardry Variants Daphne</em> is a 3D dungeon RPG, a completely new addition to the <em>Wizardry</em> series. The game system follows the play cycle of the traditional 3D dungeon RPGs, with players progressing deeper into dungeons called Abyss, by repeatedly getting stronger, resupplying in towns, and battling and collecting items in dungeons. Battles with enemies proceed in a command battle system, and a formation of up to six characters, including the player, can enjoy highly strategic battles that make full use of spells and skills.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>NordVPN is running a limited-time discount that saves you 70% on its two-year subscription plans. Four different plans are available for NordVPN--Basic, Plus, Complete, and Prime. Each one is more expensive than the last, but all four are currently on sale. You’ll get the best deal when signing up for its most expensive package, Prime, which is down to $201.36 for 24 months (normally $743.76 per 24 months), but even the standard <strong>Basic plan is a great deal at just $81.36 for 24 months (was $278.16)</strong>. As a bonus, <strong>signing up for a two-year deal on the Plus or Complete plans will get you an additional six months for free</strong> via an emailed coupon code. Opt for the Prime plan, and this gets bumped to one year. You can use the code to extend your plan or gift it to a friend and get them some free added privacy or a way to access the catalog of other countries’ streaming services.</p><p>Here's a closer look at the costs of each two-year plan:</p><h2>NordVPN Plans</h2><ul><li>Basic -- $81.36 (<del>$278.16</del>)</li><li>Plus --$105.58 (<del>$359.76</del>)</li><li>Complete -- $129.36 (<del>$438.96</del>)</li><li>Prime -- $201.36 (<del>$743.76</del>)</li></ul><p>All four plans get you access to the secure NordVPN network and threat protection through its DNS servers. They also support 10 simultaneous connections, so you should have no problem running all your favorite gadgets through the VPN at once.</p><p>Stepping up to the Plus plan introduces perks like ad and tracker blockers, advanced browsing protection, and anti-malware protection. There’s even a password manager that works across all your devices automatically.</p><p>The Complete plan provides 1TB of encrypted cloud storage--for an extra $24, that’s not a bad offer. Prime is the most comprehensive plan offered by NordVPN, getting you NordProtect--an identity protection service that scans the dark web for your data, offers credit freeze assistance, and even provides you with up to $1 million in identity theft coverage.</p><p>NordVPN is a pretty popular service, and getting access to it at these low prices is mighty enticing. And since three of the four plans get you additional months for free, it’s a great time to sign up.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spider-man-x-magic-the-gathering-trading-card-set-is-available-to-preorder/1100-6529819/">Spider-Man X Magic: The Gathering Trading Card Set Is Available To Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-biggest-upcoming-games-that-you-can-preorder-now/2900-6285/">The Biggest Upcoming Games That You Can Preorder Now</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sandisk-1-5tb-microsd-card-is-steeply-discounted-at-amazon-expand-your-steam-deck-storage/1100-6527841/">SanDisk 1.5TB MicroSD Card Is Steeply Discounted At Amazon - Expand Your Steam Deck Storage</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-s-owners-can-save-big-on-western-digitals-1tb-expansion-card/1100-6527818/">Xbox Series X|S Owners Can Save Big On Western Digital's 1TB Expansion Card</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-exclusive-pokemon-tcg-premium-collection-gets-huge-limited-time-discount/1100-6528386/">Amazon-Exclusive Pokemon TCG Premium Collection Gets Huge Limited-Time Discount</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-4k-steelbook-collectors-edition-preorder-for-best-ever-price-at-amazon/1100-6529671/">Lord Of The Rings Trilogy Limited Edition Steelbook Box Set Returns Next Month</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-alarmo-now-available-at-major-retailers-mario-will-wake-you-up-for-100/1100-6529653/">Nintendo Alarmo Now Available At Major Retailers - Mario Will Wake You Up For $100</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-nintendo-switch-oled-value-bundle-comes-with-super-mario-bros-wonder/1100-6529632/">New Nintendo Switch OLED Value Bundle Comes With Super Mario Bros.

		<p>After a few years of hinting that The Last of Us Part 3 might be in the works, Naughty Dog’s Neil Druckmann seems to have a change of heart.&nbsp; In an interview with Variety about Season 2 of the The Last of Us television show Neil is asked about a third game.</p>
<blockquote><p>“I was waiting for this question,” Druckmann says, sighing, when I bring up the prospect of a third game. “I guess the only thing I would say is don’t bet on there being more of ‘Last of Us.’ This could be it.”</p></blockquote>
<p>Neil himself had <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/03/the-last-of-us-3-ps5-naughty-dog-interview/">previously said </a>he does have a idea for Part 3. “I don’t have a story, but I do have that concept,” he stated back in February 2024. “That, to me, is as exciting as one, as exciting as two, is its own thing, yet has this through line for all 3. So it does feel like… there’s probably one more chapter to this story.”</p>


<p>Further back in 2021 Druckmann said he had the outline of a story and there had been “quite a bit” of discussion about the game.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Naughty Dog have done this, after the release of Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End, Naughty Dog Creative Director Shaun Escayg<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/22/naughty-dog-doubt-that-they-are-finished-with-uncharted/"> said</a> “To say the Uncharted world is done… I doubt that highly,” and then a few years later, we were told quite bluntly they were<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/26/naughty-dog-uncharted-5/"> “done” with franchise.&nbsp;</a></p>

<p>Naughty Dog’s next new game and franchise is Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, a game that will see the studio leap into the realms of science fiction with a setting thousands of years in the future. However they have stated they are working on “multiple” single player games but clearly not Uncharted or The Last of Us.</p>

<p>The Variety interview also gives us a few hints of what to expect from Season 2 of the television show and from what Bella Ramsey is saying, <em>that scene</em> will be in this series.</p>
<p>“I’m scared of some of the bigger emotional scenes, leaving not satisfied with my performance,” she says, before explaining that that for “the darkest scene this season”, they listened to the song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRBOgtp0Hac">Peanut Butter Jelly Time. </a>&nbsp;Why they did that is not explained, it’s a very shouty upbeat song and certainly not what would pop in to your head when someone’s head is po…. let’s not finish that sentence. “I was on the floor, my eyes absolutely burning with these menthol tears, and I’m just saying, ‘Peanut Butter&nbsp;<em>Jelllll-y</em>,’” adds Bella.</p>
<p>It is also revealed we will meet Eugene, played by Joe Pantoliano, a character who is only referenced in the game as the owner of the canabis den in which&nbsp; Ellie and Dina spend a night in.</p>

            <p>
Until Dawn remake studio Ballistic Moon has reportedly "effectively closed", amid claims only a handful of employees "at most" remain - none of them developers.
</p>
<p>
Ballistic Moon, which is based in the UK, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-remake-studio-ballistic-moon-lays-off-staff-ahead-of-the-games-release-in-october">confirmed a round of redundancies last year</a>, saying it had made the "tough decision to significantly scale down our team to secure the future of our studio." However, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-effectively-closed/">new report by Insider Gaming</a> claims the studio quietly made a second round of redundancies toward the end of last year.
</p>
<p>
According to the publication's sources, roughly 40 employees were let go in October, with remaining staff kept on to provide post-launch support for Ballistic's Until Dawn remake. However, it's claimed these developers - equating to around 20 employees - lost their jobs in December, leaving only the studio's founders and "possibly" a handful of employees "at most". Reportedly, Ballistic's entire PR, marketing, and development teams are now gone.

<p>
"People are sharing bugs they've found in the game to make the team aware," a source told the publication, "but there is no one working on patch support for the game anymore."
</p>
<p>
Insider Gaming claims the job losses follow unsuccessful attempts by Ballistic's founders to pitch new projects, secure funding, and keep things "moving forward". It's also said discussions were had with Sony to secure funding for additional Until Dawn updates, possibly even another game, but they never reached fruition. Eurogamer has reached out to Ballistic for comment.
</p>
<p>
Word of additional redundancies at Ballistic comes as job cuts and studio closures continue across the games industry. February alone saw the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">Monolith Productions, Player First Games, and Warner Bros. Games San Diego shut their doors</a>, with layoffs also confirmed at Marvel Rivals' US development team, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/callisto-protocol-studio-confirms-layoffs-as-former-employee-claims-most-of-the-devs-affected">The Callisto Protocol developer Striking Distance</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surgeon-simulator-developer-suffers-more-layoffs-says-it-will-scale-back-operations">Surgeon Simulator studio Bossa Games</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/kosmos-senior-executive-heiko-windfelder-man-who-oversaw-catan-is-retiring<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>After 30 years at Kosmos, Heiko Windfelder is retiring. The senior executive has a long and storied history within the tabletop space, including selling and promoting the most beloved games ever.</p>

<h2>Heiko Windfelder's Retirement Announcement</h2>

<p>According to a report from <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/03/05/veteran-kosmos-senior-exec-heiko-windfelder-who-oversaw-rise-of-catan-exit-games-at-german-publisher-is-retiring/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Board Game Wire</a>, Heiko Windfelder is retiring from Kosmos a mere two years after long-time managing director Michael Fleissner retired. When this occ urred, operational management fell to Windfelder alongside Thilan Tran and Matthias Kienzle. Both Tran and Kienzle will continue managing in a dual leadership position.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kosmos-catan-box-art.jpg?itok=e9ruoc2z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kosmos-catan-box-art.jpg?itok=2rF9XKqp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Both Tran and Kienzle issued the following statement regarding Windfelder's retirement:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Over the past 30 years, Kosmos has developed into the highest-selling games publisher in the field of family and adult games.</p>

<p>“During this time, Heiko Windfelder has played a very influential role in shaping the fortunes of the company.</p>

<p>“With his passion for special stories, his creativity and his feel for special titles and exceptional authors, he has made a significant contribution to leading the publishing house to this pole position.</p>

<p>“For this, we thank him from the bottom of our hearts on behalf of the management and the entire Kosmos team.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Heiko Windfelder joined Kosmos in 1995, it was the same year they published <em>Catan</em>, one of the most popular board games in the business with over 45 million copies sold, not counting certain <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/catan-masterpiece-kickstarter-fully-funded-within-hour-promoting-bespoke-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">prestige artisanal component</a> sets.</p>

<p>A second popular board game series nurtured by Windfelder was the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/exit-game-gate-between-worlds-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Exit</em></a> family series. This is a series of small box escape room board games. Each entry is themed around a different scenario like a sunken ship, a Sherlock Holmes mystery, and even an officially licensed <em>Lord of the Rings</em> scenario where you must escape the temptations of The One Ring.</p>

<p>Afterwards, Windfelder served as program manager with responsibility for the company's toy and game lines. These included <em>The Crew</em>, <em>Imhotep</em>, and the Spiel des Jahres winning <em>Sky Team</em>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-the-board-game-review.1126443/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-the-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the real achievements of tabletop crowdfunding has been the freedom to experiment with ambitious ideas. Instead of needing to target a mainstream audience with wider appeal, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">video-game-to-board game adaptations</a> have been able to aim at more niche audiences whose hobby identity overlaps between both mediums. This has allowed a game like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. The Board Game to thrive, offering a full-blown analog experience that is enormously rich and full of life, just as the original franchise fully deserves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a complex and expensive game chock-full of content. In it, up to four players take on the role of STALKERs, cooperating to achieve mission objectives such as rescuing a prisoner, retrieving an artifact, or hunting a massive beast in the irradiated environs of Chernobyl. Setting up the tiles, tokens, overlays, and cards can take a solid 20 minutes. Sneaking or fighting your way through the zone while handling all of the necessary aspects of play is another two or three hours. These estimates are for players who are familiar with the game and its rules as your first session is likely to stretch even longer. This experience is the inverse of the recent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-the-board-game-priority-hagalaz-review"><u>Mass Effect board game</u></a>, instead seeking to offer an entire world to immerse yourself in at the cost of accessibility. Fortunately, all of this effort is absolutely worth it, for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is a marvelous experience on the tabletop.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/05/stalker-playerboard-1741205445258.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The default mode of play is a story-focused campaign that lasts three scenarios. This is a more modest and reasonable commitment than popular <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign board games</a> such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gloomhaven-jaws-of-the-lion-review"><u>Gloomhaven</u></a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-review"><u>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game</u></a>. Crucially, it means players are far more likely to actually finish the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It plays like a mashup of a traditional <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dungeon-crawler-board-games">dungeon crawler</a> with adventure game aspects. Each player controls a different STALKER outfitted with a variety of firearms, armor, and supplemental items. You then take turns performing one of several actions, including the expected moving and shooting, but also more unusual options like tossing bolts to distract enemies or interacting with terrain elements on the map.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Fortunately, the effort is absolutely worth it, for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is a marvelous experience on the tabletop.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The environment is dynamic and unpredictable. This is a key quality of the game, as it seeks to capture the danger and mystique of the Zone. You accumulate radiation moving through certain areas, hopefully possessing some kind of suit to offer protection. You also manipulate objects depending on the scenario and your goals. This may mean you have to locate a hidden trapdoor and pry it open, or choose between climbing a shaky ladder and descending into a drainpipe to enter a ruined building cut off from your approach. Often these environmental challenges are displayed on cards that are laid atop the map tiles. After spending an action to trigger or interact with their features, you flip the card over and reveal the outcome. There’s a strong sense of the unknown, particularly on your first playthrough of each scenario. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This core element of mystery is most strongly conveyed through anomalies. These swirling elemental entities are a significant detail of the video game’s setting, and they’re fundamental in establishing the character and personality of the post-apocalyptic surroundings. The board game adaptation of these oddities is spectacular. They’re represented by a standee and sit atop a translucent template on the board. The template contains various symbols spread across multiple map spaces, establishing a tense threat for any who would approach. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/05/stalker-anomaly-1741205445255.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Any figure that enters such a space must roll a die. If the symbol rolled matches one in the current space, it triggers the anomaly’s reaction. The effects depend on the specific type of anomaly, but often this means substantial damage with occasional detrimental status afflictions. To successfully navigate the area of threat, STALKERs must toss bolts to cover the face-up symbols and find a safe path through the chaos. This system is fantastic, as it captures the tone and atmosphere of the source material in a way that's not overly cumbersome. It also uses a unique set of components that is unusual in the board game space, which adds an esoteric quality and emphasizes its alien nature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The enemy AI is also well implemented. After all of the STALKERs have activated, a card is flipped and a menu of actions is performed. Different enemy types, such as mutants and humans, behave somewhat differently, and they also take into consideration whether the protagonists were overly loud or acted with stealth. Players running and gunning like lunatics draw more attention and receive a higher degree of aggressive response. This system provides strong incentives to conduct stealthy operations, and the tools afforded as well as the construction of the scenarios themselves make this a satisfying strategic approach. Much like the anomalies and environment facets, the intersection of enemy behavior and player conduct is a well considered system that is surprisingly satisfying.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/05/stalker-miniaturesvsstandee-1741205445258.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The story-focused campaign is interesting, with its own quirks worth exploring, but its lifespan is limited. The narrative offers two branches of missions you can embark on, which means you can replay the game to pursue the pathway you neglected. Each playthrough consists of only a few missions, but you may even find some joy in replaying scenarios you’ve already bested. Some terrain elements are randomized, and most scenarios offer multiple viable solutions to accomplishing the objective. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The campaign also offers some neat between-mission diversions. You can visit scavenger camps, interact with armorers, and unearth forgotten stashes. This is handled through an overland map of the nearby area, with newly discovered location nodes applied to the map via sticker. Two blank maps are included in the game as a fresh sheet is needed for each campaign you embark upon. These small location visits are executed fairly well, as they bring in a more macro view of the setting and help add context to the more zoomed-in missions.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The single best feature in this box is the Zone Survival module.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If that’s all S.T.A.L.K.E.R. The Board Game was, it would still be a solid entry into the tabletop gaming space. Fortunately, there's more: the single best feature in this box is the Zone Survival module. This is a full-fledged scenario generator that combines several randomized components to create a unique procedurally crafted mission. The event deck is constructed from a random allotment of cards, and your objective is either randomized or chosen from a list. You select the map from one of 10 layouts, and various environmental details are created through card draw. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This system is <em>bonkers</em>. Nearly half the cards and tokens in the game are dedicated to this fully developed and robust system. The story-driven campaign could have been removed wholesale, and this mode alone would have established S.T.A.L.K.E.R. as one of the year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">best board games</a>. Yes, the setup here is even more finicky and detailed, but the ensuing one-off scenario is full of surprises and drama. The degree of variability here is wild, and the game looks to support near endless play.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/05/stalker-allexpansions-1741205655039.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. The Board Game is a complete and hefty package, but it’s also one with an enormous amount of future potential. The core game comes with miniatures for the STALKERs, and cardboard standees for all foes and anomalies. Optional miniatures sets can be purchased, alongside several content expansions that add more detailed personal narratives to the characters, factions to interact with, and new narrative campaigns to embark upon. The commitment by the publisher is staggering, and this game looks to have long legs.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/z7EjD8?object_uuid=16530774-cc07-48ed-b16f-c2a511d60a13&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See it at Board Game Bliss</a></li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">Check Out More Board Games Based on Video Games: </h2></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> boss Neil Druckmann has cast doubt on the possibility of third The Last of Us game, telling fans, "Don't bet on there being more."
</p>
<p>
Fans have been dreaming of a potential third entry in the series ever since the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-a-gut-wrenching-sequel">release of The Last of Us Part 2 in 2020</a>. And while Naughty Dog and Sony have managed to remaster both the original The Last of Us (for a second time) and The Last of Us Part 2 since then, there's been no concrete word of a third series instalment.
</p>
<p>
Which isn't to say Naughty Dog has been entirely quiet on the matter. Back in 2021, Druckmann <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-3-has-a-story-outline-neil-druckmann-hopes-will-one-day-see-the-light-of-day">confirmed he'd penned a story outline for a potential The Last of Us Part 3</a> and admitted there'd been "quite a bit" discussion about a sequel. He <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-moving-on-from-uncharted-open-to-the-last-of-us-part-3-if-it-has-a-compelling-story">addressed a possible third series entry again</a> in 2023 - while Naughty Dog's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">now-canned The Last of Us multiplayer game</a> was still in the works - saying he was open to it, but only if the team could come up with a "compelling story".

<p>
And if that wasn't enough, Druckmann <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-3-could-be-one-more-chapter-to-this-story-says-co-creator-druckmann">returned to the subject of The Last of Us Part 3 again last year</a>, explaining that while he'd struggled to come up with a worthwhile concept for the game previously, "recently that's changed". And just to hammer home the point, he added, "So it does feel like there's probably one more chapter to this story."
</p>
<p>
All of which is to say that Druckmann's left enough of a breadcrumb trail over the last few years, that The Last of Us Part 3 feels like it might be closer to happening than not. And even though Naughty Dog is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-announces-all-new-ip-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">currently full steam ahead on its single-player sci-fi game Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, the studio's previous confirmation it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-neil-druckmann-says">had "multiple single-player projects" in the works</a> still left room for hope.
</p>
<p>
In a new <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-abby-video-game-changes-backlash-1236327786/">interview with Variety</a>, however, Druckmann has cast doubt on a possible The Last of Us Part 3. When asked about a potential third game, he replied, "I guess the only thing I would say is don't bet on there being more of Last of Us. This could be it."
</p>
<p>
It's unclear why Druckmann is suddenly less keen to fan the flames of speculation where a third The Last of Us title is concerned, but even if another game never happens, there's still new The Last of Us material on the way. HBO's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hbos-the-last-of-us-wins-eight-emmys-including-outstanding-guest-actor-for-nick-offermans-bill">critically acclaimed TV show</a> returns for a second season soon, and it'll begin adapting the events of the second game. However, Druckmann and show runner Craig Mazin previously confirmed the series will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-discusses-series-overall-length">likely take two or three seasons to cover all of The Last of Us Part 2</a>, and it's already clear plenty of new material will be in there.
</p>
<p>
Recent season two casting news, for instance, has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-additions-reveal-how-show-is-expanding-upon-the-game">suggested the show will be more explicitly tackling events only mentioned in passing during the second game</a>. And, of course, even if Naughty Dog never gets around to making The Last of Us Part 3, that doesn't mean Druckmann's story treatment for post-Part 2 couldn't eventually make it to the small screen.
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us season two runs for seven episodes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-long-awaited-season-2-finally-gets-a-start-date">starting on 13th April in the US</a>. And as for Naughty Dog's Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, there's no hint of a release date for that yet.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mtv%E2%80%99s-english-dub-of-a-martial-arts-flick-starring-a-bunch-of-2000s-era-rappers-and-tracy-morgan-is-as-unserious-as-it-sounds.1126431/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/volcano-high-mtv-english<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hwasango</em>, AKA <a href="https://archive.org/details/volcano-high-mtv_202311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Volcano High</em></a>, is a&nbsp; 2001 Korean martial arts film heavier on comedy than action. It follows a delinquent student named Kim struggling with his temper and psychic powers. After transferring to Volcano High, a preppy high school with students proficient in martial arts, Kim is dragged into a turf war between a gang of students and substitute teachers. But we’re here to talk about MTV’s 2003 English dub, which stars hip hop artists like André 3000, Lil Jon, Snoop Dogg, comedian Tracy Morgan, and Mr. Miyagi himself, Pat Morita.&nbsp;</p><p>I forget how the hell I even stumbled upon this time capsule of East meets West. Despite the film’s Korean version ranking as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120130024255/http://koreanfilm.org/kfilm01.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">9th highest-grossing Korean film in 2001</a>, the American version of <em>Volcano High</em>’s plot (which cuts 80 minutes of content) doesn’t have a remarkable story by any stretch of the imagination. Outside of some neat wire stunt work and special effects on par with <em>Donnie Darko</em>, <em>Volcano High</em> is a cheesy kung-fu movie that only stands to gain from having a goofy-sounding dub.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Volcano High School: MTV's rapper dub" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-xKg2meXFnc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>After watching the trailer of the American version, I assumed the film’s grab bag of hot-and-happening early aughts rappers would be hamming up their vocal performances. To my surprise, <em>Volcano High</em>’s cast played things pretty straight. Morita’s vocal performance is objectively better than everyone else’s because he perfectly matches the lip flaps and over-the-top gesticulations of <em>Volcano High</em>’s conniving vice principal, Ko.&nbsp;</p><p>But the absolute cream of MTV’s weird little assortment of actors is Lil Jon and Snoop Dogg. While Snoop Dogg is criminally underutilized, he earns whatever MTV cut him a check for as the school’s level-headed “big homie.” Many of his lines as class president Kwon Sang-woo (localized as Hakrim) have him pontificating circular phrases that pass for sage wisdom, such as “knowing your enemy is to know yourself” and “your biggest weakness is your greatest strength.” If it weren’t for how smoothly he delivers every line like an Instagram-worthy caption, his character wouldn’t have made me lean forward toward my laptop to hear him talk game to Andre Three Stacks’ Kim.&nbsp;</p><p>Lil Jon was born to play Volcano High’s resident bully, Jang Yang. Lil Jon has two volumes: a low grumble and full-throated shouts. <em>Volcano High </em>lets him ping pong between both poles of his vocal range; he shouts all the air out of his lungs whenever he routinely reminds people of his entire government name, and he growls like an anime villain whenever someone challenges him or gets the upper hand in their bouts of fisticuffs. If there ever was a film that would get the party rapper closer to EGOT status, it’s here.&nbsp;</p><p>Other memorable moments from <em>Volcano High</em> include Kelis’ “Milkshake” playing moments after Tracy Morgan’s dreadlocked Woo Ping faceplants his two-story window leap of faith, Jang Yang throwing hands in a cafeteria because a classmate dared to eat cheonggukjang (his least favorite food) in his presence, and an Ada Wong-looking lady calling Kelis’ character “bacon head” for her gaudy super-gelled hairstyle. If you have an affinity for cheesy martial arts movies with dubbing work on par with localized <em>Godzilla </em>movies, <em>Volcano High</em> is a pretty comfy, dumb fun watch.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/fiio-ft1-review-sennheiser-hd6xx-best-midfi-headphone-canjam"><h3>I Went To A Fancy Headphone Convention And Fell In Love With The Basics</h3></a><p>The classic Sennheiser HD 6XX and the new Fiio FT1 are the budget kings of headphones, beloved by many.

It’s also likely that fewer will be produced, which could lead to supply shortages.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-trump-tariffs-china-nintendo-sony-1851704901&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-trump-tariffs-china-nintendo-sony-1851704901">As we reported in January</a></span>, the president’s tariffs could see the price of consoles jump dramatically. A Switch could potentially go from $300 to $400. A PS5 Pro could see its price leap from $700 to $1000.
