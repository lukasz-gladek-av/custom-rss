            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>publisher Playstack has announced&nbsp;<em>Raccoin</em>, a roguelike that blends strategic deckbuilding with the arcade thrills of coin-pusher machines, and it's getting a playtest very soon.</p>

<p>As revealed by Playstack and developer Doraccoon in a press release,&nbsp;<em>Raccoin&nbsp;</em>is a ""nonstop dopamine rush" in which you must utilize special coins, combos, and synergies to get the results you want from a classic arcade coin-pusher.</p>

<p>If all of this is starting to sound familiar, that's probably because you're one of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-5m" rel="nofollow">millions of people</a> who has played&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Raccoin&nbsp;</em>very much seems to be in the same vein; it looks to be attempting to do for coin-pushers what&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>did for poker.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/raccoin-playstack-gadget.jpg?itok=AgD07SwI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/raccoin-playstack-gadget.jpg?itok=FIgtO5x6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Raccoin&nbsp;</em>wants to do for coin-pushers what&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>did for poker.</figcaption></figure><p>Some of the special coins you can look forward to include one that allows you to grow "a money tree" for your machine, as well as a "Nuclear Coin" that will provide a more propulsive push.</p>

<p>Doraccoon is promising "over 100 unique items", all of which have the potential to "dramatically shift the course of your run". Naturally, since this is a&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>-style arcade roguelike, you'll be stacking multipliers and building crazy combos as well.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to different characters to play as, each of whom brings their own unique personality and themed coins. These include a "math-savvy raccoon manager" and a "quirky biologist". Is the former a manager of raccoons or a raccoon themselves (or both)? You'll have to play to find out!</p>

<p>If you want to get a sense for what <i>Raccoin&nbsp;</i>plays like, you can check out the announcement trailer right here.</p>




<p>Of course, a better way to join the&nbsp;<em>Raccoin&nbsp;</em>hype is to playtest the game yourself, and starting from August 18th, you'll get the chance to do just that. All you need to do is request access over on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3784030/RACCOIN_Coin_Pusher_Roguelike/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official Steam store page</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Nearly two months after its release, crossplay in Rematch appears to finally be on the horizon. </p>



<p>In a post announced details for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rematch-gets-second-major-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s second major patch</a>, developer Sloclap has given a new update regarding crossplay for players. </p>



<p><strong>“Patch 3 should hopefully arrive by the end of August, and will fix some remaining known issues, and importantly introduce Crossplay to the game (at last!),”</strong> they said. </p>



<p>In addition to crossplay coming to the game, Sloclap said that “some gameplay tweaks” may also be added in Patch 3, specifically calling out the Ippy Slide. Those details, however, are “still to be confirmed”.</p>



<p>Crossplay in Rematch was scheduled to be a major feature for the soccer game upon release. Unfortunately, shortly before its launch, Sloclap <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rematch-will-not-have-crossplay-at-launch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced that it wouldn’t</a> be available at that time, though getting it implemented was a “top priority”.</p>



<p>At the time, the developers said that they did their “utmost” to have it available at launch, but “unforeseen technical complexities” prevented it from happening. </p>



<p>Recently, the studio said that <strong>“core work”</strong> <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/mini-dev-update-1-august-12th-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">was complete on the feature</a> with it being validated by Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation. </p>



<p><strong>“This milestone represents the most time-consuming phase of the project, involving multiple rounds of collaboration and in-depth testing with each platform,”</strong> Sloclap said. <strong>“Our UI/UX and Online teams have been fully focused on bringing crossplay to life, which has meant fewer updates and improvements to existing features in recent weeks.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“We’re now shifting our efforts toward final stabilization and bug fixing, with a special focus on polishing the Social features.”</strong></p>



<p>Are you excited to finally get crossplay in Rematch? Let us know down below, and join the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

                <p>Squid Games is taking over Fortnite, as Epic Games has announced that new creator-made games are available now to play. Like its Netflix source material, these are inspired by childhood games, but they're given a deadly twist as failure can result in elimination--at least it's better than what happens to the poor souls who lose a game in the popular TV series.</p><p>As you'd expect, there are also a few Fortnite elements present here, and some of the games revolve around lethal sumo rings, a deadly trap-filled gauntlet, and a recreation of the iconic Red Light, Green Light game.</p>

      </div>
<p>The first collaboration between Fortnite and Squid Games kicked off in June with themed skins in the item shop, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/squid-game-is-taking-over-fortnite-reload-next-week-with-a-new-map/1100-6532589/">a new Squid Grounds island was added to Fortnite Reload</a>, and several other accessories were added to the Fortnite shop.

                <p>The price of many products is increasing of late, due in part to tariffs and other economic conditions, and this has stretched to gaming as well. Against this backdrop, FuturLab has released a tongue-in-cheek trailer for PowerWash Simulator 2 that confirms the standalone sequel's price--$25 USD--which is the same as the first game.</p><p>"FuturLab acknowledges that in the current cost-of-living climate, players often have limited budgets for games and entertainment. For many, PowerWash Simulator is more than just a game, it's a wellbeing tool, a way to decompress and reclaim a moment of calm. The team is keen to keep that experience within reach," the developer said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0A9wbwsmsA0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0A9wbwsmsA0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>PowerWash Simulator 2 builds upon the foundation of the original game and adds more features like split-screen co-op, four-player online campaign support, better visuals, and perhaps most importantly, pettable cats.</p><p>"The choice to stick with the original price comes from a place of genuine appreciation. The team has been genuinely moved by the response to the original game and its DLC packs, and the hope is that continued support into the sequel will allow them to keep this accessible price point locked in at launch, with no plans to raise it," the studio said.</p><p>FuturLab added that it's able to keep the price the same due in part to the success of the first game. It was initially released in 2022 and became a big hit, as people embraced the satisfying zen nature of cleaning things off with a high-powered water hose.</p><p>FuturLab said that, as with the first game, it will steadily support PowerWash Simulator 2 with ongoing free updates after launch, including licensed content.</p><p>The game is in the works now for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, but a release date hasn't been announced yet. The original game launched on Game Pass, but it's not confirmed if the sequel will. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2968420/PowerWash_Simulator_2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist PowerWash Simulator 2 on Steam now.</a></p><p>On the subject of increased costs in gaming, former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden recently told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-picture-part-one-i-dont-know-if-games-are-recession-proof" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a> that publishers should have raised prices gradually over the years to account for ballooning budgets. Nintendo's Mario Kart World was the first major $80 game when it launched earlier this year, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-sales-race-ahead-almost-tied-with-switch-2/1100-6533626/" data-ref-id="1100-6533626">it was a huge success for Nintendo</a>, though many people no doubt got it for a perceived discount with the Switch 2 hardware bundle that included a copy of the game.</p><p>Microsoft was set to charge $80 for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-release-date-story-trailer/1100-6531213/" data-ref-id="1100-6531213">The Outer Worlds 2</a> this October but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-u-turns-on-80-xbox-games/1100-6533374/" data-ref-id="1100-6533374">changed plans and is keeping the price at $70</a>. Many are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-doesnt-need-to-cost-100-because-gta-online-is-the-real-cash-cow-analyst-says/1100-6533731/" data-ref-id="1100-6533731">expecting GTA 6 to come in at a price above $70</a>, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-addresses-rumored-price-hike-for-grand-theft-auto-6/1100-6533788/">the price of that game remains to be confirmed.</a></p><p>Others are not following Nintendo's path with $80 games, at least not yet, and that's because "everyone's afraid," according to Layden.</p><p>"No one wants to be the first one to raise the price, because you're afraid to lose traffic. So what you do is you just end up eating into your operating income, your profit margin," he said.</p>

<figure><a title="Tales of Xillia Jude Mathis" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ecc3f5c82141f/tales-of-xillia-jude-mathis.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure><p>After months of teasing for <strong>Tales</strong> fans, Bandai Namco may have slipped up and revealed its hand a little too early and shown us what the next <strong>Tales</strong> series remaster is.</p>
<p>As reported on <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/08/rumour-tales-of-xillia-leaked-as-the-next-tales-remaster">Push Square</a>, it looks like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/tales_of_xillia">Tales of Xillia</a> will be the next title getting the remaster treatment. Originally released on the PS3 in 2011 and 2013, the game has been stuck on the older console since, so fans should be pretty happy about this</p>
<p>So, how did it slip through the cracks, though? Well, it appears Bandai Namco Europe uploaded a video premiere titled 'Tales of Series News' which was due to go live on 18th August 2025, next Monday.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067kujhxi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Only a handful of people seem to have spotted the video before it was taken down — <a href="https://x.com/Lowedeltaa/status/1955925606274658555">Lowedeltaa on X</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tales/comments/1mpy3ur/the_next_tales_of_event_and_the_next_remaster/">a few people</a> on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/tales/comments/1mpzywl/tales_of_newsxillia_leak_youtube_screenshots/">Tales subreddit</a>.</p>

<p>Now, if you've been keeping an eye on the news, this likely isn't surprising, as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/rumour-tales-of-xillia-remastered-switch-release-spotted-online">a rating for a Xillia remaster was spotted online last summer</a></p>
<p>But, given the title of the supposed video, there might be more than just a remaster announcement coming. Also, we don't know if the remaster <em>is</em> Xillia — we secretly hope that if it is, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/tales_of_xillia_2">Xillia 2</a> is also part of the package.</p>
<p>We suppose we'll find out on Monday, though Gamescom Opening Night Live is the next day, so we're a little surprised the reveal isn't coming then...</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton has announced that later this year, it will wind down support for&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds&nbsp;</em>on PS4 and Xbox One, meaning that if you want to play the console versions of the game, you'll have to pick up a next-gen machine.</p>

<p>This news comes via an <a href="https://www.pubg.com/en/news/9005" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official post</a> on&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>website, in which Krafton confirms that support for the last-gen versions of its popular battle royale shooter will come to an end on November 13th.</p>

<p>Krafton describes this decision as "a necessary step towards aligning&nbsp;<em>PUBG Console&nbsp;</em>with current-gen consoles", and it should also help to "provide...players with a more stable gameplay environment on console", as well as ensuring "a smoother, more seamless experience with future updates".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pubg-ps4-xbox-one-support-ending-explosion.jpg?itok=gi3c0IQe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pubg-ps4-xbox-one-support-ending-explosion.jpg?itok=eVJj5-lM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>PUBG</em>'s PS4 and Xbox One versions will soon lose support.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Krafton, once this transition is complete, console players will see "improved visuals and more stable frame rates", and not only that, but ongoing crash issues should be resolved "through memory-related optimizations".</p>

<p>Since&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>is a live-service game, it probably won't shock you to learn that it won't be playable in single-player, either. Once support ends for the PS4 and Xbox One versions, that's it; they won't be playable or downloadable anymore.</p>

<p>If you're on PS5, you'll need to redownload&nbsp;<em>PUBG</em>'s new PS5 version once the transition happens, but if you're on Xbox Series X|S and you already have the game installed, you'll automatically get the new version thanks to Smart Delivery.</p>

<p>Once the transition happens,&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>will support 1080p at 60fps or 1440p at 30fps on Xbox Series S, while Series X and PS5 Pro will enjoy dynamic 4K resolution at 60fps. The base PS5 version will also hit 60fps, but at just 1440p resolution.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pubg-ps4-xbox-one-support-ending-swamp.jpg?itok=F7QS0HIo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pubg-ps4-xbox-one-support-ending-swamp.jpg?itok=5Z46HUbz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The newer console versions of&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>should look and play nicer, at least.</figcaption></figure><p>This news follows the announcement that the PC version of&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-pubg-anti-cheat-system" rel="nofollow">is getting new anti-cheat systems</a>, but that probably won't affect console players, since crossplay between console and PC isn't supported.</p>

<p>In any case, you can download and play&nbsp;<em>PUBG: Battlegrounds&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/578080/PUBG_BATTLEGROUNDS/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP5082-CUSA14081_00-PTSBUN0000000000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/pubg-battlegrounds/c0mn5dn8kr3f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and the PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game will become unavailable on November 13th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-collaborations-survey-pokemon-star-wars-1851787277"><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>‘s</span></a><span> hero design philosophy has changed since the sequel launched in 2022. With the exception of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-ramattra-dive-comp-update-season-2-patch-1849870329"><span>Ramattra</span></a><span>, the robotic omnic tank who was the fourth character added to the new roster, every other hero Blizzard has added to the hero shooter has been a human, most of whom are probably considered conventionally attractive. It’s a far cry from the game that once greeted players each time they booted up the game with a speech from a talking gorilla, but it turns out, this isn’t just a coincidence; it’s a result of a new design philosophy Blizzard has adopted since </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span> launched.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/overwatch-2-wuyang-story-background-wuxing-university/"><i><span>Polygon</span></i></a><span>, </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span> lead concept artist Daryl Tan explained that the team has been prioritizing characters they believe fans can make a “deeper connection with,” and that means they’re moving away from the “oddball” characters like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-wrecking-ball-rework-season-10-patch-notes-1851407454"><span>Wrecking Ball, a robot-piloting hamster</span></a><span>, or even Ramattra, who is a central piece in </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>‘s fiction, but is an outlier in the design philosophy the team has adopted.</span></p> <p><span>“We always will approach making </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span> heroes… aspirational in some sense,” Tan told </span><i><span>Polygon</span></i><span>. “They’re aspirational in their physique, in their expertise at what they do, and just being really cool heroes that we can look up to.”</span></p>

 <p><span>That doesn’t mean that there will never be a non-human character in </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span> again. Tan says that there is some “exciting stuff down the road” in this regard that the team will “sprinkle” into the roster in between these more “aspirational” heroes. That being said, the quote has got a lot of </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>fans talking, with some viewing it as a smoking gun revealing underlying philosophies they’ve long suspected given the way characters have been rolled out and treated in recent years.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>has a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-kiriko-mercy-venture-reaper-season-12-skins-1851626893"><span>long-debated problem</span></a><span> with only a handful of characters in its 44-hero roster getting the lion’s share of cosmetics. Heroes like Kiriko, Mercy, and lately Juno have received a plethora of skins each season, while less popular heroes have been in a drought. As Blizzard has started releasing more conventionally attractive heroes who receive skins at an abnormally high rate compared to others, some characters have come to be seen as skin-selling cash cows rather than something that adds to the world or live game. If those are the characters whose skins sell, it certainly makes sense that Blizzard would keep giving them new outfits, but it does mean that Mercy mains </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-sakura-mercy-skin-bundle-price-kiriko-shop-2000617479"><span>shoulder an unnecessary burden</span></a><span> of setting the tone for what Blizzard can get away with in terms of cosmetic prices. For some </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>fans, Blizzard saying that it’s prioritizing “aspirational” character design over quirkier characteristics seems like a thinly veiled way of saying it is prioritizing conventionally attractive heroes who people will buy skins for. It has fans debating whether or not long-established and beloved characters like the omnic Zenyatta or gorilla scientist Winston would have made the cut 10 years later.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is the first thing you see when you start Overwatch for the first time btw <a href="https://t.co/2R6FgBXC5X">https://t.co/2R6FgBXC5X</a> <a href="https://t.co/UrtUKwQr6A">pic.twitter.com/UrtUKwQr6A</a></p> <p>— Banjo (@banjonosequemas) <a href="https://twitter.com/banjonosequemas/status/1955758886411186681?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">To me it's actually getting boring and isn't "relatable" or "aspirational" at all to see the same conventionally attractive heroes with the same physique be pumped out by every live service game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re one of the many people who’ve pre-ordered Battlefield 6 and want to know what bonuses you’re getting, I hear you. The Tombstone Pack has been well-advertised at this point. So let’s see what you get and if there are any other handy bonuses to keep an eye out for.</p>



<p>Pre-order bonuses have been an incentive for years. Secure your copy early for your peace of mind, which makes the pre-order numbers look good for the company. It’s a win-win for all. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-battlefield-6-beta-rewards-twitch-drops-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> has its own litany of pre-order bonuses guaranteed to get you a boost across its multiplayer modes.</p>



<p>This guide has everything you need to know about BF6 pre-order bonuses, so let’s jump in faster than you’d jump into a free plane you know full well you have no chance of flying.</p>



<h2 id="h-everything-included-in-battlefield-6-pre-order-bonus-tombstone-pack">Everything Included in Battlefield 6 Pre-Order Bonus Tombstone Pack</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Let’s do this, boys. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Battlefield 6’s Tombstone Pack pre-order bonus includes skins, player cards, XP boosts, and other player and weapon cosmetics.</strong></p>



<p>Check out the complete list of <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield 6</a> Tombstone Pack bonuses here.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Bonus Name</th><th data-align="center">Description For Tombstone Pack Bonus</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Bandolier</td><td data-align="center">Weapon Charm</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Doomsayer</td><td data-align="center">Soldier Patch</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Express Delivery</td><td data-align="center">Weapon Sticker</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Fallen Heroes</td><td data-align="center">Player Card</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Gravedigger</td><td data-align="center">Soldier Skin</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Hatchet</td><td data-align="center">L110 Weapon Package</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Tombstone</td><td data-align="center">XP Boost Set</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>I think EA knows better than to offer pay-to-win features as pre-order bonuses—the Tombstone XP Boost Set possibly blurring that line slightly.</p>



<p>This is why pretty much everything on offer in the set is cosmetic-only. There’s no special gun that gives you an extra advantage or a camouflage skin hiding you away from prying eyes that you can’t unlock normally.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-battlefield-6-pre-order-bonuses">How to Get Battlefield 6 Pre-Order Bonuses</h2>



<p><strong>Simply pre-order any edition of Battlefield 6 before launch day to secure the Tombstone Pack rewards.</strong></p>



<p>There are no other extra rewards or bonuses. The Tombstone Pack is all you get; you need to earn the rest! Well, that is, unless you opt for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-phantom-edition-contents-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phantom Edition</a>, which comes with a lot more content. Otherwise, secure your pre-order and wait for your redeemable code.</p>



<p>A standard copy of Battlefield 6 costs $69.99, whereas the pricier Phantom Edition clocks in at $99.99.</p>

<p>Developer Sloclap has released full details for Rematch Patch 2, the second major patch for the game since its launch in June.</p>

<li>Improved network resolution and rollback on tackles</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where sometimes a player preparing a shot cannot be tackled</li>

<li><strong>Goalkeeper improvements</strong>
<ul>

<p>The Battlefield 6 Open Beta is back for a second, and final, weekend, and there’s even less time to dive into the game. If you want to maximize your enjoyment, it’s worth making some changes to create the best aim settings.</p>



<p>Whatever your game mode of choice, aiming is crucial to success in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=battlefield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>, and not having the best settings established can lead to losses in one-on-one battles. Therefore, it’s definitely worth delving into the settings to make changes.</p>



<p>That can be daunting, however, given the wide array of options available, so we’re here to help with a breakdown of the best settings to use.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-battlefield-6-open-beta-aim-settings">Best Battlefield 6 Open Beta Aim Settings</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Ready, aim, fire. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The best aim settings for the Battlefield 6 Open Beta may depend on individual preferences, and finding the sweet spot can be tricky.</strong></p>



<p>Fortunately, the community has been hard at work to find the best aim settings during the Open Beta so far and have shared their findings on social media. While you can tweak your own settings to find an approach you’re comfortable wise, I’d advise against it as it can be difficult to track and time in the Open Beta is limited.</p>



<p>Similar to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-battlefield-6-open-beta-graphic-settings/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best graphic settings</a>, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefinityGG/status/1953817537595981912/photo/4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BattlefinityGG</a> has provided the best aim settings I’ve seen so far. The full list of aim settings is detailed in the table below.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-change-battlefield-6-aim-settings">How to Change Battlefield 6 Aim Settings</h2>



<p><strong>It’s best to adjust your aim settings in Battlefield 6 in the main menu, before you get into a match, and this is done on the main landing page.</strong></p>



<p>To adjust your aim settings, follow these steps:</p>



<ol>
<li>Log in to the Battlefield 6 Open Beta.</li>



<li>Navigate to the Settings tab, marked by a gear cog. It’s after the Challenges tab.</li>



<li>Scroll to find the Gameplay and Mouse &amp; Keyboard settings.</li>



<li>Tweak to the desired input.</li>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ea-aware-matchmaking-issues-battlefield-6-open-beta/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-is-working-to-fix-battlefield-6-open-beta-matchmaking-issues-%E2%80%9Cas-soon-as-possible%E2%80%9D.1270137/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>If you're experiencing matchmaking issues with the Battlefield 6 Open Beta, you're not alone, as several players have reported being unable to get into matches as week two of the open beta kicked off today. EA is aware of the problem, and is working to solve it, though a fix has yet to be released.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1955909461945540643">In a post</a> on X (formerly Twitter) from the <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm">official Battlefield Comms account</a>, EA told players that "<em>The team is aware of ongoing matchmaking issues for some of our players when attempting to matchmake on playlists</em>. <em>We're actively investigating this and working towards a solve as soon as possible.</em>"</p>



<p>A dozen or so minutes later, the account posted an update, advising players to check that they are using the latest version of the Battlefield 6 Open Beta client, and that "<em>the team continues to assess</em>" the problem and is working to solve it. There's been no update since then as players continue to report issues.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Matchmaking Update 01 --</p><p>If you are currently experiencing matchmaking issues, please ensure that you have the most recent client update.</p><p>EA App: Repair functionality is available via the 3-dot button, and Repair.</p><p>The team continues to assess this. <a href="https://t.co/dy6jN88lMi">https://t.co/dy6jN88lMi</a></p></div>— Battlefield Comms (@BattlefieldComm) <a href="https://twitter.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1955912712535380005?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The only other updates from EA on issues with the beta have been regarding a separate problem with DLSS and DLAA not being available. For that problem, <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1955928357909975127">EA said that</a> "<em>The team have identified the root cause of this issue and are working to have this resolved and DLSS/DLAA active once again with the Battlefield Open Beta. We anticipate this to be resolved later today, and will update accordingly</em>."</p>



<p>Even with week two of the open beta kicking off with technical problems galore, it's arguably been a strong start for the beta. At the time of this writing, per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">SteamDB</a>, there are 385,680 people playing the beta on Steam alone. We'll see once the weekend properly kicks off if week two is of the beta is able to surpass week one's staggering 521,079 concurrent player count on just one platform.</p>



<p>Though EA would have to solve these matchmaking problems first. Hopefully, a fix is pushed before the end of the day.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-of-xillia-remaster-rumor</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tales-of-xillia-remaster-apparently-accidentally-confirmed.1270134/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It looks as though Bandai Namco may have just inadvertently confirmed a&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia&nbsp;</em>remaster, if a thumbnail for an upcoming YouTube premiere is anything to go by.</p>

<p>As spotted by X user <a href="https://x.com/lowedeltaa/status/1955925606274658555" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Lowedelta</a> (via ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/bandai-namco-seemingly-accidentally-confirms-tales-of-xillia-remaster-announcement-expected-august-18th.1269954/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Shona</a>), the YouTube thumbnail for an impending news video about the&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>series shows a screenshot from&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia</em>, depicting several of the game's characters having a conversation in one of its skits.</p>

<p>This, as Shona points out, may well be an error on Bandai Namco's part; rather than choosing a custom thumbnail for the livestream, the studio may instead have opted to allow YouTube to choose one, and the one it picked is from partway through the video.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tales-of-xillia-remaster-leaked-rumor-character.jpg?itok=QUQEoReI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tales-of-xillia-remaster-leaked-rumor-character.jpg?itok=ddS9sQwn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tales of Xillia&nbsp;</em>appears to be getting the remaster treatment.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not clear whether the potential remaster will include only the first game or&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia 2&nbsp;</em>as well, and we also don't know whether this will be the only project announced during the premiere or whether a brand new&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>game will be revealed too.</p>

<p>Either way, the video premieres on August 18th, so we won't have to wait too long to find out. It's a premiere, too, rather than a livestream, so you shouldn't have to wade through too much pre-announcement banter.</p>

<p>If a&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia&nbsp;</em>remaster is indeed on the cards, it would be consistent with Bandai Namco's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tales-series-remasters-regular" rel="nofollow">assertion back in December</a>&nbsp;that&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>series remasters would be coming "fairly consistently". Producer Yusuke Tomizawa said at the time that the studio intends to continue remastering games from the series "as much as possible".</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Tales of Xillia&nbsp;</em>itself, it's an ideal candidate for the remaster treatment; it was originally released on PS3 back in 2013, and it's never been released on any subsequent system, so it's currently impossible to play the game unless you already own it.</p>




<p>We'll have to wait and see what Bandai Namco has in store for the&nbsp;<em>Tales&nbsp;</em>series when its next news video premieres on Monday. Stay tuned.</p>

              <p>Batman Beyond and Static Shock are teaming up again, the spiritual successor to <em>Patapon</em> finally has a release date, and there’s always a bigger PC gaming handheld, apparently. It’s Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, culture, and other ephemera. But before we begin, there’s an important update. Our hoagie hero from earlier in the week? He was caught and charged with “forcefully” throwing a Subway sandwich at a U.S. Customs and Border Protection agent. So much for eating fresh.</p> <h2>Can your Switch 2 do this?</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000617743" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000617743"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000617743">Bilibili / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>No, no it can not. As reported <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/modder-builds-12-5-inch-4k-gaming-handheld-powered-by-nvidia-rtx-4090-laptop-gpu">by VideoCardz</a>, a DIY modder <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1EdrHYgEow/?spm_id_from=888.80997.embed_other.whitelist&amp;t=7.861177&amp;bvid=BV1EdrHYgEow">posting on Bilibili</a> took a RTX 4090 laptop, stripped it down, and repurposed it into a handheld. It sports a 12.5-inch display and a Core i9 processor, plus 64GB of DDR5 memory. The existing cooling system apparently vents enough heat to keep the GPU below 160 degrees. I don’t think this one is going to win any awards for battery life, but running <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> and other PS5 games at 4K in your hands is no small feat. I’m mostly impressed with the appearance, which has a certain appeal despite being closer to a contestant on <em>Robot Wars</em> than a mass market device. It makes Acer’s Nitro Blaze 11 <a href="https://kotaku.com/astro-nitro-blaze-11-steam-deck-ces-2025-size-handheld-1851734392">look almost normal by comparison</a>.</p> <h2>On whether <em>Tekken 8</em> will get ported</h2> <p>With <em>Street Fighter 6</em> being a launch game for Switch 2 (and a decent version at that), it seems like a no brainer for Bandai Namco’s 3D fighter to make the jump as well. Is a <em>Tekken 8</em> port already in the works or still something fans will have to wait for? “It’s an interesting option, and not totally off the table,” series director Katsuhiro Harada said at Evo earlier this month (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-switch-2">via <em>Eurogamer</em></a>). “But it would require a lot of work on the game to get it running on that hardware.”</p>

 <p>But it sounds like Harada still hasn’t made a decision. “From a business standpoint, [the Switch 2] is doing quite well, so it would be a very good business decision if you’re trying to get a bigger audience. But the amount of work that would have to be done on the game makes it not a very easy decision. At this point in time, there are no…(laughs)…there is nothing to announce.”</p> <p>While <i>Tekken Tag Tournament 2</i> was on Wii U, no numbered entry in the series has ever appeared on a Nintendo platform. Harada also recently said he <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/harada-feels-like-making-tekken-tag-tournament-3-wouldnt-make-much-sense-and-that-tekken-needs-a-tag-mode-instead/">doesn’t think it would make sense</a> to make a new<em> Tekken Tag</em>, with it being more practical to just add that as a mode to the existing game.</p> <h2>Starbucks asks customers in Korea to stop treating it like an office</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ko" dir="ltr">❗️어메이징 스타벅스❗️</p> <p>스타벅스 코리아 본사는 매장에서 개인용 데스크톱 컴퓨터를 비롯해 프린터·칸막이·멀티탭의 사용을 제한키로 결정하고, 전국 매장에 공지를 했답니다.</p> <p>멀티탭을 막 써서 컴퓨터나 프린터를 쓰고, 테이블 위에 가림막까지 설치한다니! </p> <p>너무 심한 거 아닌가요? <a href="https://t.co/ueZRyNrifj">pic.twitter.com/ueZRyNrifj</a></p> <p>— UNICON 𝕏 (@UNICONTSLA) <a href="https://twitter.com/UNICONTSLA/status/1953286006033236483?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>South Korea is famous for its PC bang internet cafes, but what if you have the equipment already and just need a place to plug in? According to <a href="https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10550038"><em>The Korea Herald</em></a> (via <em><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/gaming-pcs/just-a-tap-water-please-starbucks-korea-asks-customers-to-stop-bringing-desktop-pcs-printers-and-pop-up-dividers-into-its-coffee-shops-for-a-cheeky-work-session/">PC Gamer</a></em>), customers have been bringing full-on office setups to their local Starbucks, complete in some extreme cases with printers and cubicle dividers. As a result, Starbucks stores in the country have been putting out gentle notices on tables reminding patrons that it’s not a free WeWork space. I’m going to try to throw my next LAN party at Burger King.</p>

 <h2><em>Tales</em> news is on the way, including a likely remaster of <i><b>Xillia</b></i></h2> <p>Bandai Namco Europe apparently <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1955973635589427262">let slip a thumbnail</a> on YouTube for an upcoming showcase seemingly scheduled for August 18 that would include updates on the <em>Tales</em> RPG series. Included in the quickly removed screenshot was a reference to a rumored <em>Tales of Xillia</em> remaster. The 2013 game came out at the tail end of the PS3’s lifecycle and <a href="http://e-kotaku-review-1146006980/">was largely well-received by fans,</a> minus some really clunky English voice acting.</p> <h2><em>Batman/Static: Beyond</em> is a six-issue series coming this fall</h2>   <p>Comics are still one of the hardest mediums to keep up with, but anything <em>Batman Beyond</em>-related always has my attention. So I was excited to see DC <a href="https://www.dc.com/blog/2025-08-13/dc-announces-batman-static-beyond">announced a new limited-run series</a> with Terry McGinnis and Static Shock’s Virgil Hawkins teaming up for the second time to face new techno-infused threats together. And that was before I realized that <em>Kotaku</em> alum Evan Narcisse was writing it with artist Nikolas Draper-Ivey!</p>

 <p>“This story is intended to be a commentary on our overreliance on technology and the imminent dangers becoming complacent and too comfortable using AI to substitute our own imagination and human ingenuity,” the artist said. “We now use our watches to find our phones, we use our phones to connect to everything else. We don’t rely on our own memories. We rely on technology to remember for us. That deeply concerns me. I worry that we are getting to a point where if all these things were to be suddenly taken away from us in an instant—at the rate we’re going now, humanity will be at a huge disadvantage.”</p> <h2><em>Ratatan</em> finally has a real release date</h2> <p>The<em> Patapon</em> remaster came out earlier this summer <a href="https://kotaku.com/kotaku-games-to-play-patapon-donkey-kong-shadow-mgs3-1851786599">and was great</a>, but what I’ve really been waiting for is the spiritual successor from the original designer himself. Crowdfunded project <em>Ratatan</em> will deliver that when it comes to Early Access on PC on September 19. There are so many ways the game could fail to live up to the hype, but I’m looking forward to seeing what creator Hiroyuki Kotani has been cooking up either way.</p> <h2>ICYMI</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/alien-earth-review-fx-tv-show-science-fiction-2000617442">Here’s why you don’t want to miss out on <em>Alien: Earth</em></a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-old-country-review-is-it-good-worth-playing-2000617529">Read <em>Kotaku</em>‘s review of <em>Mafia: The Old Country</em> to find out why it’s “a deal you probably can refuse.”</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-gooner-skins-swimsuit-interview-psylocke-emma-frost-2000617518"><em>Marvel Rivals</em> still isn’t beating the “gooner game” allegations</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="How to ALL Hit Expedition 33" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DaVCFdzGq-A?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>You’ve heard about <em>Dark Souls</em> no-hit runs, but YouTuber&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ymfah/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">ymfah</a> decided to pull off an “all-hits” playthrough of <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, completing the game without parrying or dodging a single attack.

<p>It has been confirmed that Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater’s multiplayer mode, Fox Hunt, will not support crossplay. </p>



<p>Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater is scheduled for release on August 28, 2025, as a remake of the acclaimed 2004 game. Unfortunately, it has been announced that the highly anticipated multiplayer mode, Fox Hunt, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eaters-fox-hunt-mode-wont-be-available-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not be available at launch</a>. It has now been confirmed that this mode will not support crossplay.</p>

The post states that supported platforms include PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam. However, “crossplay between different platforms will not be supported.” Many players in the comment section have expressed disappointment over the news. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Crossplay has become an integral feature in multiplayer gaming nowadays and a staple for most new releases. Crossplay enables players to enjoy a game with friends who use different platforms. Moreover, crossplay allows players to interact with a brand-new player base. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater’s Fox Hunt mode is an online mode where players engage in tactical hide-and-seek. The game mode is set in the same universe as the MGS3 remake, and players will utilize elements unique to Metal Gear, including camouflage and survival.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/konamis-efootball-gets-major-version-5-0-update/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/konami%E2%80%99s-efootball-gets-major-version-5-0-update.1270116/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Konami has released a major new update for eFootball across all platforms. EFootball version 5.0 launches on Thursday, and features stadium customization and roughly 80 gameplay changes.</p>



<p>Regarding stadium customization, <a href="https://www.konami.com/efootball/en-us/page/v5/versioninfo_v5-00" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">players will now be able</a> to <strong>“freely combine various elements, including stadium colours, choreographies and Giant Props, to create your own unique home arena.”</strong> There’s also a new skill known as “Link-up Play” for certain managers. </p>



<p>According to Konami, <strong>“Through a Link-up Play, two players can combine in special ways and receive a boost to their abilities at specific moments. It will activate based on certain conditions, as the two players known as the Centerpiece and Key Man must each play in certain positions and have the required Playing Styles.”</strong></p>



<p>Aside from the new features, there are dozens of gameplay changes for players. You can check them all out below. And be sure to let us know what you think of the update in the comments below.</p>







<p><strong>Dribbling</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Made adjustments so that when entering a command in a direction away from the defender, that opponent is less likely to make an attempt on the ball.</li>



<li>Added new motions used when an opponent approaches from the side, ensuring that they compete for the ball naturally without sticking to the opponent. This will improve the sense of fairness and control when trying to dribble past a defender.</li>



<li>Added new motions used when evading a defender who competes for the ball from the left or the right. Made adjustments so that players with high Balance can dribble past opponents more easily.</li>



<li>Adjusted how acceleration changes while dribbling so that, at low speeds, players can accelerate quickly and make swift movements, while at higher speeds, they will accelerate gradually.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that the “Dribbling” and “Acceleration” Player Stats affect how quickly players accelerate while dribbling.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Feints</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Added new motions for the Marseille Turn and Chop Turn to improve the sense of control.</li>



<li>Removed some motions for special Marseille Turns.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Trapping</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Made corrections to alleviate the problem where players are unable to receive passes.</li>



<li>Made corrections to alleviate the problem where the ball hits the player’s body again immediately after they trap it.</li>



<li>Made corrections to alleviate the problem where the player traps a ball from midair, but it takes a fair amount of time to take full control of the ball.</li>



<li>Added some trapping motions to alleviate the problem where players move too slowly after trapping the ball.</li>



<li>Made corrections to alleviate the problem where the ball cannot be trapped in the direction entered.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so players move to a position where it is easy to trap a ball in midair with their leg.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Shooting</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Made adjustments so that players who have the “Non-Dominant Leg Precision” Player stat at maximum and possess both the “Outside Curler” and “Blitz Curler” skills will prioritize performing a “Blitz Curler” with their non-dominant leg rather than an “Outside Curler” with their dominant leg, when possible.</li>



<li>Fixed the issue where players shoot directly with a kick or header, but that shot is well off target.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Heading</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Made adjustments so that players move closer to opponents when competing for a header.</li>



<li>Added new heading motions to help players head the ball more suitably.</li>



<li>Made adjustments to the accuracy of near and far-post heading shots directed to the left or right.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Kicking</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Made corrections to alleviate the problem where players fail to kick the ball due to catching their other leg in the process.</li>



<li>Adjusted decision-making so that kicks are canceled based on the situation, which will alleviate the problem where players kick an opponent.</li>



<li>Fixed the issue where players send a low pass from a set piece, but the accuracy is calculated using a Player Stat not intended for that type of kick.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that an early cross can now be sent to a position closer to the goal.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that the increase in kicking speed occurring after entering a Knock-on command is also applied when kicking from the outside of the cleat.</li>



<li>Made corrections to alleviate the problem where a player attempts a kick, but the ball hits them instead and the kick is canceled.</li>



<li>Made corrections to alleviate the problem where players stumble and cannot kick when competing for the ball.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Defense</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Made corrections to alleviate the problem where players win the ball but cannot take possession of it because, when moving towards the ball, they get stuck to an opponent.</li>



<li>Added new sliding tackle motions to improve the sense of control.</li>



<li>Adjusted how certain motions are shown so that players can touch the ball during a sliding tackle without committing a foul.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that the “Tackling” Player Stat has a greater effect on sliding tackles.</li>



<li>Made adjustments to acceleration for both defenders and attackers away from the ball so that, at low speeds, they can accelerate quickly and make swift movements, while at higher speeds, they will accelerate gradually.</li>



<li>Adjusted the base movement speed when using directional inputs to improve the sense of control when moving players in that way.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that players rarely attempt standing tackles automatically while the ball is far away, unless the Pressure command is given. Use commands based on the situation. To win the ball aggressively, enter the Pressure command, or to slow down an opponent, try the Match-up command.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so it is easier to attempt a tackle while running alongside an opponent.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so it is easier to make contact with the ball when attempting to block a low pass or low through ball.</li>



<li>Fixed the issue where it is difficult to block or defend against direct kick feints while using the Match-up command.</li>



<li>Made corrections to alleviate the problem where players stumble greatly in unusual ways when attempting a Shoulder Charge.</li>



<li>Players will now start defending more quickly when play switches from attack to defense, depending on their “Defensive Engagement” Player Stat.</li>



<li>Adjusted the penalty that prevents the active player near the ball from moving immediately after losing possession. This will allow them to keep moving depending on the situation.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so players do not come to a sudden stop immediately after losing the ball. They will now continue moving depending on the situation.</li>



<li>The “Defensive Engagement” Player Stat will now affect the timing at which a defender will start pressing if they are positioned behind an opponent who just received a pass.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so forwards take positions a little deeper in their own half when their team is pinned in by the opposing attack.</li>



<li>Fixed the issue where two forwards take up almost the same position when their team is pinned in by the opposing attack.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that players with high Defensive Engagement are more likely to run back at full speed to defend their goal.</li>



<li>Made adjustments to reaction speed due to a problem where AI-controlled players covering the goal clear shots with extreme quickness.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that AI-controlled players with high Aggression will quickly close the distance on an opponent when applying pressure.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that, while using the Pressure or Call for Pressure command, players with high Defensive Awareness will track opponents more easily.</li>



<li>Made adjustments to reaction speed due to a problem where, while using the Pressure or Call for Pressure command, players responded with extreme quickness to an opponent’s dribbling or feint.</li>



<li>Made adjustments to alleviate a problem where, while using the Pressure or Call for Pressure commands, defenders do not turn properly towards the ball when the ball holder is neither performing a Finesse Dribble nor touching the ball while dribbling. Defenders are now more likely to face the right direction in these situations.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that, while using the Pressure or Call for Pressure command, players with high Defensive Awareness will have greater success following ballcarriers who perform a feint.</li>



<li>Expanded the range of movement applied when an active player stands between the ballcarrier and the goal while using the Match-up command. This adjustment will make it easier to place the player in a selected location.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that, while using the Match-up command, players will move more smoothly according to directional inputs, as long as they are moving within a correctable range.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that, while using the Match-up command, the game will respond better to movement commands entered immediately after switching the cursor manually.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that Call for Pressure will be canceled if used for a certain length of time and the players applying pressure are positioned far from the ball.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Offense</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Made adjustments so that players’ acceleration while running is affected not only by the “Acceleration” Player Stat, but also by the “Offensive Awareness” Player Stat.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that, instead of running at full speed, players will move at 70% of that speed depending on the situation.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that when running from a deep position behind the opposition’s back line, players will start decelerating depending on the situation.</li>



<li>Reduced the frequency at which players run at full speed when moving to a forward position while on the attack.</li>



<li>Made adjustments to positioning to reduce the likelihood that players in the defensive line will move to an attacking area when the ball is bouncing around and no one has control, which would leave the opponent with a great chance to counter if they win the ball.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that players turn their bodies appropriately when running in front of goal looking to receive a cross.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that when Team Playstyle is set to “Possession Game”, right and left backs will take higher positions during buildup play unless they have the “Defensive Full-back” Playing Style.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that when Team Playstyle is set to “Possession Game”, central and defensive midfielders will take slightly higher positions during buildup play unless they have the “Anchor Man” Playing Style.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that when the team’s back line has the ball, a center back with the “Build Up” Playing Style will move to a suitable position where it is easy to receive a pass.</li>



<li>Made adjustments to alleviate the problem where a player coming to support the play and receive a pass is hidden behind an opposing defender. This will allow users to pass the ball around more smoothly.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that, depending on the situation, players deep in midfield will move to somewhat higher positions to support passing during buildup play.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Goalkeeper</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Added new ball throwing motions to speed up the goalkeeper’s movements before they release the ball.</li>



<li>Fixed the issue where the goalkeeper chases after a ball that is about to go out but then stops moving completely.</li>



<li>Fixed the issue where the goalkeeper rushes out to defend against a dribbling attacker but then stops moving completely.</li>



<li>Made corrections to alleviate the problem where the goalkeeper cannot catch a high bouncing ball in time as it is falling and it then goes over their head.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that when rushing out to defend against a dribbling attacker, the goalkeeper makes more suitable movements when trying to block a shot.</li>



<li>Fixed the issue where the goalkeeper turns towards their goal and attempts a leg save while a teammate is in possession of the ball near the goal line.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that the goalkeeper can no longer catch balls for the purpose of wasting time, such as when the ball is headed back to them following a goal kick, goalkeeper throw-in, punt or a pass from a teammate involving a feint or trapping play.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>AI</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Made adjustments so that when a player makes a kick and no longer has the ball, but an opponent makes a sliding tackle immediately after that, it is more likely that the player will make motions that help them avoid that tackle.</li>



<li>Adjusted the difficulty for each Match Level’s AI according to changes in game balance.</li>



<li>Adjusted how players’ Stamina levels during matches affect the “Speed” Player Stat.</li>



<li>Fixed the issue where the cursor will not leave the kicker after they take a corner kick.</li>



<li>Made corrections to alleviate the problem where a player makes a cross, but the cursor switches to a teammate other than the target, preventing the user from making the intended play. The cursor will now remain on the target of the pass in most cases.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that when an AI-controlled player takes on an opponent in possession of the ball, the higher their Aggression the closer they will get to the ballcarrier.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that when an AI-controlled player takes on an opponent in possession of the ball, the higher their Defensive Engagement the faster they will move in front of the ballcarrier.</li>



<li>Made corrections to alleviate the problem where, after the cursor switches, the player automatically moves to a position other than the one selected. This improvement will help ensure that players will defend as instructed.</li>



<li>Fixed the issue where, after the goalkeeper catches the ball and falls on the ground, an AI-controlled player moves near the keeper in unusual ways.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Controls</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed the issue where, after losing the ball, players could win it back immediately by making a sliding tackle, standing tackle, or shoulder charge. It is no longer possible to carry out such commands directly after losing possession.</li>



<li>Fixed the issue where, when using the Pressure command while no player has possession of the ball, that command stops working temporarily.</li>



<li>Fixed the issue where, after entering a shooting command during a direct free kick, Off the Ball Controls commands are carried out.</li>



<li>Made corrections to alleviate the problem where, when attempting a one-two pass, the cursor switches in unintended ways.</li>



<li>Made adjustments so that when the cursor automatically switches to a defender or a potential defender is selected, the cursor will likely move to a player in a position where it is easier to challenge the opponent, depending on the situation.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Fouls</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed the issue where a player makes a sliding tackle with excessive contact and it clearly seems like a foul, but no foul is called.</li>



<li>Fixed the issue where a player in an offside position becomes involved in the play immediately after the ball goes to an opponent, but no offsides is called.</li>



<li>Made corrections to alleviate the problem where a player makes contact and it clearly seems like a foul, but no foul is called.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Cutscenes</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Added new motions to the reactions of players while the ball is not in play, giving them more realistic movements.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Smart Assist</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Made adjustments so that, during a Stunning Shot, the gauge level is affected by skills owned by that player. This will make it easier for players to put their skills to use.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Other Gameplay Enhancements</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Made changes to cancel the display of UI information shown at the feet of players applying pressure after an opponent enters the Call for Pressure command during an online match.</li>



<li>A variety of other adjustments have been made to improve the overall match experience.</li>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-jurassic-park-survival-gameplay-showcased-in-bts-feature.1270068/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/saber-interactive-is-making-a-new-game-based-on-one-of-hasbros-tentpole-franchises/">Saber Interactive</a> and NBC Universal have finally shown a little bit more about the first-person horror game that takes players back 65 million years, Jurassic Park: Survival. In a behind-the-scenes feature that includes commentary from both Saber and Universal's teams on how the studios worked to recreate the park from the original film into a game.</p>



<p>The feature provides details on the game's protagonist, Dr. Maya Joshi, the work that went into ensuring animations for the dinosaurs were as accurate as possible, and how Saber has been leaning on its collaboration with Universal to be as detailed as it can when it comes to recreating every element from the first film that fans of the series would recognize.</p>



<p>In between all that, there are a few very short looks at the first-person gameplay, though the feature doesn't dig any deeper into the different gameplay elements we see, like a handheld map and compass Dr. Joshi is using to try and get around the island, and what appears to be a noise meter, helping her to know how loud she's being in any given situation.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Jurassic Park: Survival | Behind the Scenes Featurette" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u4eXQMah9C4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>All the footage shown is marked as 'pre-alpha,' though even in this unfinished state, it is already beginning to look impressive. That said, it's likely a disappointing sign for anyone who is anxious to get their hands on Jurassic Park: Survival, since this is the first look at the game we've had since its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzJ9gf-TbWc">December 2023 announcement trailer,</a> and this kind of a feature makes it feel like the game's development is progressing slowly.</p>



<p>But that's just worried speculation as someone who is very much looking forward to the final product. Jurassic Park is a series that videogame horror fans have long recognized as a good foundation for a horror game. Hopefully, whenever the game does come out (cause there's still no confirmed release window, let alone release date), it's able to deliver on the experience of just how harrowing it would be to be trapped on Isla Nublar.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1s-new-beta-update-adds-a-rival-cartel-and-more/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/schedule-1%E2%80%99s-new-beta-update-adds-a-rival-cartel-and-more.1270065/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Schedule 1 has just received a new Steam beta update, which adds a rival cartel, the Benzies Family, along with some additional content. </p>



<p>Players have been patiently waiting for a new Schedule 1 content update for some time now, and it has finally arrived. The developer hosted a community vote in June, where they asked players what content they wanted in the next update: Rival Cartel, Police Expansion, or Shrooms. Everyone wanted a rival cartel. </p>



<h2 id="h-schedule-1-welcomes-the-benzies-family-cartel-in-the-new-update">Schedule 1 Welcomes the Benzies Family Cartel in the New Update</h2>



<p>The game’s cartel update, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/546742887822393994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">version 0.4.0</a>, is now available through the Steam beta branch of Schedule 1. The developer had expected to release this update last month, but underestimated the work required to complete it. At the same time, they have been working simultaneously on official Steam Deck Support and the Console Port for Schedule 1, which is scheduled to arrive later this year. Let’s get into the new update below. </p>



<h4 id="h-schedule-1-rival-cartel-features-and-interactions">Schedule 1 Rival Cartel Features and Interactions</h4>



<p>Benzies Family is the new powerful rival cartel that can be found in Schedule 1’s Hyland point. Players will be able to encounter them after unlocking a few customers at Westville. </p>



<p>The interactions with the Benzies’ family include cartel-player deals when both are trusted, ambushes, dealer robberies, dead drop theft, and cartel-customer deals. Seems like the cartel can be helpful when truced and painful when not. </p>



<h4 id="h-new-schedule-1-property-the-manor">New Schedule 1 Property: ‘The Manor’</h4>



<p>Next is Schedule 1’s new purchasable property, the Hyland Manor. However, to purchase this property, players must first complete the Benzies family storyline. Many might recall that a few months ago, a player <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-player-has-stumbled-upon-a-potential-upcoming-property/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered</a> a brand-new property in the game called ‘The Manor’ (see the similarities there?). Moreover, this was by far the largest property in the game, featuring four bedrooms on the first floor and two spacious reception rooms on the ground floor.</p>



<h4 id="h-new-schedule-1-weapons-vehicles-cosmetics-and-more">New Schedule 1 Weapons, Vehicles, Cosmetics, and More</h4>



<ul>
<li>That’s not all, the latest update includes a pump shotgun and shotgun shells to use with it. </li>



<li>A new vehicle called ‘Hotbox’ has been added, which is very much on brand. </li>



<li>Regarding cosmetics, three new hairstyles have been added: close buzzcut, Tony, and long slicked back. </li>



<li>Three new commands have been added: ‘setgravitymultiplier’, ‘setregionunlocked’, and ‘forcesleep’. </li>



<li>Lastly, players will find more loading screen hints after this update. </li>
</ul>



<h4 id="h-schedule-1-tweaks-and-improvements">Schedule 1 Tweaks and Improvements  </h4>



<p>Several changes have been made to improve the gameplay experience. </p>



<ul>
<li>Players will now find that each region has a ‘cartel influence’ level associated with it; you must bring that down to progress to the new region. </li>



<li>Players can now view the dialogue of other players talking to NPCs in multiplayer. </li>



<li>Deals will be cancelled when the assigned dealer is dead/unconscious. </li>



<li>Unconscious NPCs that are dropped in the ocean will be killed. </li>



<li>Dead/unconscious NPCs and police can be pickpocketed. </li>



<li>Once a customer is attacked, they will not place any orders with the player for 72 hours. </li>



<li>The braking properties of all vehicles have been adjusted.</li>



<li>Non-police NPCs have been given ranged weapons. </li>



<li>Police and NPCs can now “ometimes predict future target position instead of pathing directly to the target.”</li>



<li>Flashlight brightness has been adjusted. </li>



<li>Several minor scripts have been refactored. </li>
</ul>



<h4 id="h-bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h4>



<ul>
<li>Fixed various mislabellings in employee tutorial quests.</li>



<li>Fixed two light beams being visible when the flashlight is equipped.</li>



<li>Fixed scuffed NPC ragdoll LODs/culling.</li>



<li>Fixed some missing walls at Hyland Medical.</li>



<li>Fixed third-person recoil animation for the M1911 and Revolver.</li>



<li>Fixed the networth calculator algorithm, which did not factor in some item quantities.</li>



<li>Fixed vehicle impacts doing too much damage to NPCs.</li>



<li>Fixed some missing fonts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-schedule-1-is-getting-graffiti-soon">Schedule 1 is Getting Graffiti Soon</h2>



<p>The developer for Schedule 1 posted a new video on <a href="https://x.com/Tyler_TVGS/status/1955953753426944131" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), stating that graffiti could be included in the next beta patch or the one after. </p>
