		<p>Overnight, Grasshopper Manufacture had its own mini showcase in which it announced that its action game Romeo Is A Dead Man will be released on February 11th. To mark the announcement, a brand new trailer for the game was released, and it is as strange as you would expect from the mind of Suda51 and the team at Grasshopper Manufacture.</p>
<p><iframe title="ROMEO IS A DEAD MAN - Release Date Trailer / 『ロミオ・イズ・ア・デッドマン』発売日発表トレーラー" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ceog9nU0ucs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Romeo Is A Dead Man’s story set up is a bit wild too. Space-time has been shattered and just as Romeo is about to die he is saved by the Dead Gear Life Support System, which turns him into cyborg. He is then recruited to the FBI’s Space-Time Police to hunt down criminals taking advantage of the chaos, while also on a mission to find his girlfriend Juliet. Romeo and Juliet. Get it?</p>
<p>Suda51’s last game was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/27/no-more-heroes-3-review/">No More Heroes 3</a>, of which Nick said, “No More Heroes 3 shines with its fourth-wall-breaking self-awareness, zany characters and stunningly slick combat. It’s not afraid to be what it is, Suda 51 and his team delivering a great instalment to the franchise that welcomes us to the Garden of Insanity.”</p>

<p>Romeo Is&nbsp; A Dead Man will launch on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

            <guid>1374271</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr"><em>Men In Black</em> was an absolute highlight of the 90s and early 2000s entertainment. Threading the needle perfectly between pop culture, conspiracy, and digital and practical effects, it was a world that felt believable because it was just close enough to our own with a bit of fantasy. Coatsink has sought to bring back that magic with <em>Men In Black: Most Wanted</em>, an <em>MIB </em>VR adventure set in the 90s as you take on the role of Agent I, working to stop a new alien threat coming to earth.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Agent 'I Don't Remember'</h2><p dir="ltr"><em>Men In Black: Most Wanted</em> opens as you come to consciousness, having accidentally neuralyzed yourself. Being quickly surrounded by aliens, you have to quickly make your way back to your car, and the MIB headquarters to be debriefed.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/men-in-black-most-wanted-shooting-range.jpg?itok=lfS0GJeF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1069" height="1079">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/men-in-black-most-wanted-shooting-range.jpg?itok=4QJj6stu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1069" height="1079">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">Here, you learn of a plot for Aliens to slowly invade the Earth, while you know that there's a grander conspiracy. At this time, the only activity you've heard of is some small-time smugglers. The plot thickens further as you're told that the only way you could have been ambushed in the way you were… would be if there was a mole in the MIB.</p><p dir="ltr">Armed with the knowledge of an alien to track down at a Motel, and the common sense to keep your mission a secret, you head out to begin your mission to topple this alien invasion.</p><p dir="ltr">From here, your adventure takes you to a variety of interesting locations, such as a dockyard or office building, where you enter under the guise of an inspector or someone with a meeting before uncovering the aliens hiding in plain sight.</p><p dir="ltr">I was a huge fan of the mission formula. Each mission takes you through investigation segments, where you explore the environment, stay away from suspicious eyes, and make your way deeper into any of the facilities. You'll normally be searching for clues related to alien activity, access cards, or solutions to other smaller puzzles to make your way deeper in.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/men-in-black-most-wanted-environmental-puzzle.jpg?itok=KuY3U1Uv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1070" height="1079">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/men-in-black-most-wanted-environmental-puzzle.jpg?itok=LIfx4EAx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1070" height="1079">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">The exploration sections weren't difficult; they reminded me of action-adventure games from the PS2 era, but getting to complete them in VR added a new sense of fun. Something that would feel basic in a 2D video game, like opening a few drawers without being spotted for a keycard, added a new sense of tension when you had to physically spin around to check and make sure the coast was clear.</p><p dir="ltr">Once you've completed some puzzles, you'll ultimately end up in an alien base where you'll be ducking energy blasts and taking out aliens before they take you out. There are all of the classic hallmarks of an arcadey shooter, with ways to take out enemies from stealth and giant red barrels to shoot, all culminating in some kind of boss encounter.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Walk Like An MIB Agent</h2><p dir="ltr">The controls for <em>Men In Black: Most Wanted</em> are nice and intuitive. Moving with the left stick and pivoting with the right, your health bar is on your wristwatch, and at any time, you can pull up your mission status by bringing your left hand to your temple.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/men-in-black-most-wanted-bug-view.jpg?itok=LccTuDbQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1076" height="1079">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/men-in-black-most-wanted-bug-view.jpg?itok=Ve8nUxxE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1076" height="1079">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">Your wristwatch is also where you can pull out and store your equipment. The stowing of items is partially to help keep everything in a single place to pull from, but it also adds to the gameplay, as MIB tech will be investigated by onlookers. Keeping it stowed means more effort to get out, but you fly under the radar.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Men In Black: Most Wanted</em> really lets you go through the whole experience of a MIB agent, showing up to a location with some made up name and agency, lets you investigate for clues, and if an onlooker gets too suspicious, you get to neuralize them.</p><p dir="ltr">Quite nicely, each level is also only ~40-50 minutes, depending on how stumped you get by the puzzles. I found that this was the perfect length for me for a single session before I started feeling any kind of adverse effects from so much running, ducking, and shooting in VR.</p><h2 dir="ltr">An Agent Is Only As Good As His Tools</h2><p dir="ltr">As you progress through each level, you earn more and more tools that become relevant to the next mission. Early on, I was unsurprised by the abilities I got, like a glove that let me move metal objects around regardless of their weight. This leans heavily into VR-friendly object movement as you just raise a hand and grip to move a metal box or vent grate off the wall.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/men-in-black-most-wanted-gun-combat.jpg?itok=4hXDGhAA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1072" height="1079">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/men-in-black-most-wanted-gun-combat.jpg?itok=7itPTuyS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1072" height="1079">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">The tool that I loved the most was the spider-like robot that can walk on walls and short-circuit electricity. You can pluck it from your inventory and lob it in any direction or through an appropriately sized gap. Once the robot sets itself up, you raise your right hand to your head to swap control to the robot. Another fantastic way to make what could be a complicated button combination incredibly easy to perform in VR.</p><p dir="ltr">As the robot, you can also leap on walls, twisting your perspective of the world and opening up new avenues for puzzle solving.</p><p dir="ltr">As you progress through the game, you can also upgrade the weapons you get by spending collectible points on them. You can modify weapons to have charged blasts or fire ricochet bullets to change up how you're playing the game.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr">A Cartoon Look, But Not THE Cartoon Look</h2><p dir="ltr"><em>Men In Black: Most Wanted</em> has a fun art style that's a mix of what you'd expect from a comic or a '90s cartoon. That being said, it's not as stylized as the old cartoon, which is a bit of a shame.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Most Wanted</em> falls into that really good level of graphics for mobile VR that's showing you something that you can accept and be a part of the world as, without trying to push too hard for a level of realism that would leave the user stuck in an uncanny universe.</p><p dir="ltr">This cartoonish style also lends itself fantastically to the big pops of color that separate the mundane and boring world of the city with alien artifacts and blood.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/men-in-black-most-wanted-magnetic-glove.jpg?itok=SwCHTOOq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1077" height="1079">

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr">Invasion Mode Is VR Horde Mode</h2><p dir="ltr">When you're done playing the 8-10 hour campaign, you can take on the Invasion mode on your own or with others online. Invasion Mode is as you'd expect, you take on waves of enemies with a variety of different objectives and try to make it as far as you can on a single life.</p><p dir="ltr">After each round, you can purchase an upgrade for yourself or your weapons or consumable items. The points you spend are earned by defeating enemies. Each enemy I killed rewarded me with a different amount of points; I couldn't quite tell what was determining that amount or if it was mostly random.</p><p dir="ltr">On top of killing aliens, you might also be searching the arena for objectives like power sources to place in receptacles around the arena.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/men-in-black-most-wanted-worms.jpg?itok=FjkFrX0Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1071" height="1077">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/men-in-black-most-wanted-worms.jpg?itok=h1AN9VKo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1071" height="1077">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">The purchases expand even further past upgrades, as you can also buy arena obstacles and turrets. These items let you reshape the terrain and add a bit of random/uniqueness, but in your favor.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Men In Black: Most Wanted</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2><p dir="ltr"><em>Men In Black: Most Wanted</em> from start to finish felt like discovering a classic Action Adventure title from the ~PS2 era of gaming. The gameplay is a fun mix between some engaging problem-solving and sleuthing before it moves into frantic shootouts against colorful aliens.</p><p dir="ltr">Coatsink has done a fantastic job crafting a mission-based story to lead you through the alien underground, pulling the threads of a conspiracy for a fun and engaging payoff.</p><p dir="ltr">Coupled with easy to learn and dynamic VR controls, an art style that fits the subject well and welcomes you to the world, and a reasonable play session time matched to the story beats of a mission whether you're a massive fan of <em>MIB</em>, or are just looking for a great action adventure title to play on your Quest next I'd definitely recommend this.</p><hr><p><em><strong>Men In Black: Most Wanted </strong>was reviewed on Meta Quest 3 with a copy provided by the Developer over the course of 9 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the process of review.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

		<p><em>Fandom is, itself, illogical. </em></p><p><em>You do not control the team. You do not control the outcome. And yet, the vast majority of the population willingly subjects themselves to stop to regular emotional torture rooting for some kind of team.</em></p><p><em>Given how little control we have over other parts of our lives, maybe it makes sense. If the seeming randomness of sports can make us happy, maybe there will be a roll of the dice in another direction, too? </em></p><p><em>Well, if you're a Chicago Bears fan, that's probably not something to count on. But this year has been different. Special? Maybe not. Different? Yes. Patrick is ready to ride the bronco and see where it takes him, while Rob remains...you know, let's call it skeptical.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Rob:</strong> If you had told me back in August that I would spend part of Thanksgiving Weekend watching the Chicago Bears pulverize Philadelphia Eagles and that they would be the number one team in the NFC, I would have assumed that there was some kind of freakish midair collision that involved multiple teams' charter planes. That the Bears would be winning these games wearing blacked-out logos for the Packers and Eagles on their uniforms. And yet here we are: the Bears are 9-3 and likely headed for the playoffs.</p><p>The thing is, Patrick, I can't shake the feeling that this is 2018 all over again. An offensive-minded culture guy has sparked a formerly moribund franchise. The quarterback frequently looks mediocre but with flashes of excellence, and the defense is getting turnovers even as they give up lots of yards. The Bears could easily be 3-9 if one thing goes differently in each of those six one-score wins. If we're being honest, a lot of those games have been pretty uninspiring. "Another fraudulent Bears win!" is what you yelled as we celebrated at the Bills game, and you could have said that about quite a few of those victories.</p><p>It's hard for me to enjoy the ride this time around because 2018 was a false dawn that heralded years of deepening dysfunction, winning too much trust for a front office and coaching staff that didn't deserve it. By the end of 2019 it was abundantly clear why Matt Nagy's and Mitch Trubisky's Bears needed so many fluke wins and when the luck ran out, so did any joy in watching our football team.</p><p>So I find myself dreading the next month of football, and in particular this weekend. Because the Bears are playing the Packers, and the schedule looks brutal from here, with rematches with the Lions and Packers both upcoming plus a game against the 49ers. In previous years, the Bears were so hopeless that you weren't really publicly shamed for being a fan because nobody was seeing their games outside of ritual sacrifices on Sunday and Monday night football. Now? Patrick, everybody is paying attention to our Bears! There's a good chance four of those next five games are going to be nationally featured. And dude, I just don't want this team to be an embarrassment anymore. I am sick of the texts from friends at halftime of a Sunday night disaster: "Yo is it always like this?" Yeah, historically, it is. This is my team. This is what shaped me.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@libraryofcongress?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Library of Congress</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>Dude, I’m sorry, but you have to stop this. Line in the sand. This team is fun. No, they’re not a Super Bowl team. Yes, they’ve won a bunch of coin flip games. But trust your eyes: this is a foundation.</p><p>Every basic and advanced statistic about the Chicago Bears tells you what they’re doing is real. The “maybe not 100% real” part is <em>wins</em>, but I’m sorry, this entire NFL season is about mid teams fighting one another. There is no dominant force in either conference. How else do you explain that if the Bears lose to the Packers, they move from the one to the seven seed? It’s a wholly unique year in a sport where weird shit happens and this is just a year where weird shit is happening to the Bears and they also happen to be putting things together at the right time of the year. </p><p>I’m done caveating all of that! The Bears are <em>fun</em>, man.</p>

              <p>Upgrading your work or everyday laptop doesn’t have to break the bank; especially if you know where to look for one. Black Friday and Cyber Monday are over, but there’s still one last chance left to save big on a premium laptop, and bag some freebies with your purchase while you’re at it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6240/">The 17.3-inch HP touchscreen laptop, which usually sits well over $2,600, is currently going for just $770 at Amazon, after a whopping 70% off its usual price.</a> It’s the lowest we have seen it drop to in a month, and the retailer is also throwing in a bunch of useful accessories for absolutely nothing. <a href="https://gizmodo.com/download/windows-11-pro">Windows 11 Pro</a> also comes pre-installed, so you’re saving a good chunk on that front, too. Be sure to grab yours fast, as we don’t expect the discount to stay around for long. In fact, it might not even make it into the weekend.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6240/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Display, Fast Performance</h2>
<p>You’re getting a massive 17.3-inch Brightview HD+ touch display that brings content to life in stunning 1600 x 900 resolution. 1.4M pixels come together to deliver every detail with incredible accuracy, while the slim bezel and 16:9 aspect ratio offer quite a lot of room to work and play. You can stream your favorite shows, create presentations, and even play some of your favorite titles; all without feeling cramped. There’s an HP TrueVision 720p HD, paired with temporal noise reduction and an integrated dual array digital microphone for better video calls. Additionally, audio quality is just as great, thanks to the built-in Dual-stereo speakers.</p>
<p>For power, HP has packed the laptop with a 6-core AMD Ryzen 5 7530U Processor that is capable of hitting speeds up to 4.5 GHz. It’s more than enough to speed through a bunch of work and creative tasks without a hint of lag. The 16GB RAM isn’t massive, but still modest enough to keep things running smoothly, especially when you’re trying to multitask. You will be able to work with different applications at the same time – think catching up on Slack, hopping on a meeting with Zoom, working on a PowerPoint project – without slowing down. Storing all your important data in a single place is made easy with the built-in 512GB SSD. It should be enough for most users out there, unless you’re trying to store an entire gaming library on it. And since the storage is expandable, you always pair it with an SD card or an external hard drive to get the space you need. SSDs are also much faster than traditional drives, so you’re going to enjoy faster boot and load times as well.</p>



<p>The battery is solid, and HP Fast Charge gets it back up and running in no time when you’re running low. As for the freebies, you’ll get Windows 11 Pro pre-installed, a CD/DVD drive, a cleaning cloth, a wireless mouse, and a 256GB Micro SD. That’s everything you need to get started right away.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6240/">If you’ve been looking to grab a solid laptop without blowing your budget, this 17.3-inch HP touchscreen laptop is an excellent option to consider, especially at its current price</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>December 4th is Dragon Age Day, the unofficial day fans of BioWare’s fantasy RPG anthology celebrate the series. Last year, the studio earnestly participated. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-4-review-dreadwolf-rook-action-rpg-1851681954"><i><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></i></a> <span>was only about a month old at the time, so BioWare </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-character-creator-free-download-1851713224"><span>released the game’s incredible character creator for free</span></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-popular-choice-stats-romance-1851713958"><span>broke down early player choices</span></a><span> on social media. This year? There wasn’t a peep from the studio on the matter. Not even a single mention of the franchise that once won “Best Game” at the Game Awards.</span></p> <p><span>If you look at BioWare’s </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>social accounts, the last time the studio used the game’s </span><a href="https://x.com/dragonage"><span>X account</span></a><span> was to repost an ad for </span><i><span>The Veilguard</span></i><span> on the EA Play subscription service on August 28. The developer’s </span><a href="https://blog.bioware.com/"><span>official blog’s</span></a><span> last post was on November 7, celebrating </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span>’s equivalent “holiday,” N7 Day, which </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-n7-day-bioware-blog-teaser-url-krogan-2000642122"><span>had a small update on the upcoming fifth game</span></a><span> and the Amazon television series. You’ll find no such post about </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span>. BioWare has admitted it’s become a one-game studio after massive layoffs </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-bioware-dragon-age-veilguard-dlc-layoffs-1851750767"><span>back in January</span></a><span>, so there is no fifth </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>game in the works, but the silence also casts a shadow on the RPG series’ past.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>If you’re only passively paying attention, it might make sense for the studio to not make a big deal about a series without a sequel it’s actively promoting. But for fans and the developers who spent decades working on </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span>, it’s another insult to beloved games that seemed to sometimes get the short end of the stick over their troubled development.</span></p>

 <p><span>In the months since BioWare was gutted of veteran talent and </span><i><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard was </span></i><span>thrown under the bus by parent company Electronic Arts, developers have been candid about how the </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>team felt like it </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-anthem-mark-darrah-youtube-bioware-1851779569"><span>wasn’t treated fairly by the broader company</span></a><span>. </span><i><span>The Veilguard</span></i><span>’s messy production saw the game rebooted from a live service no one wanted into a single-player RPG that, miraculously, came out feeling like the character-driven epics BioWare is associated with despite being a decade in the works.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>After the game didn’t reach internal projections out of the gate, EA downsized BioWare and has focused the company exclusively on </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span>, and implied that </span><i><span>The Veilguard </span></i><span>may have reached a broader audience if it </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-5-bioware-live-service-1851756169"><span>had stayed a live service game no one asked for</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>So perhaps it’s for the best that BioWare didn’t acknowledge</span><i><span> Dragon Age </span></i><span>this year. If the company had even made a tweet or blog post expressing its love for the world of Thedas and pride in having brought it to life, the messaging would have come across as tone-deaf after the hell its team reportedly went through.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>At least this way, the fans and creatives who made these games get the day to themselves, without it being co-opted by a studio and publisher that treated them like second-class citizens. Now, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416"><span>the </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>team gets the final word</span></a><span>.</span></p>

With 40 magical runes to combine however you want, every challenge is an opportunity to create your own solution.</p><p><strong>What if Every Puzzle Had Multiple Solutions, and Half of Them Were Things You Invented?</strong></p><p>You start with four runes and collect more as you explore the world of Rhell, using up to five of these in whatever combination you please to solve different puzzles. Want to hold down two buttons, but you’ve only got yourself? Duplicate yourself and turn your copy into a puddle that permanently holds the switch down. Need a vehicle in a quick fix? Cast Life on a rock and use it as your pet car! Whatever the combination, whatever the solution, the magic is yours to master.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>The World’s Gone Quiet</strong></p><p>Everyone has vanished except 12 people, leaving behind empty towns and unanswered questions. As Rhell, a sharp-tongued mage, you explore forgotten ruins filled with ancient secrets, decode mysterious fragments left behind by those who came before, and slowly piece together what really caused this catastrophe. The few remaining inhabitants have their theories, but you might find a truth far stranger than anyone suspected. What started as a simple mystery becomes something that challenges everything you thought you knew.</p><p><strong>Discover Your Own Path</strong></p><p>Wander through nine distinct areas at your own pace – from flooded libraries and underwater cities to volcanic factories and crystal caves. Each location tells its own story through environmental details and hidden lore, along with characters that have their own mysteries to unravel. Some areas connect in unexpected ways, rewarding those who explore thoroughly. The world doesn’t just contain puzzles, it is a puzzle—one that reveals more of itself the deeper you dig. Whether you’re following the main plot or getting side-tracked by a curious detail, there’s always another secret waiting just around the corner.</p><p><strong>Shape Your Story</strong></p><p>If you choose to help the people you meet along your journey, you might see Rhell’s character develop. Help the lonely characters and watch her soften into someone who genuinely cares. Ignore them entirely and she’ll stay the blunt, loud-mouthed mage she started as. With multiple endings to discover, let your curiosity and kindness (or lack thereof) lead you.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>40 magical runes creating millions of spell combinations (102,400,000 to be exact!).</li><li>Creative ways to solve each puzzle—do it your own way!</li><li>Semi-open world with nine distinct areas to explore.</li><li>Hours of gameplay with endless experimentation and replayability.</li><li>Rich, story driven narrative with branching paths and multiple endings.</li><li>Sarcastic, sassy mage who accidentally helps people while being rude about it.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Rhell: Warped Worlds &amp; Troubled Times Official Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dLLvF0e5e0g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/rhell-warped-worlds-troubled-times-for-pc-launches-march-19-2026]]></content:encoded>

<p>A new post on <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs/status/1996836863332831330">X</a> from <a href="https://x.com/nintendo_cs" tabindex="-1">@nintendo_cs</a> (translated by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social">@Oatmealdome</a> on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social/post/3m77x5mfgzd2g">Bluesky</a>), Nintendo stated that it is aware of two bugs in particular, and it's working on a fix. First, there's the City Trial 'Dyna Blade' event, which Nintendo has noticed isn't showing up as often as it should. There's also a glitch in the Free Run timer, where it stops counting if the mode is used for too long.</p><div><figure data-videoid="M1hEbqIQJAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytM1hEbqIQJAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6de8adsgtvzq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>840k</span></a></p>

<p>It seems that the latter of these two bugs only applies if Free Run is played for a <em>really</em> long time, mind you. X user <a href="https://x.com/maziari1105" tabindex="-1">@maziari1105</a> <a href="https://x.com/maziari1105/status/1995844351768101180">shared a clip</a> of their timer maxing out after running the mode for a whopping 116 hours — so don't worry about leaving it on for an hour or two!</p>
<p>Nintendo has given no indication of when a patch will be released to remedy these issues, though we'd be surprised if we don't see it soon enough.</p>
<p>We had a blast with Kirby Air Riders when it launched on Switch 2 last month, calling it "a cracking sequel" in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">8/10 review</a>.</p>

              <p>There are so many great games out there to play but so little space on the Nintendo Switch to download them all. The system’s built-in capacity fills up quickly, especially if you prefer digital purchases. Fortunately, expanding your available space is not only possible, but simple, affordable, and officially supported. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6239/">Samsung’s microSDXC memory card, designed specifically for the Nintendo Switch family of systems, is currently part of a limited-time sale at Amazon.</a> The 1TB model, normally priced at $122, has dropped to just $85, giving players a substantial 30% discount on one of the best storage upgrades available.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6239/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2 data-start="772" data-end="824">Support a Massive Library of Nintendo Switch Games</h2>
<p data-start="826" data-end="1187">If you’ve owned a Switch for a decent length of time, you’ve likely hit your storage limit. Even the Nintendo Switch OLED model, released in 2021, includes only 64GB of internal storage. The original 2017 Switch offers just 32GB, and with a portion of that dedicated to essential system files, you really have only about 25GB free for games.</p>
<p data-start="1189" data-end="1601">To put that into perspective, <em data-start="1219" data-end="1262">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> comes in just over 16GB. That’s a reasonable file size compared to blockbuster games on other platforms, but on a Switch, it takes up a significant chunk of your available storage all by itself. Two or three larger games can easily fill an entire console, forcing you to constantly delete and redownload titles as you want to revisit.</p>
<p data-start="1603" data-end="2132">This is why a large-capacity microSD card is almost mandatory. By adding the Samsung microSDXC card, you expand your Switch’s storage by up to 1TB. That’s more more than 30 times the internal space of the base model system. With that much room, you can download huge first-party adventures, tons of indie favorites, and even bulky third-party releases without worrying about shuffling files around. For most players, it’s enough space to last for years.</p>


<p data-start="2134" data-end="2704">The Samsung 1TB microSDXC card delivers read and write speeds of up to 180 MB/s, which is more than sufficient for the Nintendo Switch. It’s reliable, fast, and optimized for smooth performance while launching games or transferring data.</p>
<p data-start="2134" data-end="2704">And we haven’t even talked about the best part yet. This SD card has Shadow the Hedgehod on it. This whole lineup of Samsung microSDs features a Sonic character. The 128GB model is marked red with Knuckles, the 256GB one marked orange for Tails, and the 512GB card is accented blue with Sonic. And then at the full 1TB, we have the ultimate lifeform himself in black—Shadow the Hedgehog.</p>
<p data-start="2134" data-end="2704">It’s inherently very silly to me to put anything remarkable on the outside of a microSD card designed for the Nintendo Switch. That’s mainly because you’ll look at it once, pop it into your console, then never look at it again. I guess you can rest easy knowing Shadow is looking after your digital copies of <em>Super Mario RPG</em> and <em>Snipperclips</em>.</p>
<p data-start="2706" data-end="3132">Do note that this microSD card is&nbsp;<strong>not compatible</strong> with the newly released Nintendo Switch 2. The new console requires faster read and write speeds that you can find on an express microSD. This particular lineup of microSD cards are, however, still compatible on any of the first generation of Nintendo Switch consoles. This includes the Nintendo Switch, the Nintendo Switch Lite, and the Nintendo Switch OLED.</p>

<p>The Game Awards 2025 has an absolutely stacked lineup of nominees and awards. There are so many categories where it could go either way, and Insider Gaming has boldly put its reputation on the line to pick the winner for every TGA 2025 category.</p>



<p>From Best Debut Indie Game to Best Narrative to the coveted Game of the Year award, you already know we are in for three hours of drama come The Game Awards 2025 night. Insider Gaming has already told you <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-vote-game-awards-2025-all-categories-nominees-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to vote for The Game Awards 2025</a>; now it’s time to tell you what we think.</p>







<h2 id="h-who-does-insider-gaming-think-will-win-game-of-the-year-at-the-game-awards-2025">Who Does Insider Gaming Think Will Win Game of the Year At The Game Awards 2025?</h2>

<p><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is Insider Gaming’s pick for Game of the Year at The Game Awards 2025</strong>.</p>



<p>It seems only fitting to give the biggest award more of a breakdown. Spoiler alert: This is not the first time Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is going to reign supreme in a category. New-studio Sandfall Interactive—comprised of former Ubisoft devs—set out to create something different and unique with Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p>







<p>The gamble paid off and continues to pay off late into 2025. Here are a handful of accolades the game has achieved this year:</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sets-record-as-2025s-best-third-party-xbox-game-pass-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 sets record as 2025’s best third-party Xbox Game Pass release</a>.</li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-nominations-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It breaks a staggering The Game Awards record</a>.</li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-announces-new-content-after-crossing-5-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It’s shipped 5 million units</a>.</li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/french-president-applauds-clair-obscur-expedition-33/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur received acclaim from the French President</a>.</li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-already-getting-a-movie-in-case-you-missed-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A movie is already in the works.</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Let’s make this clear: This is who Insider Gaming thinks will win, but necessarily who the team <em>wants </em>to win. However, it’s hard to ignore the buzz and brilliance of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, and IG predicts it will scoop the big one, along with many other awards.</p>

    <p><span>Return to the "Planet of Festivities" and discover the unseen side of the Penacony journey with The Dahlia.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 3.8 update for <em><a title="Games > Honkai: Star Rail [43 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a></em>, dubbed “Memories are the Prelude to Dreams,” is coming soon, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [216 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-1011805"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>As the epic journey of Amphoreus comes to an end, the Astral Express will focus on Penacony before embarking on its next space fantasy destination. This time the “Planet of Festivities” emanates a completely different aura from before, and players will have the opportunity to explore the untold mysteries alongside the new limited five-star character Constance “The Dahlia.” Meanwhile, challenging enemies and distinctive limited-time events will be introduced, weaving together an adventurous journey through the galaxy filled with danger, opportunities, and rewards.</p><p>Penacony, Land of Dreams, is a vacation spot where interstellar visitors gather to celebrate and have fun. In the previous chapter during the Charmony Festival, the members of the Astral Express successfully awakened those who had fallen into beautiful dreams, empowering them to take control of their own reality. However, beneath the seemingly perfect journey lie many unresolved mysteries. After the final battle of Amphoreus, Constance “The Dahlia” appears unexpectedly, revealing that the Trailblazer’s memories are incomplete and that some key parts have been stolen. With her assistance and guidance, the Trailblazer will work to piece together a complete and true storyline of Penacony.</p><p>In version 3.8, the Trailblazer will experience the story through Firefly’s perspective: how she initially entered the dreamscape, how she met us, and the battlefields she must face. All these questions will be answered one by one. As we follow her journey, The Family’s seat of power and the Dream of Gnawing Oak will also emerge from the depths of memories. Additionally, Firefly will encounter an old friend, closely connected to her past as a Glamoth Iron Cavalry Knight.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1011843"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>As a key part of Penacony’s memory-hunting adventure, The Dahlia will also join the roster as a playable character. She arrives in Penacony despite her father Duke Inferno’s grand plans being ultimately abandoned. The Dahlia’s target is the Remembrance, and her power is also related to that path, with the ability to enkindle and fabricate memories. She has a long history with the Garden of Recollection and Black Swan, and it is said that she has grown accustomed to betrayal. Nevertheless, The Dahlia will assist us in reclaiming the lost memories and completing the entire Penaconian trailblazing expedition. These memories hold special significance not only for the Trailblazer, but for her as well.</p><p>The Dahlia, a five-star character following the Path of Nihility, excels when teamed up with characters who specialize in Break DMG. On the battlefield, she can actively unleash a gloomy Zone. While this Zone lasts, Toughness Reduction inflicted by allies can trigger Super Break DMG, even before the enemies have their Weakness Broken. Additionally, as a graceful and elegant dancer, The Dahlia invites a teammate to become “Dance Partners.” After either of the two Dance Partners attacks an enemy target, they will deal an additional instance of Super Break DMG. On that foundation, her Ultimate applies every Dance Partner’s Type Weakness to all enemies, enhancing Toughness Reduction effectiveness.</p><p>Besides, in the upcoming version, a brand-new event titled “The Chrysos Awoo Championship” is set to begin. The Trailblazer, as a special guest, will take on the role of a chimera trainer, leading their own little chimeras to form a powerful team in pursuit of championship glory. Additionally, the event “Remnants of Twilight” will also be available, featuring a variety of battle challenges that will require players to think strategically and act decisively.</p></blockquote><p><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,973 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,974 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/honkai-star-rail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honkai-star-rail/id1599719154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.hkrpgoversea&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer and special program below.

                <p>Path of Exile 2 is playable now in early access, but the game's 1.0 release isn't ready yet--and it won't be here soon, it seems. Grinding Gear game director Jonathan Rogers said in an interview that the Tencent-owned studio will likely not hit the previously hinted March 2026 window.</p><p>"I'm fairly confident that we won't be out of 2026," Rogers told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/path-of-exile-2-release-date-slips-again" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>. "But as I said, I never want to really completely promise anything. But I don't think it'll end up being March; we'll have to see."</p><p>There is no "specific timeline" for when Path of Exile 2's 1.0 release will arrive, but Rogers said he "certainly" hopes it won't be any later than the end of 2026.</p><p>"Obviously we're trying to get there as fast as we can, but I certainly wouldn't want to slip into 2027," he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7nH1hHyzUSk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/7nH1hHyzUSk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In other news, Grinding Gear has announced a new update for Path of Exile 2, The Last of the Druids, which is coming on December 12. This update allows players to become a wolf, bear, or wyvern, while the update also includes a balance overhaul, in-game performance optimization, and an expanded passive tree with more than 250 skills.</p><p>Finally, Grinding Gear announced a free weekend for Path of Exile 2, coming up December 12-15.</p><p>Path of Exile 2 was released in early access back in December 2024. You can buy the game now for $30, while it will transition to free-to-play for its 1.0 launch, whenever that comes.

            <p>Last night, Twisted Works lifted the lid on its upcoming fantasy London-set online co-op combat game. If you think that concept sounds familiar, you are not alone.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/twistedworksltd/about/">Twisted Works was established last year</a>, with veteran developers from PlayStation London Studio, Guerrilla Cambridge, Creative Assembly, Disney Interactive, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, Blu, Slide London and more all lending their pedigree to the team.</p>
<p>And, it seems that some of the developers' previous work had more than a just a small influence on the upcoming release, Cast Outs, which bears a striking resemblance to artwork for London Studio's own cancelled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstations-london-studio-working-on-ps5-online-game">online game for the PlayStation 5</a> that was to be set in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstations-london-studio-working-on-online-co-op-combat-game-set-in-fantasy-london">fantasy version of the UK capital</a>.</p>

<p>Just like London Studio's now-cancelled game, Cast Outs is also an online co-op game set in an urban fantasy-inspired London. In the words of Twisted Works, Cast Outs is "fantasy in a modern jacket", where up to four players can team up together and use magical spells to traverse the city and defeat enemies.</p>
<p>You can check out the trailer for Cast Outs below.</p>

<p>"Cast Outs brings you the pure spectacle of magic where spellcasting hits with the physical impact of a brawler and the immediate kick of a shooter. Dive into the ultimate magical urban battleground where you and your friends can truly cooperate, regardless of skill level," reads the official blurb. "It's the perfect balance of quick-fix fun and high-octane action, built to be played together."</p>
<p>And, as you can see in the images below, art for both games has similar iconography and colour schemes:</p>

<p>Cast Outs is set to debut on PlayStation 5 and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3307340/Cast_Outs/">PC via Steam</a>. A release date is still to be announced. How do you think it looks?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-laying-off-900-playstation-employees-london-studio-to-close-in-its-entirety">London Studio was shut down in February of last year</a>, when Sony laid off 900 people, equating to eight percent of its then-workforce.</p>

            <p>Netflix has announced it's acquiring Warner Bros. in a deal worth $82.7bn, including its game studios.</p>
<p>Back in June, <a href="https://www.wbd.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-separate-two-leading-media-companies">Warner Bros. Discovery announced the company would be split</a> between Streaming &amp; Studios (including Warner Bros. Motion Picture Group, DC Studios, and HBO among others) and Global Networks (including sports and news TV brands like CNN and TNT Sports).</p>
<p>It's the former half that Netflix is set to acquire, with the transaction closing in 12-18 months once the split takes place, subject to regulatory approvals. At the time of the split announcement, David Zaslav, president and CEO of Warner Bros. Discovery, said it will "invigorate each company by enabling them to leverage their strengths and specific financial profiles. This will also allow each company to pursue important investment opportunities and drive shareholder value."</p>

<p>Warner Bros.' game studios includes the likes of Rocksteady (the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-games-order">Batman Arkham series</a>), NetherRealm Studios (Mortal Kombat), and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/avalanche-studios">Avalanche Studios</a> (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a>).</p>
<p>It's currently unknown how the gaming division of Warner Bros. will be impacted by the Netflix acquisition. While gaming isn't mentioned specifically in <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros">Netflix's press release</a>, "games and consumer product and experiences" were included during a webcast on the news. Hogwarts Legacy at the least was a huge revenue driver and a sequel is extremely likely, while DC fans will surely be hopeful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-has-a-new-single-player-batman-game-in-development-teases-new-report">Rocksteady is reportedly working on a new Batman game</a> to follow its celebrated Arkham Knight series.</p>

<p>"Our mission has always been to entertain the world," said Ted Sarandos, co-CEO of Netflix. "By combining Warner Bros.' incredible library of shows and movies - from timeless classics like Casablanca and Citizen Kane to modern favorites like Harry Potter and Friends - with our culture-defining titles like Stranger Things, KPop Demon Hunters and Squid Game, we'll be able to do that even better. Together, we can give audiences more of what they love and help define the next century of storytelling."</p>
<p>Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters added the acquisition will "improve our offering and accelerate our business for decades to come".</p>
<p>"Today's announcement combines two of the greatest storytelling companies in the world to bring to even more people the entertainment they love to watch the most," said Zaslav. "For more than a century, Warner Bros. has thrilled audiences, captured the world’s attention, and shaped our culture. By coming together with Netflix, we will ensure people everywhere will continue to enjoy the world's most resonant stories for generations to come."</p><p>As for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a>, in June it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-restructures-leadership-team-following-new-focus-on-game-of-thrones-dc-harry-potter-and-mortal-kombat">initiated a dramatic leadership shift</a> as part of a refocus on its biggest franchises, like Mortal Kombat, DC, Harry Potter, and Game of Thrones.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="5578c9cb15efa"><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5578c9cb15efa/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Friday 5th December marks the six-month mark for Nintendo's sequel system. Launching back in June, the earliest adopters among us have now been living with the console for half a year. Blimey! It seems like only yesterday we were all speculating about the follow-up to Switch 1. Would it launch in 2022? 2023? 2024?...</p>
<p>Yes, Switch 2 has been in our minds for years, and it feels surreal to have possessed the thing for six months now. So, before we get into the annual GOTY madness, now's a good time to look back, take stock, and briefly discuss how we're getting on with Switch Part Deux.</p>
<p>You'll find some polls below related to the hardware itself, the software lineup, and how you'd rate the whole shebang now that the final marquee first-party game of the year is out in the wild. (It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid</a>, if you somehow hadn't noticed all the articles with Samus in the lead image.)</p>
<p>Let's start with the system itself, now that the new hardware smell has worn off...</p>
<h2>Hardware: It's a Switch, too</h2>

<p>Picking up my launch-day console, I'm happy to say my initial impressions — as chronicled in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/hardware-review-nintendo-switch-2-a-faster-slicker-sexier-switch">my hardware review</a> back in mid-June — still hold true.</p>
<p>Having gone back to Switch 1 for review purposes a few times in the last few months, the older console feels so very, very slow. My heart still goes out to the OLED's screen, but besides the novelty of it being slightly smaller, there's nothing about the first console I miss.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:182525 @ 1764942940 -->
<p>Switch 2 came in very hot with a launch day update essentially 'activating' it, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-21-0-1-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">various system updates</a> have refined things on the firmware side. My Joy-Con are still functioning perfectly - which should really be a given, but the spectre of drift lingers, as does the pile of useless OG Joy-Con in the cupboard.</p>
<p>I'm fairly careful with all my devices, but I've taken the system on trips, packed it in suitcases, and generally given it a full and thorough 'using' across all modes, and it's coped with those day-to-day rigours just fine.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/poll-have-you-had-issues-with-the-ethernet-port-on-switch-2s-dock">User reports</a> about a faulty or malfunctioning LAN port in the dock are disappointing, although it's not a problem anyone on Team NL has run into. Likewise, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/poll-are-you-happy-with-switch-2s-screen-because-some-people-certainly-arent">legitimate complaints</a> around blurry panel problems and ghosting seem to have died down, too - not that those issues don't still exist, they just don't seem to be troubling the vast majority of Switch 2 owners.</p>
<p>On the whole, then, there are areas to polish (and the screen on my trusty OLED model still looks spectacular) but Switch 2 gets things mostly right, and it's holding up well after six months of use, if not abuse. What about yours?</p>

<h2>Software: Delightful, certainly, but lacking surprise?</h2>

<p>The number of truly new Switch 2 games, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/all-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-games">exclusive</a> or otherwise, might be lacking, but it's hard to argue with the breadth of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-best-nintendo-switch-2-games">quality games</a> we've seen released since June. Plenty of familiar ports, yes — another way in which Switch 1's legacy passes directly to its successor — but with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/every-switch-2-launch-game-ranked">25 games in the launch lineup</a>, is there anything to grouse about on the consumer side, <em>really</em>?</p>
<p>Perhaps. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is a great game, but also 'just' the new Mario Kart, not a genre-defining all-timer like a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">BOTW</a> or even a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/wii_sports">Wii Sports</a>. Despite the brilliance of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, there's nothing just yet that you <em>absolutely have to get a Switch 2</em> to play. Plenty of gems, some exquisite ports, and having them on a handheld hybrid is as convenient as ever, but the vast majority can be played elsewhere. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hades_ii">Hades 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4</a>, for example, both perform wonderfully on Switch 1.</p>
<p>Backwards compatibility has been expanded (with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">NieR:Automata</a> fixes coming in a recent update), and NSO additions have kept trickling in. We're still waiting on four of the ten announced GameCube additions to show up, but <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-online-gamecube-game-on-switch-2-ranked">what's there is good stuff</a>.</p>
<p>So, plenty to play, but how are you feeling?</p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:185286 @ 1764943210 -->
<h2>How would you rate Switch 2 overall (so far)?</h2>

<p>We've briefly looked at the system and the software, but how are you feeling about your investment in the console? Any regrets? And standout moments in your time with it so far?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/27-upcoming-nintendo-switch-2-games-were-excited-for-in-2025">The future's looking bright</a>, but let's get a numerical sit-rep - and feel free to head into the comments if you'd like to elucidate or espouse further.</p>

            <guid>1374199</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Liquid Swords, the development studio founded by founder of Just Cause dev Avalanche Studios Christofer Sundberg, has announced its first game. That game is Samson: A Tyndalston Story, a new open world game where the stakes are always high. You play as the as Samson who lives in the city of Tyndalston where he has built up a mountain of debt and the lenders want their money back.</p>
<p><iframe title="SAMSON | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OQ4z_yQE5Xo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Samson, you can explore the open world districts of Tyndalston while also taking missions to pay off your debt. The issue is the debt keeps growing due to the daily interest rate applied, and you do not have the luxury of time on your side. The game will also not let you just do all the missions you want to pay off the debt. Samson has a points system and you have to spend those points to select which missions to undertake. Once you make choice, you cannot go back and pick another. It does not matter if you succeed or fail, as the consequences will depend on the outcome.</p>
<p>As you make progess in the game, you will be able to improve Samson’s skills from fighting to driving as he tries to survive in this world, before the debt gets too much and he runs out of time. Samson will have to keep improving as things progress, as the world changes around him and things get more dangerous. At the moment, Samson: A Tyndalston Story has been confirmed for PC only with a release date yet to be announced.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a>, the massive modding project reinterpreting The Elder Scrolls 4 via <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>'s engine, had its release officially <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivions-release-has-been-delayed-to-2026-but-you-can-check-out-an-interactive-version-of-its-map">delayed to 2026</a> earlier this week. The delay followed an ex-Skyblivion level and world designer Dee Keyes alleging that the mod's previous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivions-2025-release-goal-is-pointless-and-unachievable-claims-longtime-dev-accuses-two-leads-of-rushing-the-mod-out">2025 release goal was "unachievable"</a> earlier this year, in a post which also accused Skyblivion project lead Kyle 'Rebelzize' Rebel and implementation lead Heavy Burns of mismanaging communication within the mod's team. In response, Heavy Burns asserted that "many" of the claims in the ex-dev's post were "either misrepresented or just untrue".</p>
<p>Now, in a Discord discussion emphasising that players shouldn't assume the spellcrafting mechanic the modders have had to cut from the initial release will be put back in down the line, Skyblivion's UI department lead has suggested they weren't consulted about what was said in the YouTube video announcing the mod's delay to next year. That'd be the delay announcement video which features a section specifically dedicated to the current status of Skyblivion's UI and mechanics.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Well, technically, I had no idea what was said in the video, I was not even asked, and I have not even watched it till now," the mod's <a href="https://skyblivion.com/the-team/">sole UI lead</a>, who goes by the handle Fallen011[35], <a href="https://discord.com/channels/239801644076892160/275583958190653440/1446307977232515133">wrote in response</a> to a fan erroneously claiming the delay video had confirmed spellcrafting will definitely be added post-release. "If that was said, then I hope it was said in a manner of 'planned' or better as a hope instead of a promise."</p>
<p>That was how it was framed in the video, with project lead Rebel simply saying it and the also cut underwater combat "are features we would like to add to the game at a later date". In other Discord comments, Fallen011[35] also responded to fans who say that they're planning to wait for spellcrafting to be added before playing Skyblivion, commenting that there's no guarantee that either this or the revamped interface (which Rebel has said the team would work on "if time allows") will definitely arrive.</p><p>"Both require massive amounts of work, and for me to be honest, I do not know if I want to keep working [non-stop] on UI after release," the lead wrote. "UI is not really great to work with in Skyrim, and at some point I just want to be finished with UI. And for me and others in the Project, spell crafting is not that important. That being said, I would keep hopes down and not think that this will 100% be the case."</p>
<p>Makes sense, but it's Fallen011[35]'s suggestion that they weren't privy to what was said in the video about the release delay which stuck me, especially in light of the allegations of communication issues that Keyes levelled at the leads in his post. Rebel's video doesn't just announce the delay - it paints a picture of where each key aspect of the mod's development is at right now, including its user interface. The project lead says in the intro that the group "did not want to announce a delay without also sharing our current plans and ambitions for the release of the project."</p>
<p>With that in mind, it seems strange to me for the mod project leads not to be kept in the loop about the video's contents, at least as it concerned their specific department's area, regardless of whether they had any direct input on exactly what was said. Even if it wasn't necessary to ensure Rebel could provide an up-to-date and accurate picture of progress, it would seem sensible for the team to be all on the same page ahead of making an important public announcement about their project.</p>
<p>I've reached out the Skyblivion team and project lead Kyle Rebel for comment.</p>
<p>If you're keen to get an early idea of how you'll acquire and play Skyblivion before release, check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivion-project-lead-and-gog-chat-about-partnering-up-to-release-the-massive-elder-scrolls-mod-following-fallout-londons-troubled-success">the chat I had with Rebel and GOG earlier this year</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-reviews-is-it-good-switch-2-nintendo-2000649621"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a> starts with a bang, but it didn’t really impress me much. However, everything changed once I reached the game’s first real playground, a Giger-esque otherworldly factory filled with robots, puzzles, electrical dangers, and a cool motorcycle.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/fans-who-pre-ordered-metroid-prime-4-six-years-ago-have-seen-their-entire-lives-change-2000645936">Nearly a decade after it was first teased</a> and 18 years after <em>Metroid Prime 3,</em> Retro and Nintendo have finally released <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> for Switch and Switch 2. Over here at <em>Kotaku</em>, we didn’t get an early copy of the sci-fi action adventure FPS like many other sites. So I’ve been playing it today on Switch 2, taking my first power-suited steps into this latest entry in the beloved <em>Metroid Prime</em> series. Two things struck me right out of the gate while playing <em>Prime 4:</em> This game looks really nice. And the opening hour is meh.</p>

  <p><em>Metroid Prime 4</em> is a gorgeous game, even if <a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-graphics-comparison-switch-2-ugly-2000650585">some online don’t think it looks realistic or detailed enough</a>. What Retro has pulled off here is at times stunning and always runs at a flawless 120FPS at a crisp resolution, too. It might not be as sharp as something like <em>Black Ops 7</em> running on a PS5 Pro or as detailed as<em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> on a Series X, but <em>Prime 4</em> nails it where it matters, using art style and smart graphical tricks to create something that looks wonderful on my big dumb 4K 120hz television.</p>

 <p>I especially love the lighting and <em>Prime 4</em>‘s HDR implementation, with dark areas not looking washed out and bright lights popping off the screen. It’s easily the best-looking Switch 2 game around.</p> <p>However, visuals weren’t enough to win me over during <em>Prime 4</em>‘s first hour. The game starts off with an action-packed tutorial and then a slow exploration of an alien world, where you meet a very annoying Galactic Federation soldier who, along with the game itself, practically holds Samus’ hand through most of the first part of <em>Prime 4</em>. It’s not bad, per se, but I wasn’t excited to play more. Thankfully, you ditch that annoying dude and set off to visit the game’s first real area, Volt Forge.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000650677" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000650677"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000650677">©Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This is where <em>Prime 4</em> gets <em>really</em> good. I won’t spoil too much, as it’s an experience I don’t want to ruin for anyone. But what makes Volt Forge so excellent is how it blends everything great about <em>Metroid Prime</em> into one haunting and large level. There are boss fights that utilize your various tools and weapons. It has puzzles that feel just challenging enough that solving them is satisfying, but not so annoying as to be a brick wall. And some incredible music, too. And to my surprise, Volt Forge even gets a bit creepy at points. Don’t expect jump scares or worry that <em>Prime 4</em> is a horror game; it never goes that far, but I enjoyed the change in pace from the opening level.</p>

 <p>Maybe the most unexpected part of Volt Forge is that it reminds me of <em>Titanfall 2</em> and <a href="https://youtu.be/A2W0LfUXFQo?t=1740">that game’s much-praised level set inside a large factory</a>. Again, I won’t spoil exactly what happens in Volt Forge that reminded me of that level from Repsawn’s excellent sci-fi mech shooter, just know that the factory Samus is exploring is far from broken down. So you might want to be careful.</p> <p>And at the very end of Volt Forge, you unlock <em>Prime 4</em>‘s motorcycle, which handles fine enough and feels great to drive. I have no idea if the rest of the game will match Volt Forge’s quality or if I’ll enjoy the more open-ended hub desert where the motorcycle is primarily used. It’s possible that everything after this will be terrible. For now, though, <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> was able to overcome its so-so opening hour and win me over with a creepy and dangerous trip through an alien factory.</p>

              <p>LEGOs are fun to build on your own, and even more enjoyable when doing it with friends. If you’re a fan of the galaxy far, far away or have a little one who just can’t seem to stop talking about the identity and origin of Supreme Leader Snoke, there’s a way to bring an important part of Star Wars to your living room this holiday season.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6238/">The LEGO Star Wars: Attack of the Clones Jango Fett’s Starshipset, which usually goes for around $70, just dropped to $56 at Amazon</a>. That’s after the retailer slashed 20% off its retail tag, making the purchase quite affordable. The offer can be grabbed by both Prime and non-Prime members. Even better, all shoppers get to enjoy free delivery with their purchase, so there are no extra costs to worry about. However, we highly recommend getting your orders in quickly because the holiday rush is in full swing, and deals are moving fast.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6238/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Great for All Ages</h2>
<p>The set is made for ages 9 and up, and comes with a total of 707 pieces. It’s not massive, which is great if you’re planning to grab it for kids and don’t want to overwhelm them with a large project. It’s going to be one of those fun sets that can be brought to life by dedicating just a few hours during the weekend. Since the holiday season is upon us, everyone in the family can join in; maybe by the fireplace with some hot chocolate. Play the Star Wars theme song in the background to get in the feels!</p>
<p>You’ll be building Jango Fett (with dual blasters and jetpack), who is <em>a simple man trying to make his way in the universe</em>, young Boba Fett learning all about family trade, and tall Kaminoan Lama Su minifigures, plus the stunning starship. The attention to detail on the starship is incredible, since it features authentic rotating wings, four stud shooters, and a seismic charge-dropping function for some cool, explosive escapes just in the asteroid chase scene. There’s also an opening cockpit for two minifigures to jump in for some adventures across the Outer Rim, as well as a mobile service cart with ammunition storage. The latter doubles as a display stand.</p>



<p>Once built, the starship is going to measure over 3.5 in. (9 cm) high, 8 in. (21 cm) long, and 8.5 in. (21 cm) wide. It’s going to look stunning on its own, but you can always pair it with others in the LEGO Star Wars collection for a bigger setup that spans multiple star systems. The set also comes with a detailed instruction book that’s going to take younger fans through each step one by one. It’s quite easy to follow, so kids will be able to build on their own. For even more assistance, you can install the LEGO Builder app, which offers digital, 3D instructions. Kids can zoom in from every angle, track their progress, and save sets. The app also makes it easy to build with friends. In this mode, it divides tasks between everyone on board, so everyone can complete their own.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6238/">The current discount brings the price of the starship model to just $56. You’re saving a nice 20% on a set any Star Wars fan is going to love and cherish.</a> If you like it, don’t wait too long to grab it. Once the discount is gone, we can’t say whether it will be back anytime soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Netflix Set To Buy Warner Bros In 2026]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After weeks of accepting bids from potential suiters, it’s been announced that Netflix is set to buy Warner Bros. in 2026. The deal is expected to close after Warner Bros. Discovery completes its split into two separate companies.</p>



<p>In a joint <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">press release</a> on Friday, it was revealed that Netflix <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-looking-at-buying-warner-bros-discovery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will be acquiring</a> only the Streaming &amp; Studios side of the split as part of the $82.7 billion deal. That means, based on the <a href="https://www.wbd.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-separate-two-leading-media-companies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">previously announced</a> details, Netflix will own Warner Bros. Games. That means studios like NetherRealm, Rocksteady, TT Games, and Avalanche will likely all soon fall under the Netflix Games umbrella.</p>



<p><strong>UPDATE 8:35 am ET:</strong> Netflix has confirmed that it will include Warner Bros. Games</p>



<p><strong>“Today’s announcement combines two of the greatest storytelling companies in the world to bring to even more people the entertainment they love to watch the most,”</strong> Warner Bros. Discovery president and CEO David Zaslav said.</p>



<p>Netflix co-CEO Greg Peters added, <strong>“This acquisition will improve our offering and accelerate our business for decades to come. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“With our global reach and proven business model, we can introduce a broader audience to the worlds they create—giving our members more options, attracting more fans to our best-in-class streaming service, strengthening the entire entertainment industry and creating more value for shareholders.”</strong></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s worth mentioning that, while the deal mentions a full acquisition of Warner Bros., which is set to be the name of the streaming and studios side of the company, there was no mention of the games division in the press release.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Warner Bros. and Netflix for clarification on what the plans are for the gaming division. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/05/splitgate-arena-reloaded-gets-a-17th-december-relaunch-date/</link>
            <guid>1374181</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a> relaunch is set to arrive on 17th December with a big gameplay realignment and rebranding as Splitgate: Arena Reloaded, 1047 Games has announced.</p>
<p><iframe title="SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded | December 17" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hrcUZ_F7vX8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded is a major gameplay direction shift from that of Splitgate 2 at its launch in June. The Factions have been removed and so have the Abilities that were bound to them, making for a more purist focus on classic arena shooter combat. Because of this, the game progression has been rebuilt and the Ranked system overhauled.</p>
<p>There’s five new maps alongside six that have been fully-reworked, and you’ll play on them with new Arena modes, including a Classic Arena mode that has even starts and powerups to grab. Oh, and there’s three new Primary Weapons and a Railgun as a new Power Weapon.</p>
<p>Rounding things out, store prices have been reduced, the battle pass has been simplified, and they’re promising improved cosmetics quality.</p>

<p>Instead of studio founder Ian Proulx, who appeared in a bungled stage appearance at Summer Game Fest for the Splitgate 2 launch, 1047 Games Design Director Josh Watson provided the main quote, “Splitgate has always been a love letter to the arena shooters we grew up playing. We’ve been hard at work rebuilding the game from the ground up, taking the best of Splitgate 1 and Splitgate 2, removing what didn’t work, and refining what did.”</p>
<p>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded will launch on 17th December for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4 and Xbox One, and 1047 will be really, really hoping it’s better received this time around, and that they can generate enough good will to recapture the breakout popularity of the original game’s first open beta tests.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p data-start="140" data-end="945">Laptops often get more praise than they deserve. While they’re convenient for mobility, nothing quite compares to a well-designed desk setup with large monitors, a responsive mechanical keyboard, and the comfort of a dedicated workspace. Such an environment not only boosts productivity but also creates a place you’ll genuinely enjoy returning to whenever it’s time to focus. One of the best ways to power a setup like this is with the Apple Mac Mini. Despite being a desktop machine, it’s still compact enough to take with you when needed. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">Even better, the 2024 version of Apple’s compact desktop is currently discounted by 17% on Amazon, dropping the price from $599 to $499.</a> If you’ve been considering an upgrade, this is an ideal moment to treat yourself while saving a whole $100.</p>
<p data-start="947" data-end="1618">The discounted model is the 2024 Apple Mac Mini equipped with Apple’s M4 chip, which features a 10-core CPU and 10-core GPU. The device is sold in 256 GB and 512 GB variants, although the higher-capacity version is currently selling for over $700. Alongside that storage, the system includes 16 GB of RAM. The M4 processor is the star of the show here, giving this compact desktop a tremendous performance boost. Apple claims it can operate up to 13 times faster than the fastest Intel-based Mac Mini. That makes the machine suitable for everyday productivity as well as demanding creative tasks like photo or video editing.</p>

<p data-start="1620" data-end="2060">In terms of connectivity, the 2024 Mac Mini packs a generous selection of ports and wireless options. You’ll find three Thunderbolt 4 ports, two USB-C ports, HDMI, and Gigabit Ethernet, along with Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 for fast and stable wireless connections. Apple may have phased out the headphone jack on the iPhone years ago, but it remains present on the Mac Mini, giving you the convenience of wired audio whenever you want it.</p>
<p data-start="2062" data-end="2748">The desktop comes loaded with macOS 15.1 Sequoia, which continues Apple’s emphasis on privacy and security. It includes an upgraded Secure Enclave to help safeguard your personal data and system integrity. MacOS supports a wide variety of software, from productivity essentials to creative tools. You can use the full Microsoft 365 suite, Adobe Creative Cloud applications, Zoom, and thousands of other programs.

<h2>Better With Apple Accessories</h2>
<p data-start="2750" data-end="3035">To enhance your experience even further, you can pair the Mac Mini with other Apple accessories. It works seamlessly with the Apple Studio Display and integrates perfectly with peripherals like the Magic Keyboard with Touch ID, offering a smooth and cohesive setup across your devices.</p>
<p data-start="3037" data-end="3278"><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4124/">For a short time, Amazon is selling the 2024 Mac Mini with the M4 chip for $499, an even $100 reduction from its standard price.</a> AppleCare+ isn’t included, but you can add three years of coverage for a combined total of $588—that’s at a $120 discount.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-arena-reloaded/</link>
            <guid>1374169</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Splitgate developer 1047 Games has announced that Splitgate 2 will be relaunching later this month under the new name SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded. The latest trailer shows that the game isn’t just relaunching with a new name, though, and that 1047 Games has been hard at work listening to community feedback and improving the game in as many areas as possible.</p>



<p>As said in the game’s latest YouTube trailer (see below), the game has seen a significant graphic overhaul, a pullback on the game’s heroes and abilities, and a rebuild of the game from the ground up, taking the best of Splitgate 1 and Splitgate 2 and removing what didn’t work.</p>







<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<div><p>In addition to those changes, SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded now also has player stats, leaderboards, a career system, and a new competitive experience.</p><p>SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded, Josh Watson, also revealed that the game will launch with five new maps, four new weapons, new modes, and more, with “A lot more to share in the coming weeks”.</p></div>



<h2 id="h-splitgate-s-redemption-arc">Splitgate’s Redemption Arc?</h2>



<p>After a horrible launch earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-developers-say-its-going-back-to-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Splitgate 2 was taken offline back to BETA</a> after the game failed to make a good impression on players and see significant player retention. Splitgate 2’s failed launch was hindered by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-ceo-apologizes-for-sgf-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controversial comments</a> from 1047 Games CEO Ian Proulx at Summer Games Fest and since then, the game struggled to find any kind of interest from the wider community.</p>



<p>Now, though, 1047 Games seems like it’s started a redemption arc by listening to the community and seemingly keeping Proulx away from the game’s marketing. The YouTube community on the trailer seem to suggest that players are once again interested, which would be a huge turnaround for the developers if they can pull it off.</p>







<p>The game is set to launch as a free-to-play title on December 17th on PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, and PC, with the latest game trailer </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cast-outs-reveal-trailer-drops-features-developers-from-closed-sony-london-studio-team/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony’s London Studio is back with fewer staff members and has been rebranded as Twisted Works. The team has revealed Cast Outs, which bears a striking resemblance to London Studio’s canceled game it was working on.</p>



<p>Last May, the unfortunate news broke that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstations-london-studio-has-closed-after-20-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation’s London Studio closed after 20 years</a>. The team primarily focused on games designed around gadgets, such as the EyeToy and PlayStation VR. But Twisted Works is comprised of several London Studio members, and they are working on Cast Outs.</p>







<h2 id="h-london-studio-developers-return-to-finish-what-they-started">London Studio Developers Return To Finish What They Started</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Back, sort of. Credit to Sony</figcaption></figure>



<p>In the wake of London Studio’s 2024 closure, everyone learned of a canceled PS5 game the developer was working on.</p>







<p>An online co-op game, Cast Outs uses fantasy elements in its London setting. You’ll need to embrace the fantastical arts, such as magic and spells. Here’s how Twisted Works described the game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Cast Outs&nbsp;brings you the pure spectacle of magic where spellcasting hits with the physical impact of a brawler and the immediate kick of a&nbsp;shooter. Dive into the ultimate magical urban battleground where you and your friends can truly cooperate, regardless of skill level. It’s the perfect balance of quick-fix fun and high-octane action, built to be played together.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Much of the footage and elements sound like the studio’s original canceled project. Development must be moving along well, as the studio is already talking about a beta: “We are entering production soon and plan to release an early access beta in early 2027.”</p>



<p>You can see the reveal trailer for yourself.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The Game Bakers have announced a new release date for their mountain climbing game Cairn, which was delayed back in September as the team needed more time. The new release date for Cairn is January 29th, when it will be released for PC and PS5. Ahead of the full release, you can play the Cairn demo on Steam and PS5 to get an idea of what to expect on your climb of Kami.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cairn - Launch Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/x6KWhvvk3bM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Game Bakers has also revealed the details of the Deluxe Edition, along with pricing for the different versions of the game. The Cairn Deluxe Edition will include a Kami travel book, wallpapers, and three keepsakes that can be added to main character Aava’s rucksack. Both versions will have a 10% launch discount with the standard edition priced at $26.99/26.99€ / £22.99 / JP¥3060 / CN¥98 and the Deluxe Edition priced at $34.20/ 34.20€ / £28.60 / JP¥3924 / CN¥129.</p>
<p>In Cairn, players climb the mountain Kami as explorer Aava. On this journey, Aava will find traces of past climbs, historical artefacts that tell the story of the mountain, and run into other climbers who are on their own journeys. Cairn is a realistic climbing simulator where you will need to guide Aava to suitable holds for her hands and feet, while also maintaining balance so she does not fall off of Mount Kami.</p>

                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p>According to a report by&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.thewrap.com/netflix-wins-the-warner-bros-discovery-bidding-war-enters-exclusive-deal-talks/">TheWrap</a> </em>and <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/netflix-to-acquire-warner-bros">now Netflix itself</a>, Netflix is now entering exclusive talks to buy Warner Bros. Discovery, having outbid other competitors for the&nbsp;<em>Batman</em>-owning megacorp. If the deal goes through, said to be at over $27 a share, it would mean the streaming giant would own everything from HBO to DC comics, including all your favorite Lego and <em>Batman</em> games.</p> <p>Warner Bros. boss David Zaslav has been making it clear he wants to sell the company for a good while now, but holding out for a big exit. In October this year he <a href="https://kotaku.com/holy-monopoly-batman-warner-bros-reportedly-reject-a-buyout-bid-from-paramount-2000634581">turned down a bid from Paramount</a> said to be at $20 a share, with&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-12/warner-bros-is-said-to-rebuff-paramount-takeover-approach"><em>Bloomberg</em> claiming</a> the CEO was holding out for 50 percent higher. That valuation seemed crazy, and it was assumed that Paramount came in much lower to test the waters, with the expectation of either a $25 per share bid to follow, or more hostile takeover moves. However, instead, it seems Netflix has swooped in close enough to that $30 offer, working out to a price of $82.7 billion, and thus won the war. Should things go to Netflix and Warners’ plans, the purchase should be complete by the end of 2026.</p>

 <h2>What are the implications of this deal?</h2> <p>If the deal goes through, this would mean streaming giant Netflix would own one of its big rivals, HBO Max, and presumably look to merge the two services. It would also own Warner’s entire movie business including New Line Cinema, all of DC Entertainement, the Discovery network of channels, and multiple networks like CNN, TBS, TNT and the Cartoon Network. And, of course, Warner Bros. Games.</p>

 <p>In a normal universe, this would be the sort of deal that would be tangled in monopolistic concerns for years to come, as people questioned the unparalleled power this could offer Netflix over multiple industries. However, given other recent mergers that have taken place after, um, payments made to the Trump orbit, what might happen is anyone’s guess. However, earlier talk last month of the potential deal between Netflix and Warner <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/netflix-warner-bros-bid-antitrust-concerns-darrell-issa-letter/">resulted in antitrust concerns being raised</a>, and certainly there will be a lot of fight from those concerned how the deal could affect Hollywood.</p>

 <p>Yet, at the same time, Paramount was allowed to merge with Skydance and Disney was allowed to buy Fox, so Netflix has plenty of precedent to argue from. As it happens, it could be Paramount that objects the loudest to the Netflix deal, given how it and so many others had assumed it would get Warner eventually, and the company is <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/04/paramount-questions-warner-bros-discovery-sale-process-letter.html">already questioning the “fairness and adequacy”</a> of the process. A Paramount attorney wrote, “It has become increasingly clear, through media reporting and otherwise, that WBD appears to have abandoned the semblance and reality of a fair transaction process, thereby abdicating its duties to stockholders, and embarked on a myopic process with a predetermined outcome that favors a single bidder.”</p>

 <h2>A messy breakup for gaming?</h2> <p>The Netflix deal also makes another aspect of Warner Bros. Discovery more interesting. <a href="https://www.wbd.com/news/warner-bros-discovery-separate-two-leading-media-companies">Zaslav had appeared determined to break up the company</a> such that its linear cable channel businesses would be separated from the rest, and then that loss-making sector take all the company’s debt with it. Because that’s legal I guess. This is something Paramount was trying to prevent with its purchase attempt, however, according to a press release put out by Netflix, the intention is to buy Warner Bros. <em>after</em> Zaslav’s division, seeing the profitless cable channels become a new company called Discovery Global and not be part of the sale.</p>

 <p>Netflix’s co-CEO Ted Sarandos said in the press release,</p> <blockquote><p><span data-darkreader-inline-color="">“By combining Warner Bros.’ incredible library of shows and movies—from timeless classics like </span><em><span data-darkreader-inline-color="">Casablanca </span></em><span data-darkreader-inline-color="">and </span><em><span data-darkreader-inline-color="">Citizen Kane </span></em><span data-darkreader-inline-color="">to modern favorites like </span><em><span data-darkreader-inline-color="">Harry Potter</span></em><span data-darkreader-inline-color=""> and </span><em><span data-darkreader-inline-color="">Friends</span></em><span data-darkreader-inline-color="">—with our culture-defining titles like<em> S</em></span><em><span data-darkreader-inline-color="">tranger Things</span></em><span data-darkreader-inline-color="">, </span><em><span data-darkreader-inline-color="">KPop Demon Hunters</span></em><span data-darkreader-inline-color=""> and </span><em><span data-darkreader-inline-color="">Squid Game</span></em><span data-darkreader-inline-color="">, we’ll be able to do that even better. Together, we can give audiences more of what they love and help define the next century of storytelling.”</span></p></blockquote> <p>At the same time, the deal could be very concerning for games players, given <a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-gaming-hades-monument-vally-golden-idol-braid-1851785038">Netflix’s very clear backward step from anything other than mobile gaming</a>. Its owning the studios that develop the <em>Arkham</em> and&nbsp;<em>Lego</em> games could mean bad times for console players if the pattern continues.</p>

 <p>There’s obviously a lot of fighting to come, and presumably some hefty legal challenges from those who feel dropped at the altar, let alone the antitrust maneuvers. But given [broad sweeping gesture], it won’t be in the least bit surprising to see it happening sooner rather than later.</p> <p><strong>Updated: 12/05/2025, 8:35 a.m. ET:</strong> Updated the post above to add details from Netflix’s press release, including the money involved.</p>

Two titanic storefronts that control access to a huge portion of the PC market have blacklisted a title seemingly without rhyme or reason.

That means the streamer has bid farewell to Spry Fox, which has been sold back to its founding team just a few years after Netflix purchased the studio.
