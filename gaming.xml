            <p>
Maybe you've heard of Kamala Harris; she's the current US vice president and very likely the Democratic party's official presidential nominee for November's US election. But now she's firmly back in the spotlight, the mildly curious case of her secret life in developer Remedy's 2019 action-adventure Control has resurfaced online.
</p>
<p>
You see, pinned to a whiteboard in an unassuming corner of The Oldest House - the transdimensional Brutalist office block at the heart of Control's story - is a picture of a missing 40-year-old Bureau employee, Jane Farland, lost during one of the House's shifts. Only, Photoshopped eyes aside, Jane Farland is the spitting image of Vice President Harris.
</p>
<p>
Harris' surprise secret life as a fictitious video game character has been noted before - in this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/controlgame/comments/d0rhzv/kamala_harris_apparently_exists_as_a_different/">five-year-old Reddit thread</a>, for instance - but the picture has started gaining traction again as Harris once again makes headlines thanks to her likely US presidential bid.

<p>
Unfortunately, the story behind the image is a little harder to uncover. Journalist Stephen Totilo tried to get to the bottom of it as part of his latest <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/">Game File newsletter</a>, first pinpointing the image's location to a whiteboard near an elevator in Control's Central Executive hub.
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
Unfortunately, Totilo's attempts to get a comment from Remedy on Harris' appearance in Control have so far been met with silence (I've reached out to the developer, just in case it's feeling chattier today), but the real answer is likely to be a fairly boring one.
</p>
<p>
The image appears to be an only lightly doctored official photo from Harris' time as a US Senator. And given US government materials are generally in the public domain, Remedy would be free to use Harris' headshot if it was Googling "US federal employee in a business suit" for its missing person whiteboard (notably, Harris isn't the only real-life US senator who appears there). One eye-tweak later and - ta da! - another in-game asset is complete.
</p>
<p>
Still, if Jane Farland suddenly finds her way back to The Oldest House in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedys-control-2-still-in-proof-of-concept-stage-as-max-payne-remake-enters-production-readiness">Control 2</a> and she's <em>still</em> got Kamala Harris' face, then Remedy might have some explaining to do.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-team-is-exploring-how-to-test-6v6-in-the-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>One of the biggest changes made by Blizzard to Overwatch 2 is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-pvp-5v5-maps-hero-looks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switch</a> from 6v6 matches to 5v5. However, a sizable amount of fans of the original game remained vocal about reintroducing 6v6 in some form, and the developers are taking that feedback seriously.</p>
<p>Today, Game Director Aaron Keller explained the hurdles it'll have to overcome first. The first and biggest reason is the need to do this in a way that allows the game to have optimized technical performance with 12 players in a match: a number of upgrades and additions to Overwatch 2 impact the game's performance. In a 6v6 setting, these upgrades can significantly impact players using older systems.</p>
<p>While a time-limited Overwatch 2 test could come sooner, the team is still investigating exactly how long it would take to permanently improve performance across the entire game. This endeavor will likely take at least several seasons, said Blizzard.</p>
<p>Another issue is what to do with queue times, which was the main reason for switching from 6v6 to 5v5 in the first place. They have some ideas, but there's no guarantee they'll work. Moreover, Blizzard understandably wishes to make sure that those who enjoy the game as it is today are not frustrated by these attempts to reintroduce 6v6.</p>
<p>The current objective is to run a test for a few weeks and gauge the community's interest. Then, the developers would measure its impact on the other experiences in Overwatch 2, like 5v5, arcade, etc. They'd use the lessons from that playtest to see what could be learned about the mode within the current game ecosystem and for the future of the franchise. They would carefully ponder on the learnings from each test and how they can best give players what they want. Whether that's a 5v5 world, a 6v6 world, or both will be figured out in the future.</p>
<p>In other Overwatch 2 news, the first Mythic weapon skin was <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2s-first-mythic-weapon-skin-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> earlier this week, giving Reinhardt fans a cool new cosmetic to purchase.</p>

But by the end of the nearly 4,000-word blog post, it’s clear that the team is still struggling to define <em>Overwatch 2</em>, which once again leads us back to the question: Why does it exist in the first place?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195460" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="195460,196880,196049" data-current="195460"><div><p>Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20938.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Overwatch 2</em> was originally meant to exist alongside the original game, bringing new PvE elements and a shared multiplayer ecosystem across both titles.

All of those changes have led to where we are today, a spot that many feel is stagnant and unenjoyable.<br></p><p>Role Queue ensures you’re not playing competitive matches with no healers (which was incredibly frustrating in the original game), but Keller acknowledges that this consistency made <em>Overwatch </em>“start to feel samey.” I’ve played hundreds of hours of competitive <em>Overwatch 2</em>, and so many of my matches have blurred together into a streak of sameness. “Could there be an in-between version that softens the original problems without completely solving them and also isn’t quite as reactive as our current Role Queue system?” Keller wonders.<br></p><p>Unfortunately, the shift to 5v5 also somewhat flattened <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s gameplay. “The world of 6v6 could have really high, highs but reaaaaally low, lows,” Keller wrote. “One of the design goals of 5v5 was to try to raise that floor, even though it was at the expense of some of those high moments.” The 5v5 change removed the secondary tank role, which helps prevent matches from getting stunlocked and drastically reduces queue times, but also fundamentally alters the way every single role is played.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="bc07d74f25c4990ec0c200250242549f" data-recommend-id="image://bc07d74f25c4990ec0c200250242549f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="D.VA and Orisa face off." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="D.VA and Orisa face off." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bc07d74f25c4990ec0c200250242549f" data-recommend-id="image://bc07d74f25c4990ec0c200250242549f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="D.VA and Orisa face off." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Support players, no longer tasked with keeping two massive tanks afloat, have to be more aggressive, adding their damage to an already high-damage pool thanks to the dual DPS characters. And the tank, rather than having a secondary, or off-tank, to support them, is now the biggest hero on the field and the most likely to bear the brunt of every enemy player’s damage and utilities. Tanks now play to exist, to stay alive, rather than playmake.<br></p><p>“Having two [tanks] allowed one to focus on protecting their backline while the other held ground or pushed into the enemy team,” Keller writes about 6v6. “The tank role had a lot of depth in understanding how to work with the other tank on the team.” And as <em>Overwatch</em> players have pointed out, so many of the tanks’ existing kits are tailored for 6v6 play, which too-often renders off-tank choices like Wrecking Ball completely unviable, especially in competitive matches.<br></p><p>The struggle to balance tanks for 5v5 play has persisted for nearly two years.

No shit.<br></p><h2 id="h10971"><a id=""></a><strong>Five versus six</strong></h2><p>The crux of what many players believe is the issue with the 5v5 swap is that the majority of <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s characters, maps, and modes were built for 6v6 play. Some suggest that Blizzard, rather than making major changes like nerfing shields (which would render problematic <em>Overwatch 1</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWbegqdb2o8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWbegqdb2o8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">metas like pirate ship</a></span> useless), the team just pulled the second tank. Pulling that second tank removes freedom of choice for tank players and robs us of the variety of gameplay styles and approaches that comes from finding the perfect balance between two tanks.<br></p><p>It also puts more pressure on the supports to keep that singular tank afloat, while ensuring that DPS players have to choose specific heroes to counter the singular, beefed-up enemy tank. Not to mention the burden the singular tank player has to bear—if they can’t keep up with the enemy tank, matches are wildly unfun for them and their squad.<br></p><p>Warring team composition factions within the <em>Overwatch </em>community are nearly split right down the middle, as evidenced by a March poll from former OWL esports player Jake Lyon, in which 51.9% of players said they preferred 5v5 to the original 6v6 supporters’ 48.1%. That almost-even split tells me one thing: this is more about personal preference than what is objectively better, as there are downsides to both formats. As Keller writes in the blog, “Our players have different opinions and preferences about the ideal number of players in an <em>Overwatch</em> match, and so does our team.”</p><p>For more flexible, top-down players, 5v5 is a perfectly fine experience, as they can easily swap between any character in their role’s roster to ensure the match is a success.

As Keller and others have made clear, there are pros and cons to both versions of <em>Overwatch</em>’s core multiplayer mode. There’s no singular, simplistic solution to this problem that Blizzard has inadvertently created.</p><figure id="" data-id="79100238fdd4db4ee7b14915aecc96f9" data-recommend-id="image://79100238fdd4db4ee7b14915aecc96f9" data-format="png" data-width="1427" data-height="805" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Overwatch 2 x Transformers collab." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Overwatch 2 x Transformers collab." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Blizzard</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="79100238fdd4db4ee7b14915aecc96f9" data-recommend-id="image://79100238fdd4db4ee7b14915aecc96f9" data-format="png" data-width="1427" data-height="805" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Overwatch 2 x Transformers collab." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h10972"><a id=""></a><strong>Now what?</strong></h2><p>Keller’s blog post is clear: Blizzard is “focused on making 5v5 the best experience that it can be.” But, the team is also “open-minded to re-evaluating our decisions based on your actions and feedback.” As we’ve seen in the last year or so, Blizzard has experimented with gameplay changes in its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-quick-play-hacked-hero-limits-season-9-1851319812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-quick-play-hacked-hero-limits-season-9-1851319812">Quick Play: Hacked mode</a></span>, including increasing the speed of objective captures and payload movement (a change it ultimately kept in the game).

And Keller voices concerns with “opening Pandora’s box” when it comes to queue times, which will likely increase with the inclusion of an extra player on your squad. “The team was not able to solve this problem previously,” he admits. But would 6v6 loyalists even care that they have to wait longer to get their preferred game mode back?<br></p><p>This latest Director’s Take promises that “this isn’t the last time [Blizzard will] be getting into 5v5 or 6v6,” so I’m sure the debate will continue on for many more months. I just want to get out of gold in support, please. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Want to find a career in the world of esports? With competitive video games constantly on the rise, more and more career options within the field are opening up. But is esports a good career? And what type of career options are there in competitive video games? In this guide, we’re breaking down everything that you need to know about getting a job in esports.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-can-you-find-a-good-career-in-esports">Can You Find a Good Career In Esports?</h2>



<p>New career options in esports are popping up every day. As the industry continues to grow, people are beginning to find new roles that need to be accompanied. Let’s not forget that a career in competitive video games is relatively new, meaning there is still so much for us to learn about it.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Is working in esports a good career move? Or is it just a failure waiting to happen? Well, it depends on what section of esports you are looking to create a career in.</p>







<h2 id="h-esport-career-options">Esport Career Options</h2>



<p>There are plenty of career options in esports. Many do not require a college degree – most personalities and experts working in esports got there without any formal qualification <strong>in an esports capacity</strong>. It can be tough to make a living in some roles though, and salaries are typically a little lower than in closely competing career paths.</p>



<p>For instance, holding a career as a professional player is incredibly difficult. It’s the same as being a professional athlete. You have to take care of yourself while also devoting your life to whatever game you play. And still, you are not guaranteed a spot at the top. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>However, many other career options in competitive gaming could be considered suitable for those without top-tier gaming skills. It’s not all about the players, after all – an esports career can be quite diverse. Finding the best career in esports, though, is subjective, as it just matters what type of skillsets you can bring to the table.</p>



<p><strong>Here is a list of different esports careers:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Esports Journalist</li>



<li>Esports Caster</li>



<li>Tournament Coordinator</li>



<li>Player Manager</li>



<li>Team Manager</li>



<li>PR for an Esports Organization</li>



<li>HR for an Esports Organization</li>



<li>Broadcast Director</li>



<li>Broadcast Worker</li>



<li>Event Worker</li>



<li>Esports Marketing</li>



<li>Content Creator</li>
</ul>



<p>While this is a broad list of esports careers, there are still many other options out there that may not even seem plausible. Over the last ten years or so, the industry has blossomed, and around the world, there are <strong>thousands </strong>of esports job opportunities.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-an-esports-career">How To Get An Esports Career</h2>



<p>Figuring out how to find a job in esports can be quite difficult. There are very few colleges offering esports-related degrees at the moment, meaning many people will have to get their foot in the door elsewhere.</p>



<p>Luckily, many degrees such as PR, Marketing, Business Management and more can easily help you find a job in the world of esports. The only issue, though, is many jobs are hoping you have some sort of experience relating to competitive video games. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>So, how do you get that experience? How does someone get a career in esports? Well, making connections is a great place to start. Go to events, meet people, create a presence online, and start creating your own esports-related content or blogs. Hiring managers want to see dedication towards the industry when they sit down to interview you.</p>



<p>Sure, you may get lucky and get hired in the world of esports after being fresh out of college with just a basic marketing degree, but if you can show a future employer that you have already begun to make a name for yourself in the industry, then you will have a much better chance at receiving a job.</p>



<h2 id="h-ultimately-is-esports-a-good-career">Ultimately, Is Esports a Good Career?</h2>



<p>This is one of those verticals that’s getting more popular all the time, so it’s of course becoming more competitive. Trends are emerging, requiring jobseekers to seek higher qualifications for jobs in esports, and many roles want multifaceted employees who have transferable skills in several areas. For instance, you could be a Social Media Manager for an esports organisation, but they’d want you to have photo and video editing experience, community management experience, and even qualifications or experience in journalism – or <strong>psychology</strong>.</p>



<p>With that being said, esports is a good career choice because it’s so dynamic, and you’ll be working at the forefront of one of the most exciting industries in the technical world. Everyone working in esports is spearheading the growth of the industry, and hundreds of millions of fans have their eyes fixed firmly on everything that happens within it.</p>



<p>If you’re happy accepting a lower-than-average salary and working a little harder to stay innovative and dynamic, then yes, esports is a good career – it also helps if you <strong>love </strong>competitive gaming.</p>

Additionally, there will be a native version of the game on Steam, and players won't have to use the EA App (the successor to Origin) to play it on PC.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dragon Age: The Veilguard Is a Great Start For Newcomers | Summer Game Fest 2024</p>
      </div>
<p>This is a stark contrast to EA's previous games, which required players to have the EA app to play on PC. However, the game will still need players to agree to a third-party EULA, as noted by the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a>. This year, there was particular blowback with other publishers requiring third-party accounts to play Steam games, most notably with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-helldivers-2-mandatory-psn-sign-in-requirement-following-player-uproar/1100-6523180/" data-ref-id="1100-6523180">Helldivers 2</a>.</p><p>BioWare also said that it will be providing more details about the game's launch later this summer. It's due out sometime this fall for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. So far, there's been quite a bit info out there about the game, including it having a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-a-no-death-setting/1100-6524662/" data-ref-id="1100-6524662">no-death option</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioware-explains-why-dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-not-open-world/1100-6524197/" data-ref-id="1100-6524197">being mission-based rather than open-world</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-gonna-show-a-lot-of-skin/1100-6524909/" data-ref-id="1100-6524909">apparently a lot of nudity</a>.</p>

From Winslow’s review: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>I’m here for everything <em>Rise of the Ronin</em> is serving because I’m still having a great time with Team Ninja’s latest game. I’m enjoying the combat, which is approachable, deep, and varied. I’m enjoying the setting, which is inspired by IRL events I’ve studied for years. I’m enjoying the characters, all of whom are three-dimensional and memorable. (I’ve teared up a few times when some of my fave characters died.) Hell, I’m even enjoying the uninspired side content simply because I get to swing my sword. </p><p>For better and worse, <em>Rise of the Ronin</em> is Team Ninja’s “Greatest Hits” RPG. There might be a dud or two in the tracklist, but on the whole, this record—I mean, game—bangs.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Larian Studios has successfully resolved the<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-closed-beta-has-been-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> dice-rolling issue</a>, and as a result, the highly anticipated Baldur’s Gate 3 patch 7 closed beta is now live exclusively on Steam. If you’re one of the fortunate players chosen, you can find the link to download the playtest in your Steam Library.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The developers have also requested players not to share spoilers from the new update, as most players cannot access the closed beta. The beta test is an ongoing process, and you still have the chance to sign up, as Larian will be adding more players throughout this period. Keep an eye on your Steam Library for updates. If you were among the lucky few selected, you can compare notes with other participants through this Discord server.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Several players in the comment section have posted screenshots for their invites for Baldur’s Gate 3 patch 7 closed beta. Some can access the beta directly through the game’s Steam store page; others have received a special invite email. The ones that couldn’t get in the first time shouldn’t lose hope, as Larian might randomly select them when letting in another batch of players. Also, the developers have confirmed that the closed beta is unavailable for console players.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition is now widely available to play via GeForce Now across various platforms.<a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-has-been-integrated-in-xbox-game-pages-premium-memberships-are-discounted-and-theres-new-games-too/"> GeForce NOW</a> already has an expansive library, but now this iconic classic has made its way into it. Along with Skyrim, eight other games will be joining the library.</p>
<p>If you play The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim through GeForce NOW, you can stream it to your device without worrying about your specs. This includes your laptop, a MacBook, and even a Chromebook.</p>
<p>Those who are members of GeForce NOW will get access to a new reward if they participate in the World of Warships challenges, which will be available until July 30. By doing so, you can earn a GeForce NOW one-day priority code each day.</p>
<p>Along with the nine games added to the GeForce NOW library, the summer sale is still available. Those interested in purchasing the Ultimate and Priority memberships can get 50% off their subscription.</p>
<p>While there is the option for a free subscription, the options are limited, allowing you to play for an hour at a time. If you <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-gb/geforce-now/how-to-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pay for the Priority subscription</a>, you can play up to 6 hours per session with 60 FPS. If you want a premium experience, the Ultimate subscription allows you to play for 8 hours at a time with up to 240 FPS.</p>
<p>By connecting to your Steam, Epic Games, Ubisoft, EA Origin, or even a GOG account, you will have access to a library of games that you can stream to your setup.</p>
<p>The latest games to be added to the library are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cataclismo (Available on Steam)</li>
<li>CONSCRIPT (Available on Steam)</li>
<li>F1 Manager 2024 (Available on Steam)</li>
<li>EARTH DEFENSE FORCE 6 (Available on Steam)</li>
<li>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (Available on Steam)</li>
<li>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition (Available on Steam, Epic Games Store, and PC Game Pass)</li>
<li>Gang Beasts (Available on Steam and PC Game Pass)</li>
<li>Kingdoms and Castles (Steam)</li>
<li>The Settlers: New Allies (Steam)</li>
</ul>
<p>For those unfamiliar with how GeForce NOW works, it doesn't offer games to play. The games listed are now compatible with GeForce NOW, and if you already own them, you will be able to play them using a GeForce NOW rig. This is important to remember if you're considering subscribing but don't have a games library of your own across any platforms. Any of the compatible GeForce NOW games will need to be purchased unless specified as Free to Play.</p>

The forbidden city of Akratya is an unforgiving land that cannot be conquered alone. Bind with fallen warriors found throughout your crusade and dynamically transform between characters seamlessly in mid-combat with the unique four-hero party system.</p><p>The fallen are individual characters with their own unique skill sets, combat styles, and rich history. By absorbing their essence, you inherit the fiber of their very being. Conflicts and synergies between characters greatly impact gameplay, so relationships must be balanced. Strong synergies may offer combat buffs that can spell disaster for the ruthless boss awaiting your steel and magic.</p><p>Throughout combat, you will charge a sync meter shared across all characters. During an opportune moment, dispel your sync meter and unleash a devastating Morphstrike using the combined power of the bound fallen warriors. When faced with a formidable abomination, a precisely executed Morphstrike can be the deciding factor between life and death.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The world of <em>Deathbound</em> has been lovingly crafted and influenced by the developer’s homeland of Brazil, a vibrant culture brimming with life, creativity, rhythm, and a rich history. From the Afro-Brazilian martial art of capoeira to the sweeping music cascading through Akratya, Trialforge’s origins shine throughout every aspect of <em>Deathbound</em>.</p></blockquote><p><em>Deathbound</em> is due out for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1277130/Deathbound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, <a title="Companies > Epic Games [339 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/epic-games">Epic Games</a> Store, <a href="https://www.gog.com/wishlist/games/deathbound" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOG</a> on August 8.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The Sega Dreamcast's VMU was a technological marvel in its day: a memory card with its own screen and control setup that hosted its own basic minigames. Well, one modder decided to take its capabilities a little further by creating a VMU that can play Sega Genesis games.</p><p dir="ltr">X/Twitter user @GGEAR_TARO posted <a href="https://x.com/GGEAR_TARO/status/1805496381743997316" rel="nofollow ">multiple clips</a> of the modded VMU in action, including the iconic intro of the original Streets of Rage and gameplay of Space Harrier 2. Naturally, the VMU's tiny D-pad might present some problems when compared to a traditional controller, but it's a very cool idea that represents a fantasy a lot of Sega fans had for the VMU back in the day.</p><p dir="ltr">While it might seem somewhat strange, this isn't the first innovation to hit the VMU scene in the past few years. Back in 2022, a company called Dreamwave Enterprises <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/vm2-the-next-gen-vmu-for-the-dreamcast#/" rel="nofollow ">crowdfunded</a> a decidedly unofficial upgrade to the VMU, the VM2. It features a better screen with a backlight, a higher resolution, microSD storage, external charging, and PC connectivity, among other features. In other Sega news, the company recently revealed a new trailer for the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-is-coming-october-25-new-trailer-revealed-at-summer-game-fest/1100-6524053/" data-ref-id="1100-6524053">Sonic X Shadow Generations</a> at Summer Game Fest, and it releases on October 25.</p>

BioWare has updated the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard/">Steam page</a> to confirm it’s been verified for Steam Deck.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/Hrungry/status/1816450818658500668">Hrungr on X</a>, this means that The Veilguard will be fully functional on Valve’s handheld, which has not been confirmed until now. Consider this a quick PSA for PC players who enjoy playing their role-playing games on the small(ish) screen.&nbsp;</p>
