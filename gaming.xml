            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-wins-igns-2024-peoples-choice-tournament<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The tournament started with 64 entries and crowned one fan-voted champion.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">There were some incredible games released this year, and we wanted to know which you thought was the best of the best. So with our partners at Truth, we picked 64 of 2024’s best games, put them in a head-to-head tournament, and gave you the power to vote for your favorites. After six rounds of voting and more than 1 million votes in all, one game reigned supreme as champion: Black Myth: Wukong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">An action game from developer Game Science, Black Myth: Wukong is inspired by the classic Chinese novel Journey to the West. You play as the Destined One, an anthropomorphic monkey based on Sun Wukong from the novel. You wield a staff with different stances, have access to several magic spells, and can transform into enemies after defeating them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-review-pc"><u>IGN’s review</u></a>, we cited its fantastic combat, beautiful environments, and well-designed bosses as the areas where it shines. While it may not be a soulslike, its combat can be quite challenging and forces you to weave together quick reflexes, smart resource management, and versatile attacks to take down its many bosses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Myth: Wukong’s popularity was obvious from the very start of our fan-voted tournament. It had a dominant run, culminating in a win over Marvel Rivals in the final with 59% of the vote. Before that, it had to get through Harry Potter: Quidditch Championship, Star Wars Outlaws, Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership, Stellar Blade, and Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, beating all of them with at least 67% of the vote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Rivals’ run to the final was more contested, with it barely beating out the Silent Hill 2 remake in the semifinals and Astro Bot in the quarterfinals, which was one of the closest matchups of the whole tournament. There were more than 50,000 votes cast in that matchup, and Marvel Rivals won by only 960. Before those close calls, it had to get through some stiff competition in World of Warcraft: The War Within, Batman: Arkham Shadow, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-game-of-2024"><u>pick for Best Game of 2024</u></a> went to Metaphor: ReFantazio, but it didn’t make it out of the first round of the People’s Choice Tournament. Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership took it down before falling to Black Myth: Wukong in its path to the title. Indie darling Balatro, one of IGN’s runners-up for Best Game of 2024 and winner of our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pc-game-of-2024"><u>Best PC Game of 2024 Award</u></a>, also had a surprisingly short run. After narrowly defeating Still Wakes the Deep in the first round, it got only 26% of the vote in Round 2 against Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 2 had a very impressive run overall, taking down multiple big names on its way to the Final Four. In addition to its resounding win over Balatro, it also defeated Sons of the Forest, Dragon’s Dogma 2, and Final Fantasy 7: Rebirth, another of IGN’s runners-up for Best Game of 2024. The other member of the Final Four was Silent Hill 2, which won the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-horror-game-of-2024"><u>IGN Award for Best Horror Game of 2024</u></a>. It got to the semifinals by going through Life Is Strange: Double Exposure, Helldivers 2, Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD, and Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thank you to the many people who logged votes in this year’s People’s Choice Tournament. Let us know in the comments below what you think of the outcome. If you disagree with the winner, which game would you have chosen? And here’s to another great year of gaming in 2025!</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/these-are-the-lasting-things-that-half-life-2-gave-us-besides-headcrabs-and-crowbars/">more than two decades since <em>Half-Life 2</em></a>'s release have been filled with plenty of rumors and hints about <em>Half-Life 3</em>, ranging from the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/valve-secrets-spill-over-including-half-life-3-in-new-steam-documentary-app/">official</a>-<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/valve-half-life-alyx-is-not-the-end-of-the-franchise/">ish</a> to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/half-life-3-totally-absolutely-confirmed-by-hidden-dota-2-update-file/">thin</a> to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/mysterious-black-mesa-website-says-its-not-secretly-working-on-half-life-3/">downright</a> <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/10/valve-registers-european-trademark-for-half-life-3/">misleading</a>. As we head into 2025, though, we're approaching something close to a critical mass of rumors and leaks suggesting that <em>Half-Life 3</em> is really in the works this time, and could be officially announced in the coming months.</p>
<p>The latest tease came just before the end of 2024 via <a href="https://x.com/mikeshapiroland/status/1874213952680607922">a New Year's Eve social media video</a> from <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0788587/">G-Man voice actor Mike Shapiro</a>. In the voice of the mysterious in-game bureaucrat, Shapiro expresses hopes that "the next quarter century [will] deliver as many <em>unexpected surprises</em> as did the millennium's first (emphasis added)... See you in the new year."</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="und"><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Valve?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Valve</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Halflife?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Halflife</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/GMan?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#GMan</a> #2025 <a href="https://t.co/mdT5hlxKJT">pic.twitter.com/mdT5hlxKJT</a></p>
<p>— Mike Shapiro (@mikeshapiroland) <a href="https://twitter.com/mikeshapiroland/status/1874213952680607922?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 31, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>The post is all the more notable because it's Shapiro's first in over four years, when he concluded a flurry of promotional posts surrounding the release of <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> (many of which were in-character as G-Man). And in 2020, just after <em>Alyx</em>'s release, Shapiro <a href="https://www.vg247.com/mike-shapiro-voice-of-the-g-man-says-the-next-game-hes-in-will-be-like-seeing-an-old-friend-again">told USGamer</a> that he had recently worked on a "blast from the past" project that he would "announce... on my Twitter feed when I'm allowed to" (no such announcement has been forthcoming for any other game).</p>
<p>"I was working on that game for quite a while before I knew [what it was]," Shapiro said at the time of the unannounced project. "There was a rehearsal and some recordings, and after one of the recording sessions I was having a drink with the director. He told me what the game was, and nobody knows that this is coming.</p>
<p>"This is going to be such a mindblowing re-up from what people have come to know," Shapiro continued in 2020. "It's going to really... it's going to make people have a complete re-understanding of what they thought they knew about the story in the game prior to it, and I don't even know if people are expecting it."</p>
<h2>Raised HLX-pectations</h2>
<p>On its own, a single in-character post from a voice actor would probably be a bit too cryptic to excite <em>Half-Life</em> fans who have seen their sequel hopes dashed so often over the last two decades. But the unexpected tease comes amid a wave of leaks and rumors surrounding "HLX," an internal Valve project that has been referenced in a number of other Source 2 engine game files recently.</p>

<p>Betting in Counter-Strike has been a major factor of the game’s incredible growth, especially since the introduction of skins to CS:GO. The betting scene in Counter-Strike has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-csgo-and-cs2-skin-gambling-legal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gone through many changes</a>, but there’s still plenty of opportunities available to those (of legal age) who want to play.</p>



<p>These tips for betting on Counter-Strike aren’t going to tell you the teams or players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-bet-on-counter-strike-esports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can reliably bet on</a>. Instead, these tips will go over the best practices for betting on Counter-Strike, so that you can play safely and responsibly.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-tips-for-betting-on-counter-strike">Best tips for betting on Counter-Strike</h2>



<h3 id="h-bet-responsibly">Bet responsibly</h3>



<p>Playing responsibly when betting on Counter-Strike should be considered a rule instead of a tip. Gambling and betting can be fun, but it can also be addictive and costly if you don’t play smart. </p>



<p>Here are some essential guidelines for betting responsibly on Counter-Strike, or any game.</p>



<p><strong>Never bet more than you’re comfortable losing.</strong> This is the golden rule of betting. Placing large wagers that promise large payouts can be tempting, but if things don’t go your way, you could end up losing too much.</p>



<p><strong>Learn proper bet unit size.</strong> Knowing how much to bet is crucial to playing responsibly and sustainably. To do this, you’ll need to establish your bankroll.</p>



<ul>
<li>A bankroll is the amount of money you set aside to bet with for a specific amount of time. This can either be for a season, a month, or even a year.</li>



<li>Your bankroll determines your unit size, which is how much you bet with. For example, if you have a $100 bankroll set aside for a month, your unit size should be $1 or $2.</li>
</ul>



<p>The type of bet you place will influence the unit size you use. On a relatively safe bet with lower odds, you should bet one or two units. But for more higher risk wagers, like multi-leg parlays or longshot bets, you should be betting fractions of a unit.</p>



<h3 id="h-take-advantage-of-all-the-sites-available">Take advantage of all the sites available</h3>



<p>There are a number of websites that offer the opportunity to bet on Counter-Strike. These sites consist primarily of esports-focused sites where you can bet on professional match outcomes, and skin gambling sites. </p>



<p>Regardless of which kind of betting you’re more interested in, here are some tips for making the most out of all the sites available.</p>



<ul>
<li>Compare sites to find the best odds. When betting on Counter-Strike matches, differing sites may offer better or worse odds for the outcome you’re betting on. Taking the extra time to find the site with the best odds is worth the reward if your be hits.</li>



<li>Take advantage of sign-up/deposit bonuses. If you’re just getting into Counter-Strike betting now, there are number of sites that will offer bonuses for signing up or placing your first deposit (sometimes you’ll need a promo code). Make sure you read the full details before depositing, but taking advantage of a bonus should reward you with some additional funds.</li>
</ul>



<p>With any site though, make sure it’s a reputable, trustworthy site before you sign up or do anything else. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/someone-made-a-captcha-where-you-play-doom-on-nightmare-difficulty/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>It's a WebAssembly application, but it was made via a human language, prompt-driven web development tool called <a href="https://v0.dev/">v0</a> that's part of a suite of features offered as part of Vercel, a cloud-based developer tool service, of which Rauch is the CEO. You can see the LLM bot chat history with the <a href="https://v0.dev/chat/4X85A52Dzde#vZBwKTIde4ZPopW5ExYEzIi38oM6vJzm">series of prompts</a> that produced this CAPTCHA game on the v0 website.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, there has been a past attempt at making a <em>Doom</em> CAPTCHA. In 2021, developer Miquel Camps Orteza made <a href="https://vivirenremoto.github.io/doomcaptcha/">an approximation of one</a>—though not all the assets matched <em>Doom</em>, and it was more <em>Doom</em>-adjacent. That one was made directly by hand, and its source code is available on GitHub. Its developer noted that it's not secure; it's just for fun.</p>
<p>Rauch's attempt is no more serious as a CAPTCHA, but it at least resembles <em>Doom</em> more closely.</p>
<p>Don't expect to be playing this to verify at real websites anytime soon, though. It's not secure, and its legality is fuzzy at best. While the <a href="https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM">code</a> for <em>Doom</em> is open source, the assets from the game like enemy sprites and environment textures—which feature prominently in this application—are not.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-announces-new-rules-for-golden-demon-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/games-workshop-announces-new-rules-for-the-golden-demon-2025-mini-painting-tournament.1073016/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-announces-new-rules-for-golden-demon-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has announced Golden Demon 2025. The official <em>Warhammer</em> miniature painting competition will return this year with changes to its various categories and awards.</p>

<h2>The Golden Demon 2025 Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/6vp4sdtr/golden-demon-2025-the-prestigious-painting-competition-returns-to-adepticon-with-a-new-category-and-new-awards/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Warhammer-Community</a> post, the first leg of Golden Demon 2025 will happen at this year's AdeptiCon, which will be held in the United States at the Baird Centre in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on March 26.</p>

<p>The post continues to describe changes to the competition's different categories. Duel will return as its own category, allowing entrants to showcase fierce battles between two opponents. Furthermore, both <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warcry-briar-and-bone-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warcry</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-underworlds-grandfathers-gardeners-and-jaws-of-itzl-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer Underworlds</em></a> entries will be entered under the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em></a> Unit umbrella category.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/golden-demon-2025-category-list.jpg?itok=FZTjEdZe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/golden-demon-2025-category-list.jpg?itok=ImAmsy5X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Otherwise, all other categories of Golden Demon 2025 are unchanged. <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a>, the <em>Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-old-world-core-boxes-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer The Old World</em></a>, <em>Warhammer The Horus Heresy</em>, <em>Necromunda</em>, and <em>Blood Bowl</em> are all unchanged.</p>

<p>As for awards, Games Workshop adds some new achievements below the podium. In addition to the Gold, Silver, and Bronze awards, there are Finalist, Commended, and Notable awards. The latter three positions are for entries that have caught the judges' attention. It is a welcome consolation for entries that go that extra mile.</p>

<p>Games Workshop's changes to the Golden Demon continues their active support alongside listening to constructive fan feedback. This includes their update to Golden Demon 2024 entries <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-imposes-golden-demon-ai-ban-preventing-its-use-in-miniature-painting" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">banning AI-generated</a> materials in any submitted entry. This may have been caused by the use of an AI-generated backdrop by 12-time winner Neil Hollis.</p>

<p>Games Workshop will be providing more Golden Demon 2025 details in the lead-up to AdeptiCon. In the meantime, if you have an idea for an entry to submit, the sign-up form is the same as last year on the official <a href="https://citadelcolour.com/golden-demon-2025/" rel="nofollow">Golden Demon</a> website. Potential US winners, you have three months to start assembling and painting.</p>

                <p>The Marvel Universe as we know it started in 1961 with the debut of the Fantastic Four, so it's only fitting that the first post-launch heroes for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-coming-to-consoles-ps5-beta-and-exclusive-spidey-costume-confirmed/1100-6523816/" data-ref-id="1100-6523816">Marvel Rivals</a> are coming from the first family of superheroes. NetEase Games has dropped a teaser image for the Fantastic Four with an announcement that a new trailer is coming on Monday, January 6.</p><p>As with the previous heroes introduced in the game, Mr. Fantastic, Invisible Woman, Human Torch, and the Thing have been slightly redesigned to fit in with Marvel Rivals' aesthetic. For example, Mr. Fantastic looks considerably younger and more buff than his comic-book counterpart. Intriguingly, the FF's helper robot, H.E.R.B.I.E., is also prominently featured in the promo art. That's prompted speculation that he could also be a playable character, similar to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-jeff-the-land-shark-hero-guide/2900-6053/" data-ref-id="2900-6053">Jeff the Land Shark</a>.</p><p>One of the reasons why the FF are getting such a prominent push is that 2025 will mark the team's return to cinemas 10 years after the much-maligned 2015 Fantastic Four reboot. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-fantastic-four-movie-receives-new-subtitle/1100-6525360/" data-ref-id="1100-6525360">The Fantastic Four: First Steps</a> will be the team's MCU debut after alternate versions of Mr. Fantastic and Human Torch had cameos in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doctor-strange-in-the-multiverse-of-madness-review-dimension-hopping-horrors/1900-6417872/" data-ref-id="1900-6417872">Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/deadpool-and-wolverine-review-status-quo/1900-6418260/" data-ref-id="1900-6418260">Deadpool and Wolverine</a>, respectively.</p><p>Through January 10, NetEase is giving away a free in-game gift of a chibi version of Galactica <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-is-celebrating-another-milestone-with-a-free-limited-time-reward/1100-6528532/" data-ref-id="1100-6528532">to celebrate hitting 20 million players</a>.

                <p>Veteran game developer Ken Levine has shared his thoughts on generative AI, his latest game and it having high stakes, and why he believes we still don't really know what video games are.</p><p>Talking to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-future-of-storytelling-with-ken-levine" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a>, Levine said he believes generative AI is a "very powerful" tool that he doesn't want to underestimate. But he said it has many limitations in its current state, including persistence.</p><p>"You look at Sora, the ChatGPT video generator, you see a woman walking down the street and the street scene is beautiful--but if she were to turn around and walk backwards, it wouldn't remember where she has been," he said. "It doesn't currently understand persistence, although that may change."</p><p>Many are concerned about AI taking jobs from humans, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-boss-explains-why-ai-will-be-good-for-gaming/1100-6518421/" data-ref-id="1100-6518421">video game executive Andrew Wilson of EA believes that will happen</a>, but Levine said AI still has a ways to go as it relates to creative storytelling.</p><p>"So for all the concerns about AI, have you seen it write a good 20-page movie yet? Scene-to-scene? It doesn't know how to do that," he said.</p><p>For now, the useful parts of AI for game development are focused more on technical elements, Levine said. "For instance, training your bug database to query how many bugs you have in certain situations. But what it can't do is tell me a really compelling story that has a three-act structure, or even tell me multiple scenes. It gets extremely confused," he said.</p><p>Levine said no generative AI was used in the development of his newest game, Judas, outside of advancements to bug databases.</p><p>"Right now I'm not overly impressed when it comes to game development. I'm sure there will be more to it [in future] but I'm not super worried about it yet in a, 'It's coming to take everybody's jobs' perspective," he said.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="662011850"

I prefer to avoid that because a player will feel rushed--you want to keep the stakes dramatically high, but you also want to make them feel like they can do what they want to do and explore the environment down to every square inch."</p><p>He added that the story and scope of Judas was "much smaller" when development began, but it grew as the team's ambitions grew. Judas has been in the works for more than a half-decade, and Levine said one of the reasons for the lengthy development period came down to its setup in being a game that's responsive to player choices.</p><p>"That's a really hard problem, and that's why you don't see a ton of it [in games]," he said.</p><p>Levine also spent time during the interview talking about how he believes that video game developers are still trying to find out what a video game is and can be.</p><p>"Our industry is over 50 years old and we still don't really know what it is, what games are. By the time movies were 50 years old, they were making Citizen Kane. It's changed somewhat [since then], styles have changed, but they had it pretty well figured out by the 1940s--we haven't," he said.</p><p>Judas is in development for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, though a release date has not yet been announced.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-multiplayer-games-of-2024-with-or-against-friends/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The multiplayer games category is always a bit harder to assess for a very simple reason: your online experience may vary greatly from that of your fellow gamer due to many factors, such as connection, random matchmaking, and even your choice of friends.</p>
<p>With that caveat out of the way, there's another useful meter to gauge how any multiplayer game is doing - the healthiness of its community. As such, we have picked some of the most popular cooperative and competitive games released in 2024.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPGs</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2024-full-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indies</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2024-the-return-of-the-strongest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2024-a-bloody-massacre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2024-no-enemy-left-standing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-dlc-expansion-of-2024-give-us-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLC/Expansion</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-adventure-games-of-2024-all-kinds-of-journeys/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Adventure</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-platformers-of-2024-hop-skip-jump/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Platformer</a></em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/palworld_ConceptArt_01-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Palworld</h2>
<p>PocketPair's game easily wins the crown of the most surprising debut of 2024. The first game developed by the Japanese studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-has-sold-7-million-units-on-steam-alone-is-outselling-pokemon-legends-arceus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke several records</a> when it launched last January. By combining survival, monster taming, and the Pokémon-like Pals, Palworld created a new mix that proved irresistible for so many players around the world. Last we heard, the game had surpassed 25 million units sold, and that was before its <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-trailer-still-gets-showcased-during-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch on PlayStation 5</a>.</p>
<p>Like with Helldivers 2, the game experienced a drop in popularity as the developers were simply unequipped with the amount of new content requested by a large and voracious fanbase. However, the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-to-get-massive-new-island-next-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update</a> appears to have renewed interest in Palworld. PocketPair still has a massive issue to deal with, though: the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-is-officially-suing-pocketpair-creators-of-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lawsuit with Nintendo</a>, which threatens to undo everything for the studio.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/helldivers-2-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Helldivers II (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/helldivers-2-not-enough-patriotism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">6/10</a>)</h2>
<p>The first Helldivers game was successful enough to warrant a sequel, but no one, not even Arrowhead itself, could have predicted the popularity attained by Helldivers II. Moving from top-down to full-fledged 3D was a gamble that paid off in spades, turning this sequel into the fastest-selling new game ever published by PlayStation (it <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> twelve million units in the first twelve weeks on the market), an achievement that speaks for itself. Granted, there were a few ups and downs during the live service phase, as a few patches were not well received by fans. However, Arrowhead managed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-patch-released-playercount-triples-as-a-result/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bounce back with the September update</a>, and they continued picking up steam.</p>
<p>If you're into liberating the galaxy and destroying aliens at any cost (even killing your own friends as 'collateral damage'), there's no better game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">10/10</a>)</h2>
<p>FromSoftware did not make any specific changes to Elden Ring's online component with Shadow of the Erdtree. However, there is at least one very pressing incentive to seek help more often than in the base game: the expansion is far more challenging. As such, having friends to back you up can prove simply invaluable when going through Shadow of the Erdtree.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Call-of-Duty-Black-Ops-6.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raining-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8.8/10</a>)</h2>
<p>Activision has had the multiplayer games market in its pocket for years with Call of Duty. Sure, there were the survival and Battle Royale waves, but the shooter franchise largely maintained its position. However, Modern Warfare II and Modern Warfare III lost ground, and Activision simply could not afford a third consecutive disappointing release. Thankfully, Treyarch's Black Ops 6 was a resounding success both with fans and the market, becoming the biggest Call of Duty launch ever in terms of played matches and hours spent in-game. Kai Tatsumoto wrote:</p>
<p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 represents a proper return to form, with Treyarch taking the helm in development once more. This is probably as definitive a Call of Duty title has been in years, with a package that executes well across all three pillars of Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies.</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Marvel-Rivals-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Marvel Rivals</h2>
<p>It wasn't a great year for new free-to-play releases or hero shooters. However, right at the tail end of 2024, NetEase buckled the trend with Marvel Rivals. Many (including us) have been tempted to dismiss it as an Overwatch clone ahead of its December release, assuming we might be in for another live service failure after <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-shuts-down-firewalk-studios-maker-of-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Concord</a>, but that wasn't the case at all. Marvel Rivals quickly found its user base and a very large one, to boot, having already been played by over 20 million users and securing a spot <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-remains-one-of-top-played-games-across-3-platforms-in-us-sonic-frontiers-gets-resurgence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the US's top three most played games</a> across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X in the week ahead of Christmas.</p>
<p>That's just the beginning. NetEase has no doubt a lot more content on the way, starting with the Fantastic Four joining the playable cast, <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-is-reportedly-getting-the-fantastic-four-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to the latest leak</a>.</p>

<p>The most expensive Counter-Strike skins ever have some massive price tags associated with them. Since the introduction of in-game cosmetics to CS:GO year ago, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-to-find-cs2-skin-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">value of this skin economy</a> has steadily grown, thanks to factors like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-csgo-and-cs2-skin-gambling-legal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gambling</a> and the 2023 announcement of Counter-Strike 2.</p>



<p>The Counter-Strike skin economy is so large that it’s not contained to just the official Steam community market. Dozens of sites allow players to buy and sell skins. A few uniquely rare skins have fetched a very pretty penny, but one holds the record for selling for the most amount of money.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-most-expensive-cs-go-skin-ever-sold">The Most Expensive CS:GO Skin Ever Sold</h2>



<p>The most expensive purchase of a CS:GO skin ever occurred in April 2023, just a few weeks after Valve announced CS2. This announcement caused a spike in both renewed interest in the franchise as well as skin prices, leading to what appears to be the biggest purchase ever.</p>



<p>ZipeLCS, a long-time skin trader and co-owner of the Danish organization ECSTATIC, <a href="https://x.com/zipelCS/status/1647582159245385729" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that they had sold <strong>a StatTrak Case Hardened “Blue Gem” AK-47 with four Katowice 2014 Titan Holo stickers for roughly $400,000.</strong> The transaction also included a Case Hardened “Blue Gem” Karambit knife that sold for an additional $100,000, roughly.</p>



<p>But what makes this AK valued at around $400,000?</p>



<ul>
<li>Case Hardened skins are more valuable if there’s more blue. The Case Hardened AK above features a “Blue Gem” 661 pattern, which gives it an incredibly rare shiny blue pattern.</li>



<li>It’s in Minimal Wear condition (second best next to Factory New).</li>



<li>The four Katowice 2014 Titan Holo stickers, the <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/counter-strike-2/top-20-most-expensive-csgo-stickers-in-history-1361385/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most rare and expensive Counter-Strike stickers</a>, were valued at roughly $60,000 each.</li>

<p>Just this past year, <strong>a StatTrak Case Hardened Factory New AK-47 with the 661 pattern was <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/counter-strike-2/counter-strike-2s-most-expensive-skin-sells-for-jaw-dropping-1-million-2762918/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly</a> sold for more than $1 million</strong>, according to Dexerto. The seller claims to have rejected “multiple” offers at $1 million, placing the exact buy amount at somewhere between $1 million and $1.5 million.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>While this AK appears to be the most expensive skin ever sold, it’s not the highest price ever listed for a skin. <strong>One player <a href="https://afkgaming.com/csgo/news/extremely-rare-csgo-knife-allegedly-costs-more-than-12-million-euros" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">offered to pay $1.5 million</a> in Bitcoin for a one-of-a-kind Factory New Case Hardened “Blue Gem” Karambit knife</strong>. For context, the one that sold for $100,000 above was Well-Worn. However, the owner of the skin was “not interested” and said that the offer was too low.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>I come and go with the work of Ken Levine, celebrated auteurman and <a href="https://kotaku.com/report-ken-levines-ghost-story-studio-is-nowhere-near-1848297126">reported burnout-inducing manager</a>, but I'm interested to see more of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/judas">Judas</a>, his current project at Ghost Story Games. The concept for Judas is that you're trapped in a computer-run society housed aboard a colony ship, the Mayflower. The titular Judas has managed to break free of the AI-groomed status quo, and is out to start a revolution. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ken-levines-new-game-judas-looks-a-lot-like-bioshock-infinite-in-space">"Bioshock Infinite in space"</a>, we called it, back in 2022, but Levine says it's more open-ended than either of his Bioshock endeavours, with a greater emphasis on other characters remembering and responding to your actions over time.</p><!--more-->
<p>That's from a new <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-future-of-storytelling-with-ken-levine">GamesIndustry.biz</a> interview that also contains Levine's thoughts on generative AI (ambivalent) and whether today's triple-A budgets are healthy (no), plus some regurgitated rhapsodising about the power of choice and interactivity and the importance of players telling their own stories. The last part makes me feel like it's 2003 again and I'm writing my first reader review for Eurogamer dot net, transfixed by the idea that I might, some day, discover the Citizen Kane of Games. </p>
<p>I don't doubt Levine's sincerity, but comments like "there's no medium that's more user-involved than our medium" now make me powerfully grumpy. They make me want to write an editorial about how most of the vaunted choices games offer are boring busywork or hollow gestures that weigh down the quieter, more graceful acts of interpretation that characterise the experience of non-interactive artworks like, say, those stupid films and books, which don't even let you push buttons to make characters talk.</p>
<p>But I won't do that: you came here to read about Judas. The interview harbours a few more concrete details about the narrative design of the game, which Levine acknowledges is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-story-games">taking a fair long while</a>. One of the reasons it's taking a while is that he basically wants every notable NPC to be capable of harbouring very meticulous grudges.</p><p>"The approach we're taking with Judas is heavily based upon recognition of player action and response to player action," Levine told the site. "Even just characters' observing a long range of player action and commenting on it. 'Hey, you saw this and you did that and then you did this and that was interesting because that caused that' - we're doing that kinda stuff right now. </p>
<p>"And it's really just observing the players and then writing the types of lines that could react to various types of things. It's a huge amount of work because you have to think of all the things a player can do and then write in-character responses for different characters to those actions in a way that feels organic."</p>
<p>Levine is keen to avoid "random number generator" moments, with characters handing you quests out of the blue. As he reiterates: "once you start observing sequences of events - having characters observe 'You did this and then you did that and that caused this and I'm mad because it did that' - that's when it gets really interesting."</p>
<p>The result, Levine promises, will be a game that supports many more routes to certain outcomes. "There are beats and how you got there is going to be fairly different from one player to the next," he says. "And places you'll get to are very different from one player to the next."</p><p>It sounds like the Mayflower itself will be a more open-ended environment than Bioshock's Rapture or Infinite's Columbia. "<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a>, if you look at them from a development standpoint - and this may be a bit alienating to some readers - but they're basically a corridor," Levine concedes. "A very, very long corridor with a bunch of trigger points that make story elements happen. Judas is made very, very differently and that makes it much more hopefully reflective of players agency, but also much, much harder to make."</p>
<p>I like the idea of a version of Bioshock in which Rapture isn't a gauntlet run populated by raving thespians, but a persistent society with a memory. I wouldn't put it past Ghost Story to be setting us up for a fall, however - Bioshock's big twist is that many of your choices weren't choices at all. If you find that prospect exhausting, the good news is that Alice Bee (RPS in peace) has already skipped forward a decade to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pre-emptive-backlash-to-backlash-to-positive-reviews-for-judas">review the negative reviews of the positive reviews of the game</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Given an audience willing to fork out eye-watering amounts for its laptops and phones, it’s perhaps not surprising that the company assumed it could do the same in the cursed world of VR with the $3,500 Vision Pro mixed-reality goggles. Except, according to sourced reports, it couldn’t. The Vision Pro is said to no longer be in production.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196012" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku Goes Hands-On At The Apple Developer Showcase" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="86" data-playlist="196012,195371,197298" data-current="196012"><div><p>Kotaku Goes Hands-On At The Apple Developer Showcase</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196012/196012_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196012/196012_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196012/196012_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196012/196012_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21534.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>This is all based on a report from October 2024 on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-sharply-scales-back-production-of-vision-pro&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theinformation.com/articles/apple-sharply-scales-back-production-of-vision-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Information</em></a></span><em> </em>(a site that, appositely, charges $300 to $1,000 a year to read its articles) which claimed, based on multiple sources, that Apple would be winding down production on the Vision Pro as the year ended, given the backlog of unsold devices. There was also rumor of a cheaper model going into production instead of a previously planned second version of the Pro, potentially for an end-of-year 2025 release.</p><p>The Vision Pro’s failure to set the world aflame is perhaps somewhat predictable. Not only does absolutely no one actually want mixed-reality headsets for their work life, but they especially don’t want to pay the price of a second-hand car for the honor. At $3.5k, you’d have to hope the Vision Pro came with a suite of absolutely essential apps and uses, and, er, it didn’t do that either.</p><p>Back in October, <em>The Information</em> said its sources at component manufacturers told the site they’d supplied enough parts for over half a million headsets, with “tens of thousands of undelivered parts” filling the suppliers’ warehouses. It was claimed at the time that Apple had sold 370,000 Vision Pros—a figure that seems enormously optimistic, but one that allegedly represents only two-thirds of the stock that had been made. Compare that to the millions of units Meta has shifted of its Meta Quest VR headsets, at a seventh of the price of Apple’s tech.</p><p>If all this proves to be accurate, that means that as of now Apple is no longer making new Vision Pros, because just not enough people saw a reason to pay such a whacking fee for such an entirely superfluous piece of tech. As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/31/vision-pro-may-be-out-of-production/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.macrumors.com/2024/12/31/vision-pro-may-be-out-of-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>MacRumors</em> points out</a></span>, Apple had reportedly originally asked its Chinese manufacturer to expect to make eight million Vision Pros, meaning it’s likely sold a twentieth of its initial expectations. The reports claim Apple has told the manufacturer to expect to make half that many for its next, cheaper version of the AR headset which, while suggesting a massive drop in expectation even at a cheaper price, still seems ludicrously unlikely.</p><p>Meta’s relative success with the Quest VR headsets in 2024 is likely due to its finding that sweet price point of $300 to $500, where people are more willing to take a gamble on a piece of unproven tech. Arguably, Apple could still find its niche in this space, if it can get things down to $1,000 and capture the business market that feels obliged to jump on gimmicks, leading to overworked people in hot suits being forced to look at virtual Power Point demonstrations until they quit their jobs and take up macrame.</p><p>We’ve contacted Apple for a comment.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The association with gambling first got it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/balatro-nintendo-switch-eshop-removed-gambling-1851301756&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-nintendo-switch-eshop-removed-gambling-1851301756">briefly banned from the Nintendo Switch eShop</a></span> and later led to an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/roguelike/balatro-creator-speaks-out-as-pegi-doubles-down-on-its-18-rating-blaming-eu-laws-for-the-roguelikes-adults-only-categorization-this-sucks/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/roguelike/balatro-creator-speaks-out-as-pegi-doubles-down-on-its-18-rating-blaming-eu-laws-for-the-roguelikes-adults-only-categorization-this-sucks/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">erroneous 18+ age rating from PEGI</a></span> in Europe. It’s unclear how much of this reoccurring issue is because people in charge of ratings don’t know how games work, or are so overworked that they don’t actually have time to pay attention to what they’re rating. </p><p>The faulty association with gambling is particularly pernicious considering there are plenty of games on mobile shops that do feature very obvious gambling mechanics, including ones you can spend real money on. <em>EA Sports FC Mobile</em> replicates the card-pack-opening probabilities of its console counterpart, and even <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> lets players spend money to speed up booster pack openings that all rely on chance for whether you get new rare cards or duplicates of the ones you already own. These, as well as many RPGs with gacha-fueled character-collecting mechanics, are all rated E for Everyone. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Leap onto and climb their massive forms to attack from different angles. Shatter armor or slice at weak spots to diminish their protection.

			<p>If you've played Baldur's Gate 3 and wanted to give it a different twist, there is a mod that makes the game play out as a roguelike instead. This mod is called Trials of Tav and is an incredibly popular mod that you can use in the game. Between Larian and modders, new content is consistently being added to the game, and this mod is no different. Modder Hippo0o has managed to create a full roguelike mode for the game, allowing you to choose your own adventure as you fight off against masses of enemies.</p>
<p>As the updates for the Trials of Tav mode have begun to slow down, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/14430?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Trials of Tav - Reloaded</a> has surfaced online from modder Celerev. In this version of the mod, it's overhauled the pre-existing mod and added bug fixes, an overhaul to the monsters, new scaling and new enemies to fight off against that have been adapted from tabletop.</p>
<p>One of these mobs includes a brand-new superboss. It's a level 27 enemy and is the last enemy that you can come across in the scaling. Should you find that you can defeat him, this is where you can say that you've actually won a run in Trials of Tav. It may take you a long time to get to that point, but it's well worth the grind.</p>
<p>In addition to the superboss, Celerev says that they've added over 60 new enemies to the base game, including enemies that you wouldn't typically come across. This includes characters like Nine-Fingers Keene and, more comedically, killer sheep.</p>
<p>To give the players a fighting chance, there has been a slew of bug fixes and changes to the scaling so that players have more of a chance to make the saving throw against their opponent. Shops are also now re-balanced, offering players a fairer opportunity.</p>
<p>Aside from Trials of Tav - Reloaded, this month sees the testing for Patch 8, an official patch released by Larian Studios. This is a pretty major patch, as it adds a bunch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-to-get-cross-play-12-new-subclasses-and-photo-mode-next-year/">new subclasses</a> to try out across each main class, as well as the ability to play Baldur's Gate 3 with others on other platforms. This means that you'll finally be able to play the game with friends who are on PlayStation while you're on PC, for example.</p>
<p>It's uncertain when the patch is set to be fully released, but it's likely more information will come out once the first round of testing takes place this month.</p>
<p>Will you be trying out Trials of Tav - Reloaded?</p>
