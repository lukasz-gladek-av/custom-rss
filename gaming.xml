			<p>Path tracing looks stunning in video games, both old and new, but the hardware definitely still isn't quite there yet to offer decent performance on anything that isn't top-end, as highlighted in a new showcase of a recently released Left 4 Dead 2 RTX Remix mod.</p>
<p>The mod, which can be downloaded&nbsp;<a href="https://github.com/xoxor4d/l4d2-rtx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, is a compatibility mod that makes the classic game by Valve compatible with RTX Remix and, as such, lacks some advanced features. Even with some issues, however, path tracing undoubtedly breathes new life into the game's visuals in some scenarios but does so at a very heavy cost, as highlighted in the new showcase shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmarkPC</a>. At 4K resolution, very high settings, the game goes from running at around 500 FPS to running at unsteady 60 FPS with the RTX Remix mod and NVIDIA DLSS 4 at the Performance preset, a huge hit in performance that highlights how even one of the most powerful GPUs on the market isn't ready to handle path tracing at 4K resolution. Even at 1440p resolution, the RTX 5080 doesn't run the game as well as one might expect with the path tracing mod, requiring Frame Generation to hit an average of 90 FPS with NVIDIA DLSS Quality.</p>
<p><iframe title="Left 4 Dead 2 Path Tracing with RTX Remix On vs Off - Graphics/Performance Comparison | RTX 5080" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DHKBqCJW9Jk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Looking at how the Left 4 Dead 2 RTX Remix path tracing mod challenges even an RTX 5080 GPU, it looks like Frame Generation will continue to be a necessity to reach acceptable levels of performance in games that support the technology. Multi Frame Generation, which is currently available on RTX 5000 series cards only, makes it possible to enjoy games with path tracing at high resolution and framerates, as seen in <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-rtx-5080-path-tracing-120-fps/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-announced-for-summer.1127967/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nacon has announced&nbsp;<em>RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business</em>, a "standalone adventure" intended to serve as a followup (but not necessarily a full-blown sequel) to 2023's&nbsp;<em>RoboCop: Rogue City</em>.</p>

<p>Announced during yesterday's Nacon Connect showcase, <i>Unfinished Business&nbsp;</i>will once again put you in the (presumably extremely heavy) shoes of RoboCop as he prepares to take down a "group of highly trained mercenaries" in the massive housing complex known as OmniTower.</p>

<p>Essentially,&nbsp;<em>Unfinished Business&nbsp;</em>sounds rather like&nbsp;<em>RoboCop: Rogue City&nbsp;</em>meets&nbsp;<em>The Raid&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Die Hard</em>&nbsp;(or, indeed, 2012's&nbsp;<em>Dredd</em>). Nacon is promising new enemy types, deadly traps, and elite troops to take down.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-summer-electrocution.jpg?itok=AbXZdMtw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-summer-electrocution.jpg?itok=RKcev0ri 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business&nbsp;</em>is a "standalone adventure" coming this summer.</figcaption></figure><p>As before, you'll have access to RoboCop's full arsenal, including the brand new Cryo Cannon, which sounds like a pretty good way to make a persuasive argument for criminals to comply.</p>

<p>What's more, you'll also get the chance to play as Alex Murphy, RoboCop's pre-transformation alter ego, and "discover a different side" of the iconic hero.</p>

<p><em>RoboCop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business&nbsp;</em>launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527760/RoboCop_Rogue_City__Unfinished_Business/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10014077" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business/9NNNFB5F54C9" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> in summer.&nbsp;You can check out the announcement trailer for the game<em>&nbsp;</em>right here.</p>




<h2>What else was revealed during Nacon Connect 2025?</h2>

<p>Plenty of other Nacon games were revealed during the publisher's Connect showcase yesterday.</p>

<p>As well as <i>Unfinished Business</i>, Nacon also revealed a new game in the stealthy&nbsp;<em>Styx&nbsp;</em>series.&nbsp;<em>Styx: Blades of&nbsp;</em><em>Greed&nbsp;</em>is described as a "blend of stealth, action, and strategy", and it's coming to PC and current-gen machines in fall.</p>

That's set for next year on PC and current-gen consoles.</p>

<p>That's not the only eldritch horror game revealed during the show, either.&nbsp;<em>Zeno Clash&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Clash: Artifacts of Chaos&nbsp;</em>developer ACE Team revealed&nbsp;<em>The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu</em>, a first-person co-op horror game loosely based on Lovecraft's novel of the same name. That one's coming next year.</p>

<p>The Island gives WWE 2K25 even more Trophies and Achievements to go for. You can check out the extras right here.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-many-trophies-amp-achievements-in-wwe-2k25">How Many Trophies &amp; Achievements in WWE 2K25?</h2>



<p><strong>WWE 2K25 has a Chris Jericho-sized list of 66 PlayStation 5 Trophies and 61 Xbox Achievements. But if you’re on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, you only get 61 and 56 extra accomplishments respectively.</strong></p>



<p>This is because of The Island. A new game mode introduced in WWE 2K25—but it’s exclusive to PS5 and Xbox Series X. Meaning, if you’re on last-gen, not only do you miss out on The Island, you can’t get the five DLC trophies or achievements either.</p>

            <p>RoboCop will be climbing an apartment tower full of slimebags in a standalone follow-up to his trudging but faithful 2023 shooter. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business">Robocop: Rogue City - Unfinished Business</a> is so over-named it looks like DLC, but is actually an independent sequel from the same developers, and directly follows the events of the recent criminal justice 'em up. It'll see metal man Murphy going floor to floor as he and other Detroit city policefolk ascend a residential tower after "a group of highly trained mercenaries armed with cutting-edge weapons takes control of the building and turns it into their deadly fortress." Wait... doesn't this sound like another cyberpunk dystopia?</p>

<p>"Prepare to take on a new breed of enemies: OmniTower is packed with high-tech threats," says the game's blurb <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527760/RoboCop_Rogue_City__Unfinished_Business/">on Steam</a>. "From flying drones to exploding bots and anti-personnel turrets, every floor is riddled with deadly traps, and heavily armed elite troops. Expect to face minigun-toting armoured squads, special forces equipped with jet packs or even katana-wielding foes who look more machine than man."</p>
<p>If you have seen 2012's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G-eI5oLlIeY">Dredd</a> starring Karl Urban, you may have raised an eyebrow (if you have seen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6Q7KnXpNOg">The Raid</a>, you have raised both). Yes, this sounds like the same premise. But maybe that's no big deal. Developers Teyon seem to be doing their due diligence by adding all the requisite RoboCop-flavoured elements. You will play through FPS flashbacks with Murphy as a pre-cyberized meatcop, for example, and get some new abilities and weapons, such as a freezey cryo cannon and "devastating finishing moves" where you can slam crime-doer faces into nearby walls and vending machines.</p>
<p>The additional hands-on bone-crunching checks out. One of the more enjoyable parts of Robo's recent wreckabout was being able to lift any perp and yeet them ragdollifically across the city streets and prison corridors that you stomped through. Other than that I wasn't too fond of the shooter in my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/robocop-rogue-city-review">RoboCop: Rogue City review</a> but I did acknowledge that it would likely be pleasing to long time fans of Paul Verhoeven's ultra-violent satire. </p>
<p>The sequel-follow-up-not-DLC-we-promise is due out sometime in "Q3 2025" which is business speak for "I dunno, autumn, I guess". </p></div>

            <p>Retro peripheral manufacturer Hyperkin has apologised for a "lack of transparency" and "failing to communicate" with its customers.</p>
<p>The company has had a series of fumbles in recent years, with a tendency to announce new products too early. Last year it announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-handheld-sega-mega-drive-device-in-the-works">handheld Mega Drive device</a> but has since gone quiet, while back in January it revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/soon-you-will-be-able-to-play-your-xbox-with-a-ps5-style-controller">PS5-style controllers compatible with Xbox and PC</a> but without a release date.</p>
<p>Also in January, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-new-guitar-hero-controller-will-release-for-the-wii-this-year">Hyperkin revealed its new Hyper Strummer guitar controller</a> for the Wii, but customers accused the company of simply reusing unsold stock of its Wii guitars. The company refuted the accusations and is set to release an <a href="https://shop.hyperkinstore.com/products/hyper-jammer-wireless-guitar-for-pc-ps3-hyperkin?_pos=1&amp;_sid=00762d90e&amp;_ss=r">equivalent controller for PC and PS3</a>.</p>

<p>Now the company has issued an apology in a bid to rebuild trust with its customers.</p>
<p>"The Hyperkin team has taken time to reflect on our values as a company," a statement on social media reads.</p>
<p>"We have overpromised and under-delivered. We failed to properly communicate and let down countless fans in the community with our lack of transparency."</p>
<p>It continued: "Our previously announced guitars are examples of us failing to communicate. There are no excuses and we take full responsibility for these mistakes. Trust is earned, not given, and we recognise that we have a lot of work to do to earn yours back with our modern guitar controller that is still being worked on."</p>
<p>Hyperkin promised to "break the habit", acknowledging its past administration was "eager to announce projects still early in development", which will no longer be the case with the new team the company is building.</p>
<div>

<p>As such it's focused on three areas: improved transparency in communication, "consistent connection" to keep customers informed, and "uncompromising quality" as it meets its goal to "deliver hardware that exceeds expectations".</p>
<p>"For every victory there will be an announcement," it concluded. "For every shortcoming there will be a statement. Thank you to our fans, supporters and multiple communities that have put up with our missteps. We don't want to fail you again."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-labs-first-playtest/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-releases-its-first-community-update-on-battlefield-labs-playtests.1127925/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-labs-first-playtest/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlefield Labs will have its first-ever playtest for the next Battlefield game today and with it, the developers have released the first community update.</p>



<p>The update is intended to keep the entire community updated on Battlefield Labs – even those not in the playtest. For the first test, Battlefield Labs will be testing the games Gun and Movement. If you’re not in the test, players can still <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-sign-up-for-battlefield-labs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sign up to Battlefield Labs</a>. </p>



<p><strong>The first Battlefield Labs test update reads:</strong></p>



<p>We’ve continually evolved our gunplay and movement mechanics throughout the Battlefield series. Now, within Battlefield Labs, we’re focused on refining the best elements from past titles, modernizing them, and validating if they feel fun and rewarding, and have the right balance between intuitive control and dynamic combat.</p>



<p>We’re designing the combat experience to ensure players of all skill levels can enjoy our gunplay and movement systems. Our goal is to offer gameplay that rewards skill with precise weapon feedback and movement options for veterans, while providing an intuitive experience for new players to learn and enjoy.</p>



<p>For gunplay we’re exploring designs centered on helping you learn and develop skills and muscle memory through action, as weapons naturally signal their recoil direction. This feedback loop allows you to understand and adjust your aim, making it easier to handle different weapons. This system not only adds variety but also enhances each weapon’s unique feel and play style.</p>



<p>Movement is also deeply integrated with gunplay, as your actions and targets are all part of the same cohesive combat experience. We aim to make movement both feel intuitive and rewarding to move within the world and during combat, but also when playing against someone using both the gunplay and movement systems to their maximum potential.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-new-and-improved-for-gunplay-and-movement">What’s new and improved for gunplay and movement?</h2>



<p>Initially we’ll test select but important areas that create the foundation required to create a fun and rewarding Battlefield combat experience. We’re making focused efforts to create consistent and optimized millisecond-to-millisecond soldier combat, and we’ll share some key examples of changes that will be available during our initial playsessions.</p>



<p>We’ve reduced the time it takes for bullets to appear on your screen from when you press fire. This change decreases input delay, makes shooting feel more responsive, and helps you better track and hit moving targets.</p>



<p>We’re optimizing for a 60Hz tick rate, ensuring the game server more frequently updates the positions and actions for all players. This results in responsive gameplay across all platforms and inputs. You’ll notice more precise shooting and movement, enhanced damage feedback, and more accurate representation of other players’ positions and combat outcomes.</p>



<p>We’ve adjusted the recoil system to make the different weapon types feel unique when firing them. Through enhancements to gunplay recoil, camera shakes, and firing settles, each shot’s recoil direction now matches its gameplay angle. The weapon visually stabilizes the more accurate your handling is, making you feel like you’re actually firing and controlling it.</p>



<p>To evolve the moment system we’ve revamped animations and reintroduced movement features such as crouch sprint, combat dive and landing roll, and added visual indicators to make it easier to understand when movements such as vaulting or leaning are possible.</p>



<h2 id="h-feedback-and-validation">Feedback and Validation</h2>



<p>At this stage content within Battlefield Labs is pre-alpha, and playsessions take place within a closed dev environment focused on testing small chunks of a larger array of features. Some gameplay features are placeholder, work-in-progress and with bugs and performance not being representative of the final experience. However, even during this early stage of development you’ll get a good sense of our new design approach.</p>



<p>During our first playsession our teams will be validating the systems and stability of Battlefield Labs such as server performance, while participants will be able to familiarise themselves with what’s next for Battlefield through testing the gunplay and movement experience, focused on:</p>



<ul>
<li>Feel of the different weapon archetypes</li>



<li>Improvements to aim and control</li>



<li>Weapon balance and fun factor</li>



<li>Look and feel of movement</li>



<li>Moving and interacting within the map</li>



<li>Combat pacing</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-stay-tuned">Stay Tuned</h2>



<p>Lastly, a reminder that while our playsession will be within a closed environment, and we can’t invite everyone to every session, we’ll make sure to keep you informed on ongoing Battlefield Labs playsessions and learnings through these regular Community Updates.</p>



<p>We’ll be back in the coming weeks to talk more about our learnings from our first playsessions, as well as another feature focused Community Update.</p>



<p>Have you already signed up to the Battlefield Labs playtests? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>&nbsp;if you have any success.</p>

<p>Balatro’s assortment of Rare and Legendary Jokers should always be on your mind. While you can build toward most decks and strategies, there’s a good chance you need to pivot if one of these bad boys comes along. Let’s teach you about each one and how to unlock them.</p>



<p>Every game of Balatro is different—unless you use one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-balatro-seeds/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best Balatro Seeds</a>. The final destination may be similar to runs you’ve had before, but the sheer depth of the game’s content means practically every run is new. There are thousands of possibilities, and one run could see you solely pursue <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-use-tarot-cards-in-balatro-all-tarot-cards-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tarot Cards</a>, or you may seek out Balatro’s Rare and Legendary Jokers.</p>



<p>If you’re new to Balatro—because of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-balatro-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass</a> or something else—you might need a quick walkthrough of every Rare and Legendary Joker.</p>

<p>It’s time for the cream of the crop. Balatro’s Legendary Jokers are the rarest and some of the most devastating. Getting a Soul Card is quite difficult and only happens every few hours of gameplay (unless you’re lucky), but you learn to savor a Legendary Joker if you get the chance to use one.</p>

<p>While there's no release date yet for the service, Jackbox Games is hoping to bring a beta version to "one or two smart TV platforms" in spring this year. More platforms and features will then follow.</p>
<p>"It has always been our goal to bring these games to as many people as possible and make them as easy to play as we can," reads a notice on the <a href="https://www.jackboxgames.com/blog/jackbox-coming-to-your-smart-tv-for-free">Jackbox website</a>. "That is why we are announcing a new Jackbox app that will allow you to play Jackbox Games on your smart TV and other platforms."</p>
<p>If you're yet to play them, Jackbox Games are a collection of party games available on Steam that players can join on their mobile device.</p>
<p>Games include the likes of joke writing game Quiplash, T-shirt design game Tee KO, and the meme creation game Survive The Internet, among many others. The robot rap battle game Mad Verse City is a personal favourite.</p>
<p>Last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jackbox-finally-adding-megapicker-for-seamless-minigame-swapping-across-packs">Jackbox added a Megapicker</a> to combine all its various game packs into a single selection, making it easier to switch between games.</p>
<p>It also released a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jackbox-wants-us-to-answer-questions-like-which-meat-most-wants-to-be-called-daddy-in-its-new-naughty-pack">Naughty Pack of more mature games</a>, though considering most players like to make the basic games rude, it's unclear how popular these have been.</p>
<p>It's unknown if these mature games will be included on TVs to awkwardly play with your family.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>There will be some changes to how things work in the remake of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-4">THPS4</a> when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a> releases this summer. As a reminder, the original release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3</a> included a two-minute time limit in which players could complete a level's challenges. This was removed for Pro Skater 4.</p>
<p>But, while in the OG Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4 players were able to skate around levels freely in Career mode and then talk to other characters around the stage to trigger challenges, on the remake's release this July, the game will instead follow a different structure.</p>
<p>Eurogamer can confirm the objectives for players to complete in Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be based on a timer for both games. There will also be a Free Skate mode, which has no timer at all, as well as Speed Run and Single Session modes. The Free Skate mode in Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4 will not let players to complete challenges in the same way that they were able to in the original Pro Skater 4 Career mode.</p>

<p>Earlier this week, and after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-announcement-teased-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-latest-map">plenty of whispers and speculation</a>, Activision announced Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 and 4 were finally getting the remake treatment. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be released across PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC (via Steam, Battle.net and Microsoft Store), and Nintendo Switch on 11th July. It will also be coming to Game Pass Ultimate and Game Pass PC.</p>
<p>"Developed with attention to detail by Iron Galaxy Studios and in collaboration with Tony Hawk and Activision, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 picks up seamlessly right where the critically acclaimed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 and 2</a> game left off," the official blurb reads.</p>

            <p>Mechy and messy extraction shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-forever-winter">The Forever Winter</a> sees a big update today that addresses the biggest player complaint the game had on launch - the precious water that drained away in real-time, even while you weren't playing the game. The patch to the early access shooter reworks water so it becomes a currency that you use to infiltrate the game's brutal maps at different entry points, instead of dripping away and threatening to leave you thirsty and destitute. And this isn't the only promising news - enemy spawning changes, reworked gunplay, and a new map also appear. </p>

<p>If you missed the water fury the first time around, let me explain. The Forever Winter's brutal warzones would often hide barrels of water you could strap to your back. Escape the map and you would add these litres to a big water tank in your home base (a hub of bullet merchants where you stash all the good gear you've scavenged). But that water supply would slowly drain - the cost of keeping your hub running. If it hit zero, your hub would "die" and all your stashed goodies would vanish. This water supply would deplete even while offline, the idea being that this adds more stress to the process of surviving in an apocalyptic hellscape. </p>
<p>Now the game's creators are ditching that idea entirely. "Water is no longer a resource that drains [in] real-time," say developers Fun Dog Studios in the update's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2828860/view/496063443495814171">patch notes on Steam</a>. "It is now a currency that is used to access region entry points. Region entry points have specific water costs that are in an RNG range."</p>
<p>This basically means the game's maps now have a default entry point, and you'll need to use water as payment to enter the hellish battleyards from other starting points (you may also need to have a good reputation with certain factions for this). Water can now also be traded from player to player, and the frequency of scavengable water barrels appearing in maps has been rebalanced, say the devs. </p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/the-forever-winter-water-update-1.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>

</figure>
<p>Unsurprisingly, many players disliked the original water premise. It became one of the biggest gripes in an early access launch marred by performance issues and unpredictable enemy behaviour. The developers promised changes, but didn't want to remove water as a stressy driving force completely. </p>
<p>One early patch saw <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-forever-winter-devs-answer-complaints-about-water-scarcity-by-adding-thieves-who-invade-your-hq-and-steal-your-water">thieves creep into your subterranean home to steal your last drops</a>. Defeating these scoundrels offered a last chance to save your stash from a water shortage. Later, the developers added a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2828860/view/547848028756640978">"thief-proof vault"</a> - a limited space for goodies that would never be lost, even in a critical water crisis. They also introduced water bots that would let players collect water automatically. (The meme-faced water thieves will still appear following this latest update, we're told. Although the consequences for not dealing with them won't be so high anymore.) </p>
<p>The water system, for all the ire it attracted, was the least significant of my complaints when I played The Forever Winter for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-forever-winter-struggles-into-early-access-with-poor-performance-and-a-deadly-thirst-for-your-time">our early access review</a>. Enemy spawning was wacky, their combat behaviour was difficult to understand, levels were cluttered and visually noisy, bugs were commonplace, and even the simple act of picking up items from the ground was a chore. I loved the core idea (little scav caught in the middle of an eternal robo-war) and the art direction is precisely my weathered cloth bag. But it was hard to stomach the rough state of the launch.</p>
<p>This update addresses several of those problems too, though. Enemy spawning has been adjusted to "hopefully completely remove" the problem of "seeing enemies spawn right in front of you out of thin air" or "having enemies spawn right on top of you or out of view." Guns have seen a big rework, and a new map featuring a fiery stone staircase has been added. We're also told "rendering improvements have been made to increase FPS" and "enemy detection icons show up more reliably with the correct information", meaning that you should theoretically be able to understand when and where a foe spots you or a teammate.</p>
<p>This is all good news, and I want to return to the game to see if it plays a little smoother now. I'm in favour of the water rework too. I understand that game designers often aim to elicit strong emotions in players, and here Fun Dog's designers desired a feeling of unease and insecurity, all the better to fit their game's permawar theme. But I prefer when those feelings are confined to the time when I'm actually playing the game, rather than spreading like a nervous tendril into my real life. I imagine many others feel the same about "FOMO" designs like this. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Bethesda has reassured <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> fans it is still "hard at work" on what's next for its ambitious sci-fi role-playing game, almost six months on from last September's Shattered Space expansion.
</p>
<p>
Starfield arrived in a blaze of marketing back in September 2023, though updates for the game have since slowed. Much of Bethesda's messaging of late on the game's social media channels has been focused on highlighting community-made content.
</p>
<p>
Now, there's a fresh update from Bethesda, acknowledging the wait for news. "We know you're eager for an update," <a href="https://x.com/StarfieldGame/status/1897709518013997493">Bethesda wrote</a>, replying to a fan who contacted the company saying it needed to start communicating what was happening with the game's next update or DLC.

<p>
"We truly appreciate your passion for Starfield," Bethesda continued. "The team has been hard at work, and while we're not ready to share specific details just yet, we have a lot of exciting things planned for the game this year that we can't wait to talk about when the time is right."
</p>
<p>
Responses from fans include excitement to see what's next, as well as messages speculating that Bethesda is busy working on the game's PlayStation 5 version before pushing forward with any other expansion.
</p>
<p>
"While Shattered Space is quite possibly one of Starfield's most enjoyable storylines to date, it once again struggles to offer any real consequences," our Katharine wrote of the game's first expansion, in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-shattered-space-review">Eurogamer's Starfield: Shattered Space review</a>. "And its new setting feels woefully underutilised."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesdas-todd-howard-confirms-at-least-one-more-starfield-expansion-after-shattered-space">Bethesda's Todd Howard previously confirmed Starfield would receive at least one more Starfield expansion after Shattered Space</a> - though there's no word on when that will turn up.

			<p>It's been a while since Bethesda Game Studios provided an updated roadmap of what's next for Starfield. Fans have been reaching out to the developer, and now the game's official X account has <a href="https://x.com/StarfieldGame/status/1897709518013997493" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> 'lots of exciting things' coming to the game later in 2025:</p>
<p><em>We know you're eager for an update, and we truly appreciate your passion for Starfield. The team has been hard at work, and while we're not ready to share specific details just yet, we have a lot of exciting things planned for the game this year that we can't wait to talk about when the time is right. We’re always listening and taking your feedback to heart. Thanks for being part of this journey with us.</em></p>
<p>2024 was filled with lots of updates, such as the one that added the much-requested Rev-8 land vehicle, not to mention the Shattered Space expansion. However, the premium DLC wasn't that well-received, getting just a six out of 10 in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> by Francesco De Meo:</p>
<p><em>The Starfield Shattered Space expansion leaves a lot to be desired. While it introduces a more focused and engaging story compared to the base game, the average map and quest design, along with the lack of new features, turn the adventure in Va'Ruun'kai into a bit of a slog rather quickly. Although the tighter focus is welcome, the Starfield experience as a whole needs something more substantial to reach its full potential.</em></p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see if the game gets another full-fledged expansion this year or just some free updates. Bethesda's Todd Howard did <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-crossed-14-million-players-will-get-annual-story-expansions-shattered-space-set-on-single-planet-is-far-harbor-sized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">say</a> the team was gearing up to release annual story expansions, but plans might have changed, especially as the studio is very busy with The Elder Scrolls VI.</p>
<p>Still, there is that Starborn trademark that Bethesda&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/starborn-trademark-could-hint-at-starfields-next-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registered</a> in the Summer of 2024; fans have been speculating it could be the title of the next Starfield expansion. We'll probably learn a lot more about the future of Starfield during June's Xbox Games Showcase. Keep in mind that one of those exciting things could very well be the long rumored PlayStation 5 release, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-starfield-playstation-5-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> to be close now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/goblin-stealth-gaming-returns-in-styx-blades-of-greed-out-in-2025-heres-the-first-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Cyanide and Nacon have announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/styx-blades-of-greed">Styx: Blades Of Greed</a>, the third in a trilogy of goblin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth</a> games known for puke-based mechanics and many a snarky note-to-self. I never completed the previous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/styx-master-of-shadows">Styx: Master Of Shadows</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/styx-shards-of-darkness">Styx: Shards Of Darkness</a>, and if I'm honest, I fear Cyanide's impish infiltrator is doomed to forever butt his smirking, warty head against the 6/10 glass ceiling, with Thief's Garrett flashing V-signs on the other side.</p>
<p>Still, I have a certain respect for the series. There aren't many third-person sneakers like this any more, still fewer that have successfully gotten away with a protagonist who sounds like a chaddy Sam Fisher and looks like he should be cleaning toilets in Moria. So a quiet hip-hooray, then, for Blades Of Greed, which is out later in 2025. Here's a trailer.

<p>
What's the Green Plague up to in this one, then? The usual, from the looks of it: clambering up massive citadels, shivving or bamboozling their guards, cracking the bad kind of bad joke, making away with the treasure. You can still sick up a clone of yourself and turn invisible using Amber, but you also get powers derived from a new energy source, Quartz - these include mind control and time manipulation. 
</p>
<p>
The story is about stealing Quartz from the human Inquisition, and takes you via airship to three large environments - "The Wall, which marks the boundary of the human world; the lush orc village of Turquoise Dawn; and the Ruins of the elven capital, Akenash". New areas become available within those sandboxes via "Metroidvania-style" tool-gating. You'll also get to craft weapons and potions before undertaking each heist.
</p>
<p>
The setting has always been Styx's big draw for me. All that cobbled-together, piled-up masonry, buttressed by some respectable grimdark lore. I share Alec Meer's (RPS in peace) distaste for the character's internal monologue, however. "Clearly, a lot of money and skill has gone into making Shards Of Darkness, which only makes the fact that you have to battle past this woeful characterisation to get to the strong stealth meat below all the more tragic," he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/styx-shards-of-darkness-review">wrote of the most recent Styx outing</a>.</p>
<p>Re-reading that review, I'm struck by the mention of rampant fourth-wall-breaking, which I don't remember being quite so abundant in Master Of Shadows. Hopefully they've eased off on it in Blades Of Greed. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3290690/Styx_Blades_of_Greed/">Find out more on Steam</a>.

            <p>Chinese-speaking users accounted for 50 percent of Steam's playerbase last month.</p>
<p>Valve has released its latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/">Steam Hardware and Software Survey</a>, which revealed a 20.88 percent increase in Simplified Chinese-speaking users in February 2025, making up half of the entire userbase.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/steam-saw-chinese-users-spike-and-exceed-50-of-worldwide-playerbase-in-february-2025/">Automaton</a> noted, February usually brings an increase of Chinese users to Steam as it coincides with Chinese New Year holidays. However, this year's increase was significantly higher than usual - 2024 saw an equivalent increase of 7.26 percent.</p>

<p>English-speaking users are the next highest, accounting for an almost 24 percent proportion of the userbase. Similarly, the Christmas season usually results in a spike in proportion.</p>
<p>The success of Game Science's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> is likely a contributing factor to this increase in Chinese users. While its player numbers have dwindled since launch, it remains a huge success story and has the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-already-steams-most-played-single-player-game-of-all-time">second highest all-time concurrent player count on the platform</a>.</p>
<p>Another factor could be the demo for Mecha Break, a multiplayer mech shooter from Chinese developer Amazing Seasun Games that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfestmostplayed_feb_2025">dominated Steam Next Fest</a> - it reached a <a href="https://x.com/MechaBREAK/status/1897105111476003317">peak player count of over 300,000</a>.</p>
<p>Other contributing factors could be the ongoing success of NetEase's Marvel Rivals that saw its new season launch in this period, as well as the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> at the very end of the month that saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-propels-steam-to-highest-ever-player-count">Steam reach its highest ever concurrent player count</a>.</p>
<p>What's more, this upward trend in Chinese-speaking users is likely to continue. If Mecha Break's demo is anything to go by, its full release later this year will be huge.</p>
<p>Then there's the likes of the PlayStation-published Chinese action game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lost-soul-aside-launches-in-2025-nine-years-after-devil-may-cry-and-final-fantasy-15-inspired-action-games-reveal">Lost Soul Aside</a>, as well as another Chinese action game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-fresh-look-at-chinese-fantasy-soulslike-wuchang-fallen-feathers">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a> (not to be confused with Wukong), while the free-to-play <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fragpunk-console-launch-delayed-as-neteases-shooter-hits-pc-this-week">FragPunk</a> follows Marvel Rivals as NetEase's next big shooter.</p>
<p>It's clear that Chinese studios are thriving, and that's resulting in a surge of Steam users in the country.</p>
<p>Yet political relations between China and the US are causing friction in the industry. NetEase laid off a number of Marvel Rivals developers from its US team despite the game's success. Reportedly, further downsizing is yet to come, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">NetEase has denied such allegations</a>.</p>
<p>At the start of the year, Chinese conglomerate <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-labels-tencent-as-a-chinese-military-company">Tencent was labelled a military company by the US</a> - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-threatens-legal-proceedings-if-us-doesnt-overturn-decision-to-label-it-as-a-chinese-military-company">company threatened legal proceedings in response</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>At the time, I hoped this tone and tenor of trying too hard<em> </em>was just press release guff. No such luck, if the writing shown off below is any indication.</p>

<p>But let's first back up a moment, because it does <em>look</em> great. So great I'm having some difficulty believing this is what the game looks like, rather than just being concept art. It's stunning. The purple and yellow palette. The painterly style, soft but sharp with detail.</p>
<p>Then you start reading. "Let me introduce myself," says your character to a sweet old lady feeding pigeons. "I don't shit in my own drinking water - though I see that's not a deal-breaker".</p>
<p>In Disco Elysium, your character could find a leather jacket with "Fuck The World" written on the back. If you tried hard enough, you could even convince your partner Kim to wear a complimentary jacket that read "Pissf****t". Someone at Longdue evidently thought those jackets were a good baseline for character development.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I'm viewing this dialogue through eyes pre-exhausted by Longdue's description of your character as "a chaotic, self-destructive provocateur who sees humanity as inherently selfish and cruel" and "unapologetically cynical and dangerously unhinged". Disco Elysium was frequently self-satisfied, show-offish, and overly slick. But it wasn't ever, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/rr56tvKSe28">Nathan Barley on the bus</a>.</p>
<p>The pigeon lady offers your character a loaf of bread. You've got three responses to that, one of which is categorised "Noblesse N'oblige". I like that name. The dialogue itself is "I'd rather lick the bin [knock the bread from her hands]" - a jejune and obliviously mean-spirited interpretation of why the chaotic cringe comedy options in Disco were so much fun.</p>
<p>Your "Gonzo" option is: "Yeah, feed the masses! So let it be done. EAT UP, SKY RATS! (Take the bread)". You ever see a sentence that reads like someone wrote the exclamation points first and worked backwards from there? The attempts at understated philosophy feel just as unconvincing: "They give the filth on the ground a fighting chance to touch the sky. That's admirable".</p>
<p>I don't expect or even especially want a carbon copy of Disco Elysium from Hopetown, but if you're going to piggyback off the imagination of people that<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-studio-bosses-humiliated-the-cancelled-expansions-lead-writer-for-speaking-to-journalists-claims-report"> have allegedly had their work stolen from them</a>, apparently justified by the sole contribution of a lone systems designer from an outsourced studio (who I'm sure is excellent at their job and likely had no say in the "spiritual successor" marketing angle), I think you should probably make a more convincing attempt to better understand the spirit you're succeeding.</p>
<p>Still, bloody gorgeous art. And, look, I'm obviously cherrypicking lines out of context from a single screenshot. I'd be very happy to be eat crow for doubting pigeons here. If not, there's always two <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yet-another-studio-formed-of-disco-elysium-alumni-has-announced-a-cerebral-sci-fi-rpg-just-to-confuse-you">others</a> anyway.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Nintendo has added two more Game Boy titles to its Switch Online subscription catalogue - and you can play them right now. 
</p>
<p>
1994 classic Donkey Kong is the star of the show here - the highly-regarded puzzle platformer that serves as a continuation of the classic DK arcade game, with elements of Donkey Kong Jr, and also the subsequent Mario vs Donkey Kong titles.
</p>
<p>
If you've never played it before, there's a fun surprise after the first four levels - which are the ones found in the original Donkey Kong arcade cabinet. It's safe to say the game is bigger than just those.

Also available today is Mario's Picross - which is, as you'd expect, Picross puzzles to colour in based on Mario and Mushroom Kingdom designs. Originally released for Game Boy in 1995, this was one of the earliest Picross games, and the first to the west.

			<p>It's been exactly a year since Frogwares <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-goes-to-kickstarter-soon-as-frogwares-needs-a-safety-net-from-the-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> its fans that The Sinking City 2 would get a Kickstarter funding campaign. Back then, the Ukrainian studio aimed to launch it shortly, but clearly, there were some hiccups.</p>
<p>The campaign is finally <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2?ref=discovery_category&amp;total_hits=21544&amp;category_id=35" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live</a>, though, and its minimum goal of €100K has already been nearly doubled as of this writing. So far, Frogwares has not shared any info on the stretch goals, but they're sure to come with 29 days left in the campaign.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Sinking City 2 - Developer Deep Dive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jN0mNkrXHJc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Wael Amr, CEO of Frogwares, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>After 3 years of this horrid war hanging over our daily lives, we've learned to adapt, though it has never been easy. In 2023 when we released Sherlock Holmes The Awakened with the help of Kickstarter and our loving fans, we built ourselves a safety net that saved us more than once. From power outages and the need for team members to relocate on short notice, to having to pause development for days, this safety net was crucial. Given that The Sinking City 2 is a far more complex and demanding game, we’ve decided to take the same route as before.</em></p>
<p>Frogwares Publishing Director Sergiy Oganesyan also spoke about the previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-announcement-ue5-horror-frogwares-deliver-ukraine-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> slight genre change, moving away from adventure to a full-fledged horror title:</p>
<p><em>When we announced The Sinking City 2 back in 2024, we stated this is going to be our chance to shift our studio into creating games that are more “horror first” focused and the results we’re all seeing internally are extremely promising. We’re not ditching our investigation roots entirely, but the chance to spread and challenge our norms has really helped the team grow. We’ve placed combat and exploration first while still keeping an air of investigation that adds depth but is entirely optional.</em></p>

<p>The Sinking City 2 is being made with Unreal Engine 5 and will launch on PC (Steam, Epic Games Store, GOG), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-confirmed-to-have-been-co-developed-with-sony/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>AMD FSR 4, the latest version of the upscaling technology made by AMD, was co-developed with Sony. The news came <a href="https://x.com/amdradeon/status/1897741520200962308" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a tweet</a> pushed by AMD itself, where it was added that this is just the beginning:</p>
<p><em>Happy Radeon Day! We’re proud to collaborate with PlayStation on Project Amethyst!</em></p>
<p><em>FSR 4 is looking fantastic! Excited for the co-development with Sony Interactive Entertainment on the models used for the AMD FSR 4 upscaler. This is just the beginning. Stay tuned for what’s next!</em></p>
<p>For those who may not remember, the joint machine learning project Amethyst was announced in late 2024 by Sony. In an <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mark-cerny-qa-we-ask-about-vrr-improvements-pssr-fg-path-tracing-and-ml-project-with-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exclusive Wccftech interview with Mark Cerny</a>, the PlayStation 5 Pro System Architect explained:</p>
<p><em>Pretty much when PlayStation 5 Pro was wrapping up, we began discussions and development of those various aspects of Amethyst. To get more specific, I think we were getting pretty good momentum by the end of 2023. But as you know, it takes a phenomenally long amount of time to go from discussions and concepting to actually having a piece of hardware out in the marketplace.</em></p>
<p><em>We're looking to co-develop performant new AI architectures that can be used freely in any space that anybody chooses to use them, whether that is PC, console, or cloud. For the software, if I look at it today, we have games that run on a TV and there's a certain set of developers that make them, and AMD for PC has games that run on PC monitors that have a somewhat overlapping set of developers that make games for them. There are different needs and different relationships there, so really what we're looking to do is to co-develop those network architectures and those training strategies that can then be freely used in both contexts.</em></p>
<p>The collaboration is specifically on the AI models, then. It's the big AMD FSR 4 change, after all. FSR 1 was just a spatial upscaler, whereas FSR 2 switched to a temporal upscaler. Neither could possibly perform as well as an AI model, though, which has now been proven with the launch of FSR 4, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-better-fsr3-dlss-cnn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described as a massive improvement over FSR 3</a>. Of course, the trade off is that AMD had to restrict it to the new Radeon RX 9000 Series, just like NVIDIA has been doing with DLSS and its GeForce RTX Series.</p>
<p>Still, AMD should definitely be commended for its efforts to catch up with NVIDIA. While the DLSS 4 transformer model remains the gold standard for upscaling, AMD FSR 4 has reduced that gap considerably, a far from easy feat to accomplish given NVIDIA's headstart. The increased competition in the space will no doubt spur NVIDIA to further improvements and so on, eventually benefiting all users.</p>
