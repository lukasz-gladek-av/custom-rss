<p>Delta Force has taken the first-person shooter by storm these past few months, with players praising the game for being “what Battlefield 2042 should have been”. </p>



<p>In addition to the console version of the game, the developers also confirmed that a kill-cam feature is in development, as well as content variations for some of its modes and maps. This includes a night mode for its Hazard Ops extraction game mode, where players will be required to use Night Vision goggles during gameplay.</p>



<p>Delta Force is a free-to-play first-person shooter scheduled to release in early access on Steam sometime in Q4 2024. The console versions will come in Q1 2025.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s average 30-day player count on Steam has dropped to its lowest level in the series' history.</p>
<p>Whilst participation in live-service games inevitably waxes and wanes - and these figures do not account for players on console - it's nonetheless an unwelcomed milestone for Bungie's beleaguered sci-fi shooter.</p>

<p>Despite launching Episodes, the three-part, self-contained seasons that kicked off in The Final Shape's shadow back in June, <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/1085660">Steam Charts</a> suggests the game is averaging just 31,300 players over the last 30 days – the lowest number ever recorded since Destiny launched on Steam back in 2019.</p>
<p>That's down 75 percent since June, when Destiny 2's final expansion, The Final Shape, launched.</p>

</figure>
<p>According to <a href="https://thegamepost.com/destiny-2-lowest-player-count-franchises-history/">TheGamePost</a>, that's less than half the number of players Destiny 2 boasted three months after The Witch Queen and Lightfall released in 2022 and 2023, respectively.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-acknowledges-uncertainty-surrounding-the-future-of-destiny-following-layoffs">Bungie recently issued a statement acknowledging concern over the future of its decade-old sci-fi franchise</a> following "recent changes" at the studio.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">Sweeping layoffs saw 220 Bungie staff out of a job</a>, less than a year after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-developer-bungie-latest-playstation-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">further 100 employees were let go last October</a>. A further 155 Bungie staff are also departing the studio for roles within parent company PlayStation.</p>
<p>In response, Bungie has now said it remains "committed" to Destiny, though details of what's next remain thin on the ground. There's also no mention of the departures of key Destiny creatives Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy, who were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-destiny-project-payback-no-longer-happening-senior-execs-depart">reportedly developing a now-cancelled Destiny spin-off named Payback</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"IT WAS $7500 - for a buyout of any future royalties from the game - forever…" Ware added in a follow-up tweet.</p>
<p>"To put this in context, Grand Theft Auto 6 [sic] grossed, wait for it… $8.6 BILLION.</p>
<p>"Ah, but think of the exposure…," he added, before signing off with: "Go fuck yourself".</p>
<p>When pressed in his comments that he'd "fucked up" by turning down such an opportunity and "long-term win", he responded:</p>
<p>"I haven't 'fucked up'. I've worked in artist rights advocacy for 20 years. I know the game. This [is] iniquitous."</p>
<p>"For those claiming [Heaven 17] should have accepted the extremely low offer for buyout for Temptation in GTA6 claiming 'increased exposure'…  an extra one million streams generates each writer a pitiful $1k each," he <a href="https://x.com/martynware/status/1832661703554728237">explained</a> later still.</p>
<p>When asked what he would have considered a reasonable offer, Ware <a href="https://x.com/martynware/status/1832738125237358859">suggested</a>: "$75K a buyout - or no advance required for a reasonable royalty". Apparently, Rockstar "<a href="https://x.com/martynware/status/1832677601267052797">refused</a>".</p>
<p>Ware's mentions were then swarmed by people pointing taking umbrage with his position.</p> <div>

But this week, the sole reason for my fandom, <em>The Beatles: Rock Band</em>, turns 15. Harmonix’s rhythm game masterpiece feels forgotten despite the miraculous circumstances that allowed it to exist. </p><p>It remains the single most gorgeous tribute the band has ever received and deserves to be remembered as both the peak of a forgotten genre and a prime example of how games can allow newer, younger audiences to appreciate things they wouldn’t have otherwise.<br></p><h2 id="h430289"><a id=""></a>The Long And Winding Road</h2><p>The existence of a <em>Beatles </em>video game was announced by MTV Games, Apple (no not that Apple, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Records&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Records" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this one</a></span>), and Harmonix in October 2008. In the media landscape of the time, this was massive, with both <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20090312101841/http://www.gamespot.com/news/blogs/rumor-control/909119209/26653056/wsj-beatles-playing-rock-bands-tune.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090312101841/http://www.gamespot.com/news/blogs/rumor-control/909119209/26653056/wsj-beatles-playing-rock-bands-tune.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gaming</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/the-beatles-onboard-with-rock-band-1043637/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/the-beatles-onboard-with-rock-band-1043637/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mainstream</a></span> outlets reporting on the new untitled project. Back then, there were two dominant franchises in the absurdly successful rhythm game genre, and every few months the world’s biggest bands would pick a side. </p><div><p><em>Guitar Hero</em>, owned by Activision and developed by Neversoft, managed to lock down groups like Aerosmith, Metallica, and Van Halen to exclusivity deals that eventually resulted in their own standalone entries. Meanwhile,<em> Rock Band</em>, the franchise helmed by Harmonix (the original creators of <em>Guitar Hero, </em>confusing I know) and published jointly by MTV Games and EA, managed to get bands like U2, AC/DC, and The Pixies to drop entire albums into its ever-growing, always forward-compatible music library.</p><p>Two bands were widely considered the holy grail of this ongoing cold war: Led Zeppelin (one of the only rock acts to never feature any of their music in either series) and the Beatles. Both groups had a long history of being deeply protective of how and where their music was licensed.</p></div><p>So when one of these holdouts declared they were jumping onto gaming’s biggest trend, it was major. There was a caveat: Players couldn’t import these songs into the other <em>Rock Band</em> games, one of the key advantages Harmonix’s series had over the competition. Still, though, this was the goddamn Beatles. This was huge news to everyone.</p><p>Everyone but me.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="bb972b3fba0937a62981750bcd3c3fae" data-recommend-id="image://bb972b3fba0937a62981750bcd3c3fae" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Beatles perform." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Beatles perform." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Harmonix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bb972b3fba0937a62981750bcd3c3fae" data-recommend-id="image://bb972b3fba0937a62981750bcd3c3fae" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Beatles perform." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h430290"><a id=""></a>Nowhere Man</h2><p>As a fanboy skimming Harmonix forums daily, with hundreds of <em>Rock Band </em>songs on his Xbox 360 hard drive, I was underwhelmed. I knew very little about the Liverpool-based quartet. Aside from some late-night infomercials promoting box sets of their old-ass music, the Beatles were about as distant from me, a Black teenager from New York City raised primarily on hip-hop, ‘80s pop, and the <em>Tony Hawk Pro Skater </em>soundtrack, as humanly possible.<br></p><div><p>I had an appreciation for a handful of older rock acts like the Police and Jimi Hendrix thanks to my parents. But the Beatles, who broke up before either of them could speak complete sentences, didn’t resonate with mom or dad during their formative years, either.</p><p>It was the 2009 Xbox E3 Press Conference, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/is-e3-dead-2023-canceled-esa-1851092261&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/is-e3-dead-2023-canceled-esa-1851092261">of all things</a></span>, that changed my tune. In a genius bit of marketing, Microsoft opened the show with the world premiere of <em>The Beatles: Rock Band</em>. Six joyful members of the Harmonix team played “Day Tripper,” followed by Giles Martin, son of the Beatles’ legendary producer, explaining that the Beatles catalog was “meticulously reworked specifically for this game.” The resulting work was also the basis for the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.npr.org/2009/09/08/112646759/the-beatles-remastered-not-just-for-audiophiles&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.npr.org/2009/09/08/112646759/the-beatles-remastered-not-just-for-audiophiles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2009 remasters</a></span> being released alongside the game’s launch.</p></div><figure id="" data-id="b328d9649ac01aa6563336582a449018" data-recommend-id="image://b328d9649ac01aa6563336582a449018" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Beatles perform.

This was a rare moment in which the living Beatles and their surviving loved ones had come together (heh) under one roof, and the mainstream media ate it up. </p><p>The significance of this, of course, was totally lost on me, a 16-year-old writing up dumb E3 blogs for my 300 Tumblr followers. But I was intrigued. It finally clicked that this wasn’t just a <em>Rock Band </em>game with Beatles avatars and some extra chrysanthemums in the main menu’s UI. Sure, this wasn’t my band. But this was clearly something Harmonix was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/developer-terrified-while-making-beatles-rock-band-5350599&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/developer-terrified-while-making-beatles-rock-band-5350599">excited to make</a></span>. The team’s enthusiasm was infectious enough to get me, a fan of their work since <em>Frequency</em> and <em>Amplitude</em>, curious about the final product.</p><p>A few weeks after the September 9, 2009 release date I picked up my copy and quickly discovered my new musical obsession. <em>The Beatles: Rock Band</em> was obviously a great game. But it was also an in-depth, lovingly crafted history lesson told across 45 songs, dozens of archival videos and photos, loading screen fun facts, and original cinematics, aimed squarely at a total Beatles novice. Harmonix diligently recreated the sets, stages, stadiums, and imaginary landscapes of the band’s entire career, instantly catching me up on why they mattered.</p></div><h2 id="h430291"><a id=""></a>Fixing A Hole</h2><div><p>Sure, this was about as sanitized a history lesson as one could get on The Beatles, a band with no shortage of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/when-john-lennons-more-popular-than-jesus-controversy-turned-ugly-106430/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/when-john-lennons-more-popular-than-jesus-controversy-turned-ugly-106430/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">controversies</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/cynthia-lennon-the-first-wife-of-john-lennon-whose-steadfastness-was-rewarded-by-cruel-treatment-at-the-hands-of-the-beatle-10150200.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/cynthia-lennon-the-first-wife-of-john-lennon-whose-steadfastness-was-rewarded-by-cruel-treatment-at-the-hands-of-the-beatle-10150200.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fuck-ups</a></span>. And with music (and games) being subjective, not everyone would have the same takeaway. But like the Wii, which simplified the hobby for working parents and retirees just a few years before, <em>The Beatles: Rock Band</em> was an undeniable demonstration of how video games could reintroduce and recontextualize a point of cultural significance to all ages.</p><p>A year before <em>The Beatles: Rock Band</em>, I would’ve cynically written them off as a bunch of old white dudes with no real classics like a <em>Reasonable Doubt</em> or a <em>Late Registration</em>. Within a month of rolling credits, I purchased 70 percent of those 2009 remasters. I even learned how to play a handful of their songs on the bass.</p><p>Harmonix has since moved on from the <em>Rock Band </em>series<em> </em>to create unsung gems like the experimental turntable simulator <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fuser-dj-game-dlc-harmonix-guitar-hero-rock-band-1849856001&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fuser-dj-game-dlc-harmonix-guitar-hero-rock-band-1849856001"><em>Fuser</em></a></span>. Then, in 2021, the company was purchased by Epic Games and has since released the successful <em>Fortnite Festival</em>. But it’s a shame that its Beatles game only received a handful of DLC releases (the rest of <em>Abbey Road</em>, <em>Rubber Soul,</em> <em>Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band</em>, and the free single <em>All You Need Is Love</em>). It’s an even bigger tragedy that Harmonix couldn’t renew those licenses so it could remain playable on modern hardware (would love it if Epic used its near-infinite war chest of V-Bucks to rectify this, but I digress).</p></div><p>Some 15 years after its release, <em>The Beatles: Rock Band </em>represents one of gaming’s finest moments: The tasteful and respectful preservation of seminal work from another medium in a new and interesting way. The rhythm game bubble may have popped not long after its 2009 release. But <em>The Beatles: Rock Band </em>is paramount to the industry trend that birthed it. It is a gold standard in a larger phenomenon that makes the entire medium so unique and so compelling in the first place.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Following more than a year of intense training, constant streams showcasing his evolution, and being coached by the (now former) record holder, Doug ‘Censor’ Martin has finally broken the world record for the most pull-ups in 24 hours. </p>



<p>Martin, who is one of the most prolific professional Call of Duty players ever, has been chasing this record for the longest time, and now he hasn’t just beaten it, but <strong>obliterated it</strong>, soaring over 9,000 pull-ups in little more than 19 hours.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-tippable">Tippable</h2>



<p>Love him or hate him, Doug ‘Censor’ Martin has achieved something special today, securing a Guinness World Record that’ll likely go unbroken for quite some time. The former record holder, Kenta Adachi, held the record for performing 8,940 pull-ups in a 24-hour window in Japan.</p>



<p>Before that, Jaxon Italiano, an Australian man, beat the existing record by performing 8,008 pull-ups in the same timeframe. He has been working with Censor for a while, training him (successfully) to beat the now-shattered record.</p>



<p>Hitting the record with five hours left on the clock meant that Censor was able to push on and go as far as he desired, all the while being monitored by invigilators from Guinness. At the time of publishing, he was still going.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>WE HAVE A NEW WORLD RECORD⚠️⚠️</p><p>At just over 19 hours, Doug <a href="https://twitter.com/Censor?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Censor</a> Martin has broken the WORLD RECORD for the most pull-ups in 24 hours. </p><p>He still has all that time to push the record however high he wants. </p><p>We are all so fucking proud of you Doug, seriously.

</div></figure>







<p>Censor has been a die-hard Call of Duty pro player for more than a decade, securing the top spot at the MLG National Championship way back in 2011 and helping to spearhead the growth of the Call of Duty scene. He has since retired from actively competing but remains connected to the Call of Duty League’s Boston Breach.</p>



<p>This was an inspirational journey – for those who didn’t follow it, Censor would regularly appear in front of the camera in floods of tears, expressing his frustration at missing attempts to break the record in training. His hands were regularly chewed up by the bar, and his body was being punished with each new milestone.</p>



<p>Congratulations, Doug.</p>

			<p>Following yesterday's rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-xvi-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> by Windows Central journalist Jez Corden that several Final Fantasy games such as Final Fantasy VII Remake, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Final Fantasy XVI, and the Pixel remasters were 'on the docket' for an Xbox port, another journalist, Alex Donaldson from VG247, provided an opposite outlook.</p>
<p>In a forum post <a href="https://icon-era.com/threads/alex-donaldson-there-is-presently-no-active-development-on-an-xbox-version-of-remake-or-rebirth.13960/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> on the IconEra board, Donaldson claimed that, to his knowledge, there's no active development on an Xbox version of either of the Final Fantasy VII remake titles released so far. He's confident that it will eventually happen, just not right now. He speculated that Square Enix would focus on completing the third part of the remake trilogy and only then look at Xbox (and possibly Nintendo Switch 2) porting.</p>
<p>Donaldson subsequently added that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/square-enix-producer-naoki-yoshida-reiterates-the-studios-committment-to-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">company-wide policy change for the new multiplatform strategy</a> inevitably takes time to be applied, so there might be unannounced Square Enix games that have been in development targeting the usual platforms (PlayStation and PC) since they were started before the changes, and it might not make financial sense to change that target when they are at a late stage of development. Fans should be warned that if that turns out to be the case, it won't mean that Square Enix has shifted its strategy again.</p>
<p>Donaldson ends his post reiterating that things could have changed 'really recently', but last he heard, there were no development plans to port Final Fantasy VII Remake and/or Rebirth to Xbox presently. However, he added that Final Fantasy XVI is a different matter, and it may well happen sooner than the other games.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Final Fantasy XVI will launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-comes-to-pc-september-17/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Tuesday, September 17, for PC</a>, around fifteen months after its PlayStation 5 debut. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth may follow a similar trajectory, which would put its PC release somewhere around May 2025.</p>

<p>Days Gone was released on PlayStation 4 in 2019, emerging as a solid enough open-world, post-apocalyptic shooter with some innovative elements. It was a bit of a performance-based nightmare at launch, but it levelled out quite nicely and was eventually ported to PC, offering players on two platforms an enjoyable end-of-the-world experience.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, despite the potential of the universe for expansion and another game, Bend Studio announced some time ago that it wouldn’t be pursuing a sequel, leaving the title to rust and age, confined to the abyss of history. That has never sat well with the game’s director, who recently spoke out against Bend Studio for using Days Gone’s protagonist to ‘promote other games’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-days-gone-by">Days Gone By</h2>



<p>To celebrate the launch of Astro Bot, Bend Studio posted a picture of Deacon St. John, the main character from Days Gone, watching other Astro Bot characters play on a beach. By way of a response, John Garvin, one of the writers and directors working on Days Gone, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Kinda sad that Deek <em>(Deacon St. John)</em> has been reduced to promoting other games … well done Bend Studio! Way to protect your legacy!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This isn’t the first time that Garvin <a href="https://x.com/John_Garvin/status/1832243904172978646" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has taken to social media</a> to vent his frustrations regarding the abandonment of Days Gone. The gaming industry veteran departed Bend Studio in 2019, months after the release of Days Gone, and he has always rued how his game was treated in the years that followed.</p>



<p>He doubled down in the comments on Twitter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Haha, I see my character reduced to a cartoon schill promoting some small game and I’m being harsh? Sit down, my brotha, adults are talking</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I enjoyed Days Gone and rinsed the game as much as possible, collecting every trophy and exploring the vast world it presented. In particular, I was fond of the game’s ‘horde mechanic’, which allowed for hundreds of enemies to charge at the player in an instant, often making for some of the most intense fights I’ve ever had in a game.</p>



<p>It’s a shame that Days Gone was forgotten by Bend Studio, but it’s not the first franchise the team has had to give up on. It’s not a good look for Garvin to be defending his title like this on social media and he’s receiving plenty of flak for it, but it’s not impossible to see where he’s coming from.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Stellar Blade, Assassin’s Creed, and Others Referenced in Astro Bot Credits]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-credits-reference-games/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stellar-blade-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-and-others-referenced-in-astro-bot-credits.975081/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-credits-reference-games/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It has been noticed by eagle-eyed gamers that several references to games <strong>not featured </strong>in Astro Bot have surfaced in the game’s credits, suggesting that they’ll be added in post-launch updates. There’s a sizeable list that includes the likes of Stellar Blade, Assassin’s Creed, Worms, and Rise of the Ronin, leaving users to wonder in what capacity they’ll be added to the game that was released just a few days ago.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-stellar-blade-that-ll-be-interesting">Stellar Blade? That’ll Be Interesting</h2>



<p>The ‘Asstro Bot’ comments have already started appearing online.</p>



<p>In the credits for Astro Bot, several key franchises appear without having a spot in the base game:</p>



<ul>
<li>Worms</li>



<li>Stellar Blade</li>



<li>Rise of the Ronin</li>



<li>Rayman</li>



<li>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</li>



<li>Assassin’s Creed</li>



<li>Croc: Legend of the Gobbos</li>
</ul>



<p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1fbgfsk/stellar_blade_worms_rise_of_the_ronin_multiple/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Goldenboss6 on Reddit</a> for the list</em></p>



<p>Players have been enjoying the plethora of crossovers and collaborations in Astro Bot, but the team certainly isn’t done yet and there’s still plenty to draw from in the world of PlayStation. Stellar Blade certainly is an interesting title to feature on the list. </p>



<p>Earlier this year, the post-apocalyptic slasher was released to a positive reception but gained most of its attention online because of how voluptuous the protagonist is. As players explore Stellar Blade, they can unlock a series of outfits, some of which leave utterly nothing to the imagination.</p>



<p>Rayman, Worms, or Croc write themselves perfectly into a cutesy game like Astro Bot, but it’ll be interesting to see how the likes of Stellar Blade are brought up.</p>



<p>Astro Bot was released on September 6, pulling in extremely positive reviews across the board and being declared Game of the Year by many users.</p>



<p>Have you given it a go yet? What franchise would you most like to see brought into the fold?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/th0mashd-gives-his-thoughts-going-into-day-2-of-fortnite-globals/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The popular European Fortnite competitor, Th0masHD, finished off day one of Fortnite Globals in second place with his teammate, Queasy. The two players dominated but still fell almost 150 points behind first. Th0masHD, one of the most decorative and famous Fortnite players in the world, has never actually gotten first place in an FNCS event. </p>



<p>I was able to sit down with the player after day one to get his thoughts on what needs to happen for him and his duo to grab first during the second and final day.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-th0mashd-prepares-for-day-2-of-fortnite-globals">Th0masHD Prepares For Day 2 Of Fortnite Globals</h2>



<p>Ending day one, the duo was able to hold second place as their own. The team, however, ended with only six points more than third place. This means the duo will have to be on their toes going into the final day of competition tomorrow.</p>



<p>“Obviously, it feels good to end in second on the first day,” said Th0masHD in an exclusive interview. “But tomorrow is what truly matters.”</p>



<p>While the first day of the Fortnite Global Championship was the standard FNCS format, the second day will have a 1.5x point multiplier, meaning any duo could make a massive comeback.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>“We will definitely go and look at some of the games we played today and see what people are doing and what we need to do for tomorrow.”</p>



<p>But with a successful performance coming out of day one, does the duo need to prepare differently than usual for tomorrow?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-th0mashd-talks-what-him-and-queasy-need-to-do-in-tomorrow-s-6-games">Th0masHD Talks What Him And Queasy Need To Do In Tomorrow’s 6 Games</h2>



<p>The duo still has a heavy amount of points they need to achieve before taking home the Fortnite Global Championship trophy, as the team keeps their heads high going into tomorrow’s final six games.</p>



<p>“I think we played good today,” said Th0masHD when asked how he felt about his duo’s performance during day one’s games. “I think we played the best we could. Perfect, to be honest. It was really only game one that we played sort of badly.”</p>



<p>So, what will the duo going into tomorrow’s finale?</p>



<p>“I think we need to stick to the plan and do the same today.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The team’s win happened when the two capitalized on height, with Th0masHD ensuring the ultimate height play while Queasy dragged out from a few layers below him.</p>



<p>“The first game we were able to hold height perfectly. It was basically a free win.”</p>



<p>While the two are feeling confident going into day two, they will need to make sure not to let their guards down, as many other players will have it out for them.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/industrial-annihilation">Industrial Annihilation</a> is a mashup Planetary Annihilation (big robot armies do battle on a planet) with factory management such as Factorio (conveyor belts conveyor belts conveyor belts). When we last checked in with it back in January, it was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/industrial-annihilation-is-a-planetary-annihilation-successor-with-factory-building">funding via StartEngine</a> with an ambitious eye towards a spring Early Access release.
</p>
<p>Now it's September and it's just got done being successfully funded <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/indannihilation/industrial-annihilation/description">via Kickstarter</a>, with a probably-still-ambitious eye towards an Early Access release before the end of 2024.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Kickstarter successfully hit its £152,299 ($200k) funding goal and went on to raise a total of £233,597. That unlocked the first three of several possible stretch goals, including an original soundtrack release and the addition of some extra skins and an extra unit. The funding amount is on top of $820,284.30 (around £624k) raised <a href="https://www.startengine.com/offering/industrialannihilation">via the StartEngine campaign earlier this year</a>.
</p>
<p>It's not uncommon for video games to raise capital through multiple platforms on their way to release. StartEngine also differs from Kickstarter in that it's an investment platform, not a crowdfunding tool.
</p>
<p>I never got on with Planetary Annihilation, but I did love Supreme Commander, which is part of the same messy family of spiritually related robot strategy games. Much of that love came from the challenge of efficiently constructing a base with which to churn out units within Supreme Commander's easily crashed economy. A similar game, more specifically focused on the joy of factory efficiency, sounds like it could be great.
</p>
<p>Although the Kickstarter campaign has ended, it's still possible to place late pledges. You'll also find more info on the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1796720/Industrial_Annihilation/?_xm=194726.318729274632699918">over on its Steam page</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
