            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-sales<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>co-creator Ed Boon has revealed the latest sales figures for&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>, the most recent entry in the long-running fighting game franchise, and it turns out the game is doing about as well as a recent indie smash hit.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1881825218538467395" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform X, Boon reveals that&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>is currently sitting at five million sales, as well as the fact that it's still ranking in the top 15 most-played games on PlayStation 5 (according to data that looks suspiciously similar to Circana's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-sales-data-july-circana" rel="nofollow">usual roundup</a>).</p>

<p>That figure puts&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>'s sales roughly on par with those of indie smash hit poker roguelike&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-5m" rel="nofollow">revealed to have hit the same milestone yesterday</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mortal-kombat-1-sales-fight.jpg?itok=IBARtKWX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mortal-kombat-1-sales-fight.jpg?itok=YG0Rx-Ir 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>has apparently reached five million sales.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course,&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>belongs to one of the longest-running fighting game franchises in the world, and it was also released several months before&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, so its achievement is perhaps a little more humble in that light.</p>

<p>Back in November 2023, around two months after&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>'s initial release, Warner Bros <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-eyes-more-live-services-as-mortal-kombat-1-sells-nearly-3-million-copies" rel="nofollow">revealed that the game had sold three million copies</a>. That means it's picked up another two million in just over a year.</p>

<p>Since launch,&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1&nbsp;</em>has enjoyed a slew of crossovers that have no doubt boosted its profile. These have included DLC fighters like <i>Invincible</i>'s <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-omni-man-gets-gameplay-reveal-november-release-window" rel="nofollow">Omni-Man</a>,&nbsp;<em>The Boys</em>' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-homelander-first-look" rel="nofollow">Homelander</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Peacemaker</em>'s...uh...<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortal-kombat-1-peacemaker-gameplay" rel="nofollow">Peacemaker</a>.</p>

<p>The game's latest crossover DLC fighter is Conan the Barbarian, and believe it or not, he's never appeared in a&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>game before, although another iconic Arnie character, the T-800 Terminator, was added to&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 11&nbsp;</em>as post-launch DLC.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>, it is, despite its name, the latest game in the&nbsp;<em>Mortal Kombat&nbsp;</em>series.</p>

<p>Released in September 2023, the game's story serves as another reboot, realigning some characters and reimagining others to create a new narrative continuity. It's still got plenty of the same blood-spattered fighting gameplay you know and love, though.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-does-1-ante-1-hand-each-round-mean-in-balatro-hieroglyph-voucher-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you’ve come across the Hieroglyph Voucher in Balatro and are unsure what it does, you’re in the right place. It stumped me, and my heart sank when I realized the full extent of what it did. Let’s avoid the same mistake happening to you.</p>



<p>Early games of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-has-announced-its-sold-5-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Balatro</a> are understandably a lot to take in. Jokers, Card Enhancements, Planets, Spectral modifiers, etc. But Balatro’s Hieroglyph Shop Voucher is a perfect example of how a simple misunderstanding can bring a run crumbling down. I took this the first time it appeared, having a vague idea of what it would do, and it didn’t help.</p>



<p>With greater understanding, I now know Hieroglyph’s full value and worth. Let me pass this knowledge on.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-hieroglyph-voucher-do-in-balatro">What Does Hieroglyph Voucher Do In Balatro?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>For those daring enough. Credit to LocalThunk</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Buying the Hieroglyph Voucher reduces your Ante by one, but you have one fewer Hand for every subsequent Blind you come up against from this point on.</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-1-ante-explained">-1 Ante Explained</h3>



<p>When you start a game of <a href="https://www.playbalatro.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Balatro</a>, you are immediately on <strong>Ante One of eight</strong>. If you beat the Boss Blind—after the Small and Big Blind—you progress to <strong>Ante Two</strong>, and so on.</p>



<p>Let’s say you’ve beaten the Small Blind on <strong>Ante Four</strong>. You go to the Shop and purchase Hieroglyph, and your Ante counter now changes to <strong>Ante Three.</strong> You have gone back a whole Ante!</p>



<h3 id="h-1-hand-explained">-1 Hand Explained</h3>



<p><strong>The default Hands you start with is usually four</strong>. Different Decks can change this, but by and large, you’re going to start with four. A Hand is the <strong>amount of times you’re allowed to submit cards in exchange for a score</strong>.</p>



<p>So, if you buy Hieroglyph and have four Hands available, <strong>this tally goes down to three</strong>. You now only have three chances to score points for any Blind you come up against.</p>



<h2 id="h-should-you-use-1-ante-1-hand-hieroglyph-voucher-in-balatro">Should You Use -1 Ante -1 Hand Hieroglyph Voucher in Balatro?</h2>



<p><strong>Hieroglyph should only be procured if you have an extremely effective strategy and you’re obliterating every Blind with a single hand.</strong></p>



<p>The Voucher is designed so that if your setup is OP, <strong>you get another Ante to make it even stronger</strong>. If you’re already destroying Blinds in one or two goes, losing a Hand won’t affect you. </p>



<p>You can also try Hieroglpyh if you’re<strong> struggling and desperately need something to turn your run around</strong>. This is very risky, and losing a Hand could sign your death sentence. The <strong>Paint Brush</strong> (+1&nbsp;Hand Size) and <strong>Palette </strong>(+1&nbsp;Hand Size again) Shop Vouchers are incredible additions to your arsenal if you can get them.</p>



<p>They negate the consequence of losing a Hand and can give you a clean reset. I pick and choose my Hieroglyph usage—mainly for those OP runs—but it’s a great tool to be more powerful and <strong>take your run into Endless Mode</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<p>How often do you take Hieroglyph in Balatro? Are there any other scenarios you’d suggest buying the Voucher I haven’t already outlined?</p>

Additionally, your Sega Account grants you access to exclusive bonuses and the ability to link accounts on various gaming platforms."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The first of these benefits is the Kazuma Kiryu Special Outfit in Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii, which lets protagonist Goro Majima dress up as his friend, rival, and longtime Yakuza series lead. This is the same outfit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-players-can-dress-up-majima-as-kiryu-if-they-sign-up-for-email-notifications">Sega is giving away for signing up to email notifications</a>, but it's unclear if that has now changed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those with a Sega Account between January 22 and March 7 will receive the outfit, distributed via a code between February 17 and March 7. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-release-date-brought-forward-a-week-to-avoid-monster-hunter-wilds-clash">Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii itself arrives on February 21</a>, brought forward from its original February 28 date to avoid a clash with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-hands-on-preview-exactly-what-i-hoped-for">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sega didn't announce what future benefits fans could expect, but it will presumably include its other flagship franchises such as Sonic the Hedgehog and Persona.

While practically nothing is known about this project, Sega described it as a "large scale global title" that many fans are expecting to be an accumulation of various games akin to what Call of Duty has done with its titles or what Ubisoft is working on with Assassin's Creed Infinity: essentially a hub for myriad other games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

NetherRealm development chief Ed Boon had teased fans over the years by referencing a pink ninja called Floyd, and, back in 2023, <a href="https://x.com/thethiny/status/1706734341982687374" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Mortal Kombat dataminer TheThiny</u></a> unearthed text in the Mortal Kombat 1 files that referenced a character of the same name.

Could it be that each challenge completion increases the chance Floyd will turn up?

		<p>It seems the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> release date has leaked, the game set to launch on 15th May 2025 for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC, and naturally day one on applicable tiers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p>The leak has seemingly come from an article that was briefly posted online by Gamekult, spotted via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/doom-the-dark-ages-releasing-on-may-15-2025.1088169/">Resetera</a>, who may have been briefed ahead of time on the content of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/09/xbox-developer_direct-stream-will-feature-doom-the-dark-ages-more-on-23rd-january/">Xbox Developer_Direct stream that will take place tomorrow</a>, Thursday 23rd January.</p>


<p>Doom: The Dark Ages is a prequel to the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/05/16/doom-review/">Doom 2016 reboot</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/17/doom-eternal-review/">Doom Eternal</a>, nipping back in time to the last time that the Doom Slayer was out and about for some demon bashing. You’ll go thoroughly medieval on those demons, which will include a mix of very familiar foes from the series as well as some all-new enemies.</p>
<p>The stream will feature the developers themselves to introduce their games and talk about them ahead of expected launches in 2025, and alongside Doom: The Dark Ages, it will be visiting Compulsion Games to talk about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a>, to Sandfall Interactive to look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/28/clair-obscur-expedition-33-preview-a-poignant-and-painterly-rpg/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, and one final surprise studio and game reveal – there’s been lots of rumours for an Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake…</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-apparently-leaks-ahead-of-developer-direct.1088655/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/doom-dark-ages-release-date-apparently-leaks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>release date may already have leaked ahead of the game's showing during tomorrow's Xbox Developer Direct presentation.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, Xbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-announced" rel="nofollow">announced a Developer Direct</a> for January 23rd (that's tomorrow), during which the studio will be showing off&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>,&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, and&nbsp;<em>South of Midnight</em>, as well as an as-yet unrevealed fourth game.</p>

<p>Getting a release date for one or all of those games would make sense during said presentation, but it looks like a French publication may accidentally have already leaked the release date for&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, if a ResetEra user's sighting of an RSS feed listing is to be believed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-apparently-leaked-armor.jpg?itok=lkDB-wik 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-apparently-leaked-armor.jpg?itok=ikweDE3y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>' release date may already have been leaked.</figcaption></figure><p>ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/doom-the-dark-ages-releasing-on-may-15-2025.1088169/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Alexzan</a> says they were browsing their RSS feeds (essentially feeds that display website updates and information) on RSS app Feedly when they noticed an entry from French publication <a href="https://www.gamekult.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gamekult</a>.</p>

<p>The listing is, of course, in French. It reads as follows: "<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> décimera les légions infernales le 15 mai 2025".</p>

<p>You can probably work out roughly what that means on your own, but just in case, Alexzan helpfully provides a translation: "<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>will decimate the infernal legions on May 15th, 2025".</p>

<p>The article to which the listing should point is, of course, not currently available on Gamekult's website, but it would seem the publication has accidentally revealed a May 15th release date for the upcoming game. If it's legit, it was almost certainly published too early in error.</p>




<p>We'll almost certainly find out exactly when&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>is due to launch when the Developer Direct airs tomorrow. It's due to start at 1pm Eastern (which is 10am Pacific and about 6pm GMT).</p>

<p>When it does launch,&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>will arrive on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3017860/DOOM_The_Dark_Ages/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/doom-the-dark-ages/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/doom-the-dark-ages" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>. As a first-party Xbox game, it'll also be available on Game Pass on day one, but only for certain tiers.</p>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Ahead of the Game Developer’s Conference (GDC) in March, the organization behind the event released its latest annual survey of creators on the state of the industry. The feedback showed that gaming has been rocked by layoffs over the last 12 months, but also pointed to some silver linings for its growth and future heading into 2025. </p><p>This year is expected to be a massive one for gaming between the launch of Nintendo’s highly-anticipated new Switch 2 console and the long-awaited arrival of <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>, the sequel to the second-best-selling game ever made. But 2025 is also expected to be another year full of potential upheaval as the video game industry tries to figure its shit out amid both audience stagnation and record competition between the hundreds of high-quality new games released every month. </p><p>The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://reg.gdconf.com/state-of-game-industry-2025?_mc=edit_gdcsf_gdcsf_le_x_10_x_2025&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://reg.gdconf.com/state-of-game-industry-2025?_mc=edit_gdcsf_gdcsf_le_x_10_x_2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2025 GDC State of the Game Industry report</a></span>, whose data was compiled from the responses of over 3,000 developers, showed game makers are still reeling from cuts across publishers and studios both big and small (NYU associate professor Laine Nooney discussed some of the limits of the data <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/lainenooney.bsky.social/post/3lgbfp7nmdk2o&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/lainenooney.bsky.social/post/3lgbfp7nmdk2o" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></span>). Eleven percent of respondents said they were laid off in 2025, with over 40 percent of developers feeling the immediate impact of those departures. They’re also feeling the effects of generative AI, with over 50 percent of respondents saying their companies use the tools and roughly one third saying they have personally used them to make games. </p><p>Live-service games are another area in which developers are increasingly skeptical. Amid major flops like <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League </em>and <em>Concord</em>, roughly one-third of developers at big-budget studios said they’re currently working on an online multiplayer game, but 41 percent of all developers said they’d rather be working on anything but a live-service project. That sentiment comes alongside conflicting signals from players, with Sony cutting even more live-service projects even as hero shooter <em>Marvel Rivals</em> explodes as one of the most successful new online games in years (for the time being, anyway).</p><p>One area for optimism? PC gaming. The 2025 GDC State of the Game Industry survey found that more developers than ever are planning their games for the open platform. The number of developers who said they’re working on a PC game grew from 66 percent in 2024 to 80 percent this year. The report speculates that this could be due in part to the popularity of Valve’s Steam Deck, which combines the convenience of a Nintendo Switch with the vast library of Steam games. (PC gaming has also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/new-report-says-pc-games-are-outselling-console-games-calling-pc-gaming-a-bright-spot-in-a-troubled-industry/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/new-report-says-pc-games-are-outselling-console-games-calling-pc-gaming-a-bright-spot-in-a-troubled-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grown by 20 percent since 2021 according to some estimates</a></span>, even as console gaming has stalled.)</p><p>GDC, which runs March 17-21 this year, includes curated video game history installations, award shows, and talks in which developers share stories and insights from their experiences making hugely successful and/or historically significant games  (GDC 2025 includes presentations on <em>Astro Bot</em>, <em>Helldivers 2</em>, and more). But it’s also a place where funding deals for new releases, from small indie games to bigger projects, get hatched. How to secure development funding while the industry is in flux is one of the big topics the conference plans to focus on this year.</p><p>  “The lack of opportunities in the game industry spills into funding opportunities,” one anonymous developer said in the survey. “Unless you have something that will be live-service or the potential to be super viral, it’s not easy to find a publisher.”</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d069670ac0f04af574f0c285b9554d42" data-recommend-id="image://d069670ac0f04af574f0c285b9554d42" data-format="png" data-width="1304" data-height="734" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows the breakdown of what platforms developers are creating games for.

That’s followed next by PS5 at a rate of 38 percent and Xbox Series X/S at 34 percent. (Games can come to multiple platforms, of course, hence the total here far exceeding 100 percent.) Developers were also surveyed about their upcoming projects, and that data shows the console numbers going just slightly down, with 37 percent of these upcoming projects targeting PS5 and 33 percent coming to Xbox Series X/S. Switch 2, meanwhile, is trending the other way, leaping from an 8-percent target rate for developers’ current projects to 20 percent for their next ones. Meanwhile, despite PlayStation edging out Xbox as a development target, when it comes to subscription services,  Game Pass is still more popular to develop for than PS Plus. Thirteen percent of developers are working on games for Microsoft’s service while only nine percent are targeting Sony’s rival one. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="52e5853c94eae704ce19fdd70bab900e" data-recommend-id="image://52e5853c94eae704ce19fdd70bab900e" data-format="png" data-width="1295" data-height="727" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A chart shows developer interest in various VR/AR platforms.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-spring-festival-rocket-league-mode<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>NetEase Games has revealed a brand new event for hero shooter&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>. The Spring Festival event arrives tomorrow, bringing with it a whole new game mode and some shiny new skins.</p>

<p>Kicking off on January 23rd at 9am UTC (that's 4am Eastern and 1am Pacific), the Spring Festival event's main draw is its Clash of Dancing Lions limited-time mode, which will look familiar to you if you've ever played&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/rocket-league" rel="nofollow"><em>Rocket League</em></a>.</p>

<p>Teams of three compete against one another on a dedicated map, with each team aiming to gain possession of a ball and make sure it enters the opposing team's scoring zone. Whoever reaches "a predetermined score" first will be declared the winner.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/marvel-rivals-spring-festival-new-mode-gameplay.jpg?itok=agXvRQcg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/marvel-rivals-spring-festival-new-mode-gameplay.jpg?itok=TRUuuJux 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Marvel Rivals</em>' new mode will be familiar to you if you've played&nbsp;<em>Rocket League</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The trailer for the event shows Star-Lord, Iron Fist, and Black Widow competing in the event, but it'll likely be open to all heroes; those are just the characters getting new skins as part of the Spring Festival.</p>

<p>Speaking of which, three Clashing Lions-themed skins have been introduced for those heroes. Star-Lord gets a fetching Lion's Mane costume, Black Widow gets a Lion's Heartbeat outfit, and Iron Fist gets a Lion's Gaze look.</p>

<p>They're all essentially themed around the same traditional Chinese lion dance motif, and they all look pretty excellent. At the very least, you'll be able to earn Star-Lord's outfit through "completing tasks", although it isn't clear whether you can earn the other two that way as well.</p>

<p>Additionally, since&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/marvels-spider-man-2" rel="nofollow">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>&nbsp;</em>is landing on PC soon, NetEase says a new&nbsp;<em>Spider-Man 2</em>-themed bundle will be available in&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' store, complete with a new outfit for Spidey, as well as a new nameplate and spray. Those are launching on January 30th.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>, it's a free-to-play hero shooter developed and published by Chinese studio NetEase. Similar in many ways to&nbsp;<em>Overwatch</em>, the game pits Marvel heroes like Black Widow, Captain America, and Venom against one another in objective-based gameplay modes.</p>

<p>The game has proven popular among players, reaching a player count of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-10m" rel="nofollow">10 million within a 72-hour period</a>. It's also attracted the attention of modders, who have already <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-modding-workaround" rel="nofollow">found a way around</a> an apparent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-modding-clampdown" rel="nofollow">clampdown on skin modding</a> introduced alongside&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>' first season.</p>

<p>You can play&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767030/Marvel_Rivals/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marvel-rivals/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/marvel-rivals/9n8pmw7qmd3d" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Koei Tecmo Games [3,041 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/koei-tecmo-games">Koei Tecmo</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Gust [800 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/koei-tecmo-games/gust">Gust</a> have released a new trailer, information, and screenshots for <em><a title="Games > Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land">Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</a></em> introducing the game’s systems. Plus, 15 minutes of new gameplay was showcased during the Taipei Game Show 2025 Special Program for the game. <span id="more-939549"></span></p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p>In the latest entry of the <em>Atelier</em> franchise, players can freely explore the Aladiss continent by discovering ruins, uncovering hidden treasures, and encountering brand-new characters. A newly unveiled overview trailer gives fans a deeper look at the game system, while a brand-new key visual by Benitama has also been released to the public to help celebrate the upcoming game.</p><p><em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</em> follows the adventures of Yumia Liessfeldt and her companions as they set off on a journey to unravel the mysteries behind the cataclysm that destroyed the once great continent of Aladiss, resulting in alchemy becoming taboo. In her quest, Yumia will be assisted by Flammi, a flying, self-confident traveling companion who once belonged to her mother. Yumia will also encounter many different characters throughout her travels including Licht, a highly skilled informant; Wilma, an anthropologist with a passion for the culture of Aladiss; Erhard, the leader of the Research Team; and the Alber, a small and friendly tribe who live in various parts of the world.</p><p>Throughout Yumia’s adventures, players will explore dungeons and ruins in search of hidden treasures including “memory vials” – remnants of the past that will allow them to consult certain information on the field such as the location of relic treasure around them. “Memory vials” can also be dismantled to obtain rare materials which are useful for synthesis.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_939581"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>By using the treasure trove keys found during their journey, players will be able to access precious treasures. They can find “trait crystals,” which can be used on items or equipment to improve performance from treasure chests. As they venture into Aladiss, fans will also find “mana geysers” which will release “particles” needed to unlock new synthesis recipes.</p><p>In <em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</em>, exploration will not be without its dangers, however, as players will sometimes have to venture into “manabound areas” where highly dense mana lies stagnant. Entering these areas will gradually deplete players’ energy, making it impossible to run while also reducing abilities in battle. Players will be able to restore their health by finding Alstahlia Flowers, while discovering and restoring landmarks will clear the area and improve ease of exploration.</p><p>While progressing through the story, players will receive exclusive quests from their travelling companions, but will also be able to gain rewards by completing normal quests. Discovering and unlocking landmarks and Shrines of Prayers during exploration will grant them with location quests.</p></blockquote><p><em>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,685 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,590 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,608 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,713 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,539 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,170 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3123410/Atelier_Yumia_The_Alchemist_of_Memories__the_Envisioned_Land/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> on March 21 worldwide.</p><p>Watch the footage below.

<p>After <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/the-thing-after-the-switch-how-overheard-chatter-led-to-a-nintendo-goose-chase/">literal years</a> of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/07/report-nintendos-next-console-ships-late-2024-still-supports-cartridges/">speculation and leaks</a>, it was nice to get <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/its-official-take-a-first-look-at-the-switch-2/">an actual glimpse of the Switch 2 hardware</a> (and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/how-big-is-the-switch-2-trailer-suggests-7-9-screen-10-5-width-w-joy-cons/">its increased size</a>) last week. But even with the console officially "revealed," there's still a wide range of important unknown Switch 2 details that Nintendo has yet to address.</p>
<p>As we wait for the company to dribble out additional information in the coming weeks and months, we thought we'd take a quick look at the biggest outstanding questions and concerns we still have about Nintendo's next gaming platform, along with some analysis of what we know, what we can guess, and what we expect on each score.</p>
<h2>Launch date?</h2>
<p>The teaser trailer's promise of a "2025" Switch 2 release technically covers any launch date between "tomorrow" and December 31. But we can probably narrow that window down a bit.</p>
<p>For one, Nintendo promised "a closer look at Switch 2" in <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/successor/en-us/nintendo-direct/index.html">a Direct video presentation scheduled for April 2</a>. It would be a little weird for that "closer look" to come after the console itself was launched, so a launch before April seems out of the question.</p>

<p>Nintendo is also planning <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/nintendo-switch-2-experience/">a series of worldwide "Nintendo Switch 2" hands-on experiences</a> through which consumers will be able to try the console for themselves. Again, it would be odd to run an exclusive, ticket-limited hands-on experience if the console was already available in stores. The latest Switch Experience event is currently scheduled for May 31 through June 1 in Seoul, South Korea, making a Switch 2 release before June seem unlikely (though a staggered regional rollout could change this calculus).</p>
<p>Before the Switch launched in March of 2017, Nintendo's previous three home consoles all launched in November, dating back to <a href="https://archive.arstechnica.com/archive/2001/0901-1.html">the GameCube in 2001</a>. Don't be shocked if Nintendo reverts to form and waits until the high-impact holiday sales windows near the end of the 2025 for the Switch 2's release.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<h2>Price?</h2>
<p>When the Switch launched in 2017, its $300 price point was actually a little higher than the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidthier/2017/02/09/sony-just-gave-ps4-a-price-cut/">contemporary prices for the aging PS4</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/10/15776370/microsoft-xbox-one-s-price-drop-e3-2017">Xbox One</a>. And Nintendo has steadfastly managed to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/08/will-the-nintendo-switch-ever-see-a-price-drop/">avoid offering a single price drop</a> on the best-selling console since then (though inflation has lowered the value of that pricing a bit, and the Switch OLED <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/switch-oled-review-nintendos-nicest-most-nonessential-upgrade-yet/">came in at $350 in 2021</a>).</p>

              While the nominal price of the original Switch hasn't changed, inflation has eaten into its "real" price a bit.

<p>In the meantime, Sony has actually raised the PS5's (already significant) launch price <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/08/sony-raises-playstation-5-console-prices-in-many-regions-effective-immediately/">in many regions</a>&nbsp;and has seen <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-700-price-tag-isnt-hurting-ps5-pros-early-sales/">strong initial sales for the $700 PS5 Pro</a>. On the other side, Microsoft's $300 Xbox Series S <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/leaked-microsoft-documents-show-the-xbox-series-s-might-be-more-popular-than-you-think">seems to be vastly outselling</a> the $500 Series X, showing there is still quite a bit of sensitivity to console pricing in the market.</p>
<p>Taking all that into account, a $350 to $400 asking price for the Switch 2 doesn't seem out of the question. But Nintendo has surprised us with both <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2006/09/7743/">lower than expected</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/03/a-beautiful-screen-a-weak-battery-a-door-to-the-future-ars-reviews-the-nintendo-3ds/">higher than expected</a> hardware launch pricing in the past, so we wouldn't bet the farm on where this one ends up.</p>

<h2>Games?</h2>
<p>While it was neat to see a few brief seconds of what we assume is <em>Mario Kart 9</em> in the Switch 2 teaser trailer, it would be nice to hear more about what first-party games Nintendo has planned for that all-important launch window.</p>

<p>Nintendo could follow the example of the original Switch and launch with a new <em>Zelda</em> title again, but this seems a bit unlikely since we're still <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/hands-on-with-tears-of-the-kingdoms-zelda-meets-minecraft-construction-set/">less than two years out from <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>. A new full-fledged 3D Mario adventure—perhaps expanding on some of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/02/super-mario-3d-world-bowsers-fury-review-everything-old-is-new-again/">the open-world ideas from <em>Bowser's Fury</em></a>—seems like a better bet this time around, given how long it has been since 2017's best-selling <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> (which continued Nintendo's long tradition of launching a Mario game in a new console's first year).</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>And let's not forget about <em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>, which Nintendo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/seven-years-later-nintendo-proves-metroid-prime-4-still-exists/">officially teased last summer</a>, long after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/06/core-pokemon-rpg-metroid-prime-4-coming-to-nintendo-switch/">its original 2017 announcement</a>. The planned 2025 release seems perfectly aligned to be a big launch title for Nintendo's new system.</p>
<h2>Battery life?</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/how-big-is-the-switch-2-trailer-suggests-7-9-screen-10-5-width-w-joy-cons/">additional size</a> of the Switch 2 tablet could offer a bit more space to squeeze in some bulky rechargeable batteries. But those batteries will be powering a much larger display this time around, as well as some more powerful internal hardware.</p>
<p>We'd expect this trade to roughly come out as a wash and for the Switch 2 to match the 4.5 to 9 hours of battery life that Nintendo quotes for modern Switch consoles, depending on the game being played.</p>
<h2>Weight?</h2>
<p>At less than a pound, the Switch has always been less heavy to hold for extended periods than modern portable gaming PCs like the Steam Deck (1.4 lbs) or the Lenovo Legion Go (1.88 lbs). The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/how-big-is-the-switch-2-trailer-suggests-7-9-screen-10-5-width-w-joy-cons/">upsized</a> Switch 2 will likely add a little bit of weight over its predecessor, but we'd be surprised if it ends up significantly heavier on a relative basis.</p>

<p>Nintendo's long history of handheld consoles has always prioritized designs that are comfortable for the smaller hands and arms of younger players. We don't expect that to change significantly for the Switch 2.</p>
<h2>Hardware power?</h2>
<p>Back in 2023, leaks suggested that the Switch 2 would be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/what-do-we-know-about-the-switch-2s-hardware-power/">powered by an Nvidia T239-based chip</a>. That mobile-focused chip would be a significant step up from the Tegra X1 in the original Switch—which was considered slightly underpowered <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/12/nintendo-switch-nvidia-tegra-x1-specs-speed/">even when it launched in 2017</a>—but still only roughly equivalent to <a href="https://www.techpowerup.com/gpu-specs/geforce-rtx-2050-mobile.c3859">a 2021-era RTX 2050 Mobile chipset</a>&nbsp;as far as graphical performance is concerned. Still, that would be enough for some fancy graphical features like hardware-accelerated ray-tracing and DLSS upscaling on at least some games.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>In <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/what-do-we-know-about-the-switch-2s-hardware-power/">a speculative piece</a> based on those leaks, Digital Foundry said this kind of chipset could likely manage a "far from pristine" but "decent [upscaled] image on a 4K living room TV." That seems like a reasonable guess, and it could be a good excuse for publishers to re-release new versions of some late PS4/early PS5-era hits for Nintendo's next portable.</p>
<h2>Screen resolution/quality?</h2>
<p>The 720p screen on the original Switch was a revelation after decades of Nintendo handhelds with notably low-resolution screens. Since the launch of the 800p Steam Deck in 2022, though, most portable PC makers have opted for a full 1080p display or higher for their handheld offerings.</p>
<p>Increased resolution could be even more important on the Switch 2 if Nintendo wants to maintain a decent pixels-per-inch ratio on the new console's <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/how-big-is-the-switch-2-trailer-suggests-7-9-screen-10-5-width-w-joy-cons/">expanded screen size</a>. Previous Nintendo consoles like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/switch-oled-review-nintendos-nicest-most-nonessential-upgrade-yet/">Switch OLED</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/02/new-nintendo-3ds-xl-review-return-to-the-third-dimension/">3DS XL</a> show what happens when you expand the screen real estate but not the pixel resolution of an existing platform.</p>

<p>While a full 1080p screen would likely increase the Switch 2's materials cost a bit, it's a price Nintendo is likely ready to pay to show off the power of the Switch 2 in portable mode. Don't expect a pricey OLED screen at launch, though—if the Switch is any indication, Nintendo will save that for a mid-generation upgrade in a few years.</p>

<h2>Compatibility with old hardware?</h2>
<p>While Nintendo has stressed that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-will-play-original-switch-games/">your old Switch software will still work on the Switch 2</a>, it has so far been less clear on whether all your old Switch controllers and accessories will be compatible with the new console.</p>
<p>First- and third-party Switch controllers simply use the Bluetooth standard, which Nintendo seems overwhelmingly likely to keep using for the Switch 2. Given that, there's little reason that wireless Switch controllers shouldn't continue to work on the Switch 2. The same goes for wired USB controllers and wired accessories like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/10/your-old-gamecube-controllers-now-work-with-the-nintendo-switch/">the GameCube controller adapter</a>.</p>

<p>Using your old Switch Joy-Cons in portable mode is a different matter, as the Switch 2 seems to lack the physical plastic "rail" needed to slide those controllers into place. But since the Switch 2 comes packaged with new, larger Joy-Cons, there aren't many situations where you would need to physically connect your old controllers anyway.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 teaser trailer briefly showed a more rounded Switch 2 dock, suggesting that the new console might not be able to connect via docks designed for the original console. What's currently unclear is whether that dock upgrade is primarily cosmetic or houses some new internal circuitry necessary for upscaling Switch 2 games on the big screen.</p>
<h2>Improved performance for old games?</h2>
<p>If you own a Switch, you're probably used to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/11/dooms-switch-port-playable-but-a-distinct-visual-downgrade/">stuttering frame rates</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/10/the-switcher-is-real-witcher-3-on-switch-is-a-blurry-tolerable-compromise/">other performance issues</a> on the system's more taxing 3D titles. The additional hardware power of the Switch 2 could theoretically help these legacy games run more smoothly, much as it does for backward-compatible software on recent Sony and Microsoft systems.</p>
<p>Nintendo will likely follow its competitors' lead in this regard to some extent. The biggest question is how much work developers will need to put in to unlock the best performance for original Switch games on the Switch 2.</p>

<p>On the PlayStation 5 Pro, for instance, developers have <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/04/ps5-pro-50-enhanced-games-available-at-launch-november-7/">needed to patch in "Enhanced" versions</a> to take full advantage of the console's power. Titles without those specially designed patches simply get a less optimized "PS5 Pro Game Boost," which <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-game-boost-significant-improvements-final-fantasy-xvi-xiv/">can still offer some significant improvements</a>.</p>
<h2>Switch Online?</h2>
<p>Nintendo has confirmed your current Switch Online account will still work with the Switch 2. But the company hasn't confirmed which perks from that subscription will carry over to the new system.</p>

<p>The expansive <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/09/welcome-to-nes-flix-testing-nintendo-onlines-new-8-bit-library-on-switch/">Switch Online classic game library</a> is the biggest perk in question here. Since the Switch 2 is backward-compatible with old Switch software, it would be a bit odd to suddenly cut off the emulated game library that is a core of the Switch Online experience. But Nintendo has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/05/sorry-the-switch-isnt-getting-wii-style-virtual-console-downloads/">shut down access</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/rip-virtual-console-nintendo-will-shut-off-wii-u-3ds-game-downloads/">officially emulated games in the past</a>, so it's not out of the question.</p>
<p>It's also worth remembering that Switch Online subscriptions haven't increased in price <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/09/nintendos-first-ever-paid-online-service-launches-on-switch-sept-18/">since they started in late 2018</a>, despite years of higher-than-normal inflation. The launch of a new console could serve as a good excuse for Nintendo to foist a price increase onto consumers.</p>

                <p>Ask any collector of Game Boy Advances games what their holy grail is, and chances are high that Ninja Five-O is on that list. A cult-classic action game released by Konami way back in 2003, physical GBA copies are typically listed for a very high price on the reseller market, but fortunately, you can save quite a bit on its upcoming digital release for PC, PS5, PS4, and Switch on February 25. Over on Fanatical, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fgame%2Fninja-five-o&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fone-of-konamis-best-gba-games-releases-on-steam-next-month%2F1100-6528930%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you can score a 25% discount on a Ninja Five-O preorder</a>, as the game is available there for just $18.74.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4431557-ninja-five-o.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4431557" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4431557-ninja-five-o.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4431557"></a><figcaption>Ninja Five-O</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4431557-ninja-five-o.jpg"></figure><p>If you've never played it, Ninja Five-O puts you in the jika-tabi footwear of Joe Osugi, a detective who solves crime in the city of Zipangu with his analytical mind and ninja skills. Just like in the original GBA game, you'll take on the evil Mad Mask gang using your ninjutsu, and for anyone looking for a real challenge, you can put your ninja arts to the test with a Time Trial mode. Quality-of-life updates include quick-saves and the option to rewind the game at any time to help you get through some of the tougher stages.</p><p>Anyone looking to score a physical edition of Ninja Five-O can also check out Limited Run Games for a hard copy. Currently, these all appear to be sold out but it is worth bookmarking the site in case there's a resupply in the future. Standard and collector's editions were available, with the special edition featuring a particularly nice set of extras like a cool box, an original CD soundtrack, a strategy guide with behind-the-scenes content, and a holofoil sticker sheet.</p><h2>Ninja Five-O Physical Editions at Limited Run Games</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4431559-ninja-ce.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4431559" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4431559-ninja-ce.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4431559"></a><figcaption>Ninja Five-O collector's edition at Limited Run Games</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4431559-ninja-ce.jpg"></figure><ul><li><a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all/products/ninja-five-o-pc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC (Standard Edition)</a> -- $35</li><li><a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all/products/ps5-limited-run-109-ninja-five-o" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 (Standard Edition)</a> -- $35</li><li><a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all/products/ps5-limited-run-109-ninja-five-o-collectors-edition" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 (Collector's Edition)</a> -- $80</li><li><a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all/products/limited-run-564-ninja-five-o-ps4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS4 (Standard Edition)</a> -- $35</li><li><a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all/products/limited-run-564-ninja-five-o-collectors-edition-ps4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS4 (Collector's Edition)</a> -- $80</li><li><a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all/products/switch-limited-run-246-ninja-five-o" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch (Standard Edition)</a> -- $35</li><li><a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all/products/switch-limited-run-246-ninja-five-o-collectors-edition" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch (Collector's Edition)</a> -- $80</li></ul><p>In case you're looking to grab a few more games for your shelf, there are some interesting titles to check out currently.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-hedgehog-4-movie-march-2027<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paramount has already announced a release date for the fourth&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>movie, despite the fact that the third movie was only made available to stream yesterday (and that it's still available to watch in some theaters).</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/sonic-4-release-date-march-2027-1236280697/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Variety</a>,&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4&nbsp;</em>will be launching on March 19th, 2027. Obviously, that date is more than two years away, but hey, I suppose&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>movie fans need something to look forward to.</p>

<p><em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4&nbsp;</em>won't necessarily be the movie's final title, but if it follows the naming conventions of its two predecessors, then it probably won't bear any kind of secondary name. Don't expect&nbsp;<em>Sonic 4: The Rise of Robotnik&nbsp;</em>or anything anytime soon.</p>

<p>Of course, we still don't know what kind of story details we can expect from the movie, although the post-credits scenes included in the third installment are probably strong clues as to where it's headed.</p>

<p>The third movie's post-credits scenes (look away now if you don't want spoilers!) confirm that Shadow survived the events of the film, and they also tease the appearance of both Metal Sonic and Amy Rose in the next movie.</p>

<p>As such, we can probably expect&nbsp;<em>Sonic 4&nbsp;</em>to focus on both characters, and Keanu Reeves' Shadow the Hedgehog will probably be returning as well. Naturally, all of this is speculation until the movie is officially revealed.</p>




<p>The existence of a fourth&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>movie makes a lot of sense given how well the previous three have done in financial terms.</p>

<p>According to Paramount, between them, the three&nbsp;<em>Sonic&nbsp;</em>films have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sonic-the-hedgehog-movies-1b-box-office" rel="nofollow">crossed $1 billion at the box office</a>, and since that report was released earlier this month, that number's likely to be higher by now as well.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog 4&nbsp;</em>releases on March 19th, 2027. Don't expect to hear anything more about the movie for a while given how far off that date is.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/supermaster-v-marvel-rivals-ranked-bug-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Supermaster V ranked bug is a literal marvel in Marvel Rivals. You’d think it has positive connotations and signifies progress in Rivals, but it’s a strange occurrence with drastic outcomes for ranked matches. </p>



<p>Marvel Rivals ranked mode is where the elite go to fight. It’s where the dedicated want to prove themselves and ascend to higher levels of greatness, before eventually applying to join the Avengers. With Shroud looking at starting a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shroud-marvel-rivals-esports-organisation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rivals Esports organization</a> and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-director-reveals-plans-for-esports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s director already discussing Esports plans</a>, ranked is the first step on the road to major competitive play. </p>



<p>However, Marvel Rivals ranked play is being impacted by a Supermaster V bug. Let’s take a look at everything we know about it and what it does.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-causes-supermaster-v-bug-in-marvel-rivals">What Causes Supermaster V Bug in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Has this happened to you? Credit to X user and streamer @whyAndr3w</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Supermaster V is a post-game bug happening <strong>when a ranked match is considered invalid—due to insufficient players, AFK action, or forfeiting.</strong></strong></p>



<p>These issues can be attributed to connection issues, users being idle, or rage-quitting. In short, if your ranked match goes off without a hitch, it’s sure to be a valid encounter where everything is presented and shown as normal. If any of the above happens, Supermaster V may land to spoil your day.</p>



<p>It only appears at the end of a Marvel Rivals ranked match, and I can confirm it’s not one of the official tiers in the Rivals ranked system.</p>



<p>NetEase has yet to formally address the Supermaster V error. We’re trying to piece together what we can from various players’ experiences. You can see X user <a href="https://x.com/whyAndr3w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@whyAndr3w</a>‘s game above where they encountered the bug and <a href="https://x.com/whyAndr3w/status/1878800368580391230" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted about it</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-supermaster-v-bug-change-your-online-rank-in-marvel-rivals">Does Supermaster V Bug Change Your Online Rank in Marvel Rivals?</h2>



<p><strong>Your online rank being affected by Supermaster V is inconclusive, but based on what we’ve seen, it doesn’t appear you are penalized too heavily if it happens.</strong></p>



<p>Anyone in an invalid lobby who is hit by the Supermaster V bug is susceptible to an <strong>AFK ban</strong>. It’s not confirmed to be a guarantee, but I’ve seen several examples of players complaining about this.</p>



<p><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2767030/discussions/0/578249962076305125/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam user EXtremist said</a>, “The game shows me a Supermaster [V] message, after winning, and then I get a <strong>15-minute penalty for being disconnected</strong>, which never happened. This is [the] 3rd time.” Another <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2767030/discussions/0/591758265559292113/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam player shared their story</a>, “I was in a ranked game and everyone had poor connection midway through. I hit 1000 ping at one point, [and] at the end I got the ranked progress, it says 20/30, and the rank was Supermaster V.”</p>



<p>Not every case seems to be the same though. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1hnqkmi/saying_my_rank_is_supermaster_v_after_competitive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">JDlyndon on the Marvel Rivals subreddit</a> shared a picture of the Supermaster V screen. They said they “Played and won a game of competitive and instead of getting a normal ranked points gain screen I got this.” They add “<strong>There was no AFK in the match” and it went down like a normal ranked match</strong>.</p>



<p>Again, the findings aren’t absolute right now. Keep checking back as we find out the latest on Supermaster V, and if NetEase comments.</p>



<hr>



<p>Have you had Supermaster V happen to you after playing a Marvel Rivals ranked match? Did you get an AFK ban? Have you lost any ranking points as a result?</p>

A cold, almost heartless beauty, she always says what’s on her mind, even if it means offending others. She’s just as merciless on the battlefield, where she gets a twisted sense of pleasure from tearing invaders apart.</li><li><strong>Tsubasa Kawana</strong> (voiced by Ayane Sakura) – A girl who knows a lot about machines and what makes them tick. She had a bright, lively personality, but isn’t good with stressful situations. When she gets nervous, she gets nauseous, and then…</li><li><strong>Gaku Maruko</strong> (voiced by Kensho Ono) – A guy who’s true to his personal desires (to put it delicately). He’s a coward and always looking out for himself. However, there’s something so refreshingly honest about his pettiness that it’s hard to hate him. Gaku’s also good at taking care of other people once he opens his heart to them.</li><li><strong>Kyoshika Magadori</strong> (voiced by Marina Inoue) – A young samurai who’s utterly clueless about the modern world. Has never even heard of multiplication tables, let alone learned them. She has a disturbingly close relationship with her katana, the Holy Jumonji Sword.</li><li><strong>Yugamu Omokage</strong> (voiced by Daisuke Namikawa) – A boy who’s been in the business of killing since long before the war started. Unlike the rest of his family (who are also assassins, by the way), Yugamu believes that killing should be done with love. He enjoys torture and other immoral forms of pleasure.</li><li><strong>SIREI</strong> (voiced by Otsuka Hochu) – The principal and commanding officer of Last Defense Academy. To put it another way, a weird little robot that orders the members of the Special Defense Unit around. Under his command, Takumi and the others will be working to wipe out the mysterious School Invaders.</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > Switch [16,539 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a> and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,170 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3014080/The_Hundred_Line_Last_Defense_Academy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> on April 24 worldwide.</p><!-- AD: content -->

Boon then tweeted a short clip showing one of the T-1000’s Fatalities, which Terminator 2 fans are sure to get a kick out of.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We see the T-1000 drive a smashed up truck straight into his hapless opponent, rekindling memories of the iconic chase scene in Terminator 2 where the T-1000 drives the same truck in pursuit of Arnold Schwarzenegger’s Terminator and Edward Furlong’s John Connor.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">(5 of 7) With Conan getting into player’s hands, we are excited to keep trucking forward with future DLC ! <a href="https://t.co/eC3Aqj5KDc" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/eC3Aqj5KDc</a></p>— Ed Boon (@noobde) <a href="https://twitter.com/noobde/status/1881825221369528644?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 21, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">But it’s Boon’s comment accompanying the clip that set tongues wagging within the Mortal Kombat community: “With Conan getting into player’s hands, we are excited to keep trucking forward with future DLC!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the line “keep trucking forward with future DLC” may relate to the upcoming release of the T-1000, some are hoping it’s a tease that more DLC characters are set to hit the game once the current set is rounded out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">T-1000 Terminator is the final DLC character set to be added to the gory fighting game as part of the Khaos Reigns expansion, and follows playable fighters Cyrax, Sektor, Noob Saibot, Ghostface, and Conan the Barbarian. Fans have wondered for some time now whether developer NetherRealm plans a third set of DLC characters, or a Kombat Pack 3, amid questions about Mortal Kombat 1’s sales success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Parent company Warner Bros. Discovery has indicated, however, that it still believes in the Mortal Kombat franchise. In November, CEO David Zaslav said that on the games side of things, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warner-bros-ceo-namechecks-batman-as-part-of-its-new-video-game-focus-so-is-another-arkham-game-in-the-works-at-rocksteady"><u>the company plans to double down on just four titles, one of which is Mortal Kombat</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-ed-boon-says-netherrealm-knew-what-its-next-game-would-be-3-years-ago"><u>Boon said NetherRealm had decided on its next game three years prior, but promised to support Mortal Kombat 1 “for a long time to come.”</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most fans of the studio’s work expect it to release a third game in its DC fighting game franchise, Injustice, although neither NetherRealm nor Warner Bros. has yet to confirm that. The first game in the series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/injustice-gods-among-us"><u>Injustice: Gods Among Us</u></a>, launched in 2013, with its sequel, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/injustice-2"><u>Injustice 2</u></a>, coming out in 2017. NetherRealm released <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-11"><u>Mortal Kombat 11</u></a> in 2019 and for a time it seemed like the studio would alternate between Mortal Kombat and Injustice games, but it went on to release another Mortal Kombat, the soft reboot that is Mortal Kombat 1, in 2023 instead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1s-ed-boon-says-door-not-closed-on-injustice-3"><u>an interview with IGN</u></a> in June 2023, Boon spoke in vague terms about this decision. "There were a number of factors, some of which I can talk about, some of which I probably shouldn't," Boon said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two reasons Boon was willing to discuss were the unfortunate onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the team's choice to switch to a newer version of the Unreal game engine (Mortal Kombat 11 runs on Unreal Engine 3, whereas Mortal Kombat 1 runs on Unreal Engine 4).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But we did go to a new graphics engine, Unreal," Boon said. "We really wanted to be careful with COVID and all that stuff and everybody staying safe. So there were a bunch of variables involved that eventually we realized, 'Okay, let's do another Mortal Kombat game and hopefully we'll get back to the Injustice games.' "</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just to be sure, we wanted to confirm with him directly that the door was not closed on the Injustice franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Not at all," Boon answered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>
External hard drives over 16TB in size will soon be supported by Xbox consoles, Microsoft has announced. 
</p>
<p>
The addition of support for bigger external USB storage has been confirmed for Xbox Insiders, as part of a system software update rolling out now to public testers in the Alpha Skip-Ahead ring. As ever, this new feature will slowly filter out to larger testing groups before its widespread public release, typically over the next couple of weeks. 
</p>
<p>
"We are enabling support for external USB drives larger than 16TB, so you can be sure your favorite games are always ready to play!" Microsoft wrote in a <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/help/hardware-network/xbox-insider-release-notes/console/alpha-skip-ahead/2025/01/alpha-skip-ahead-2502-250120-2200">blog post</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"Newly formatted drives that are larger than 16TB will be formatted with multiple partitions to utilise all available space for games and apps. These will appear as multiple devices in the storage devices list."

</figure>
<p>
Intriguingly, Microsoft does not list a new upper limit for storage devices - suggesting that with the partition methodology in place, there is no upper limit anymore. How big a hard drive can you connect?!
</p>
<p>
"Drives greater than 16TB that have already been formatted will be unaffected by this change and would need to be reformatted to take advantage of the updated support for larger drives," Microsoft concluded.

The next <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> project is still growing in size and isn't ready for the bulk of BioWare staff to jump aboard, former studio veteran Mark Darrah has said.
</p>
<p>
Darrah worked at BioWare for 23 years as a project director and executive producer on the Dragon Age series, and has tracked the studio's changing project schedule in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GR5p4maGiRE">newly-public video</a> peering behind the scenes.
</p>
<p>
Some BioWare staff who worked on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> are now filtering over to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a>, but others are being kept busy contributing to projects elsewhere within the wider EA organisation, Darrah said.

<p>
First announced in 2020, Mass Effect 5 (or whatever it ends up being called) has been worked on by a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-developer-bioware-highlights-crack-team-of-trilogy-veterans">small team of original Mass Effect trilogy veterans</a> within BioWare while the majority of the company has worked to get Dragon Age: The Veilguard out the door. 
</p><p>
But now The Veilguard has shipped, that doesn't mean Mass Effect 5 will suddenly have the full operational strength of BioWare behind it, Darrah continued, even though the studio had entered an era where it only dedicated the majority of its resources to one project at a time. 
</p>
<p>
"Mass Effect isn't ready to suddenly have a team of 250, 300 people working on it," Darrah noted. "In the past when BioWare was toying with being on just one project, like on Anthem or The Veilguard, that project was up and running at full speed so it was able to suck in every available resource, it had enough existing infrastructure that it was able to absorb everything. 
</p>
<p>
"That's not exactly what's happening [with Mass Effect 5]. You see this when you go on to people's social media profiles. People who worked on The Veilguard, some of them are going onto Mass Effect, but some of them are moving into other parts of the EA organisation because Mass Effect isn't ready for them."
</p>
<p>
BioWare previously worked on multiple projects in parallel, such as various entries in the Mass Effect and Dragon Age series, plus development on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-the-old-republic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a> and - going back further - teams dedicated to handheld development, a cancelled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jade-empire">Jade Empire</a> sequel, and the Montreal satellite studio which led development on Mass Effect Andromeda, and was subsequently folded into EA's Motive studio.
</p><p>
Having many teams meant moving people between projects might have been easier, Darrah said, but this came with its own issues. For example, having multiple projects also limited that movement, if several games were due to ship in close proximity.
</p>
<p>
"This might be great," Darrah concluded of BioWare's current single-project focus, "because what it means is BioWare, for really the first time ever, is able to singularly focus on a single project, is able to put all attention on a single project, is able to put everything it has towards a single goal: which is making the best Mass Effect it possibly can."
</p>
<p>
Mass Effect 5 still lacks a release date, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-damps-down-expectations-for-mass-effect-5-news-this-week-ahead-of-franchises-n7-day">last year's N7 Day was a quiet affair as BioWare still heads down on the launch of The Veilguard</a>. Here's hoping things ramp up considerably in 2025.
</p>
<p>
BioWare's Mass Effect head honcho Michael Gamble recently let fans know the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-wont-dabble-with-stylised-visuals-like-dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-says">won't be changing art styles akin to Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> and dropped a hint that left fans speculating that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-fans-think-this-official-image-hints-that-paragonrenegade-system-is-absolutely-returning">the series' Paragon/Renegade system would be returning</a>. 
</p><p>In addition to the next Mass Effect game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-is-officially-getting-a-tv-adaptation-at-amazon">Amazon is working on a TV series set within the Mass Effect universe</a>. Commander Shepard voice actor Jennifer Hale told Eurogamer earlier this month that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effects-original-cast-should-return-for-the-tv-series-shepard-voice-actor-jennifer-hale-says">she'd love to see the trilogy's original cast make an appearance</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Mobile gaming has for a long time been the most accessible route into video games, and while that used to mean Candy Crush or Angry Birds, the last 12 months have seen the arrival of big hitters like the explosive anime action of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/09/zenless-zone-zero-review/">Zenless Zone Zero</a> and the glamorous <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/05/infinity-nikki-review/">Infinity Nikki</a>. Netmarble are hoping to continue that trend with the stunning Game of Thrones Kingsroad, the latest entry in George R. R. Martin’s saga.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Game of Thrones: Kingsroad] Gameplay Sneak Peek" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I7HUNq-H0mQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Set to release for PC, Android and iOS, we were able to go hands-on with the latest beta to see just how faithful Kingsroad is to the previous Westeros adventures. Set amongst the melee following Robert Baratheon’s death, you are the bastard child of House Tyre, called north to find out why the Castle Black, home to the Night’s Watch, has gone silent.</p>


<p>You choose initially from three different classes: the Sellsword, a heavy fighter class with a massive axe, the Knight, a classic balance of offence and defence, and the lithe Assassin, a swift and deadly option.</p>
<p>Before you can say “Hero Journey”, you’re swept north of the Wall to seek out Jon Snow and a batch of missing Rangers. It does not go well, and you’re soon fighting off wave after wave of vicious White Walkers. Netmarble have done a fantastic job of capturing the skeletal foe’s terrifying presence, and if you were a fan of the original show, or indeed the actual novels, I think you’ll be all-in from the opening of Kingsroad.</p>


<p>The action-heavy gameplay relies on heavy-hitting melee combat, and your character is equipped from the start with a standard and heavy attack, as well as a bow for more delicate ranged work. They’re joined by a steady flow of skills and abilities, which are perfect for giving you the upper hand when facing the enormous swing of an undead Giant.</p>
<p>This definitely isn’t a Soulslike, but blocking and dodging play an important role in staying alive. It’s approachable and weighty, and, playing with a controller on PC at least, it feels responsive and like a fully-fledged action title rather than a stereotypical mobile game. Times have absolutely changed, and from the opening at least, Kingsroad is exceeding expectations.</p>

<p>The mobile-centric free-to-play side of things does rear its head when you make your way to the upgrade tree, and the first of your upgrades is worth a 1% improvement in your skills. While it isn’t surprising to find that artificially slow progression here, what is surprising is that Kingsroad feels so much like a ‘proper’ action title, that it feels incongruos.</p>
<p>Playing on PC I was immediately impressed by just how good Game of Thrones: Kingsroad looks, from the high-quality main visuals to the painterly effects laid over the animated cutscenes. Jon Snow looks like Jon Snow – though he doesn’t sound quite right, shorn of Kit Harrington’s performance – and your player character boasts plenty of detail, really bringing the brusque, frosty action to life. The voice acting overall is actually a highlight, with a few moments of wondering whether it’s the original actors or not making way for the enjoyably northern accents that you encounter here in the snow.</p>

<p>Today is the final day for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/12/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-last-day-to-sign-up-for-the-closed-beta/">Game of Thrones: Kingsroad’s open beta</a>, so, if you were lucky enough to nab a spot, there’s still time to jump in and experience Netmarble’s fresh take on George R.R. Martin’s world. Hopefully, we won’t have too long to wait before the game’s full launch, and we can see how just how long and bloody that Kingsroad is.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-improved-pointlights/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new version of the Bloodborne Remaster Project is now available for download, introducing new visual improvements to the emulated game on PC.</p>
<p>The new version of the impressive fan-made remaster developed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@fromsoftserve" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fromsoftserve</a>, version 0.84, introduces more pointlights to Central Yharnam, Cathedral Ward, Old Yharnam and Cainhurst, while improving the quality of all pointlights in all maps, changing some reflectance maps and more. The changes introduced in the new version of the project, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/45?tab=files">Nexus Mods</a>, are showcased in great detail by the project's developer in the video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Bloodborne PC Remaster 0.84 is out now!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O81LRW6ZHNU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It's great to see how far the Bloodborne Remaster Project is going, considering a few months ago none of the PlayStation 4 emulators available could emulate the game. The rapid progress made by the ShadPS4 emulator, however, finally made it possible to enjoy one of the best games developed by FromSoftware ever made, alongside a few other <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-remaster-project-end-2024-montage-shadps4-0-5-1/">PlayStation 4 exclusives</a> such as Fist of the North Star: Lost Paradise.</p>
<p>While fans are developing the Bloodborne remaster Sony doesn't seem interested in releasing, the Japanese company is unlikely to return to the franchise without FromSoftware's involvement. Former PlayStation veteran Shuhei Yoshida recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/yoshida-says-hed-have-resisted-sonys-live-service-push-thinks-bloodborne-2-isnt-coming-until-miyazaki-is-free/">commented</a> on the matter, saying that Hidetaka Miyazaki is definitely interested in returning to the series, having really loved the original game, but he's now so busy that he cannot develop a remaster or a sequel himself, and won't allow anyone else to do so. PlayStation's inaction on the matter, Yoshida theorizes, is because they are respecting his wish.</p>

            <p>If you want to toss a coin to your orchestra, you will soon be able to do just that, as CD Projekt Red has announced ticket sales for The Witcher in Concert will go on sale imminently.</p>
<p>The Witcher in Concert is a celebration of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a>'s 10th anniversary, because it really has been that long (and yet, I haven't aged a day). It will "bring to life the open-world RPG's timeless score with a live orchestra performance". As with other video game-based concerts, gameplay will accompany the music as it swells from the orchestra.</p>
<p>The concert tour itself will kick off during this year's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a> event in Cologne, before traveling across Europe. That includes here in the UK, with the concert coming to London on 5th November, before it heads to Manchester on 7th November.</p>

<p>"I can't believe it's been 10 years since we first introduced The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt to the world! Music is such an important part of our games, and to see the community respond with such enthusiasm for what we created has been truly incredible," said soundtrack co-composer Marcin Przybyłowicz.</p>
<p>"From everyone's favorite 'le le les' to the tracks we used to underscore the most heartfelt moments, every single composition was a joy to create, and I'm looking forward to sharing it with people around the world."</p>
<p>Those interested are able browse the current list of venues and purchase tickets through The Witcher in Concert <a href="http://thewitcher.com/concert">official website</a>. Ticket sales go live on 24th January, so this Friday, however a pre-sale will begin 48 hours prior to this date for those who sign up to the concert's newsletter. So, I guess that means now. Get tossing those coins! (only if you want to, of course).</p>

            <p>S-Game has released a new trailer for forthcoming action game Phantom Blade Zero, but it remains without a firm release date.</p>
<p>The new trailer celebrates 2025's Year of the Snake with a fresh gameplay of a boss battle and a look at new snake-themed weapons: the sword-whip Soft Snake Sword, and twin swords White Serpent and Crimson Viper.</p>
<p>The trailer also states a release date will be announced this year, as the developer is continuing to tweak and finalise the game.</p>

<p>In an email to Eurogamer alongside the trailer, S-Game stated the playable demos from last year proved Phantom Blade Zero is already a "polished title", but it's using Unreal Engine 5 to "push the boundaries even further" after a "significant" boost to the budget.</p>
