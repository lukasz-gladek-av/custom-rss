The Ice King will begin attacking it from underneath, taking out chunks of the landing. Occasionally he will also swipe above the platform; this attack is indicated by a line of reddish paw prints. Keep moving around to dodge these attacks and once the platform gets small enough, Mio and Zoe will fall to the ground below and the real fight will start. </p><h2 id="h10916"><a id=""></a> The first phase </h2><figure id="" data-id="b0aade99497c3a6058ba5c8675f79a56" data-recommend-id="image://b0aade99497c3a6058ba5c8675f79a56" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A split view shows the protagonists of Split-Fiction abttling the Ice King." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A split view shows the protagonists of Split-Fiction abttling the Ice King." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hazelight Studios / Simon Estey / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b0aade99497c3a6058ba5c8675f79a56" data-recommend-id="image://b0aade99497c3a6058ba5c8675f79a56" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A split view shows the protagonists of Split-Fiction abttling the Ice King." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Raised slightly above the battlefield, the Ice King will create columns of ice. Run between them to avoid getting hit. After he sends out several of these, he will start to slam on the ground, raising chunks of ice that need to be jumped over. He will then raise on his hind legs for a second, giving whoever is controlling Zoe enough time to turn into her tree spirit and pull him to the ground. Once this is done, Mio should run over to his face and begin pummeling it. Note that sometimes, after sending out the shockwaves of ice, the Ice King will pause for a moment before resuming his attack. This is a trick to get Zoe to turn into the tree spirit which is unable to jump. Don’t fall for it. Make sure he is fully upright before trying to pull him down.</p><p>After dealing enough damage to him, the Ice King will cause icicles to litter the arena, culminating in a gigantic one in the center. Stand in the small spaces between or where the icicles have already fallen to avoid getting hit. He will then resume the pillars of ice, but this time, icicles will be falling as well. Continue moving to avoid taking damage. Eventually he will repeat the shockwave attack letting you use the tree spirit and gorilla to deal more damage.</p><h2 id="h10917"><a id=""></a> A cool intermission </h2><figure id="" data-id="07f6121aeaf6d98113074dad081c1502" data-recommend-id="image://07f6121aeaf6d98113074dad081c1502" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonists of Split-Fiction slide down an iced spiral." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonists of Split-Fiction slide down an iced spiral." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hazelight Studios / Simon Estey / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="07f6121aeaf6d98113074dad081c1502" data-recommend-id="image://07f6121aeaf6d98113074dad081c1502" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonists of Split-Fiction slide down an iced spiral." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After hitting him twice, the Ice King will once again break the arena you are fighting on. Mio and Zoe will slide down a spiral path with hazards in the way. Jump over the ice shards, but make sure to not leap when he is about to send attacks horizontally. Once you reach the bottom, run down the path and jump into the center area. The second and final phase of the fight begins. </p><h2 id="h10918"><a id=""></a> The second phase </h2><figure id="" data-id="688b5aace45562777bb8b326e7c451db" data-recommend-id="image://688b5aace45562777bb8b326e7c451db" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonists of Split-Fiction battle the Ice King while a vortex takes up the middle of the map." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonists of Split-Fiction battle the Ice King while a vortex takes up the middle of the map." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hazelight Studios / Simon Estey / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="688b5aace45562777bb8b326e7c451db" data-recommend-id="image://688b5aace45562777bb8b326e7c451db" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonists of Split-Fiction battle the Ice King while a vortex takes up the middle of the map." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This battlefield has a small pool in the center. The Ice King will start the fight by creating a vortex in the pool which sends out small tornadoes. Run around the perimeter of the pool by dodging the tornadoes. The vortex will then disappear allowing Mio to turn into her axolotl form and jump in. There is a giant ball in the center that she can throw above the surface. Zoe must then use the tree spirit to catch it in midair and throw it at the Ice King to stun him. Have Mio race back to land and turn into her gorilla to throw a few more punches his way.</p><p>Unfortunately, the Ice King will freeze the pool and repeat the vortex attack. Dodge as you did previously and he will use a new attack once the tornadoes clear which has him sending out bombs that follow you around. The trick is to dodge these attacks on top of the frozen pool to cause damage to the ice. Do this enough times, and the ice will break, allowing access to the plant ball again. Repeat the process to damage him once more and the Ice King will go down for good.</p><figure id="" data-id="6a3a08ecb9628d2648ffce1501523598" data-recommend-id="image://6a3a08ecb9628d2648ffce1501523598" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The smaller form of the Ice King looks like a cute kitten." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The smaller form of the Ice King looks like a cute kitten." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hazelight Studios / Simon Estey / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6a3a08ecb9628d2648ffce1501523598" data-recommend-id="image://6a3a08ecb9628d2648ffce1501523598" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The smaller form of the Ice King looks like a cute kitten." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Ice King can be a little tricky given his high number of AoE (Area of Effect) attacks; but a good way to avoid this is by keeping some distance from you and your partner so you aren’t both taken out by the same attack. Other than that, follow this guide, and you will take out the first of Zoe’s bosses in no time.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Over 300 quality assurance testers working on Bethesda franchises like <em>Fallout </em>and <em>The Elder Scrolls </em>have voted to authorize a strike following what they say are stalling negotiations with parent company Microsoft. “We’ve had to continuously fight for what should be bare minimum,” said Aubrey Litchfield, a tester on <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196406" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196406,194328,196698" data-current="196406"><div><p>Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21954.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The QA department at ZeniMax, which operates Bethesda and was purchased by Microsoft for $7.5 billion back in 2021, voted 94 percent in favor of authorizing a strike, according to a press release by the Communications Workers of America on Tuesday. While that doesn’t mean a strike is currently in effect, it does mean the 300 members who are part of ZeniMax Workers United-CWA could initiate a strike if progress isn’t made at the bargaining table on their first contract.</p><p> “Underpayment and costly RTO initiatives have caused many of us to put our lives on pause because our income does not match even the rising cost of living in the cities where ZeniMax insists we live and work to maintain employment,” said senior QA tester Zachary Armstrong in a press release. “None of us wishes it had come to this, but if Microsoft and ZeniMax continue to demonstrate at the bargaining table that they’re unwilling to pay us fair wages for the value our labor provides to our games, we’ll be showing them just how valuable our labor is.” </p><p> ZeniMax Workers United-CWA formed back in 2023 after the CWA cut a deal with Microsoft to support its bid to acquire Activision Blizzard in exchange for the tech giant remaining “neutral” on unionization within the company. Instead of fighting the process, Microsoft would voluntarily recognize any union with majority support among its members. Things sound less congenial at the bargaining table. The Bethesda union held a one-day work stoppage last fall and filed an unfair labor practice charge against Microsoft for outsourcing work. The Xbox maker disputes that it’s being unreasonable. </p><p> “Our quality assurance team is an integral part of our business and is key to our ability to deliver games our players will love,” a spokesperson for the company told <em>Kotaku </em>in an email. “We respect the team’s right to express their viewpoints and are deeply committed to reaching a fair and equitable resolution that acknowledges the teams’ contributions. There has been substantial progress over the course of the negotiations, reaching tentative agreements on a majority of the topics at the table. We have presented a package proposal that we believe is fair—if accepted it would result in immediate compensation increases, even more robust benefits and is in alignment to the company’s hybrid model of 3 days in office. We look forward to continuing this progress during negotiations.” </p><p>Quality assurance testers have long been one of the most exploited groups of developers in the game industry, forced to work long hours for low pay as studios crunch to ship massive games with as few delays as possible. But the work is also one of the most valued by players. There’s nothing worse than running into a game-breaking bug or watching your character randomly die while falling through the floor after an hour-long boss fight. Bethesda championed 2022's <em>Starfield </em>as one of its most bug-free releases in years, and it was. </p><p>Microsoft is currently bringing<em> Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> to PlayStation 5 this month, followed by the release of <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> in May. Bethesda’s next big release is expected to be <em>The Elder Scrolls VI</em>, though the open-world RPG is likely still years away from coming out. A strike could potentially slow things down even further if a deal isn’t hashed out at the bargaining table.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/schedule-i-continues-to-soar-as-fifth-patch-is-released.1151367/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-i-continues-soar-patch-notes-fifth/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The most sensational indie game of 2025 is one that nobody saw coming. It’s called Schedule I, and as the blurb goes, it sees players go ‘from small-time dope pusher to kingpin’ by making and selling all kinds of drugs. It’s bizarre, and it was pieced together almost entirely by a single developer over three years, and it’s turning heads worldwide.</p>



<p>Schedule I’s fifth patch is here, and it adds a few key improvements and addresses some outstanding bugs. Despite it being a little bit of a work in progress in some ways, Schedule I is one of the most popular games in the world right now.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-high-on-the-charts">High on the Charts</h2>



<p>Schedule I isn’t a game to be taken seriously, but many players are. It has picked up a rating of Overwhelmingly Positive on Steam from 38,778 reviews – and it was only released a week ago. It’s one of the boldest success stories we’ve seen from an indie game in a very long time.</p>



<p>It sits in the number one spot on Steam for sales, and it’s the fourth most-played game on the platform as I write this. There are 275,500 people playing it, and the game’s peak count has exceeded many AAA titles on the platform.</p>



<p>Here are the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/546730838559032913" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">latest patch notes</a> for Schedule I:</p>



<p><strong>Tweaks/Improvements</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Added an active display setting to choose which monitor the game displays on.</li>



<li>Botanists will now automatically move product from their supplies to drying racks.</li>



<li>Owned vehicles are now visible on the map app.</li>



<li>Implemented a few validity checks/failsafes for NPC pathfinding and warping. I think this was one of the primary causes of crashing on certain chipsets (thanks to Chi Chi on Discord for bringing this to my attention).</li>



<li>Refactored employee item movement behaviour to be a bit smarter.</li>



<li>Implemented NPC effects culling at a certain distance to improve performance.</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Bug fixes</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed non-host clients sometimes not being able to hit/stand in blackjack.</li>



<li>Fixed a quest UI bug that was sometimes causing infinite loading screens in multiplayer.</li>



<li>Fixed clipboard selections not reassigning without first manually clearing the existing selection (employee beds, botanist supplies, etc).</li>



<li>Fixed the dealer sometimes preemptively revealing its hand to non-host players in blackjack.</li>



<li>Fixed the first-person jacket looking janky.</li>



<li>Fixed the ‘Master Chef’ achievement being rewarded prematurely.</li>



<li>Fixed some property null references that were causing multiplayer loading/desync issues.</li>



<li>The drying rack ‘dry’ button is now non-interactable if the input slot is reserved by an employee.</li>



<li>Fixed NPC ‘stay in building’ behaviour sometimes causing errors for non-host players.</li>



<li>Fixed NPC voiceover emitters sometimes throwing a null reference.</li>
</ul>



<p>The game’s creator and (almost) solo dev, Tyler, also revealed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve started work on the first content update and am planning to release it this weekend. I’ll be posting some sneak peeks soon – stay tuned!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Schedule I is available exclusively on PC at the moment, and if you want to try before you buy, the game has a decent demo on Steam.</p>

For players willing to take on the highest difficulty, special loot is up for grabs.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Destiny_2_Rite_of_the_Nine_Loot">Destiny 2 Rite of the Nine Loot</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4469000-rotn-grenadelauncher.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469000" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4469000-rotn-grenadelauncher.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469000"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4469000-rotn-grenadelauncher.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Rite of the Nine will feature 12 revised weapons from past encounters with an all-new selection of perks. Adept versions will be available earned if dungeons are completed on the highest difficulty.</p><p dir="ltr">A new Origin trait called <strong>Gravity Well</strong> will be exclusive to these weapons. Along with the initial Origin perk in the fifth column, Gravity Well will also be able to be chosen as an option. Gravity Well's effects are listed as "Reloading this weapon automatically gathers nearby ammo." It's not known exactly how far away this takes effect, but the perk seems to gather any nearby ammo bricks on the ground, Heavy or Special, and pull them to your character on a reload.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can also visit the Emissary of the Nine in the Third Spire space to attune their loot drops from dungeon completions. Similar to how the Brave Arsenal worked in Into the Light, only one attunement can be active per run, and this will increase the likelihood of obtaining that weapon as a reward.</p><p dir="ltr">Players who finish a dungeon on the highest difficulty,<strong> Ultimatum</strong>, will be able to earn an Adept weapon. These weapons have a unique shader effect on them making them glow and shimmer. Adept versions of weapons will also have boosted stats over the normal versions, so they will have an upper hand over normal drops.</p><p dir="ltr">Here are the 12 weapons coming with Rite of the Nine:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Prosecutor</strong> Auto Rifle</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Relentless</strong> Pulse Rifle</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Judgment</strong> Hand Cannon</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>A Sudden Death</strong> Shotgun</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Wilderflight</strong> Grenade Launcher</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Long Arm</strong> Scout Rifle</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Liminal Vigil</strong> Sidearm</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Terminus Horizon</strong> Machine Gun</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>New Pacific Epitaph</strong> Breach-loaded Grenade Launcher</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>No Survivors</strong> Submachine Gun</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Greasy Luck</strong> Glaive</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Cold Comfort</strong> Rocket Launcher</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Other rewards from Rite of the Nine also include <strong>five new Emblems</strong>, <strong>a new Title/Seal</strong>, and <strong>weapon ornaments.</strong></p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Destiny_2_Rite_of_the_Nine_Difficulty_Modes">Destiny 2 Rite of the Nine Difficulty Modes</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4469001-rotn-tooltips.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469001" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4469001-rotn-tooltips.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469001"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507039/4469001-rotn-tooltips.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Rite of the Nine's rotating dungeons are broken up into three difficulty tiers, allowing players of any skill level to earn something and experience a challenge. Each mode changes aspects of the dungeon, such as displaying helpful tips to the rather difficult "Notswap" modifier. Here's how each one is broken down.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Explorer_Mode">Explorer Mode</h3><p dir="ltr">This mode is essentially "Beginner Mode" with an incredibly forgiving difficulty level and much less harsh punishments for wipes and party deaths. While we don't know the maximum Power level for these dungeons yet, we can assume it will be a low bar to clear. The rules for Explorer Mode are:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>No Darkness Zones.</strong> Normally when players come across a Darkness Zone, if the full time dies with no revives available, the encounter resets back to the start of the last checkpoint. In Explorer Mode, Darkness Zones are completely disabled.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Revive timer is only five seconds.</strong> Revive Timers in dungeons typically range from 20 seconds to 45 seconds. In Explorer Mode, they are much more forgiving so players can be revived more quickly.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Tooltips explain mechanics.</strong> Before beginning the encounter, tooltips will be visible that explain how each encounter basically functions. New players will be able to immediately pick up on these tips and execute their mechanics.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Waypoints guide players</strong> during more open sections of dungeons. These will constantly be visible to guide players to the next objective.</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Helper platforms</strong> appear when a player reaches a checkpoint, helping those who struggle with jumping puzzles.</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Eternity_Mode">Eternity Mode</h3><p dir="ltr">Bungie has not shared the full details on how this mode will work, but it is likely more geared towards casual players seeking a challenge. It's possible most of the standard rules for dungeons will be present here such as Darkness Zones, longer revive timers, and possibly even more strict timers on certain encounters.</p><p dir="ltr">There will also be a scoring mechanic live in Eternity Mode that will gauge players' performance based on time spent on an encounter, enemies killed, and revives remaining after an encounter is completed.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Ultimatum_Mode">Ultimatum Mode</h3><p dir="ltr">This is the highest difficulty level for Rite of the Nine. Basically this is only where the best of the best can thrive. It's likely this will have a lower power cap and feature lots of extra modifiers to make the encounters much more unforgiving and difficult to navigate. The rules that we know of so far are:</p><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Contest Mode difficulty.</strong> Much like when a raid is live for the first time, players will be at least 20 levels below the Power level of all enemies in the dungeons. Enemies will also be much more aggressive, shooting more often and running towards players whenever possible. Limited revives will prevent players from completing encounters if they run out.</li><li dir="ltr">"<strong>Notswap" Modifier.</strong> Notswap is a new modifier where, if a player swaps an Exotic armor, a weapon, or a class, all of their energy is drained to zero. All cooldowns will be reactivated, the Super gauge will be set to zero, and they will have to regain all energy to use abilities again.</li></ul><p>Scoring will be based on deaths.The fewer deaths accumulated through an entire run, the higher the score will be. If players achieve a <strong>Platinum</strong> score, they will receive an <strong>Adept</strong> weapon at the end.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-rebellion-most-successful-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rebellion is celebrating the successful launch of Atomfall, a pseudo-apocalyptic survival game set in rural England in the 1950s. It’s a history-bending title with plenty of mysterious meat on some well-built bones, and that’s partly why <strong>one million players </strong>found their way into the game over the launch weekend.</p>



<p>In a statement, the team revealed that Atomfall is Rebellion’s most successful launch <strong>ever</strong>, and the company has been making games for more than thirty years.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-end-is-here">The End is Here</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-review-rebellion-curveball/">my Atomfall review</a>, I praised the game’s solid foundation, genuinely intriguing story, and sumptuous visuals, topics that have been mirrored by players worldwide. It’s a phenomenal concept for a game that has been delivered very nicely by Rebellion after years of development.</p>



<p>In a recent press release, Jason Kingsley CBE, the CEO of Rebellion, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are delighted that so many players are enjoying Atomfall.</p>



<p>To have surpassed the one million players in such a short space of time speaks volumes for the creativity and dedication of the entire team here at Rebellion. Our size and stability mean that we can take risks to create something as different as Atomfall. Happily, that risk is paying off.</p>



<p>We are a British company, and the game is a true reflection of that. Not only is it set in the lush, beautiful countryside but Atomfall also draws inspiration from so many classic British books, films and TV series.</p>



<p>We hope that players continue to enjoy exploring the world of Atomfall and are looking forward to future content for the game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team released some statistics along with the news, revealing that 316,000 people brutally murdered the innocent scientist who helps the player at the very start of the game.</p>



<p>I was one of those 316,000 people.</p>



<p>Also, 300,000 cups of tea have been consumed, which is nothing if not indicative of how <strong>quintessentially British </strong>Atomfall is.</p>



<p>Atomfall is available now on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC – it’s also on the Game Pass subscription service.</p>



<p>Let me know if you’ve played Atomfall in the comments and pop over to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> to let the community know what you think.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/priestahh-parts-ways-with-lag-m8-major-ii/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/priestahh-parts-ways-with-lag-m8-ahead-of-major-iii-qualifiers.1151325/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/priestahh-parts-ways-with-lag-m8-major-ii/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Preston ‘Priestahh’ Greiner has split from Los Angeles Guerrillas M8 in the Call of Duty League following a turbulent time for the team. Presently, LAG sits one from the bottom in the CDL standings, sitting on a match record of 4-15, which is fairly woeful. The only team behind LAG is the Vegas Falcons, which has yet to win a single match in the CDL.</p>



<p>Priestahh has been passed from pillar to post since his monumental season in 2023 that saw him secure two chips and a world championship, and it’s hard to tell where he’ll end up next.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-fall">The Fall</h2>



<p>During the 2023 CDL season, Priestahh saw immense success while playing an integral part in the New York Subliners roster. He was a member of the crew that landed one of the most historic grand finals in COD Champs history – a 5-0 wash over Toronto Ultra that ended in record time.</p>



<p>As a tenured veteran of Call of Duty esports, Priestahh has been around since Advanced Warfare (2014). He has flown the flag of some prestigious organisations, including 100 Thieves, FaZe, Cloud9, and now Gentlemates, represented in the Call of Duty League by the Los Angeles Guerrillas M8.</p>



<p>LAG has failed to gain any traction this season, though. The team has been hampered at every post, and it’s looking extremely likely that the squad won’t make it to this year’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-championship-2025-kitchener-june/">COD Championship tournament</a>, set to take place in Canada in June.</p>



<p>On March 18, LAG M8 started breaking down the roster, bidding farewell to Skyz – who has since wound up starting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-skyz-new-official-roster/">with OpTic Texas</a> in place of Kenny. On March 27, Lynz was pushed to the sub spot, being benched by LAG M8 after a crushing defeat <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atlanta-faze-lan-3peat-major-ii-finals/">at Major II</a>. Two days later, Priestahh was benched – and now he has departed the team entirely.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Nous disons au revoir à </span><a href="https://twitter.com/Priestahh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Priestahh</a><span> , qui quitte le club aujourd’hui

Merci Preston, nous te souhaitons le meilleur dans tes prochaines aventures 🩷 </span></p></article></div>







<p>Rostermania has been pretty wild so far during the gap between Major II and Major III. This coming Friday, matches will return, but will everyone be too distracted by the resurfacing of Verdansk in Warzone?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/former-sony-exec-says-its-about-time-for-playstation-to-reconsider-its-focus-on-cutting-edge-graphics<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Former PlayStation executive Shuhei Yoshida has been sharing quite a few insights on the games industry since his departure from Sony. Among them, he says it might be time for Sony to reconsider its adherence to cutting-edge graphics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://av.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/series/rt/2001814.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AVWatch</a> (translated via <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1906929110980653479" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genki_JPN</a>), Yoshida said it's time for PlayStation to reconsider its focus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Up until now, PlayStation's DNA has been driven by values such as 'cutting-edge graphics' that have continued since [Ken Kutaragi]'s time," Yoshida said. "Users have also expected that from PlayStation games. However, it's about time we have to reconsider that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Of course, I think it's necessary to provide the very best (in terms of graphics quality) to those who want it," Yoshida continued. "But, in order to continue to be popular with users in a broad sense, we naturally have to change our way of thinking."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There's little doubt that games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west">Horizon Forbidden West</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii">The Last of Us Part 2</a>, or other major Sony exclusives have put a lot of focus into graphical fidelity. Yet Yoshida's comments indicate it might be time to reconsider approach.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether that's a focus on relatively smaller experiences like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>, or a complete pivot to lo-fi or stylized graphics, it's not suggested. But with the price of making a big, AAA game like those in Sony's stable <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/major-publishers-report-aaa-franchises-can-cost-over-a-billion-to-make">seemingly only going up</a>, fresh approaches might be welcome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the only insight Yoshida has shared in his interview rounds. The former PlayStation exec <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-playstation-exec-says-nier-automata-revived-the-japanese-games-industry-convinced-it-to-stop-chasing-overseas-trend">also discussed NieR: Automata's impact on the games industry</a>, especially in Japan. Whether that's the blueprint for a renewed approach to games or not, I certainly wouldn't complain about more games like NieR: Automata going around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Thankfully, after more than a decade away from the glamor and gunpowder of criminal activity, a group of familiar faces behind Payday: The Heist and Payday 2 have taken a break from making the insanely difficult co-op shooter GTFO to go back to what they do best. And that is, make games where you and your friends work together to break the law by pulling off a series of elaborate and high-risk burglaries for no other reason than to satisfy your wanton greed. But where the Payday series was and continues to be a fairly standard game about robbing banks, the upcoming Den of Wolves adds a compelling sci-fi world with a gritty, cyberpunk flair, multi-phase planning and execution of break-ins where you can decide exactly how you want to pull it off, and most importantly: the ability to dive into the minds of others to steal the valuable secrets hidden within their brains. If that doesn’t get your blood pumping, I don’t know what will!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Den of Wolves takes place in the extremely dark near future where the world’s technology ecosystem imploded due to hackers, and corporations were given free rein to do whatever they pleased to combat the crisis, including but not limited to human experimentation, and building dangerous and unpredictable technologies (y’know, your basic cyberpunk hellscape stuff) so long as they kept their activities contained to the newly minted libertarian dystopia and Andrew Ryan’s wet dream: Midway City. Naturally this leads to corporations storing their data straight inside totally unhackable human brains, transforming the host to all that delicious data into a wonderful little flesh battery, from the looks of it. But we’re hardened criminals, guys. Are we really gonna let a super creepy meat computer locked away in a bank vault get in the way of us pulling off heists? I think not!</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Den of Wolves GDC 2025 Preview Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To that end, Den of Wolves has you and three friends planning and carrying out a series of felonies in Midway City, where you’ll overcome those pesky brain-based security systems by mind-melding with victims to rip off their secrets and make off with the loot. My demo focused on a single operation where my crew and I planned and executed a high-stakes assault on a bank currently under new management by a very aggressive street gang with power and tech enough to rival world governments – pretty nasty stuff. In this particular case, our plan of attack was to use a swarm of drones acquired from a previous robbery to ambush a number of these gang members to gain entrance into the reinforced stronghold, then go loud as possible, shooting up the place with reckless abandon until we found what we were looking for. In this instance, the big prize was the data inside someone’s head who was locked safely away inside a vault and scarcely resembled a human anymore; truly just straight nightmare fuel, if I’m being honest.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You'll mind-meld with victims to rip off their brain's secrets and make off with the loot.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Much of this caper went off in a way any Payday fan will immediately recognize: we used a variety of automatic weapons to smash and grab everything in sight while holding off waves of folks who were quite mad about being ripped off, deploying and repairing drills that break every couple seconds even in a sci-fi future, apparently. Naturally, cooperation was critical to our success, as we laid down cover fire for one another, revived downed teammates who got caught in a bad spot, and called out to one another as we heaved bags full of loot across the ruined fortress. There really wasn’t a whole lot new about the foundation of this heist game, aside from maybe the consumable equipment abilities that let my squad do things like throw down a temporary barrier that provided some limited cover in the middle of a fight.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But all that changed when the bank vault doors slid open, revealing the prize we were chasing after: a caterpillar-like human lump locked away to contain valuable secrets. After a little bit of hacking, we lept from the physical plane and into the mind of this person to hack open their brain and make off with their secrets. Now, I don’t know what exactly is going on in the mind of this clearly and understandably disturbed individual, but what we found waiting for us inside his dome was an unsettling and surreal series of landscapes that we had to leap between to gain access to their thoughts. And since we were on a timer, we couldn’t afford to take our time or slip up, lest we get booted back out to the real world and have to continue to hold out against enemies before getting another crack at it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This was the only brain I dove into in my limited time with Den of Wolves, but I was told that every mind would present unique challenges to play against, not just the high-stakes platforming of our current mission. And while it remains to be seen just how interesting or how much variety these will have, this section completely shook up an otherwise familiar formula in a seriously cool way. I love shooting at rival criminal gangs and robo cops as much as the next convicted felon, but it was really neat to jump back and forth between reality-based FPS combat and completely bizarre cooperative platforming in a geometrically impossible world of imagination. That really helps to set this one apart from what I worried might just be a Payday sequel with a cyberpunk skin plastered over it. Instead, it seems Den of Wolves plans on taking some real risks and trying stuff that makes it weird and interesting, and I’m absolutely down for that.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In between trips into our poor, troubled victim’s mind, we were yanked right back out to where we left off, only milliseconds apparently having elapsed in meat space while we went parading around in someone’s noggin. After jumping back into his skull for a few additional servings of deeply uncomfortable jumping puzzles, we got what we came for and made our exit by blowing up some windows with high explosives and diving out to what I can only hope was some Assassin's Creed-style hay piles waiting conveniently placed just below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though Den of Wolves borrows quite a bit from Payday and other crime games, the setting, elaborate planning mechanics, and especially its surreal mind-hacking mechanics all made me feel pretty confident that developer 10 chambers’ return to the wonderful world of heisting has a good chance of being another stunning success. Here’s hoping they can pull off the score of a lifetime when this thing eventually makes its way into early access on PC.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But should contract negotiations break down, the ZeniMax union now has the permission to call a strike.</p><p>This authorization comes as contract negotiations between union members and parent company Microsoft continue into a second year.</p><p>The strike authorization is the latest escalation between the union and management. Last year, ZeniMax Workers United <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295556/video-game-developer-strike-zenimax-microsoft">participated in a one-day strike</a> claiming that Microsoft did not adequately address employee concerns over its return to office policies and its outsourcing practices.

When will enough be enough?”</p><p>“Our quality assurance team is an integral part of our business and is key to our ability to deliver games our players will love,” Microsoft spokesperson Delaney Simmons says in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>. We respect the team’s right to express their viewpoints and are deeply committed to reaching a fair and equitable resolution that acknowledges the teams’ contributions. There has been substantial progress over the course of the negotiations, reaching tentative agreements on a majority of the topics at the table. We have presented a package proposal that we believe is fair — if accepted it would result in immediate compensation increases, even more robust benefits and is in alignment to the company’s hybrid model of 3 days in office. We look forward to continuing this progress during negotiations.”</p><p>ZeniMax Workers United is one of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24202271/bethesda-game-studios-workers-unionize-cwa">several</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/8/24094602/activision-blizzard-qa-workers-unionizing-microsoft">unions</a> under the Microsoft umbrella. It formed in 2023 and was once the largest union within the company with 300 members before Activision Quality Assurance United organized roughly 600 quality assurance workers last year.</p><p>At GDC 2025, the Communications Workers of America (CWA) announced the launch of the United Videogame Workers, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-workers-form-first-north-american-industry-wide-union-with-communications-workers-of-america">a nationwide direct-join union</a> open to any worker in the video game industry.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Developer Rebellion is perhaps best known for the Sniper Elite series, but the UK's studio latest release, Atomfall, is now the developer's "most successful launch" in its 32-year history. </p><p>Atomfall launched in full on March 27 and reached 1 million players over its first weekend, climbing further to more than 1.5 million so far. The post-apocalyptic survival game was inspired by the real-world <a href="https://www.britannica.com/event/Windscale-fire" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windscale nuclear incident </a>in the 1950s. The game has been referred to by some as "British Fallout."</p><p>"To have surpassed the 1 million players in such a short space of time speaks volumes for the creativity and dedication of the entire team here at Rebellion," the developer's CEO and co-founder, Jason Kingsley, said in a statement. "Our size and stability mean that we can take risks to create something as different as Atomfall. Happily, that risk is paying off."</p><p>Rebellion also shared some other stats from launch, including:</p><ul><li>316,000 players killed the scientist at the start of the game</li><li>Players have used the cricket bat 3.7 million times to rack up kills.</li><li>More than 4 million pasties and 300,000 cups of tea have been consumed.</li></ul><p>Atomfall no doubt benefitted in terms of player numbers by launching into the Xbox Game Pass and PC Game Pass game catalogs. Rebellion did not, however, say how many copies of Atomfall have been sold across all platforms, including Xbox and PlayStation consoles, as well as PC.</p><p>In fact, there is no indiciation at all as to how Rebellion is measuring success for Atomfall. Also unknown is how much Atomfall cost to develop or market. As always, game development budgets remain mysterious. What we do know is Atomfall is not Rebellion's first Game Pass day-one release, as Sniper Elite: Resistance was a Game Pass launch as well.</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/atomfall-review-bunker-thrill/1900-6418348/" data-ref-id="1900-6418348">Atomfall review</a> scored the game a 7/10. Reviewer Mark Delaney wrote, "Atomfall is a good game that sometimes gets in its own way, but it's the process of finding your unique path through its story that will stick with you after the dust settles."</p>

If you're a fan of locomotives and fiendish deck-building strategy roguelikes, you've probably long been in the grip of developer Shiny Shoe's massively acclaimed Monster Train. So you'll likely <em>also</em> be thrilled to hear its previously announced sequel finally has a release date - and is coming to PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch on 21st May.
</p>
<p>
Shiny Shoe's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-train-brings-a-new-idea-to-a-genre-i-love">original Monster Train released back in 2020</a>, plopping players onto an infernal locomotive destined for the heart of a frozen Hell. Here, they were tasked with fending off Heaven's forces - and, crucially, protecting the train's burning pyre - through strategic bouts of real-time card battles playing out across multiple floors of the train. And good stuff it was too, still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1102190/Monster_Train/">boasting an 'Overwhelmingly Positive' Steam rating</a> four years after its release.
</p>
<p>
Which brings us to Monster Train 2. This time around, Heaven and Hell's denizens have formed a makeshift alliance to bring down the powerful Titans - in an adventure taking players through Heaven, Hell, and the mysterious Abyss. To aid in their quest, Monster Train 2 introduces five new clans, new units, new upgrade cards, and dangerous new enemies. That's alongside the new Room and Equipment card types - the former providing special boosts to the train itself, and the latter providing bonuses to units when applied.

<p>
On top of that, there's the new Covenant Outpost, which players can visit between runs. Here, they'll experience character interactions as the story plays out, and gain access to different features. There are unlockable Pyre Hearts, for instance, each said to add unique functionality to gameplay, alongside train customisation and an improved Logbook.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, Monster Train 2's story is complemented by Dimensional Challenges - promising handcrafted challenges, new Mutators, and cosmetic rewards - as well as Daily Challenges, an Endless mode, plus the Celestial Alcoves where players can experience a "wide variety of random events... and maybe even a few surprises" from beyond the Monster Train universe.
</p>
<p>
Monster Train 2 launches for Steam, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and Switch on 21st May. And if you're curious to see what's new, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2742830/Monster_Train_2/">demo's available now on Steam</a>.

			<p>Today, developer FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco have released a new trailer for the highly anticipated game Elden Ring: Nightreign. The video is dedicated to the Ironeye class, one of the classes players will be able to pick while in the game.</p>
<p>According to the official brief, the ethos of the Ironeye is to strike from afar with ranged attacks and deadly precision. They start with a bow and specialize in dexterity-based weapons. The class brings damage and utility to parties brave enough to sojourn into Limveld. Experienced players will also recognize the usefulness of ranged attacks - being able to revive downed party members from a distance during a run can make the difference between surviving the night and not living to see another day. While the Ironeye starts with ranged attacks and has ranged Ultimates, like all Nightfarers, they can use any weapon they discover during a run.</p>

<p>There will be four more classes (or Nightfarers, as they are described in the game) in Elden Ring: Nightreign:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wylder - A balanced all-rounder, effective both in speed and attack power.</li>
<li>Guardian - A tank with heavy attacks and increased damage resistance.</li>
<li>Duchess - A nimble hero with quick attacks and a strong evasive ability.</li>
<li>Recluse - A caster with ranged magical abilities and a healing-based skill</li>
</ul>
<p>These Nightfarers still have to get their dedicated trailers, though. This is likely to happen in short order, given that the game is less than two months away from its planned May 30 launch date.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview-looking-forward-to-the-night/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">checking out Elden Ring: Nightreign</a> during the recent Closed Beta Test, Wccftech's Francesco De Meo was eager to play more:</p>
<p><em>FromSoftware isn't just combining its trademark gameplay mechanics with co-op and roguelike mechanics, it is doing so masterfully to deliver an experience that has a lot of potential and could really shine with some tweaks based on the feedback from these pre-release tests.</em></p>
<p>In less than eight weeks, we'll know if FromSoftware can deliver another hit even in a spin-off game dedicated to multiplayer.</p>

			<p>Doom and gloom settled on Nintendo Switch 2 fans <a href="https://wccftech.com/developers-say-nintendo-switch-2-dev-kits-dont-offer-4k-output/">yesterday</a> when it was revealed that the system's devkits don't support 4K resolution outputs. However, there's a good indication that this won't be the case, judging from some recent findings.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-4194#post-1702829">Famiiboards forums member Serif</a> provided some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jozskd/the_switch_2_dock_uses_a_realtek_rtd2175ncg/">additional details</a> about the dock's Realtek RTD2175N-CG chipset. Information on this precise model cannot be found online, but the closest model, the RTDN2173 chipset, which is likely a predecessor to the Nintendo Switch 2 dock's chipset, supports DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI HDCP 2.2/1.4 and HDR, as well as video resolutions from 720p up to 8K60Hz, so the dock will be able to output 4K resolution, although it remains to be seen if 4K resolution will be supported by games. Still, even if 4K resolution output is only limited to the system's UI, it will still be a massive improvement over the original Switch, whose interface looks terrible on large 4K screens.</p>
<p>Even without the unlikely lack of 4K resolution support, the Nintendo Switch 2 is setting up to be a massive upgrade over the original system. The console's controllers will also receive some significant upgrades, as the new Pro Controller will likely feature <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-upgrade-dev-kits/">a headphone jack</a>, suggesting better voice chat support for the new system as well. Thankfully, it won't be long until we finally learn everything there is to know about the Nintendo Switch 2 and how much it will actually be an improvement over its predecessor, as the console will finally be fully unveiled tomorrow, April 2nd.</p>

<p>With the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct almost upon us, details about the upcoming console’s Pro Controller have surfaced online.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-upgrades-nbsp">Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller Upgrades&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Spotted on <a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/page-4192#post-1701204" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Famiboards</a> (via <a href="https://in.ign.com/nintendo-switch-2-unofficial-name/227778/news/fcc-filing-could-indicate-a-possible-upgrade-for-nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), FCC Filings for the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller have been revealed, providing an idea about the new upgrades for this device. The filing has been listed for ‘BEE-008’, a controller with both Bluetooth and NFC. Interestingly, the filing suggests that Nintendo could finally add a headphone jack to their Pro Controller for Switch 2.&nbsp;Moreover, the controller should feature a new battery, too.</p>



<p>The community has long requested a headphone jack for the Pro Controllers. When the console is docked, wired audio is impossible unless you are glued to the TV. However, with the upcoming console finally introducing voice chat for the platform, a headphone jack for the Pro Controller seems more likely. We will have to wait for the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct event tomorrow to know for sure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Direct event <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-will-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct-last/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will last one hour</a> and explain everything we need to know about the upcoming console. It will be followed by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-gameplay-showcase-dates-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Treehouse: Live</a>, featuring hands-on gameplay for Switch 2 games.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Compulsion Games is ready to bring the world South of Midnight. Its release date comes several years after its announcement, and the developer is preparing everyone for its debut by showcasing start times for its normal and Early Access launches.</p>



<p>If We Happy Few is anything to go by, then we already know <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/south-of-midnight-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South of Midnight</a> is a can’t-miss adventure. Xbox shares Compulsion Games’ affinity for the weird and wonderful, and this is the first project under the Xbox banner. South of Midnight looks like a mature and realized vision, and its release date can’t come soon enough for some. </p>



<p>If you’re after the earliest possible start time, you’ve come to the right place.</p>



<h2 id="h-south-of-midnight-release-date">South of Midnight Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Magical and mysterious. Credit to Compulsion Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>April 8 is the confirmed South of Midnight release date, and it’s one of the month’s biggest games.</strong></p>



<p>South of Midnight—at the time of writing—hasn’t been subjected to a delay. It’s had little-to-no controversy and got a lot of hype ahead of its launch. It’s available to Xbox Series X|S and PC users, so let’s see if being available on these platforms helps its sales.</p>



<p>Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-south-of-midnight-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South of Midnight being on Xbox Game Pass</a> is sure to go in its favor.</p>



<h2 id="h-south-of-midnight-start-times">South of Midnight Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>Expect South of Midnight to launch and get underway at 9 AM PDT / 11 AM CDT / 12 PM EDT / 5 PM BST.</strong></p>



<p>Again, this is for the official launch date. South of Midnight’s release has several editions to consider, so depending on which one you opt for, there’s a chance you’re entitled to Early Access—giving you an earlier start time.</p>



<h2 id="h-south-of-midnight-early-access-start-times">South of Midnight Early Access Start Times</h2>



<p><strong>The Premium and Premium Upgrade Editions come with five days of South of Midnight Early Access.</strong></p>

A new trailer highlights the newest Nightfarer's (Nightreign's version of classes) impressive mobility, showing the ability to send out a scatter of arrows while sliding or even firing shots after double-jumping off a wall.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2wQ4uE_TPdE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2wQ4uE_TPdE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Of course, the Iron Eye has some heavy-hitting abilities as well, such as a move that pulls out a massive bow and arrow that can pierce enemies and is followed up by a shockwave that knocks down surrounding foes. The Ironeye joins other Nightfarers like the magic-specializing Recluse, the grapple-shot-wielding Wylder, the nimble assassin-like Duchess, and the tank-oriented Guardian for a total of five playable classes revealed in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date-trailer-news-everything-we-know/2900-6095/" data-ref-id="2900-6095">Elden Ring Nightreign so far</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Many players got to go hands-on with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreigns-network-test-included-over-30-billion-lost-runes/1100-6530467/" data-ref-id="1100-6530467">Elden Ring Nightreign in February as part of a network test</a>, only for it to be plagued by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-apologizes-for-elden-ring-nightreign-test-server-problems/1100-6529508/" data-ref-id="1100-6529508">server issues that From Software later apologized for</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-explores-exciting-and-unexpected-new-ground-for-from-software/1100-6529377/" data-ref-id="1100-6529377">Elden Ring Nightreign preview</a>, Tamoor Hussain said that the battle royale-inspired nature of Nightreign at first seems like From Software is chasing multiplayer trends but in reality aligns with many of the design principles the studio is known for, calling it "very much a From Software game."

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nightdive-studios-very-well-suited-for-hexen-and-heretic-remasters-lead-engine-dev-says/">Nightdive Studios</a> has made it their bread-and-butter to be the team you want remaking and remastering older games. If there's any game you loved when you were a kid that's currently trapped on aging hardware and not easily playable on modern machines, Nightdive is the team you'd want remastering that game.</p>
<p>So far, Nightdive has remastered and remade a number of classics, including its excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/system-shock-remake-shodan-establishes-dominance/">System Shock Remake</a>, The Thing Remastered, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nightdive-announces-turok-3-shadow-of-oblivion-remaster-for-pc-ps5-ps4-switch-and-xbox-one/">Turok</a> franchise, and Star Wars: Dark Forces Remastered, to name a few. The studio has no intention of sticking to games from a certain era, though, and it is looking to take on games from the seventh generation consoles, namely PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 games.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/we-stand-ready-nightdive-says-it-wants-to-start-remastering-xbox-360-and-ps3-era-games/">VGC</a><span>, Larry Kuperman, director of business development at Nightdive Studios, said, "<em>We stand ready</em>," on the subject of remastering and remaking seventh-gen games. However, both Kuperman and Stephen Kick, chief executive officer at Nightdive</span>, added that there are plenty of considerations for remastering seventh-gen games.</p>
<p>"<em>I would begin asking a couple of questions,</em>" said Kuperman. "<em>Was it Xbox 360 exclusive, or was there a PC version out too? Because that also changes things, the little preservation that’s available. Do we have source code? If so, what’s the quality of the source code? How about the assets? Those are the kinds of considerations that we have there. That being said, there were some really good games that came out in that era that shouldn’t be lost.</em>"</p>
<p>Kick then used the 2008 first-person shooter Haze as an example of a game that he and the team at Nightdive believe should be remastered.</p>
<p>"<em>To your point, though, with a game like Haze – let’s say hypothetically we had access to that, and that was our big title for 2028, right? – We would go to the original designers, and we would say: ‘It didn’t do as well as you had hoped, I’m sure you’ve had a lot of time to ruminate and to think about what you would have done differently.</em>"</p>
<p>Kick added that, specifically with Nightdive's remaster of System Shock 2, speaking to the original developers solved many of the issues they were working on, as they could hear directly from the original creators what steps Nightdive should take to properly recreate the original vision.</p>
<p>When it comes to remastering seventh-gen games, the big hang-up has never been games that were available on Xbox 360 or PC in that era. The PlayStation 3's unique CELL architecture has been the infamous roadblock that's kept plenty of PS3-exclusive titles landlocked on Sony's old grill-looking console.</p>
<p>Despite the challenge, Kick is certain that Nightdive is up to the task.</p>
<p><em>"I think that architecture – I mean, I remember the talk when the system was first released, of how difficult it was for developers to ‘get’ it – and that’s a big problem with backwards compatibility [...] So yeah, if we get to that – or I should say when – we get to the PS3 era games, it will be a challenge that we have to face. But I think that we’ve had enough experience to where we can do a serviceable job on a PS3 remaster."</em></p>
<p>Kuperman also added that part of Nightdive's advantage is their internal engine, which has helped them remaster and remake games from multiple eras of consoles. Hopefully, it turns out to be the ace up Nightdive's sleeve to make them the go-to studio for bringing PS3 games into the modern gaming landscape.</p>
