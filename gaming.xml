			<p>Raccoon Logic has unveiled its newest project, the Revenge of the Savage Planet, a sequel to the Sci-Fi adventure title Journey to the Savage Planet.</p>
<p>Raccoon Logic's upcoming title was showcased at the Opening Night Live pre-show and the Xbox Gamescom reveal. For those inspired by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/journey-to-the-savage-planet/">first game in the series</a>, the new sequel has brought in much more, building upon the same roots. This time, players will have access to a larger pool of content, including more new planets and gears and hundreds of secrets to uncover.</p>
<p>One of the most significant changes in Revenge of the Savage Planet is the switch to a third-party perspective, an attempt to stay true to the series' initial inspirations. Interestingly, the devs have also added online co-op and crossplay within the title, allowing gamers to interact with anyone anywhere in the world, choosing them as their comrades for the whole journey. You can also play with a split screen if you are more inclined towards couch co-op.</p>
<p>Adding plenty of new content has brought the spotlight to the sequel. The game now features four new planets, including Stellaris Prime and Zephy, all equipped with unique environments and obstacles to provide gamers with a delightful experience. Here are the key features of Revenge of the Savage Planet, giving us a more vivid idea of what the sequel has in store for gamers:</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Third-Person Online Co-Op &amp; Crossplay - Play with your best friend, partner or hellspawn on/or between any platform and now in third-person! You’ll be tasked with fully exploring and understanding these beautiful alien landscapes and uncovering its secrets.</em></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Couch Co-Op with Split Screen: Experience the nostalgia-tinged joy of sitting on the same couch and playing on the same screen with someone you love, like the olden days, but with 100% more corporate satire.</em></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Survive a FOUR Savage Planets - Populate your Kindex by exploring four large, vibrant worlds each with their own weird and wonderful plants and creatures. Scan everything, catalog everything, hopefully increase your science level… and you might even unlock new (yet still 4th best) gear! Plus… there may be more than four planets. Maybe.</em></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Space Action &amp; Adventure - Run, Jump, Shoot, Grind, Stomp, Dodge, Slide, Lasso and Grapple your way through the world! While you’re at it you’ll also be experimenting with three different types of gameplay goo, most of which are highly flammable! Overcome challenging combat encounters with alien boss battles, suggestive fauna, problematic software and maybe even a greedy CEO.</em></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Habitat &amp; Character Customization - Alien plants! Exciting gear! Weird rocks! Each planet is packed with nooks and crannies hiding all manner of rewards and secrets.&nbsp; While you’re at it you can even customize yourself,&nbsp; and your tiny habitat-like corner of the universe.</em></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Collect Alien Creatures - Intergalactic Hoarders can also use their Lasso to Capture and Collect dozens of strange creatures, then go visit them once they’re relocated “happily placed” in Pens outside your customizable space trailer in scenic Nu Florida.&nbsp; After all, who is the real dangerous enemy, the corporate profiteers who fired you or a slimy exploding alien creature?</em></p>
</li>
<li dir="ltr">
<p dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>SAVAGE PLANET FRANCHISE - Originally released on Xbox, PS4, Epic Games Store, Steam, Stadia and Switch platforms enabling fun space adventures for millions of players across the globe.&nbsp; The original game earned multiple awards as a humorous, cooperative indie adventure, Then later Raccoon Logic developed the “Employee of the Month” version for Gen 9 consoles.&nbsp; Raccoon Logic Typhoon Studios captured the attention of press,creators and earned its Very Positive consumer ratings and Critics endorsements.&nbsp;</em></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of the release date of the upcoming sequel, Raccoon Logic says that they have targeted the early-ish 2025 timeline for PC and consoles, but they haven't provided an exact date for now. Overall, given the upcoming in-game content with Revenge of the Savage Planet, followed by the changes made in perspectives and mechanics, it's safe to say that Raccoon Logic does stand out in its own ways, and for the enthusiasts of the overall series, they are surely going to enjoy it.</p>
<p>Head out to the <a href="https://www.savageplanet.games/en-US#media">developer's official website</a> to find out more details about the title.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/jackbox-naughty-pack-delivers-fun-games-naughty-still-to-be-seen</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-jackbox-naughty-pack-delivers-fun-games-naughty-still-to-be-seen.959790/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/jackbox-naughty-pack-delivers-fun-games-naughty-still-to-be-seen<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's no secret that playing the <em>Jackbox Party Pack </em>is often a race to the bottom in terms of humor. Who will be the first to make that <em>'Cards Against Humanity' </em>style prompt and edge the rest of the group to devolve? With the <em>Jackbox Naughty Pack</em> players now get a chance to participate in three games where some of these edgier prompts are supplied by the game itself.</p>
<p>The <em>Jackbox Naughty Pack </em>comes with three games: M-Rated variations of previously existing Jackbox minigames and a brand-new one. The games included in this <em>Party Pack</em> are <em>Fakin' It All Night Long, Dirty Drawful, </em>and <em>Let Me Finish.</em></p>

<p>A few weeks ago I had a chance to sit down with the developers of the <em>Jackbox Party Pack</em>, along with some industry peers not only to learn more about these games but also to get hands-on with them.</p>
<h2><em>Fakin' It All Night Long</em></h2>
<p><em>Fakin' It All Night Long</em> is a reimagining of <em>Fakin' It</em>, a game that is still my favorite ever since its debut in the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2b4ae760-8c82-49a2-82d4-196d2e479e53" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/jackbox-party-pack-3-review-would-you-like-to-play-game"><em>Jackbox Party Pack 3</em></a>.</p>
<p>Among the group of players each is fed instructions to follow such as raising a number of fingers or making a face, one player is the Faker and will be fed incorrect prompts having to lie about their responses. The aim of this game is for the regular players to discover the faker, while the faker wins if they remain undetected for the longest amount of time.</p>

<p>Some of the prompts include questions about how often you might have gone to court or "Raise your hand if you think you could kill a raccoon in a fair fight."</p>
<p>A new addition to <em>Fakin' It All Night Long</em> is the addition of a Remote Play mode. Normally <em>Fakin' It </em>requires you to be in the same room as each other watching each others' reactions. This has meant that streamers haven't been able to play the game with their audience. With Remote Play those reactions and gestures have been replaced by emojis that players can select from their mobile device.</p>
<h2><em>Dirty Drawful</em></h2>
<p>In <em>Dirty Drawful</em> the players are all delivered a prompt to draw, after creating their 'masterpiece' that image is displayed to all other players who will decide what they believe the prompt is. Then the real prompt, along with the guessed prompts, are all posed to the group where points are awarded for getting the correct answer or tricking your friends.</p>

<p><em>Dirty Drawful</em> is the least changed of the games. It's still <em>Drawful</em>, where a prompt is delivered for a player to draw an image. But those images just might be a bit stranger. A prompt that I received was "Murder Super Fan" while another player got "Follow! That! Furry!"</p>
<p>The biggest change here is that an undo button has been added, no clear explanation was given for why this was the first time an undo button was being added to Drawful, perhaps it's a test for a later version or it's just with naughtier prompts they want to make sure if players feel like they've gone too far they can reel it back in.</p>
<h2><em>Let Me Finish</em></h2>
<p>The new game in this party pack is<em> Let Me Finish</em>, a debate game where players are given a stock image and a weird open-ended prompt that they'll be able to answer and then debate over. Some of the example prompts were "Where is a mailbox's butt?" or "How does this avocado get aroused?"</p>
<p>This game promotes engaging with the game, as well as with one another as debate breaks out when everyone's different opinions are revealed and you can agree or vehemently disagree with each other.</p>

<p>A fun twist to this game is that if a player standing by thinks both players are completely wrong they can not only voice their opinion but add themselves to the prompt offering their own point of view for prompts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jumping in and telling players they're wrong has always been a fun part of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b0f7b9d1-a12c-4c8c-835f-34ef4ff66814" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/jackbox-party-pack-10-review-decade-of-brilliance"><em>Jackbox Games</em></a>, but to be able to do it for points is just the cherry on top.</p>
<h2>How Naughty Is Naughty?</h2>
<p>While I wasn't expecting every prompt that we saw to be absolutely explicit or get anywhere close to the questionability of a home game, the prompts that I did see didn't feel like they broached very close to 'naughty'. I'm definitely looking forward to spending more time with the game to see just how wide a variety of prompts there are.</p>
<p>The most mature additions to the game are in the avatars and mascots of the games. The humans of <em>Fakin' It</em> might be shown in a bikini or censor bars, or you'll see the <em>Drawful </em>Owl looking thiccc or wearing a gimp suit. These themes do make me wonder if our 'random' prompts at this press event had been watered down for the sake of professionalism.</p>
<p>For the time being the prompts have maybe opened a gateway to naughtiness a bit faster than a normal game of <em>Jackbox</em>, but if you really want to set that tone it's still going to be the players doing the heavy lifting.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mafia-the-old-country-wont-feature-full-italian-dub-despite-being-set-in-italy.959787/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mafia-old-country-no-italian-audio<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It looks like the recently-announced&nbsp;<em>Mafia: The Old Country&nbsp;</em>won't feature a full Italian voiceover dub, despite the fact that it's set in Sicily and the fact that previous games in the series have offered Italian audio.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1941540/Mafia_The_Old_Country/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">the Steam page</a> for&nbsp;<em>The Old Country</em>, we can see that the game will offer a full dub in English, French, Spanish, and German, as well as Russian. Italian players, however, will have to content themselves with interface translations and subtitles.</p>
<p>A quick look at the Steam pages for the first three <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030830/Mafia_II_Definitive_Edition/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">games</a> in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/360430/Mafia_III_Definitive_Edition/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">series</a> (or the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030840/Mafia_Definitive_Edition/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Definitive Edition remake of the first game</a>, at the very least) shows that they all feature a full Italian dub, making&nbsp;<em>The Old Country&nbsp;</em>the first game in the franchise not to offer this convenience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mafia-the-old-country-no-italian-audio-house.jpg?itok=oT5AwH8S 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mafia-the-old-country-no-italian-audio-house.jpg?itok=zBBEIngI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mafia: The Old Country</em>'s lack of an Italian dub feels somewhat ironic.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that we don't know a whole lot about&nbsp;<em>The Old Country&nbsp;</em>yet. It's possible that the lack of an Italian dub is due to translation complications; if characters speak both Italian and English in the game, for instance, a dub might be somewhat difficult to implement.</p>
<p>However, it's also ironic that the first game in the series that appears to take place entirely in Italy will lack an Italian dub. One would imagine the mafiosi depicted in the game would probably take umbrage with such a decision, amusing as it might be.</p>
<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Mafia: The Old Country</em>, it's the latest entry in the&nbsp;<em>Mafia&nbsp;</em>series. Announced during yesterday's Gamescom Opening Night Live showcase, the game is a prequel set during the 1900s, and it'll shine a light on the "brutal underworld" of the Sicily of that era.</p>

<p>Developer Hangar 13 and publisher 2K have promised more information to come regarding&nbsp;<em>Mafia: The Old Country&nbsp;</em>this December, so stay tuned for more on that.</p>
<p>In the meantime, if you want to keep abreast of the game's progress, you can wishlist it right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1941540/Mafia_The_Old_Country/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10007134" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/mafia-the-old-country/9P834N9S4LL0/0010" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/gamescom-2024">Gamescom</a> is exploding all around us, but there is still time to lower a pincer into the pile of Steam indie game announcements and reel up the occasional treasure. In this case, it's the demo for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cupiclaw">Cupiclaw</a>, which is possibly the first ever "roguelike deckbuilding claw machine game". You know how <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> made you feel about Joker cards? Well, this game wants to make you feel the same about claw machines. It's a terrible turn of events, frankly. I'm sorry for inflicting yet another potential bingeplay upon you. Here's a trailer. </p>

<p>The setup is that your character, Morris, has dropped his wedding ring in a claw machine, the classic first act twist in any Shakespearean tragedy. Specifically, he's dropped it in the arcade's most expensive claw machine. To earn the means to operate said ultra-pricey claw machine and retrieve the ring, he'll need to play all the other claw machines, converting his winnings into funds.</p>
<p>Why Morris doesn't just ask the arcade manager to open up the first claw machine and fetch the ring directly is a question for the soon-to-be-thriving Cupiclaw subreddit. Perhaps the arcade manager is a calculating Lothario who wishes to seduce Morris's spouse, while he's off playing at claw machines. Perhaps Morris's spouse is the manager. The moral of the story is: never let your spouse use a claw machine.</p>
<p>Anyway, in order to muster enough cash to scale the claw machine hierarchy, you'll also need to "level up" each individual machine by spending a portion of your earnings to restock it with new prizes, this being the deckbuilding aspect of the game. Prizes range from larger, plusher stuffed animals to puzzle pieces which earn you a bigger payout per piece, the more of them you amass.</p>
<p>The actual operation of each machine is straightforward - use A and D to move the claw left and right, hit spacebar to lower it. There's a timer to worry about, but if you rush you might accidentally bag objects such as crumpled soda cans that lower your final score. Like the soaring peregrine falcon, you must be discriminating yet swift.</p>
<p>All this is based on five minutes with Cupiclaw's demo. I can't say how complicated it'll get later on, but I'm hoping for a complex prize economy with plenty of variables and modifiers. The only thing I dislike about it is the overtly repetitive music. In that regard, at least, it's no Balatro.

This version only includes the base game, but it’s worth noting that some years ago, Techland made its only major expansion, <em>The Following</em>, completely free. </strong>So if you want to just catch up on Kyle Crane’s story, you can go this route and spare your wallet.</p><p>Though, I wouldn’t really recommend that route as Techland supported the <em>shit </em>out of that first game in the series when it became a rousing success. <em>Dying Light </em>had a season pass that included a year’s worth of DLCs, including a brand new mode and challenges as well as <em>The Following</em>. <strong>You can pick up these offerings in the enhanced edition of </strong><em><strong>Dying Light </strong></em><strong>which is also on sale on Steam right now for $9. </strong>Regrettably, this edition isn’t on sale on Xbox, <strong>but it </strong><em><strong>is </strong></em><strong>on PlayStation</strong>&nbsp;<strong>and the Nintendo Switch </strong>so if you’ve got that or a PC, you should be all set.</p><p>However, there’s also a final <em>definitive </em>edition of <em>Dying Light </em>that packs the base game, the expansion, the season pass DLC, all the cosmetics that were ever released for the game, and a final DLC that repurposes the aesthetic of a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/1706038022&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/1706038022">dark-fantasy game Techland was working on</a></span> for just one more dollar. <strong>Yep, the definitive edition of <em>Dying Light </em>is also available with all of that for 10 bucks on Steam.</strong> So if you want the most bang for your buck, that seems like the path to take.</p><p>If you’re uninterested in the story and just want to skip forward, or if you only played the first game, there’s good news: there’s a sequel that was only released a few years ago, and it’s <em>also </em>on sale. <em><strong>Dying Light 2 Stay Human: Reloaded Edition </strong></em><strong>(what a mouthful) is the new base version of the game which also packs the story DLC, </strong><em><strong>Bloody Ties</strong></em><strong>. You can get the base version of </strong><em><strong>Dying Light 2 </strong></em><strong>for just $24 right now on Steam and Xbox.</strong> At the time of its release, Techland got a lot of flak for emphasizing that this game had <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dying-light-2-will-take-500-hours-to-fully-complete-and-1848326833&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dying-light-2-will-take-500-hours-to-fully-complete-and-1848326833">500 hours of content</a></span> if you maximized everything possible, so if that number sounds appealing to you, that sure sounds <em>worth </em>24 bucks.</p><p>If you know you’re going to want to play the upcoming game though, you may be interested in the ultimate edition of <em>Dying Light 2</em>, which comes with the base game, the DLC, and a bunch of extra goodies like skins, an artbook, and more. The real draw of the deal though is that folks who purchase this version get <em>Dying Light: The Beast </em>for free, since it was originally supposed to be an expansion before ballooning into its own title. <strong>For the boldest of you, $63 dollars can get you the ultimate edition of </strong><em><strong>Dying Light 2 </strong></em><strong>(including future access to </strong><em><strong>Dying Light: The Beast</strong></em><strong>) on Steam and PlayStation.</strong></p><p>That’s more zombies and parkour than I think anyone could possibly ask for. I’ve never jumped into these games before, but I know that the folks who have generally love them. Given how well they’ve sold, I guess I can believe the hype. So if <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2LQh1UQXXE&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b2LQh1UQXXE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">kicking a zombie in the head after free falling from a rooftop</a></span> sounds like a thing you might want to do (and which I believe is possible in these games) boy have I got the series for you to pick up.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

One day, he looked up from his drawing and there was a girl in front of him who looked just like the one on his canvas. She called herself a ‘sinner’ who came to this town to repent for her sins. Yuuto and the townspeople welcomed the girl, Ai, to their town.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Come spring, the entrance ceremony was underway. The new students took pictures and videos in front of the school with their parents to commemorate this special day. However, it was a depressing event for Yuuto, who lives alone after the death of his father and the abandonment by his mother and older sister. While he had gotten used to it, this time he suddenly felt very lonely due to the recent passing of grandmother, the sole close relative he had left.</p><p>Upon finding out about Yuuto’s loneliness, Ai confided that she was abandoned by her parents. She searched for a reason for living, whereas he ran away from reality through his imaginative drawings. Even though they were polar opposites, their backgrounds also made them quite similar. Gradually, they became closer to each other, while harboring secrets of their own.</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">All eyes might have been on the Rev-8 land vehicle introduced to Starfield yesterday, but the update also provides another treat for the eyes. Bethesda Game Studios has revealed that Xbox Series X display settings are now matched on Series S. That means 60fps is available as an option on the smaller system.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1826009323342016643" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">On X</a>, Bethesda detailed the visual enhancements as part of Starfield's August update.

For instance, Starfield players can now select from 30, 40, 60, and uncapped fps options if they're using a VRR display. Meanwhile, others can choose either 30fps or 60fps, including on Xbox Series S.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Starfield now offers the ability to "prioritize between Visuals and Performance while trying to maintain the frame rate target," per Bethesda. While the developer recommends picking Performance for 60fps and above, players aren't forced to do so. Meanwhile, shallow puddles should now sport better reflections, too.</p><p dir="ltr">This August update follows <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/starfield-everything-new-in-the-june-update/2900-5461/#6" data-ref-id="2900-5461">the Starfield June update</a>, which introduced the Creations menu to the game alongside bounty boards and melee-weapon improvements.

The joystick is pitched as a wired companion to existing controllers, designed for people with "limited mobility."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It includes four button inputs on the front, a standard Xbox thumbstick, and two additional buttons that mimic the bumper and trigger placement on a traditional controller," explained Xbox in a blog post. "All these buttons are customizable, providing the flexibility to play in a way that’s most comfortable."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Elaborating on how it can be incorporated into different setups, Microsoft explained the joystick can be controlled via one hand, mounted via tabletops, or used with non-hand body parts. It can also be customized via button remapping or plugged directly into a console or PC to enable menu navigation and Nexus button functionality.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The joystick is slated to launch in "early 2025" and is flanked by other accessibility devices and accessories including new 3D printable files for adaptive thumbstick toppers–which have been released through Xbox Design Lab.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We’ve listened to players express a need to have more options for thumbstick toppers to customize their play," reads the blog.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/early-access-for-titan-quest-ii-set-for-winter-2024-2025/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, THQ Nordic announced that Early Access for Titan Quest II is on the horizon. It will be available to interested players in the Winter of 2024/2025. This title is being developed by Grimlore Games, known for detailed fantasy games such as SpellForce 3 and Titan Quest II.</p>
<p>This game will allow players to dive into a deep world of fantasy, where they experience what it means to rival a God. The first Titan Quest game was released in 2006, and it then received an anniversary edition of the game in 2016, merging both the Titan Quest game and Titan Quest Immortal Throne into one game.</p>
<p>THQ Nordic first announced Titan Quest II's development in August 2023. Players can dive into Early Access this coming Winter. There is no news on how much this upcoming ARPG will cost, but the game will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Whether Titan Quest II's Early Access will also be available on console hasn't been clarified, but it's safe to assume it'll be available on PC via Steam.</p>
<p>For those attending Gamescom 2024, attendees will be able to get a hands-on experience of Titan Quest II and some of the other games that THQ Nordic has to offer, such as the Gothic Remake. In addition, they are showcasing two unannounced games, with their announcements potentially happening during Gamescom week.</p>
<p>The developers of Titan Quest II have been making sure that those interested in the game are well-fed by releasing <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1154030" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple dev diaries</a> that deep-dive into subjects such as the Mythology surrounding the game, the music, world design, and more.</p>
<p>In Titan Quest II, you must take up <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-new-dev-diary-talks-about-looting-items-and-more/">your spear and fight</a> against Nemesis, the Goddess of Retribution. She has become out of control and is trying to change the Threads of Fate, punishing anyone who opposes her. It becomes your duty to fight back against her and team up with other Gods in the game to try and stop her and weave your fate alongside allies.</p>
<p>If Titan Quest II is shaping up to be something that you find yourself interested in, make sure to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1154030/Titan_Quest_II/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wishlist the game</a> on your platform of choice so that you can keep up with any announcements they make or any new dev diaries that they may release, giving you a glimpse into what to expect from this Greek Mythology-filled ARPG.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24225171/asus-wi-fi-7-gaming-router-rog-rapture-gt-be19000-rt-be86u-usb-be92-adapter-windows-laptop<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Asus announced <a href="https://press.asus.com/news/press-releases/asus-wifi-7-devices-gamescom-2024/">three new Wi-Fi 7 products</a> today, including a tri-band ROG Rapture GT gaming router, a dual-band router, and a new Wi-Fi 7 USB adapter.</p><p>The <a href="https://rog.asus.com/networking/rog-rapture-gt-be19000/">ROG Rapture GT-BE19000</a> has a familiar ’80s retro-future look shared by predecessors like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/1/23745096/i-have-never-been-so-convinced-that-a-router-was-going-to-come-alive-and-murder-me">quad-band GT-BE98</a>, along with most of the same specs, including two 10Gbps and five 2.5Gbps ethernet ports. It also supports 320MHz channel bandwidth on the 6GHz band, which unlocks much higher throughput (although you’ll need a 2Gbps or higher connection to your ISP for that to shine). </p><div><figcaption><em>The ROG Rapture GT-BE19000 has seven ethernet ports.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Asus</cite></p></div><p>Since the GT-BE19000 uses Wi-Fi 7’s multilink operation feature, you<strong> </strong>can connect a supported device to<strong> </strong>the 6GHz and 5GHz band at the same time for increased throughput, less latency, and more stability. </p><p>Asus’ other new router is the comparatively modest dual-band <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.asus.com%2Fnetworking-iot-servers%2Fwifi-routers%2Fasus-wifi-routers%2Frt-be86u%2F">RT-BE86U</a>. It’s Wi-Fi 7, so it can support multilink operation across the 2.4GHz and 5Ghz bands. It also has a 10Gbps WAN port for connecting to your modem or fiber ONT, along with four 2.5Gbps ethernet ports for wiring up your gaming PC and whatnot.</p><div><div><figcaption><em>The RT-86U, a dual-band Wi-Fi 7 router.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Asus</cite></p></div><div><figcaption><em>Stick this in your PC and download with it.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Asus</cite></p></div></div><p>Finally, Asus announced the <a href="https://rog.asus.com/networking/rog-usb-be92/spec/">ROG USB-BE92</a>, an external USB Wi-Fi 7 card. It connects using USB-A or USB-C, and Asus says it should work with Windows 10 or 11 PCs out of the box — just plug it in and go. It’s an easy way to add Wi-Fi 7 to a computer once you’ve upgraded to a Wi-Fi 7 router, unlocking features like MLO for better stability and faster throughput. </p><p>Asus didn’t announce any release dates or prices for these devices. </p><div><p><h4><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23902812/wi-fi-7-explained">What is Wi-Fi 7</a>?</h4></p><p>Wi-Fi 7 is the next version of Wi-Fi to follow Wi-Fi 6E. Like Wi-Fi 6E, the protocol works on the 2.4GHz, 5GHz, and 6GHz bands, and it’s backward-compatible with devices that precede it. Wi-Fi 7 promises higher throughput, with features like 320MHz channel bandwidth (twice what’s offered on Wi-Fi 6E), Multi-Link Operation (which combines bands into one for greater throughput and more stability), and improved interference handling.</p><p>More Wi-Fi 7 routers have hit the market and prices are beginning to come down, though it’s still early days. Even if your devices don’t support it yet, you may benefit from Wi-Fi 7 mesh systems, which will be able to take advantage of the features listed above for faster, more stable wireless backhaul connections between nodes.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As the name suggests, they are machine gun turrets that lock onto enemies. This weapon is great for whenever you find yourself fighting more than one person at a time, because it helps take some of the pressure off. It’s your little shooty buddy.<br></p><h2 id="h11293"><a id=""></a><strong>Captain America’s Shield</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="06e5ce0de18a839b007435ce2e2b5aa5" data-recommend-id="image://06e5ce0de18a839b007435ce2e2b5aa5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cap's shield." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cap's shield." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="06e5ce0de18a839b007435ce2e2b5aa5" data-recommend-id="image://06e5ce0de18a839b007435ce2e2b5aa5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cap's shield." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The shield can be used in two different ways. The first is throwing it at your enemies, because apparently you’re worthy of picking it up. Once you throw the shield, it’ll bounce off various objects and hit whatever is next to it before returning to you. The other use is the more traditional shield fare of blocking incoming damage.<br></p><h2 id="h11294"><a id=""></a><strong>Doom’s Arcane Gauntlets</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="158358d0104f964bb7c757a6c1c990cf" data-recommend-id="image://158358d0104f964bb7c757a6c1c990cf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Doom's gauntlets." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Doom's gauntlets." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="158358d0104f964bb7c757a6c1c990cf" data-recommend-id="image://158358d0104f964bb7c757a6c1c990cf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Doom's gauntlets." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Doom’s Arcane Gauntlets are similar to the Magneto Power from last season, in the sense that they throw projectiles at enemies. Its main attack lets you shoot arcane energy at enemies, but it’s mainly meant to be used in close quarters. Its secondary attack will launch you into the air and shoot a massive beam covering the immediate area.</p><h2 id="h11295"><a id=""></a><strong>Dual Micro SMGs</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="2a4119431efe3ddb2c7c5748511ef977" data-recommend-id="image://2a4119431efe3ddb2c7c5748511ef977" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dual micro SMGs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dual micro SMGs." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2a4119431efe3ddb2c7c5748511ef977" data-recommend-id="image://2a4119431efe3ddb2c7c5748511ef977" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Dual micro SMGs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Dual Micro SMGs are fairly simple to understand. As the name suggests, they’re two Micro SMGs that excel in close-quarter combat. But be careful, because it can be easy to blow through ammo.</p><h2 id="h11296"><a id=""></a><strong>Hover Jets</strong></h2><p>The Hover Jets are a part of the War Machine gear. These don’t inflict any type of damage at all. Instead, they allow you to fly up in the air for a short period of time, which is great for getting the upper hand on enemies when you’re trying to get the high ground.</p><h2 id="h11297"><a id=""></a><strong>Monarch Pistol</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="ef103233aa8bff42bea7e5591a555715" data-recommend-id="image://ef103233aa8bff42bea7e5591a555715" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Monarch pistol." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Monarch pistol." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ef103233aa8bff42bea7e5591a555715" data-recommend-id="image://ef103233aa8bff42bea7e5591a555715" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Monarch pistol." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Monarch Pistol is a weapon that Doom drops once he’s killed.

<p>Everyone loves a good gaming mouse. While everyone has their own specific needs when it comes to gaming mice and what works for them, there are still a few mice that are superior to all others. So, what is the best gaming mouse?</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-best-gaming-mouse">What Is The Best Gaming Mouse?</h2>



<p>A lot of factors are involved when determining the best gaming mouse. You have weight to factor in. You have the number of buttons to look at. Some mice have better durability than others. There are so many different aspects to look at when figuring out whether a mouse is worth it or not.</p>



<p>So, which mouse is the most worth it?</p>



<h3 id="h-the-best-gaming-mouse-glorious-model-o-wireless-mouse">The Best Gaming Mouse: Glorious Model O Wireless Mouse</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Glorious Model O Wireless Mouse is easily our number-one pick for the best gaming mouse on the market. This honeycomb-styled mouse is perfect with its medium-size and lightweight features. </p>



<p>The Glorious Model O Wireless is currently only <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Glorious-Model-Wireless-Gaming-Mouse/dp/B098RDJZFM/ref=asc_df_B098RDJZFM/?tag=hyprod-20&amp;linkCode=df0&amp;hvadid=692875362841&amp;hvpos=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=7951794455995394899&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=&amp;hvdev=c&amp;hvdvcmdl=&amp;hvlocint=&amp;hvlocphy=9007527&amp;hvtargid=pla-2281435179098&amp;psc=1&amp;mcid=89315b41c9533e3eb5ad0740c338c87e&amp;hvocijid=7951794455995394899-B098RDJZFM-&amp;hvexpln=73&amp;gad_source=1">$59.99 USD on Amazon</a>, making it extremely affordable. The mouse is 69 grams, which is incredibly light compared to many other mice on the market. This helps with reaction time and speed when gaming.</p>



<p>Despite it being incredibly light, it is still extremely durable, allowing the mouse to last for years. </p>







<h3>How Many Buttons</h3>



<p>The Glorious Model O Wireless Mouse has five buttons. There are two side buttons, the typical left and right click buttons and a DPI control button. For gamers, all you need are the main four buttons. </p>



<p>The mouse being wireless is also an incredible feature, too, as you never have to worry about your cord getting snagged on your keyboard or desk. Still, you can purchase the same mouse with a cord for cheaper, if you would like. The non-wireless version of the Glorious Model O is still much better than many other mice on the market.</p>



<h3>Additional Gaming Mice</h3>

<ul>
<li>HyperX Pulsefire Haste</li>



<li>SteelSeries Aerox 3 Super Light</li>



<li>Logitech G502</li>

<p>Microsoft has announced it is releasing a new Xbox Adaptive Joystick to make gaming even more accessible for players. </p>



<p>Releasing in early 2025 for $29.99, the Xbox Adaptive Joystick will allow players to use it as a stand alone controller or add it to the Xbox Adaptive Controller for a “full adaptive setup”.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Introducing the Xbox Adaptive Joystick" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wkXO8MeX7vA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>“Through years of research, testing and collaboration with players with disabilities, and accessibility experts, we designed the&nbsp;Xbox Adaptive Joystick<strong>&nbsp;</strong>as a wired companion to Xbox controllers, specifically for players with limited mobility,” Xbox’s <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/08/21/xbox-accessibility-adaptive-joystick-thumbstick-toppers/?ocid=Accessories_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Link_lrn_8.21.2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gaming Accessibility Team said</a>.</p>



<p>Other features of the new joystick include the ability to link it with an Xbox controller using Xbox Controller Assist, complete button remapping with multiple profiles, and the ability to be mounted to “any ¼”-20 threaded mount equipment.”</p>



<p>The Xbox Adaptive Joystick itself features four buttons on the front, an Xbox thumbstick and two buttons at the top that act as the bumper and trigger of the controller.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-more-accessibility-options-from-xbox">More Accessibility Options From Xbox</h2>



<p>In addition to the Xbox Adaptive Joystick, Microsoft is offering even more accessibility options to make sure players can enjoy their games no matter what. </p>



<p>First are new 3D printable files for adaptive thumbstick toppers. The six new designs include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Plate-shaped thumbstick topper:</strong>&nbsp;Provides a shallow, indented surface helpful for operating sticks with larger body parts, like the chin.</li>



<li><strong>Dome-shaped thumbstick topper:</strong>&nbsp;Features a rounded, convex surface designed to accommodate various grip strengths or dexterity levels.</li>



<li><strong>Stick-shaped thumbstick topper:</strong>&nbsp;Offers a narrow cylindrical grip, increasing height and leverage to reduce the force needed to operate the stick.</li>



<li><strong>Pull thumbstick topper:</strong>&nbsp;Provides a deep, bowl-shaped surface that surrounds a thumb, finger, or similar object, reducing the pressure required.</li>



<li><strong>Sphere-shaped thumbstick topper:</strong>&nbsp;Presents a smooth, rounded, ball-shaped surface to support alternative ways of operating a thumbstick, such as grasping it.</li>



<li><strong>Custom thumbstick topper:</strong>&nbsp;Allows players to create their own shape with increased adhesion for shapable materials like clay or moldable plastic, enabling them to make and affix any shape that works best.</li>
</ul>



<p>The next new offering is the new 8BitDo Lite SE 2.4G Wireless Controller, which was designed “specifically for gamers with limited mobility.”</p>



<p>“It features low-resistance buttons and highly sensitive Hall Effect joysticks, making it easier for everyone to play,” Xbox says. “All&nbsp;buttons are conveniently accessible on the top of the controller, and it even has a non-slip silicone mat to keep it steady while gaming.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Lastly, ByoWave is releasing the ByoWave Proteus Controller after four years of development. Retailing at $299, the Proteus is a modular controller with a number of combinations.</p>



<p>“The Proteus Controller comes with “snap and play” parts and is all about personalized customization,” they said. “With its modular design, players can tweak their controller setup to match their unique play style, physical needs, and game preferences with over 100 million different combinations.”</p>

In June, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-announced-confirmed-for-ps5-xbox-games-showcase-2024">Microsoft announced Id Software's upcoming Doom: The Dark Ages will also launch on PS5</a> next year.</p><p>During a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/L1Qd1cFr9VY?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft gamescom 2024 livestream</a>, Xbox chief Phil Spencer responded to a question specifically about the decision to bring Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on PS5 and what it means for other upcoming new Xbox releases. Responding, Spencer pointed to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-rares-sea-of-thieves-tops-the-ps5-sales-chart-whats-the-next-xbox-game-to-go-multiplatform">the apparently successful release of the four Xbox games on non-Xbox platforms</a> and the boost they’ve enjoyed by going multi-platform.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle - Gamescom 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>“Our franchises are getting stronger. Our Xbox console players are as high this year as they’ve ever been,” Spencer said. “So I look at it and I say, okay, our player numbers are going up for the console platform. Our franchises are as strong as they’ve ever been.”</p><p>Crucially, Spencer added that Xbox’s multi-platform push is in part about bringing in more money to Microsoft’s gaming business — with the pressure now on to deliver following Microsoft’s eye-watering $69 billion acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard last year.</p><p>“And we run a business,” Spencer said. “It’s definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company. Because we get a level of support from the company that’s just amazing and what we’re able to go do.</p><p>“So I look at this, how can we make our games as strong as possible? Our platform continues to grow, on console, on PC, and on cloud. It’s just going to be a strategy that works for us.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/spencer-1724249575303.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Xbox boss Phil Spencer speaking at gamescom 2024. Image credit: Microsoft.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Spencer’s comments come amid a tumultuous time for Xbox that has seen <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">1,900 staff cut from the gaming business</a> this year and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">multiple studio closures</a>. All the while, sales of Xbox Series X and S have fallen dramatically, Xbox Game Pass growth has stalled, and Microsoft faces a backlash from hardcore Xbox players about its potentially wavering commitment to exclusives and the console business.</p><p>Perhaps addressing those concerns, Spencer said fans need to get used to Microsoft’s new way of thinking around the games it makes. Xbox, Spencer said, is trying to grow, and it very much sounds like making Xbox console exclusives is not how the company plans to achieve that going forward.</p><p>“The last thing I’ll say, as an industry right now, there’s a lot of pressure on the industry,” Spencer said. “It’s been growing for a long time and now people are looking for ways to grow. Us as fans, as players of games, we just have to anticipate there’s going to be more change in how some of the traditional ways that games were built and distributed, that’s going to change. That’s going to change for all of us. But the end result has to be better games that more people can play. If we’re not focused on that, I think we’re focused on the wrong things.</p><p>“So for us as Xbox, health of Xbox, health of our platform, and our growing games, most important things.”</p><p>The question now is, what other upcoming Xbox exclusives will also make the jump to PS5? Will Obsidian's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>? Will The Coalition's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War: E-Day</a>?

                <p>Cheating is an ongoing problem in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/apex-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-492612">Apex Legends</a> and one that--from the outside looking in--feels like an issue that's gone unaddressed for dozens of seasons now. It's a tricky situation for the Apex Legends team. On one hand, if the team tells players how it's actively getting rid of cheating players or bots, then the team shows its hand and subsequently makes all of Apex Legends' safeguards that much easier to get around. But on the other, saying nothing makes it seem like the team is actively ignoring player concerns. For a while now, the Apex Legends team has opted for the second approach, seemingly believing it the better of two imperfect strategies. Going forward, however, the team is going to try to thread the needle between both strategies.</p><p dir="ltr">Ahead of the release of a blog post that goes into how the Apex Legends team has contended with cheaters in the past and breaks down the anti-cheat takeaways for this past June and July, Electronic Arts head of product and studio integrated communications Tracey Thompson spoke to me about the philosophy behind this change in strategy.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"EA Entertainment is sort of looking at the landscape of where we are," Thompson told me. "And obviously as you know, there is the narrative around cheaters in Apex and being afraid to play the game means that this is a very acute problem that's ongoing and isn't necessarily the most easy to tackle."</p><p dir="ltr">Most of all, Thompson continued, EA and Respawn hope that players see that the team behind Apex Legends already knows there's been a lack of transparency when it comes to the implemented anti-cheat strategies in Apex Legends. That sentiment was "an important part" of putting together the blog. In the blog itself, the Apex Legends team notes that more than six million accounts have been banned since Apex Legends' launch in February 2019, with a little over 100,000 accounts banned each month on average. In June and July 2024, these bans were overwhelmingly permanent and most were imposed for cheating as opposed to bots.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4354056-june2024banreport.png" data-ref-id="1300-4354056" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4354056-june2024banreport.png" data-ref-id="1300-4354056"></a><figcaption>Far more permanent than temporary bans in Apex Legends the past few months.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4354056-june2024banreport.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We know that we need to tell you more," Thompson added. "We want to really kick things off with sharing what we have been doing and then knowing that it needs to be more... [We acknowledge] that this may not be as meaty as people would like, but I do think that in sharing this with you...[it sets] an expectation with [players] that we know that there's way more that we have to do."</p><p dir="ltr">While talking with Thompson, she reiterated that this blog post is merely the "first of many" to come and that fans shouldn't be worried that this one post will be Apex Legends' one-and-done response. "Over time, we're going to actually start to open the aperture to give people more and more without actually giving away the secrets that people could then circumvent," she said.</p><p dir="ltr">In a follow-up email to the PR team, I asked if Respawn had an idea concerning the cadence of players getting updates like this blog post. Would players hear more during seasonal updates? Once a year during the annual birthday celebration? Every other month?</p><p dir="ltr">In response, the Apex Legends team emailed the following statement: "We want each of these updates to be meaningful so that will guide us on the cadence. However, we won't always wait for a blog. If we want to share something in the moment that we feel is a win or a smaller update, we'll do that through social [media], community platforms, etc."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4354057-s5_loba2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4354057" data-ratio="0.54248810333107" data-width="1471" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4354057-s5_loba2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4354057"></a><figcaption>Squashing cheaters is a never-ending battle.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4354057-s5_loba2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">As someone who plays Apex Legends fairly regularly and has been covering every season for GameSpot since Season 3, I'm curious to see the dev team's follow-up to this initial blog. From day one, the Apex Legends team has firmly remained in the "We don't really talk about it" camp when it came to its anti-cheating strategies. And this was to, again, avoid cheaters learning what to circumvent. It feels a little strange to see the team shift the pendulum in the other direction after all this time, even if it's only to aim for a middle ground. What can the team share that was too difficult to share before? But like anything when it comes to a live-service game, we'll just have to wait and see.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/apex-legends-season-22-patch-notes-new-lmg-gun-shield-refreshing-loot-and-controller-recon-buffs/2900-5659/" data-ref-id="2900-5659">Apex Legends Season 22</a> is in full swing.

            <p>Xbox boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> has addressed the surprise revelation that first-party exclusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-everything-we-know-9408">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">release on PS5 in spring/Q2 2025</a> just a few months after its Xbox debut, stating Xbox is "a business", and that "the bar is high in terms of the delivery we have to give back" to parent company Microsoft.</p>
<p>In an in-house interview with Xbox On, Spencer was not directly challenged about the decision to release Indiana Jones on PS5 so soon after its December Xbox debut, only insisted that, at that time, Xbox was "gonna learn" and "watch", and "from our learning, we're gonna do more".</p>
<p>At that time, Spencer explicitly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-xbox-exclusive-games-heading-to-ps5-and-switch-according-to-phil-spencer">said that neither Starfield nor Indiana Jones and the Great Circle were one of the four games tipped to come to PS5</a>, and whilst that's true - Indiana Jones was <em>not</em> one of the four games mentioned; it's actually the fifth - some fans have taken issue with Spencer's framing of the issue.</p>

<p>"Obviously, last spring we launched four games, two of them on the Switch, four of them on PlayStation, and we said we were gonna learn," Spencer said. "We said we'd watch. I think at Showcase, I might have said, from our learning, we're gonna do more.</p>
<p>"What I see when I look is: our franchises are getting stronger. Our Xbox console players are as high this year as they've ever been. I look at it, and I say, okay: our player numbers are going up for the console platform. Our franchises are as strong as they've ever been. And we run a business.</p>

<p>"It's definitely true inside of Microsoft, the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company, 'cause we get a level of support from the company that's just amazing, what we're able to go do," he added.</p>
<p>"So I look at this, how can we make our games as strong as possible? Our platform continues to grow both on console, on PC, and on Cloud, and I think it's just going to be a strategy that works for us.</p>
<p>"The last thing I'll probably say is that I think there's a lot of pressure on the industry. It's been growing for a long time, and now people are looking for ways to grow.</p>
<p>"I think us - as fans, as players of games - we just have to anticipate there's going be more change, and how some of the traditional ways that games are built and distributed - that's gonna change. That's gonna change for all of us. But the end result has to be better games that more people can play. If we're not focused on that, I think we're focused on the wrong things. So for us at Xbox - health of Xbox, health of our platform, and our growing games are the most important things."</p>
<p>Reports that Microsoft was preparing to release a number of first-party games on competing consoles <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-xbox-exclusive-games-heading-to-ps5-and-switch-according-to-phil-spencer">first surfaced at the start of this year</a>, but it wasn't until claims that high-profile exclusives such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle would also be going multiplatform that Microsoft broke its silence.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The three new Xbox console variants were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-reveals-three-new-xbox-console-variants">initially revealed back in June</a>. At this time, Microsoft merely said they would be available at the end of the year, with no further specifics.</p>
<p>That was, until today, when Microsoft confirmed the three new Xbox Series X/S console options will be released on 15th October, with select countries then following on 29th October.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/okomotive-panic-unveils-their-new-adventure-title-herdling-offering-gamers-one-of-a-kind-herding-experience/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Okomotive, the developer behind <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/far-lone-sails-hope-never-truly-lost/">the FAR series</a>, has revealed its brand <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3047750/Herdling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new adventure title</a>,&nbsp; Herdling, providing gamers with a brand new adventure.</p>
<p>Okomotive &amp; Panic are set to debut Herdling in the realm of gaming. The title revolves around the adventure of making an expedition with "a herd of loveable beasts," encountering several mysteries and surprising obstacles in the journey to reach a mystery on the summit. According to developers, the main idea behind Herdling is to provide gamers with an immersive experience that is relatable not just to the users but to the actual creators themselves. Here's how representatives from both Okomotive &amp; Panic express their optimism towards the upcoming title:</p>
<p>"With Herdling we wanted to start a new kind of adventure, not only for the players, but also for us. To create the herd of beasts and their mountainous world was an ambitious challenge for us, and we enjoyed every step of that journey," said Co-Founders Don Schmocker and Goran Saric.</p>
<p>Nick Suttner, Panic's Director of Publishing, also stated: "The FAR games are moody, moving masterpieces as far as we're concerned, so we couldn’t be more thrilled to work with Okomotive on their brand-new adventure. Herdling feels like a return to the scale and fidelity of something like Firewatch for us, so it’s really exciting to have it in our lineup. We’re huge fans of games like Inside and The Last Guardian - stirring, solo adventures that really communicate a sense of awe, loneliness, and a particular brand of companionship."</p>
<p><em>-Nick Suttner, Panic’s Director of Publishing.</em></p>
<p>Okomotive's newest title surely has fans waiting out, given the initial glimpses that show that the "herding" experience has gotten a lot more enticing. Here is how Herdling is expected to play out for fans:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>&nbsp;Guide, protect, and fall in love with a motley herd of Calicorns</em></li>
<li><em>Traverse stunning mountainscapes, fog-wreathed forests, snowy plateaus, and forgotten valleys</em></li>
<li><em>Hone your herding skills as you navigate a wide range of challenges, threats, and light</em><br>
<em>environmental puzzles</em></li>
<li><em>Feel the rush of the mountain air alongside your herd in exhilarating stampede sequences</em></li>
<li><em>An emotional, wordless tale of trust, survival, and companionship during a great crossing</em><br>
<em>through a fallen world</em></li>
</ul>
<p>In terms of the release of the title, Okomotive x Panic is expected to showcase the behind-the-scenes look at the Panic Games Showcase, which is set to be held by August 27, with first-hand playable demos to be held at PAX West 2024. Herdling will debut on PC and consoles by 2025, but we haven't gotten an exact launch date yet.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-hits-2-3-million-concurrent-players-at-steam-surpassing-cyberpunk-2077-elden-ring/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-hits-2-3-million-concurrent-players-at-steam-surpassing-cyberpunk-2077-elden-ring/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Black Myth: Wukong, the title that has taken the industry by storm, has now broken records for Steam concurrent viewers, reaching its all-time peak.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong has become a favorite in the industry. Just within a few hours of launch, the title has managed to hit 2.22 million concurrent players on Steam, the highest for a single-player title ever on the platform, beating the likes of Counter Strike-2, Dota 2, Elden Ring, and Cyberpunk 2077. Given that this number is limited to players on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358720/Black_Myth_Wukong/?snr=1_4_4__118" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam only</a>, it's imminent that the overall figures will be much higher.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>This is shocking for the industry, given that the hype around Black Myth: Wukong pre-launch wasn't that massive for it to be translated into such figures. But the gaming industry has its ways, and we might have an idea about the turn-out of the title. Black Myth: Wukong is highly popular in Eastern regions, particularly in China, and given the population the nation holds, we believe that 2.22 million players aren't the actual peak, and there's still a lot to happen.</p>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">How China-specific is interest in Black Myth: Wukong? A lot: <a href="https://twitter.com/gamediscoverco?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GameDiscoverCo</a>'s current estimate of its Steam country split for players is 88.1% China, 3% U.S., 1.6% Hong Kong, 1% Japan. <a href="https://t.co/FeAFn85NBH">pic.twitter.com/FeAFn85NBH</a></p>
<p>— Simon Carless (@simoncarless) <a href="https://twitter.com/simoncarless/status/1825818693751779449?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>An estimate by GameDiscoverCo shows that around 88.1% of Black Myth: Wukong's share is owned by China, while other nations such as the US, Hong Kong, and Japan hold a lesser portion. This shows that Chinese influence is indeed playing its part in the viewership of Black Myth: Wukong, and by the looks of it, the viewership figures are expected to skyrocket from hereon, too.</p>
<p>For those unaware, Black Myth: Wukong is a title which seeks to combine rich storytelling with stunning visuals and a unique take on the action RPG formula, putting players on a journey to discove ancient Chinese mythology, breathtaking landscapes, and a diverse cast of memorable characters based on their novel Journey to the West. The close attachment of the title to Chinese cultures and traditions is one of the main reasons why there has been a massive portion of players from the region. Along with that, the in-game mechanics and the visually stunning staff-based melee combat system have elevated the title's experience to new levels.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">review of&nbsp;</a><span><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Myth: Wukong</a> also showed that the title "couldn't have been a better debut for Game Science." The game has received a Metacritic average score of 82, showing that in terms of the overall experience, it is undoubtedly something to savor and something gamers should look forward to.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Just Six of Yesterday's Gamescom Announcements Are Confirmed for Switch]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamescom-onl-2024-switch</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/just-six-of-yesterdays-gamescom-announcements-are-confirmed-for-switch.959658/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamescom-onl-2024-switch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>An eagle-eyed observer has noted that of the 62 announcements and reveals featured during yesterday's Gamescom Opening Night Live show, just six are definitely coming to Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>As noted by <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/of-all-the-62-games-featured-at-the-gamescom-opening-night-live-only-7-games-are-available-or-will-be-available-on-switch.959187/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ResetEra user BY2K</a>, 62 announcements were made during Gamescom, of which some were new games, some were expansions or updates for existing games, and some were release date trailers or launch trailers for games we already knew about.</p>
<p>Just six of those announcements were for games that are either already on Nintendo Switch or are coming to the console at some point in the future, BY2K notes. One of them, HoYoverse's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-50-release-date">soon-to-be-updated</a>&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>, has a very uncertain future indeed on Nintendo's console.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nikoderiko-nintendo-switch-gamescom-announcements.jpg?itok=S8Dpe33v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nikoderiko-nintendo-switch-gamescom-announcements.jpg?itok=lBupvOuK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Colorful platformer&nbsp;<em>Nikoderiko: The Magical World&nbsp;</em>is one of just six Gamescom ONL 2024 games definitely coming to Switch.</figcaption></figure><p>Here's the full list of confirmed Switch releases from last night's Gamescom presentation in all its glory.</p>
<ul><li><em>Dave the Diver</em>'s upcoming crossovers (with&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/potion-craft-alchemist-simulator"><em>Potion Craft</em></a>, and YouTuber mxmtoon)</li>
<li><em>Nikoderiko: The Magical World</em></li>
<li><em>King of Meat</em></li>
<li><em>Sid Meier's Civilization 7</em></li>
<li><em>Little Nightmares 3</em></li>
<li><em>Floatopia</em></li>
</ul><p>BY2K's list also includes&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>as a "maybe", but even if we include that game, seven out of 62 announcements isn't the best look for the machine that is still Nintendo's only current console on the market.</p>
<p>Many of these games are titles we already knew weren't on Switch, like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/naraka-bladepoint"><em>Naraka: Bladepoint</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/black-myth-wukong"><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/street-fighter-6"><em>Street Fighter 6</em></a>, to name but a few. For others, it's not surprising they're missing the Switch;&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred&nbsp;</em>was hardly going to appear on Nintendo's console when&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4&nbsp;</em>doesn't.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-gamescom-announcements-switch.jpg?itok=9GhIqfMP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-gamescom-announcements-switch.jpg?itok=T_ZXc3R3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some of yesterday's Gamescom announcements were guaranteed Switch no-shows, like&nbsp;<em>Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Still, the lack of Switch ports or versions for many of yesterday's Gamescom games arguably demonstrates that the need for Nintendo to make an announcement regarding the Switch's successor is growing more urgent.</p>
<p>Many of these games are likely skipping the Switch because it simply doesn't have the technical prowess to run them; it's hard to imagine&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong&nbsp;</em>running on a Switch, for instance.</p>
<p>Thankfully, Nintendo has pledged that it will reveal information about the Switch 2 (or whatever it ends up being called) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">before the end of this fiscal year</a>, which means we'll likely learn something between now and this coming April. Stay tuned for more.</p>
