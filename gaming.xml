			<p>Starfield will reportedly launch on PlayStation 5 sometime next year, along with the game's second expansion and some quality-of-life improvements.</p>



<p>According to what unspecified sources have told MP1st, the Xbox Series X|S console exclusive from Bethesda will not launch this year on PlayStation 5 as previously rumored, but only in 2026, in part due to the low sales of the first expansion, Shattered Space. At this time, Microsoft is leaning toward releasing Starfield during Spring 2026, together with the second yet-to-be-revealed expansiom and some quality of life improvements. The announcement timeline also doesn't seem to be clear, but it's unlikely the new version of the game will be revealed later this month during this year's Gamescom, nor will it be shadowdropped like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">Oblivion Remastered</a> earlier this year.</p>



<p>It's not really surprising to learn that Starfield: Shattered Space isn't selling well. While the expansion's tight narrative elements and its atmosphere that borders space horror are very well done, the expansion doesn't offer anything different from the base game. The asking price also doesn't help, as it is too high for what the expansion has to offer, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">review.</a></p>



<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S worldwide. Learn more about the base game in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">review</a>.</p>

			<p><strong>Update 01/08/2025:</strong> Though Nintendo stated it would wait until Sunday, August 3, 2025, to unveil the new prices for the Nintendo Switch and a few specific Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, it seems that the US retailer Target has let the cat out of the bag early.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-is-increasing-the-price-of-switch-in-the-us-this-weekend/">VGC</a>, according to <a href="https://www.target.com/s?searchTerm=nintendo+switch&amp;ignoreBrandExactness=true&amp;Nao=0&amp;facetedValue=551qz">Target's website</a>, the new prices for Nintendo Switch consoles have all increased by at least $30. The new prices are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Switch - $339.99 USD ($40 up from previous price)</li>



<li>Switch Lite - $229 USD ($30 up from previous price)</li>



<li>Switch OLED - $399 USD ($50 up from previous price)</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>



<p>Following a similar announcement at the end of June for <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/whatsnew/nintendo-switch-pricing-update/?srsltid=AfmBOorKwcamh1Em9gwHD9rlcQ7-SZ-YwKnhp8OmOX208TEZnYW1R9bQ">Canada</a>, Nintendo has <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/nintendo-switch-pricing-update/">announced </a>that it will change the price of the Nintendo Switch and its "<em>family of systems and products</em>," including the base Nintendo Switch, the Nintendo Switch OLED, Switch Lite, and accessories. Pricing for the Nintendo Switch 2, however, will stay the same for now, as will pricing for its peripherals and Nintendo Switch Online subscriptions.</p>



<p>Nintendo announced the news on its official website, with a short message that doesn't specifically say how the prices will be altered, but it's unfortunately doubtful that the prices will be decreased. Just as Nintendo did for its Canada announcement, Nintendo says these changes are being made "<em>based on market conditions</em>."</p>



<p>It's also clearly a price increase because while the US price changes will be announced in just a few days on August 3, 2025, Canadians had to wait from June 30, 2025, until today, to find out what the new prices would be. To no one's surprise, they're all price increases.</p>



<p>Before today, the price of a Nintendo Switch, Switch OLED, and Switch Lite in Canada was:</p>



<ul>
<li>Switch - $399 CAD</li>



<li>Switch Lite - $259 CAD</li>



<li>Switch OLED - $449 CAD</li>
</ul>



<p>Now, everything has been bumped up by at least $20, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/store/hardware/">the new prices are</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Switch - $419 CAD</li>



<li>Switch Lite - $279 CAD</li>



<li>Switch OLED - $489 CAD</li>
</ul>



<p>So expect the cost of getting a Nintendo Switch console in the US to be a little more expensive when these prices go live in a few days. As a reminder, here's what the Nintendo Switch family of systems costs in the US today, before the price increases:</p>



<ul>
<li>Switch - $299 USD</li>



<li>Switch Lite - $199 USD</li>



<li>Switch OLED - $349 USD</li>
</ul>



<p>Nintendo also clarified that while the Nintendo Switch 2 console and most of its peripherals would not be getting a price alteration, some Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, like the Alarmo clock and certain Amiibo, will get price adjustments. </p>



<p>Even though the Nintendo Switch 2 isn't getting a price change now, it's a little concerning that the previous generation is getting a price bump. The Switch 2 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-through-6-million-units/">selling extremely</a> well so far, but with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-increase-president/">tariffs</a> potentially behind these price increases, and the Switch 2 proving that players are hungry to jump from their eight-year-old Nintendo Switch console, it makes you wonder when Nintendo will pull the lever on increasing prices for the Switch 2.</p>



<p>In its statement on price changes coming after this weekend, after stipulating that Switch 2 prices are not impacted in the changes announced today, Nintendo says, "<em>However, please note that price adjustments may be necessary in the future."</em></p>

            <p>With unofficial Oblivion remake <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-oblivion-in-skyrim-mod-still-on-track-for-a-2025-release">aiming to arrive this year</a>, one of its developers has kicked off a new dev diary series documenting the work they've been doing to get the massive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-skyrim-mods">Skyrim mod</a> ready to emerge through the release gates.</p>
<p>While the folks behind Skyblivion certainly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-in-skyrim-mod-skyblivion-still-looks-stunning-in-latest-development-update">haven't been shy</a> when it comes to regularly showing off their progress, it's always cool to see more of the blood, sweat, and tears that's going into finally getting such a gargantuan undertaking into players' hands. Then again, maybe I'm just partial to trippy glimpses at Uriel Septim's detached head floating in the development void.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Finishing Skyblivion is the name YouTuber and Skyblivion implementation lead Heavy Burns has given to this series they've just released the first episode of, and it certainly delivers on said trippy glimpses right off the bat. You see, among the various bits and bobs documented in the video is putting the final touches on exported NPC head models the mod's artists have developed, to ensure they look as detailed as the mod's character creator will allow.</p>
<p>Cue shots of severed heads with glowing purple eye holes sitting in the great grey unknown, ready to have their brows, beards, and trims retextured so they look a bit more presentable. Among the characters getting makeovers here are the likes of the Dark Brotherhood's Lucien Lachance and emperor Uriel Septim himself. The fact that the devs have made the latter look exactly like his bald acting man Patrick Stewart definitely adds to the weirdness of the floaty bodylessness.</p>

<p>There are also a couple of bits that'll likely be of interest to youm regardless of whether you get as much of a giggle from the bizarre visuals afforded by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivion-devs-used-their-bethesda-visit-to-fight-the-good-fight-asking-todd-and-co-to-bring-back-skyrim-style-official-modding-tutorials">WIP mods</a> or games as I do. There are some nice looks at how Anvil and the Imperial City are shaping up, with Heavy Burns revealing that the latter's "the final part of the overworld that is yet to be finished" ahead of release.</p>
<p>There's also some statue installation in the realm of Oblivion you'll travel to as part of Boethiah's Daedric quest, and while it's still quite lava-filled, it's got plenty of nice touches to set it apart from Mehrunes Dagon's chambers of evil. Kerb-tweaking and sign-making are also covered, if you're interested in learning the ins-and-outs of some modding for yourself.</p>
<p>The YouTuber finishes up by teasing that Skyblivion's next full developer diary isn't too far away, with the project still looking for <a href="https://skyblivion.com/volunteer/">any volunteers</a> with the skills to help get it over the line.

            <p>
It's time for another bulletin from the exciting world of desexindexification. Itch.io have re-listed a bunch of free adult-themed games that were taken down as part of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-apologise-for-frustration-and-confusion-after-delisting-thousands-of-nsfw-projects">a recent massive cull of supposedly licentious materials</a> under pressure from payment processors. Itch are still, however, working out whether and how to restore paid NSFW projects that were removed from public channels as part of their efforts to stop the payment companies suspending store purchases in general. 
</p>
<p>
In a further mild twist, one of the firms behind Itch.io's delistings, Stripe, have now informed the site that they themselves are acting under pressure from one of their own banking partners, without naming names. They'd like "to support adult content in the future". Nonetheless, Itch are still looking for new payment partners who are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itchio-are-seeking-out-new-payment-processors-who-are-more-comfortable-with-adult-material">happier to process this kind of material</a>.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Itch.io's owner, Leaf Corcoran, announced the return of free NSFW projects to search results, browse pages and recommendations in <a href="https://itch.io/t/5149036/reindexing-adult-nsfw-content">a blog post today</a>.
</p>
<p>
To be eligible for re-indexing, your game must have the "no payments" option checked under the "pricing" section of your project's editing page on your dashboard. Leaf cautions that any "individually priced files" on that game will become free in the process, as Itch doesn't currently support the ability to have "owners only" stuff on a page configured to be fully free. The site's management are looking at adding new developer dashboard options to address this.
</p>
<p>
As for the paid games, Leaf writes that "we are still in ongoing discussions with payment processors and will be re-introducing paid content slowly to ensure we can confidently support the widest range of creators in the long term."
</p>
<p>
According to Leaf, Itch have had some relatively positive conversations lately with Stripe, a $91 billion corporation and one of the world's largest privately owned financial tech companies. The bad news is that Stripe have told Itch.io that they can no longer support payments for any "content designed for sexual gratification", perhaps the baggiest of recent efforts to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/itch-post-new-list-of-banned-nsfw-content-that-would-rule-out-certain-kojima-games-plus-goty-2024-mouthwashing">pin down the kind of adult content the payment processors object to</a>. They have also, however, passed along the below message to Itch.io's users:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Stripe is currently unable to support sexually explicit content due to restrictions placed on them by their banking partners, despite card networks generally supporting adult content (with the appropriate registrations). Stripe has indicated that they hope to be able to support adult content in the future.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Itch are still looking for other partners to handle payments for "adult NSFW content". Leaf defines the latter as follows: </p>
<blockquote><p>pages that have both the "Contains sensitive material" option checked and a tag suggesting adult content (e.g., "porn," "mature," "lewd," "erotic," "hentai," "fetish"). 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Regarding the recent paid game takedowns, Leaf says that "now that we have a more specific definition of what Stripe won't process, we may review that initial list for potential re-introduction", but that the long-term plan remains "to implement one or more new processors to avoid putting the platform at risk".
</p>
<p>Itch.io are not, of course, the only PC storefront to have taken an axe to their catalogue recently. Valve have also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-change-steams-rules-to-let-banks-and-credit-card-firms-prohibit-certain-kinds-of-adult-only-content">changed their policies</a> to give payment processors, banks and internet service providers more say over what constitutes unacceptable adult material on Steam. They've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-are-now-removing-a-bunch-of-sex-games-from-steam-to-keep-banks-and-card-companies-happy">delisted or removed some games as a consequence</a>, though nowhere near as many as Itch. You can read more about that and the pressure group who've claimed overall responsibility for the cull <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/anti-porn-group-who-tried-to-ban-gta-5-claim-credit-for-steams-sex-game-crackdown">here</a>.</p>
<p>I'm currently talking to some economists to build up more of a picture of the financial machinations that undergird this moral panic. I'll hopefully have more for you on that front next week. In the meantime, why not learn how to put on a condom in Emma Kidwell's <a href="https://emmkid.itch.io/well-this-is-awkward">Well This Is Awkward</a>, pictured above.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/major-payment-firm-behind-itch-adult-game-cull-say-they-themselves-face-restrictions-from-another-banking-firm]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>It’s fair to say that Nintendo’s had a pretty good few months. After just four days, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-sales-fastest-selling-console-ever-1851784293">the Switch 2 had sold 3.5 million units</a>, making it the most successful console launch of all time. <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250801e.pdf">Nintendo is now reporting</a> it sold just shy of six million Switch 2s in the system’s first month, along with 8.6 million games. Of those, an incredible 5.63 million are copies of<em> Mario Kart World</em>. Alongside that, the console company still sold a million new Switch 1s in three months, and over 24 million games for that system. All told, from April to June, the company made sales of 572 billion yen, or $3.8 billion. It’s good to be Nintendo right now.</p> <p>All those numbers take us up to the end of June, meaning there’s actually a whole other month of as-yet unreported Switch 2 sales to take into account, meaning that number is likely closer (by our estimate) to eight million, ahead of Nintendo’s expectations, and well on the way to the company’s goal of 15 million units by March 2026. And don’t forget, they’ve got 2025’s holiday season to come before then.</p> <p>Interestingly, digital sales were down over 13 percent on the same quarter last year, which Nintendo attributes to, er, “a decrease in sales of downloadable versions of packaged software.” Well, yeah, selling fewer digital games would certain explain the lower sales of digital games. Piercing insight. There was also a drop in what Nintendo calls “IP related business,” down 4.4 percent, which is explained by “a decrease in movie-related revenue.” That’s actually a pretty impressively small drop, given it’s two years since&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> was released.</p>

 <p><em>Mario Kart World</em>‘s sales of almost six million, in large part a consequence of the game being offered as a bundle with the Switch 2 itself, make it the most successful <em>Mario Kart</em> launch ever–that’s pretty stunning given there was no previously established userbase for the console. For context,&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart Wii</em> launched two years after the Wii came out, and sold an estimated 4.7 million copies in its first four months. <em>Mario Kart 7</em> was limited by the low sales of the 3DS, but <em>Mario Kart 8</em> had the reverse effect, causing people to finally buy the unloved Wii U, selling nearly 3 million copies in its first month. However, it only reached 8.5 million lifetime sales. <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe&nbsp;</em>on the Switch is still the big leader, with astonishing lifetime sales of over 64 million copies, but even that was slower out of the gates than <em>Mario Kart World</em>. That game took a year to get to nine million copies, meaning&nbsp;<em>World</em> is well on its way to smashing that number.</p> <p>It’s notable that given 5.82 million Switch 2s have been sold (and that’s sold to real people, rather than just shipped to stores), and 5.63 million copies of&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em>, that the game is almost ubiquitous among the console owners. That means people who didn’t opt for–or were unable to buy–the bundle have been buying a separate copy anyway. Yes, fair enough, it’s not like people were spoiled for choice when the Switch 2 launched, but it remains a remarkable number. It’ll be fascinating to see how&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> has sold, and even more fascinating to visit the alternate reality where Nintendo had that game ready for launch.</p>

3 inches and opens up to reveal a game room with a sofa, a tiny arcade cabinet, a CRT TV, and numerous decorations often found in game rooms. The items on the display shelves are a nice touch. Above the couch, you can display three game console boxes and a pair of minifigure-style statues. On the other side of the room above the TV, there's a sword mounted to the wall and what we can only assume is this guy's prized Lego Star Wars starship he spent a dozen hours building.</p><p>The room belongs to the "Gamer Minifigure," who has a five o'clock and shaggy hair. The set also comes with a tiny game controller for the minifigure to hold.</p><p>The arcade machine you're building here is called Space, a vertical shoot'-em-up for two players. When closed, the red and black cabinet looks appropriately retro thanks to its chunky proportions and several stickers. The marquee sticker has those classic block letters that make it look like each letter is a spaceship entering lightspeed, and the screen sticker has pixelated graphics.</p><p>If you insert coins in the slots on the front, they will fly back out through the coin return--just like when you tried to trick arcade cabinets into accepting pennies instead of quarters.</p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4541957-legoarcademachine.png" data-ref-id="1300-4541957" data-ratio="0.426" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4541957-legoarcademachine.png" data-ref-id="1300-4541957"></a><figcaption>Lego Arcade Machine 40805</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4541957-legoarcademachine.png"></figure><h2>Lego Video Game Hardware Building Sets</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-PAC-Man-Building-Replica-Nostalgic/dp/B0CGYQ2WJC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Icons: Pac-Man Arcade (2,651 pieces)</a> -- $270</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DX3J6MT7?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Game Boy (421 pieces)</a> -- $60 | Releases October 1</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Nintendo-Entertainment-Building-Creative/dp/B08FCW3SB7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Nintendo Entertainment System (2,646 pieces)</a> -- $330 | Retired, $270 MSRP</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Atari-Building-Adults-Pieces/dp/B01N9DA98E?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Icons: Atari 2600 (2,532 pieces)</a> -- $240 | Retired</li></ul><hr><p>If you like the idea of building an arcade machine out of Lego bricks, it's worth noting that Lego partnered with Bandai Namco back in 2023 to add Pac-Man to its Icons lineup. The 2,651-piece display model measures 12.5 x 10 x 7 inches and has a lot of really impressive features, including a four-way joystick, an illuminated coin slot, adjustable game score display, and a mechanical maze to simulate a round of Pac-Man. Buildable Pac-Man, Blinky, and Clyde figures can be attached to the top of the cabinet. There's also a separate miniature arcade with a tiny Pac-Man cabinet and a minifigure. Just don't show Mr. Gamer Minifigure the tiny cabinet, as he might try to move it to his game room. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-PAC-Man-Building-Replica-Nostalgic/dp/B0CGYQ2WJC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Icons: Pac-Man Arcade</a> is in stock at Amazon for $270.</p><p>In case you missed it during San Diego Comic-Con, Lego fully unveiled the highly anticipated replica of Nintendo's Game Boy. The 421-piece display model comes with two buildable cartridges, three swappable lenticular screens, and two stands. The <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DX3J6MT7?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Game Boy is available to preorder for $60</a> and releases October 1.

            <p>What a difference just a day or two can make. Earlier this week, indie developer Pere Albacar put out a social media post promising followers a free Steam code for his upcoming release Sands of Hope, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-hollow-knight-silksong-does-actually-get-an-announcement-today-this-dev-promises-to-give-away-at-least-32000-free-games">only if Team Cherry's highly anticipated sequel Hollow Knight: Silksong got an announcement during yesterday's Nintendo Direct</a>.</p>
<p>The post soon garnered a lot of attention online, attracting over 34k replies - which would have been a lot of free Steam codes! In the end, though, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">Silksong was once again a no show at yesterday's Direct</a>, but that didn't matter to Albacar. </p>
<p>"I was very nervous during the Direct... you can imagine," Albacar told Eurogamer with a laugh, adding his initial post "started as a joke and got out of control very quickly". The developer and Guateke Studios founder added he tried to answer comments for the first 20 or so minutes, but after that they very quickly "started coming in by the hundreds".</p>

<p>Things have calmed down a bit now, but even so, this week has done wonders for Albacar's own indie release, Sands of Hope, which in the last two days has been added to over 3000 wishlists and is now appearing on Steam's homepage in the Popular Upcoming list, all thanks to that one social media post.</p>

<p>Sands of Hope is set to release on 4th August, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2821450/Sands_of_Hope/">via Steam</a>. "Explore the sandy landscapes of Cydonia as you use your ancestral powers to build and attach magnetic cubes, find energy cores to restore the land's water flow and meet other villagers with the help of a loyal dog," reads the upcoming game's description (and, yes, you can pet the dog).</p>
<p>"I'm so grateful for the reception of Sands of Hope by the community," Albacar continued. "Some of the most repeated comments were 'Even if there's no Silksong, I will get Sands of Hope' and 'I didn't know about your game, but it looks great!'... We're a team of only two, with no publisher, so all this attention on our tiny game a few days before release could be game-changing."</p>
<p>Albacar has been developing games since 2018, and taught himself coding along with "all the dozens of skills needed to make a game solo or with a tiny team". Sands of Hope will be his commercial game, which he developed alongside his friend, Frankie. The duo has self-funded the project, with work on it starting in February last year.</p>
<p>"We had talks with many publishers, but the industry climate, and our plan to keep the development time short and release in 2025 made it very difficult to close a deal," Albacar said. "I believe that to survive as an indie in this time, you've to be very smart and efficient in the game you make and how long it takes to finish it with a good quality."</p>

<p>Albacar closed: "It's very risky to make an indie game, and we have to stand out with creative and innovative ideas that the big companies are not willing to make. And that's why I think we are seeing so many indie hits in recent years, gamers will always be waiting for new and fresh experiences."</p>
<p>A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3768120/Sands_of_Hope_Demo/">demo for Sands of Hope</a> was released earlier this year, and reviews for it are currently looking pretty good overall. "Lovely puzzle game, I like the visual style and the humour. Looking forward to the full release," reads one review from the demo. "This game is very promising," another added.</p>
<p>So, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-has-laid-out-its-gamescom-plans-and-they-include-a-playable-demo-of-hollow-knight-silksong">while we may not have Silksong just yet</a>, if you are looking for something to scratch that indie itch, Sands of Hope may be worth checking out.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/a-silksong-social-media-joke-could-be-game-changing-for-this-indie-developer-despite-direct-no-show]]></content:encoded>

This is "based on market conditions" (thanks to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lvdr2echyd2t">Wario64</a> for reposting!).</p>
<p>Price changes are coming to the Switch 1 consoles, some Switch 2 accessories, some amiibo, and the Alarmo, as well as some Switch 1 accessories. The Switch 2 console, Switch 2 games, and Nintendo Switch Online memberships will be unaffected for now.</p>
<p>This follows Nintendo of Canada's announcement in June that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/uh-oh-nintendos-seemingly-raising-a-whole-bunch-of-prices-in-canada">prices for Switch 1 will be increasing on 1st August</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067qznkwt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The amount of the increase hasn't been confirmed yet, but as it's coming this weekend, we won't have to wait long to find out. So, if you want a Switch 1... you probably should go out and grab one today.</p>
<p>Console price increases have been happening all across the industry over the past few months, with the PS5 and Xbox both announcing price hikes. There's still uncertainty surrounding tariffs from the current administration in the US given how frequently they're changing, so this might not be the last increase we see.</p>

              <p>The Nintendo Switch <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-zelda-botw-anniversary-1851767489">is over eight years old</a>. It’s never seen a price cut during that time. And now it’s actually about to get <em>more</em> expensive. On Friday, the<em> Mario</em> maker warned customers that the older gaming consoles and their accessories will see price changes in the U.S. “based on market conditions.”</p> <p>Video game consoles are supposed to get cheaper as time goes on, but this console generation has bucked that trend entirely. <a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-price-increase-may-2025-1851778615">The PS5 and Xbox Series X/S</a> are all more expensive now than when they launched, and the Switch is about to join them. And update on Nintendo’s website says the Switch ($300), Switch Lite ($200), and Switch OLED ($350) will all be impacted, but the Switch 2 ($450) will remain unchanged…for now. Its accessories, on the other hand, are also getting more expensive (<a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-united-states-tariffs-price-1851776753">the second price hike this year</a>).</p> <p>Here’s the full statement:</p> <div> <blockquote> <p>Pricing for the original&nbsp;<span>Nintendo Switch</span>&nbsp;family of systems and products will change in the United States based on market conditions, effective August 3, 2025. These include Nintendo Switch – OLED Model, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch Lite and select Nintendo Switch accessories.</p> </blockquote> </div> <blockquote> <p>Other Nintendo products, including certain Nintendo Switch 2 accessories, select amiibo, and the Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo, will also see adjustments.</p> </blockquote> <div> <blockquote> <p>Pricing for the&nbsp;<span>Nintendo Switch 2</span>&nbsp;system, physical and digital Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 games, as well as Nintendo Switch Online memberships, will remain unchanged at this time. However, please note that price adjustments may be necessary in the future.</p> </blockquote> </div> <p>Nintendo isn’t revealing what the actual price changes are yet. It’s also not blaming <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-pro-game-console-prices-tariffs-report-1851779765">President Trump’s trade war</a> directly, but increased tariffs on imports into the U.S. are no doubt partly to blame. <a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/07/further-modifying-the-reciprocal-tariff-rates/">The most recent update from the White House lists</a> import taxes of 20 percent on Vietnam, 30 percent on China, and 15 percent on Japan. Depending on just how much more expensive the old Switch consoles become, it could make upgrading to the Switch 2 instead that much more appealing this fall. At least until that also gets more expensive. The company makes clear that more “price adjustments,” i.e. “price increases,” are on the table moving forward.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I’ve had a lazy week. Not in terms of juggling childcare and work through the school holidays, but in my gaming. First, I’ve been reviewing the slow-paced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/28/tales-of-the-shire-a-lord-of-the-rings-game-review/">Tales of the Shire</a>, quietly enjoying being a Hobbit and making meals to enchant the townsfolk. After that, I went straight into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/30/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-preview/">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a>, beginning the careful task of farming, trading and finding a wife while working with gaming’s cutest cows. I have played a couple of things to raise the heart rate – though they were mainly on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/playdate-2025-review-a-handheld-hero-thats-in-love-with-gaming/">Panic’s Playdate</a>, which I’ve made a regular stop-off on my weekly gaming.</p>

<p>First up this week was <strong>Jason</strong>, who polished off some more Monster Train 2, fully unlocking the clans and then beating the titans down as well. He also told us, “I’ve also been playing Final Fantasy XV, which I’m really enjoying revisiting.” Which is only right, because it’s the best Final Fantasy since XIV and before XVI.</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> played Neverwinter Nights 2 and Peglin for review, as well as some Animal Crossing, Burnout Paradise and a bit of Planet Zoo, while Ade played the superb bullet-heaven Achilles Survivor for review, saying, “it’s great fun!” He continued, “I’ve also been on with Doom: The Dark Ages which is fantastic, maybe my favourite of the modern Dooms, though I’ll need to reach the end to know for sure. Finally, I played the demo for Shinobi: Art of Vengeance so so good, roll on release day!”</p>
<p><strong>Laura</strong> has been playing the Fantasy DLC for Two Point: Museum. She says, “It’s been great to have an excuse to revisit my favourite Two Point game (as if I needed an excuse!). I’ve also been playing more of Islanders: New Shores – did I mention it was addictively relaxing?”</p>

<p>It should tell you everything about the latest expansion that <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has given up on Destiny 2, swapping in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/28/killing-floor-3-review/">Killing Floor 3</a> and Helldivers 2 instead.</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> has been playing a lot of games for review, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-platforming-perfection/">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a> being the pick of the lot, but Heartworm and One-Eyed Lokhi aren’t far behind. He told us, “I’m near the end of the surprisingly emotional Chibi-Robo like Misc: A Tiny Tale and enjoyed the first few hours of Wuchang once I got the performance stable on PC. Add in a couple of playtests and that’s my week pretty full with gaming.”</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> had a busy week, playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/30/birdigo-review/">Birdigo</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/29/atomic-owl-review/">Atomic Owl</a>, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/dear-me-i-was-review/">Dear Me, I Was</a> for review. He says, “I have also played more Wild Hearts, hunting some kemono. I did have a bit of a dumb moment where I was tasked to hunt a particular kemono so I fought one, beat it, waited for the hunt to complete, but it didn’t. Because I’d followed the wrong monster. Oh well, I got some crafting materials.”</p>

<p>And finally,&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> was our man with boots on the ground at the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/01/hands-on-battlefield-6-so-are-we-back/">Battlefield 6 multiplayer reveal</a>, and alongside his preview, he said, “The more I think about it, the more optimistic I am for Battlefield 6. So long as it’s not too buggy at launch, the gameplay, balance of classes, the setting all speak to the best of the series from the early 2010s.”</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played?</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-gameplay-showcase/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-system-works-showcases-new-marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-gameplay-in-beginner%E2%80%99s-guide.1259607/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ahead of Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls being playable at <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/22/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-debuts-at-evo-2025/">EVO 2025</a>, developer Arc System Works has showcased our first extended look at gameplay through a beginner's guide, a fitting delivery method for anyone who plans to be at EVO this year and wants to jump into the ring with at least some knowledge of how things work. </p>



<p>Announced last month during <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-soul-is-a-new-4-vs-4-fighting-game-by-arc-system-works-launches-in-2026-on-playstation-5-and-pc/">PlayStation's State of Play event</a>, this new fighter from Arc System Works is a new 4v4 fighting game, and while we're sure to see plenty of gameplay when members of the public are able to get their hands on it, this video diving into the basics is the most we've seen of the game so far.</p>



<p>The only unfortunate thing about it is that it's a relatively slow showcase of gameplay, and we see more of only one character, Captain America, than we do of the other fighters that'll be available at launch. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls Beginner's Guide" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/v1c9TcMIWfA?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>That said, it's a very thorough guide, and if you are going to EVO with the intent of waiting in line to check out Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls, then you could call this video required viewing to ensure you're ready for the fight.</p>



<p>While players will be able to see even more of Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls at EVO 2025, and get to play it, they won't get to try it out with PlayStation's new fight stick, which we recently learned is officially called <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-flexstrike-project-defiant-fight-stick/">FlexStrike</a>. The FlexStrike will be at EVO, but behind glass cages for players to look and not touch.</p>

Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-star-just-gave-fans-their-biggest-hint-at-a-remake-yet"><u>the actor behind the game's hero, Edward Kenway, offered up some teasing words</u></a> at a convention. Asking a fan if they'd completed Black Flag, he teased: "Well, you might have to beat it again…" </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When the fan replied, "Is this true? I have to run through all of them again," Ryan responded with a knowing wink, saying, "Well, especially this one. There's a reason I say that, but I can't say anything."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story doesn't end there, though. Meeting fans at a different convention — and despite the fact the Black Flag remake feels like an open secret — Ryan would only respond to further questions on the subject with: "I don't know, mate," (thanks, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-star-just-gave-fans-their-biggest-hint-at-a-remake-yet">PC Gamer</a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When pressed further, Ryan said: "Well, the thing is, when that happened, someone was doing this—" (at this point Ryan pointed to the person holding up their phone to record the interaction) "— I was being very free and open, but I didn't know that they actually were recording me on their phone. And then the company threatened to sue me. Yeah, so I say nothing."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has asked Ubisoft for comment.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Damn so it seems like Matt Ryan (voice actor for Edward Kenway) got into deep trouble with Ubisoft for hinting at the Black Flag Remake to that other guy..</p><p>He didn’t realize he was being recorded😵 <a href="https://t.co/2Vy8g6pMRr" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/2Vy8g6pMRr</a></p></div>— The Hidden One (@TheHiddenOneAC) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheHiddenOneAC/status/1950940394310545618?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 31, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">While Ryan is likely aware of the ongoing speculation around a Black Flag remaster, could his involvement in it extend beyond seeing his prior work re-released? Reports have suggested Ubisoft is working on a substantial re-working of Black Flag — does that mean Ryan himself is involved, re-recordling dialogue, or contributing to new story elements?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With no all-new Assassin's Creed game set for the end of this year, fans believe the Black Flag remake would be well positioned to arrive in time for the holidays. Here's hoping Ryan isn't made to walk the plank for dropping this latest hint, and it's not too long before Ubisoft makes the remake official.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nba-2k26/" data-ref-id="5000-685486">NBA 2K26</a> is getting a major upgrade to ProPlay, the enhanced animation system available only on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC. 2K has called this year's upgrade the biggest change to player movement since 2K21, making the most of the consoles' extra power to move even further towards true realism.</p><p>ProPlay is a machine learning-powered technology that analyzes real NBA footage in order to translate that into more realistic gameplay and animations. In the latest edition of NBA 2K, ProPlay will power a new dynamic motion engine, improving the look of player movement on the court. The new motion engine will be especially noticeable when players are in the air, making sure they launch, plant, and cut in a realistic way.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aem-81ru6KQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/aem-81ru6KQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Other improvements to ProPlay will be most appreciated by players who make use of advanced controls in NBA 2K, with a new and enhanced version of Rhythm Shooting on the way. The upgraded feature boasts more responsive jumpshots, for what aims to be a more skill-based style of gameplay.</p><p>Brand-new ProPlay features in offense include Signature Go-To Post Shots such as shimmy floaters, baby hooks, and up-and-unders. Players will be able to mix and match various advanced layups from different athletes in the league. As part of the broader move towards skill-based play, Green or Miss Shot Timing will be universal on higher difficulty levels, and Layup Timing will be permanently enabled. Defense will also be getting improvements in ProPlay, with more realistic movement across the board--but especially in player-to-player collisions.</p><p>Another new mechanic coming to NBA 2K26 is Quick Protect, which ball handlers can make use of to shield themselves from steals--which is just one of many little upgrades that 2K has added to make the game feel closer to real-life gameplay. Overall 2K promises new and revamped controls, with the goal of providing an "intuitive, deliberate, and free-flowing gameplay experience." Control revamps will also prioritize skill-based gameplay, with changes that will reward fast decision-making and quick reaction times.</p><p>Of course with new mechanics, 2K will also be providing new tutorials to ease players into it, with a special focus on intermediate-level tutorials to bridge the gap between beginner and advanced play.</p><p>NBA 2K26 is due to release on September 5 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PC, Nintendo Switch 2, PS4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch--however ProPlay is only available on PC and the newer-generation consoles. Certain editions of the game will give one week of early access from August 29--check out all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nba-2k26-preorders-editions-bonuses-and-early-access/1100-6533141/" data-ref-id="1100-6533141">NBA 2K26 preorder details</a> here.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Atlus has announced that <em>Persona 3 Reload</em>, a full ground-up remake of the original 2006 JRPG, has reached a brand new sales milestone.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://x.com/Atlus_West/status/1951080103439413554" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media,&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>has hit two million sales since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-persona-3-reload-trailer" rel="nofollow">launching last February</a>. The new sales figure means the game has picked up an additional million sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-3-reload-sells-over-1-million-copies-fastest-in-atlus-history" rel="nofollow">since its launch week</a>, during which it cemented itself as Atlus' fastest-selling game (until being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metaphor-refantazio-sales-1m-already" rel="nofollow">overtaken by&nbsp;<em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a>, that is).</p>

<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>'s new sales milestone also comes just a handful of hours after the game was announced to be coming to Nintendo Switch 2 during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">yesterday's Partner Showcase Direct presentation</a>. It'll land on Nintendo's newest console on October 23rd.</p>

<p>The game focuses on an unnamed teenage protagonist who must battle through the mysterious tower of Tartarus at night while building relationships with his school friends and other acquaintances during the day.</p>

<p><i>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</i>lacks some of the features introduced by 2009's&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Portable</em>, including the playable female protagonist and associated social links. It also technically lacks much of the "Answer" storyline introduced in expanded re-release&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 FES</em>, although a version of that story was later sold as an additional DLC pack for&nbsp;<em>Reload</em>.</p>




<p><em>Persona 3 Reload</em>'s success has spurred Atlus on to create another&nbsp;remake in the form of the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Persona 4 Revival</em>, which was revealed during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">this year's Xbox summer showcase</a>. We don't yet know when that one's arriving, unfortunately.</p>

<p>In the meantime, you can check out&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2161700/Persona_3_Reload/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/persona-3-reload/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/persona-3-reload/9nkk6z0k3rh2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and it's coming to Switch 2 in October.&nbsp;</p>

		<p><em>When this goes live, Patrick will, god willing, be in a pub in London. </em></p><p><em>Vacations are odd. Are you going somewhere to relax, or are you going somewhere for experiences? Arguably, the path is in-between, because if you were to live in such a place, would you be chasing every tourist trip? </em></p><p><em>Maybe a trip is, instead, to hang with family or friends. The goal isn't to do much of anything at all except to soak up time with loved ones and be in proximity. Where you do that means less than the being off it all.</em></p><p><em>Either way, it's important to get out the house. </em></p><p><em>You don't need to travel halfway across the world to do something new and different. This week, though, Rob and Patrick unpack the travel they've done over the years, what it means to travel when it's really in service of work, and how long you need to be in a place to "be" there.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> It’s strange. Over my life, I’ve been fortunate enough to travel across the world a few times, landing up in Iceland, Japan, and Germany. Sometimes a few days, sometimes a week.</p><p>The one thing those trips have in common, though, was <em>work</em>. Iceland was to attend an <em>EVE Online</em> convention. Japan was, of course, Tokyo Game Show. Germany was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Games_Convention?ref=remapradio.com"><u>the show that would become Gamescom</u></a>. It’s hard to complain about a “free” international trip, but in every case, I was doing interviews, writing blog posts, and doing lots of <em>work</em>. Plus, it was a little bit like how I can say I’ve been to Seattle a dozen times. But have you really been to Seattle if you’re just going to PAX to walk around a convention center, before you hang out at a bar?</p><p>It wasn’t until I went to PAX with my family a few years back where we stayed long enough to actually do touristy stuff in Seattle. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0iQhOmebDqo&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>I finally went on the damn Space Needle.</u></a> That’s ridiculous.</p><p>Are you really visiting a place if you’re just doing the same things you’d do somewhere else? But when I went to those other places for work, I didn’t have the money to stay an extra week!</p><p>It’s only in recent years that my wife and I have mulled a “real” vacation. Even then, we do not have the kind of family support that would let us drop off the kids for a week and jet off. I’m grateful for having my mom around in a pinch, but my mom couldn’t handle a week on her own.</p><p>So in reality, the cost of the vacation inflates and what you can <em>do</em> on it changes radically. We considered doing something closer, more explicitly centered around the kids. But fuck it, man.</p><p>A few years back, as we considered breaking the seal on Disney, my wife wondered aloud if the kids would be old enough in a few years for something more ambitious. She had never left the confines of North America, venturing only to Canada and Mexico over the years, and had always dreamed of visiting Paris. Worried it wouldn't be the “best” destination for young children, I told her we should go to Paris anyway. We’d figure out a way to make it really fun with the kids.</p><p>(Everything we’ve read since makes it sounds like it’ll actually be delightful for the kids. We’re even sneaking two nights and one day at Disneyland Paris, to bring things entirely full circle.)</p><p>Still, in some ways, I’m in the same place I was last time. I’m about to attend a cool place with a caveat. Now, it’s <em>kids</em> instead of <em>work</em>. I’ll happily take one over the other, obviously, but we spent decades clawing our way into a place where we could consider travelling and now, once again, it’s probably another decade until we could reasonably consider doing it only as a couple.&nbsp;</p><p>The reality is very few of us will ever have the means to pull off the idealized vacation. I still expect we’re going to have a wonderful time. And if I’m being honest, I’m delighted, proud, and jealous my kids are having a trip like this at their age. That wasn’t in the cards for my family at that age, and it’s a testament to all the support my family gave <em>me</em> that I’m now in this position.</p><p>Yet…I wish I could sneak off to the catacombs with my wife without jumping through hoops lol</p><p>Anyway. What have your vacations been like over the decades? What’s <em>your</em> Paris?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@chriskaridis?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Chris Karidis</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>We haven’t really had vacations until a couple years ago when we went on our big Disney World vacation. Which was, warts-and-all, a really special trip. The Animal Kingdom Lodge legitimately changed how we understood lighting, and how much it shapes a place. It’s an expensive hotel but it’s an experience MK and I refer back to <em>constantly </em>when we think about how to design and light an interior space.</p><p>I think the best (only?) real vacation prior to that was a tiny house on Lake Michigan. It was probably the most MK and I have ever had to ourselves to just hang out in our entire relationship. My entire memory of the days in that cabin is just the two of us sitting by a roaring bonfire watching the sun slide across the sky and the stars come out. It was a little early in the season so the lake was quite cold but it also made that fire feel like heaven on earth. It’s another thing we refer back to a lot and now I think of it, the place we’re buying has elements of both those vacations! It’s a cozy, sleek wood home with lots of private outdoor space. Hopefully it facilitates the making of those kinds of happy memories on a more regular basis.</p><p>As for what’s my Paris… I think it’s probably Paris or… Tokyo. I have never been to Japan but I’ve never met anyone who didn’t love their time there. It intimidates the hell out of me: I don’t speak or read any of the language and long flights are a struggle. But the idea of spending a few weeks or a month in Japan is captivating.</p><p>That’s the other thing: I don’t tend to do well with short trips. I like to live in a place more than I like to visit it. My ideal vacation is not a weekend or even a couple weeks, it’s spending a season somewhere. Long enough to find my own rhythms and relationship with it, to not feel like I need to go see a museum or a heritage site but can instead spend the day watching sports before going out for dinner at a restaurant or meeting up with friends in the area.</p>
