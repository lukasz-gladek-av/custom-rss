Welcome to <em>Installer</em> No. 41, your guide to the best and <em>Verge</em>-iest stuff in the world. (If you’re new here, welcome, hope you like gaming gadgets and silly spy movies, and also you can read all the old editions at the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/installer-newsletter"><em>Installer</em> homepage</a>.) </p><div><p>This week, I’ve been reading about <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/06/technology/humane-ai-pin.html?smid=nytcore-ios-share&amp;sgrp=c-cb"><strong>the tough times at Humane</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcxNzY3NzY3MSwiZXhwIjoxNzE4MjgyNDcxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTRU5QQUlEV0xVNjgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.w4OIlWguMfYk-NkNMnefg8NnCt9rIJFeBodZhB8DmhM"><strong>how <em>Suicide Squad </em>flopped</strong></a>, watching <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/253384-dancing-for-the-devil-the-7m-tiktok-cult"><strong>the TikTok dancing cult documentary</strong></a> and <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/786892-furiosa-a-mad-max-saga?language=en-US"><em><strong>Furiosa</strong></em></a><em>, </em>swapping my crappy Roku for a slightly less crappy Apple TV, listening to a lot of <a href="https://wondery.com/shows/wikihole-with-darcy-carden/"><em><strong>WikiHole</strong></em></a><em>, </em>mixing up new mocktail recipes, and testing the <a href="https://phanpy.social/"><strong>Phanpy</strong></a> app for all things fediverse.</p></div><p>I also have for you a new Raspberry Pi accessory, an incredibly well-liked movie to watch this weekend, a couple of fun tech books, some gaming gear, and lots more. Let’s do it.</p><p>(As always, the best part of <em>Installer</em> is your ideas and tips. What are you into right now? What should everyone else be as into as you are? Tell me everything: email <a href="mailto:installer@theverge.com">installer@theverge.com</a>, share with <a href="https://www.threads.net/@imdavidpierce">@imdavidpierce</a> on Threads, or find me on Signal @davidpierce.11. And if you know someone else who might enjoy <em>Installer</em>, tell them to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pages/installer-newsletter-sign-up">subscribe here</a>.)</p><p><h3>The Drop</h3></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/ai-kit/"><strong>The Raspberry Pi AI Kit</strong></a><em><strong>. </strong></em>This is my kind of AI PC: a super simple $70 kit that works with a Raspberry Pi 5 and gives you a surprising amount of power with which to do simple processing tasks. I don’t even know what I’ll use this for! But I’m getting one anyway.</li><li><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/movie/974635-hit-man"><em><strong>Hit Man</strong></em></a><em><strong>. </strong></em>A bunch of very smart people have said this comedy-action-thriller Netflix flick is one of the best movies of the year. And why not? Richard Linklater directs, Glen Powell stars, it’s based on <a href="https://www.texasmonthly.com/true-crime/hit-man-2/">an all-timer of a magazine article</a>. I cannot wait to watch.</li><li><a href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/joseph-cox/dark-wire/9781541702691/"><em><strong>Dark Wire</strong></em></a><em><strong>. </strong></em>This is as good a premise for a book as I’ve ever seen: the story of the FBI’s secret tech startup, designed to track some of the world’s most sophisticated criminals. A <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/inside-biggest-fbi-sting-operation-in-history/">few places</a> have <a href="https://www.404media.co/dark-wire-inside-a-kidnapping-planned-on-the-fbis-secret-chat-app/">published excerpts</a>, and I already can’t put this book down.</li><li><a href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/744393/building-simcity-by-chaim-gingold-foreword-by-janet-h-murray/"><em><strong>Building SimCity</strong></em></a><em><strong>. </strong></em>Two books this week! You love to see it. This is a story all about SimCity, yes, but also about the history of computer simulation, with lots of photos and diagrams to go with it. One for the coffee table for sure.</li><li><a href="https://rivian.com/r1s"><strong>The new Rivian R1</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Same look, same funky headlight design, totally new car underneath. A lot of what Rivian’s doing here is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172761/rivian-r1t-r1s-refresh-update-motor-battery-price">clearly just to keep costs down</a>, but this continues to be the EV I lust after the most.</li><li><a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/114479-the-acolyte"><em><strong>The Acolyte</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong> </em>This is a very different kind of Star Wars story, set in a very different time and place, told from a very different point of view, all of which I definitely think is a good thing. The reviews seem pretty mixed so far, but I’m excited to give it a whirl.</li><li><a href="https://www.getsequel.app/"><strong>Sequel 2.3</strong></a><strong>.</strong><em> </em>A very cool update to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23915813/sequel-sofa-media-tracking-apps-roblox-razr-big-vape-installer-newsletter">the Installerverse’s favorite media tracking app</a> for Apple devices. The new feature is called Magic Lookup, and it lets you send a URL to the app and have it automatically parsed and dumped into your lists. Perfect for saving those “20 things coming to Netflix this month” things you see all over the place.</li><li><a href="https://modretro.com/"><strong>The ModRetro Chromatic</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The retro gaming hardware boom we’re in right now is just the best thing. And this, a $199 Game Boy homage from a team led by Palmer Luckey, looks <em>great. </em>It’s not shipping until the end of the year, but it’s up for preorders now.</li><li><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D1025X1701640%26xs%3D1%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Frog.asus.com%252Fus%252Fgaming-handhelds%252Frog-ally%252Frog-ally-x-2024%252F"><strong>The Asus ROG Ally X</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Speaking of portable consoles! This one’s a lot bigger, a lot more expensive, and a lot more ambitious than the Chromatic —&nbsp;but it also sounds pretty great. Maybe this is the first Windows handheld that can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/2/24169709/asus-rog-ally-x-price-release-date-inside-gaming-handheld">really stand up to the Steam Deck</a>?</li><li><a href="https://www.macstories.net/comfort-zone/"><em><strong>Comfort Zone</strong></em></a><em><strong>.</strong> </em>Fun new podcast from the MacStories crew, with a gimmick I really like: every week, the three hosts have to basically do “Tech Show and Tell” and then issue a tech-related challenge to complete before the next episode. (MacStories also has another new podcast, called <a href="https://www.macstories.net/npc/"><em><strong>NPC</strong></em></a>, all about portable gaming.</li><li><a href="https://crooked.com/podcast/how-wall-e-reveals-our-changing-feelings-toward-tech/"><strong>“How ‘Wall-E’ Reveals Our Changing Feelings Toward Tech.”</strong></a><strong> </strong>I am outrageously jealous of this whole series of episodes from the <em>Offline </em>podcast, looking at how movies like <em>Her </em>and <em>The Social Network </em>influenced the way we think about and build tech. This is the final episode in the miniseries, and they’re all worth a listen.</li></ul></div><p><h3>Screen share</h3></p><p>Well, friends, it took 41 issues, but it happened: I had someone lined up for Screen Share this week, and it just didn’t come together in time. So let’s do something slightly different. I’ve recently become obsessed with the <a href="https://niagaralauncher.app/"><strong>Niagara Launcher</strong></a> for Android, which is, in theory, largely optimized for one-handed phone use but is also just a better, quieter way of organizing your homescreen. In the last 10 days, I’ve probably redone my setup eight times. It’s a lot.</p><p>Niagara is just so clever! It turns your apps into a customizable list, pops up widgets and notifications right in place, and lets you do a shocking amount of stuff without ever opening an app. This is totally how phones should work. (If you want to understand how it operates, here’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DW9U-T_LbIak"><strong>a good thorough video</strong></a> to watch.)</p><p>Niagara just got a big update, too, particularly if you pay the $10 a year or $30 lifetime Pro subscription. Its search is better now, it got some cool new icons, and there are a few other little improvements, too.</p><p>As I’ve been tinkering with my own homescreen, I’ve been collecting some Niagara setups I like, and I figured I’d share a few. You can do so many things with this launcher!</p><p>Cool, right? There are rumors and reports that we’re going to get a bunch of new customization possibilities for iOS, too, so here’s hoping this is a year filled with chaotic homescreen reorgs. If you use Niagara, by the way, or any other awesome Android launcher, I’d love to see your sick homescreen setups. Send them my way. And we’ll be back to regular Screen Share next week!</p><p><h3>Crowdsourced</h3></p><p><em>Here’s what the </em>Installer<em> community is into this week. I want to know what you’re into right now as well! Email </em><a href="mailto:installer@theverge.com"><em>installer@theverge.com</em></a><em> or message me on Signal —&nbsp;@davidpierce.11 — with your recommendations for anything and everything, and we’ll feature some of our favorites here every week.&nbsp;</em></p><p>“New version of <a href="https://www.apposite.ai/"><strong>Vibescape</strong></a> just came out for Apple Vision Pro — new Oregon coast-inspired meditation environment! Completely new experience with this and the Forest Ledge environment — pushing the boundaries of what’s possible outside of Apple’s own environments.” – Gregory</p><p>“I’ve been using <a href="https://www.beeper.com/"><strong>Beeper</strong></a> a ton on my Pixel 8 Pro and MacBook Pro. I actually installed it in early April when the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/9/24124179/beeper-app-automattic-acquisition-matrix-messaging">acquisition announcement came out</a> but have really hit my stride with it a month ago. It’s just so helpful to have all of your messaging in one app, both for work and personal.” – Josh</p><div><p>“<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2F%40patrickhwillems"><strong>Patrick Willems</strong></a> has a new video this week about <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DSW9b9VpVW0A"><strong>what’s next after superhero movies</strong></a> so I’ve been diving back into his channel after a while.” –&nbsp;Mike</p></div><p>“A friend introduced me to <a href="https://www.guildwars2.com/en/"><em><strong>Guild Wars 2</strong></em></a> a few months back. As someone who likes the concept of an MMO but always felt let down by the execution, I can confidently say this is one of the most underrated games ever made. A fun, free-to-play MMORPG with a healthy community and no microtransactions sounded too good to be true, but it’s not. Plus, with the recent announcements around the next expansion, there are more reasons to play than ever.” – Dallin</p><p>“I heard about Microsoft’s Recall, which felt exhausting and tedious to me. So, last weekend, I paved over Windows and installed the <a href="https://bazzite.gg/"><strong>Bazzite</strong></a> Linux distro on my gaming PC and have been playing all my Steam and Epic games that way. It’s surprisingly so much better than the last time I tried Linux on the desktop. I’m sure mileage varies, but everything worked with about the same amount of tweaking Windows required.” –&nbsp;Les</p><p>“The <em>LOTR</em> movies are finally<strong> </strong><a href="https://www.fathomevents.com/series/the-lord-of-the-rings-trilogy/"><strong>coming back to theaters</strong></a>. The extended editions — the only versions I’ll watch. So excited to go watch these with my pals, like high school all over again.” –&nbsp;Colin</p><p>“Watching <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/253268-who-killed-wcw"><em><strong>Who Killed WCW?</strong></em></a> from <em>Vice</em>. It’s a three-part miniseries interviewing Eric Bischoff and a bunch of wrestlers like Kevin Nash, Konnan, and Booker T about the inevitable downfall of WCW. Everyone has their own thoughts about who to point the finger at, from Turner executives hating wrestling to Bischoff not knowing what he’s doing to the wrestlers only looking out for themselves. Only one episode out so far, but it’s good.” – Brian</p><p>“The new shows <a href="https://www.dropout.tv/thousandaires"><em><strong>Thousandaires</strong></em></a><em> </em>from Dropout and <a href="https://watch.2ndtry.tv/trolley-problems"><em><strong>Trolley Problems</strong></em></a><em> </em>from 2nd Try premiered this week and are both hilarious and great examples of modern media companies and the trend of creating their own streaming platforms.” –&nbsp;Zach</p><p>“On the anime watch. I highly recommend <a href="https://www.themoviedb.org/tv/207784?language=en-US"><em><strong>Delicious in Dungeon</strong></em></a>. Very fun to watch, the characters’ comedic timing is excellent. This anime is hilarious while keeping the stakes of the story high.” – John</p><p><h3>Signing off</h3></p><p>I’ve been thinking a lot this week about <a href="https://boz.com/articles/inbox-ten"><strong>a blog post</strong></a> Andrew Bosworth, Meta’s CTO, wrote recently. He talks about his system of “Inbox Ten,” which basically means not trying to end every day with <em>nothing </em>on your plate but instead just trying to find a more manageable flow of information in your life. Boz has a whole system for managing his inbox in particular, which I really like — I used to be an Inbox Zero zealot and get stressed out when there’s stuff in there, but I like his slightly less drastic approach. And this sentence has popped into my brain all week, every time I get an email: “Don’t let it linger in your inbox or get yourself talked into work you don’t think is a good use of your time.” Words to live by.</p><p>See you next week!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Yesterday, during Summer Game Fest 2024's IGN Live, Piranha Games unveiled the release date for MechWarrior 5: Clans. The narrative-driven game with co-op support will be released on October 3 for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2000890/MechWarrior_5_Clans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam </a>and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/mechwarrior-5-clans-e50e3a" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X with cross-play support.</p>
<p>Players will experience the Clan Invasion from the perspective of Clan Smoke Jaguar as they lead their five-mech 'Star' squad through engaging missions and combat, with cinematics unlike anything seen before in the franchise. The developers have also promised a story that will bring players across several planets and diverse biomes.</p>
<p>In a previous <a href="https://wccftech.com/mechwarrior-5-clans-takes-full-advantage-of-unreal-engine-5-finally-ships-with-great-controller-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GDC 2024 interview with Wccftech</a>, Piranha Games CEO Russ Bullock confirmed that the game uses Unreal Engine 5 to the fullest extent: Lumen, Nanite, MetaHuman, Chaos destructibility, and World Partition. MechWarrior 5: Clans will also ship with controller support on PC as well, though that was kind of a given considering the launch on consoles.</p>

			<p>During Summer Game Fest 2024's IGN Live, Offworld Industries unveiled the 1.0 release date for Starship Troopers: Extermination. The 16-player cooperative first-person shooter game will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on October 11, nearly a year and a half after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starship-troopers-extermination-early-access-launch-date-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">May 2023 early access debut</a>.</p>
<p>One of the additions to the full version is a single player mode featuring 25 distinct missions and a variety of PvE combat scenarios across multiple environments, with a second chapter to follow post-launch. The story premise is that players are selected to join an elite spec ops group within the Mobile Infantry. They will soon find themselves following the orders of living legend General John “Johnny” Rico, proving their mettle against hordes of enemy Arachnids with the aid of three original NPC allies to prove themselves worthy of recruitment. And yes, Johnny Rico will be played by Casper Van Dien, the actor featured in the cult 1997 Starship Troopers movie.</p>
<p><iframe title="Starship Troopers: Extermination - Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E8FRZR728u8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Offworld Industries also confirmed that a long-requested new feature will be added to Starship Troopers: Extermination 1.0: the persistence on the battlefield of bug corpses. This will lend increased realism to the game experience, not to mention the possible introduction of tactical elements as players climb mountains of corpses to shoot the remaining bugs from a vantage point.</p>
<p>Those interested in the game should keep in mind that the current pricing of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1268750/Starship_Troopers_Extermination/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early access version</a> ($29.99) will increase with the launch of version 1.0. As such, it may be wise to purchase the game now before the expected price increase. The developers also promised to share more information about the next early access update, slated to go live at the end of June, very soon.</p>

			<p>During Summer Game Fest 2024's Future Game Show, Red Thread Games and Quantic Dream presented a new Dustborn trailer that celebrates the opening of pre-orders. As a reminder, the game is slated to launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/dustborn-red-threads-action-adventure-game-launches-on-august-20-for-29-99/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on August 20</a> for $29.99 on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series S/X, and Xbox One. Moreover, a physical edition will be released for consoles. Priced at $39.99, it includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>2 postcards from iconic locations visited by the crew;</li>
<li>A map of the American Republic, listing all the pitstops the crew has to make before arriving at their final destination;</li>
<li>A 32-page prequel comic book about the crew’s life before accepting this risky mission;</li>
<li>Stickers of iconic elements from the game.</li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone who pre-orders is getting a Sherbert twirl hat, a Psycho Pete bat, and an exclusive Eye C U Jacket. Ragnar Tørnquist, Creative Director at Red Thread Games, stated:</p>
<p><em>We are excited to offer a deeper look at how the power of words shapes Dustborn’s gameplay. As we launch pre-orders, we wanted to give players more insight into the crew’s undercover punk-rock road trip and the adversaries they face along the way. We cannot wait to see players discover the game’s comic book-inspired experience, build relationships with the crew, and use their abilities to defeat Justice and the Puritans!</em></p>
<p><iframe title="DUSTBORN | PRE-ORDER TEASER" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ogIq4hscX0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Dustborn will also get a 30-minute free demo next week as part of Steam Next Fest, during which players will be able to go hands-on with Pax, the main character. As an Anormal, she can control words to create new powers, defend herself, get out of sticky situations, neutralize threats, and build relationships with her crew or new encounters. Of course, relationships can be tricky to navigate, as each character brings their own powers, perspectives, motives, and insecurities.</p>

Looking back at January's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-developer-direct-2024-all-of-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5041/">Developer Direct</a>, quite a few Xbox games were shown off then, and it's likely that we'll see more of everyone's favorite archeologist in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Obsidian's new fantasy game Avowed, and the grand strategy of Ara History Untold.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024/" data-ref-id="5000-590943">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dungeons-of-hinterberg/" data-ref-id="5000-590949">Dungeons of Hinterberg</a>, and a look at what's next for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sea-of-thieves/" data-ref-id="5000-438508">Sea of Thieves</a> could also be on the cards, and we've also seen a few Game Pass updates in the past in previous Xbox showcase events. On the third-party side, Xbox has a lot it could show off here. March's Xbox Partner Preview featured games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/unknown-9-awakening/" data-ref-id="5000-517822">Unknown 9: Awakening</a>, Capcom's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess/" data-ref-id="5000-590945">Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online/" data-ref-id="5000-43589">Final Fantasy 14 Online</a> amongst several other interesting titles, so there's a chance that we'll see more of those games during the livestream.</p><p>Following the Xbox Games Showcase, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-announced-described-as-dark-new-chapter/1100-6523660/" data-ref-id="1100-6523660">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> Direct will be up next.

Will it contain guns, military jargon, and a few explosions? An educated guess points toward a definite "maybe" for the 2024 Call of Duty game.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bodycam-realistic-shooter/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bodycam-is-so-realistic-it%E2%80%99s-borderline-terrifying.895029/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bodycam-realistic-shooter/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>I’ve spent a few hours playing Bodycam, the Unreal Engine-powered first-person shooter from two brothers that’s turning heads on social and streaming platforms worldwide. It was released on Steam on June 7, with many users and prospective fans confusing the project with Unrecord, a similar-looking game that surfaced last year with a harrowing reveal trailer. </p>



<p>Both games look similar but while Unrecord reportedly focuses on a single-player narrative, Bodycam is a multiplayer-focused shooter. After getting hands-on with Bodycam for a while, I can confirm that it’s so realistic it’s scary, and it’s how I want all my first-person shooters to behave going forward.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prepare-yourself">Prepare Yourself</h2>



<p>Bodycam isn’t for the faint of heart. It’s marketed as being a tough-as-nails shooter that walks a fragile line between ‘virtual’ and ‘reality’. In Bodycam, players assume control of a footsoldier in either a military force or a terrorist group, using a series of authentic weapons to take down opponents and complete a range of basic objectives.</p>



<p>Everything from the maps to the game’s audio mechanics have been superbly crafted in Unreal Engine 5, and the visual layer of the game is nothing short of sublime. On a high-end PC, Bodycam looks jaw-droppingly good, offering unparalleled graphics and physics that make something as simple as shooting an opponent a terrifying realistic premise.</p>



<figure><figcaption>This is a game, not a shot from LiveLeaks</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Honest disclaimer: don’t play Bodycam if you’re easily disturbed or made uncomfortable by real-world violence.</strong></p>



<p>Allow me to explain. In one sequence, I crept through a gorgeous wooded area on my way to defuse a bomb that had been planted by a terrorist force. In the next moment, I was engaged, and bullets were whipping through the scenery, deafening me. I whirled on an opponent and blasted him with a shotgun, and he was sent collapsing to the floor, his legs bucking wildly as he contorted with the pain of the buckshot slamming into him.</p>



<p>Then, I was hit, and as my camera disconnected I too fell to the ground in the middle of a thick forest, blood gurgling in my throat as my operator choked on his final breaths. It’s <strong>intense</strong>.</p>



<figure><figcaption>You never know where the next shot will come from</figcaption></figure>



<p>Players have a few gripes with Bodycam, namely with the game’s matchmaking mechanics and server instabilities, but for the few hours that I played, I suffered from two issues:</p>



<ul>
<li>In one match, I was doing pretty well and then was suddenly disconnected</li>



<li>In another match, the player I was spectating after I’d been killed was bugging out, jerking around the map</li>
</ul>



<p>Aside from that, I have no issues with any aspect of Bodycam. It’s a solid shooter with huge amounts of potential, and although it could be seen as little more than a tech demo, it has left Unrecord sitting in the dust as far as I’m concerned. Some users might brand it a clone or an act of plagiarism, but I maintain that we saw one trailer for Unrecord several months ago and nothing else, while Bodycam is here, in the wild, and making a stellar impression.</p>



<p>Bodycam is available (for now) exclusively on PC.</p>

			<p>State of Decay 3 will receive a brand-new trailer during the highly-anticipated Xbox Showcase later today, it's been revealed.</p>
<p>Developer Undead Labs revealed as much as part of a press release that was briefly available on the studio's website. As <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1799547951758340402" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by Gematsu on X (and several others), the Microsoft-owned studio responsible for the State of Decay series is rebranding, and in a now-deleted press release, the studio confirmed that fans will get a new trailer for State of Decay 3. Seemingly, a .zip file containing a press release was<a href="https://www.undeadlabs.com/jobs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> briefly available on the studio's job page</a>. This link no longer exists, however, and we haven't been able to find a cached sample of the page either. Luckily, Gematsu included a screenshot of the press release as well as the new logo that Undead Labs will use as part of the studio's rebranding. You can find the new logo at the top of this article. A screenshot of the press release is included below.</p>
<p>"Undead Labs revealed its new brand during the highly anticipated Xbox Showcase presentation on June 9th, in the newest State of Decay 3 trailer", the press release reads.</p>
<p>"This rebrand evolves the Undead Labs brand and elevates the the role of the game studio brand within the category by building a brand-world that feels substantial and immersive in the way previously reserved for games", Nate Manny from brand development experts 51 Eggs writes in the press release.</p>

<p>As reported yesterday, the Xbox Showcase is <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-showcase-8-world-premieres-gears-6-new-doom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said to offer 8 world premieres (aside from previously announced games)</a>, including the new Gears title as well as the rumored new DOOM: The Dark Ages.</p>
<p>Formally <a href="https://wccftech.com/state-of-decay-3-announced-to-be-early-in-pre-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced back in 2020</a>, State of Decay 3 is being made in <a href="https://wccftech.com/state-of-decay-3-is-being-made-with-unreal-engine-5-and-help-from-gears-of-war-devs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unreal Engine 5 with the help of devs from Gears studio The Coalition</a>. As covered some weeks ago, the title is said to be coming along very well - at least, that's <a href="https://wccftech.com/state-of-decay-3-is-reportedly-coming-along-very-very-well/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what Windows Central's Jez Corden claimed</a>.</p>
<p>We'll update you as soon as we learn more about State of Decay 3. For now, stay tuned.</p>

		<p>It’s easy to get caught up in the hype of games. Hell, getting people excited about what’s coming out is at least part of what we do here on a daily basis. However, you can’t bandy around the phrase ‘next Breath of the Wild’ without a bit of evidence to back it up, and thanks to the latest Eternal Strands trailer from the Future Games Show, we’ve got some pretty compelling evidence.</p>
<p><iframe title="Eternal Strands Gameplay Trailer - Future Games Show Summer Showcase 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ql_EdNY7eX0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This new gameplay trailer follows on from the original announcement, and it showcases exactly the kind of action you can expect to indulge in when Eternal Strands releases in the near-ish future. First on the ‘Breath of the Wild comparison chart is the expansive open world and the vibrant visuals, with Yellow Brick Games forging a beautiful graphical style that’s undoubtedly going to entice players into their world. Exploration is clearly going to play a major part in the experience, and there’s plenty of footage of our heroine running and clambering around a variety of distinct and exciting areas.</p>
<p>Besides that, there’s a bunch of combat, and here you’re tackling an array of gigantic beasts in a way that’s perhaps more reminiscent of Shadow of the Colussus rather than Link’s escapades. You can climb up their limbs, ready to hack parts of them off, or perhaps you’ll be taken for a ride by a gigantic dragon who’s expecting some kind of flame-grilled adventurer for lunch. The designs of these huge bosses looks especially impressive, offering both terror and temptation in equal measure.</p>


<p>There’s also the options of crafting new items of armour and weaponry to improve your chances – we’ll wait to see if there’s a cooking point to throw things into – or to lean on magic to take down these massive creatures. Whatever you choose, Yellow Brick Games looks more than ready to provide it.</p>
<p>While we don’t yet have a release date for Eternal Strands, we do know that it will be releasing on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series consoles and PC, and that you can add it to your relevant <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491410/Eternal_Strands/">wishlist</a> right now. No matter where you play, Eternal Strands could well be essential when it finally arrives.</p>

  <p id="pC3IeD"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/pokemon-go/38713"><em>Pokémon Go</em></a> is having a Goomy Community Day event on<strong> Sunday, June 9, from 2-5 p.m. in your local time</strong>.</p>
<p id="dnBcPc">As expected with a Community Day event,<strong> Goomy </strong>will spawn in huge numbers with a high chance for it to appear shiny. There are also several other bonuses and perks, which we’ve list out below.</p>

<h2 id="JHxyzU"><strong>How do I catch a shiny Goomy in Pokémon Go?</strong></h2>
<p id="ZGv7YR">As per old research by the now-defunct website The Silph Road (via <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230423103325/https://thesilphroad.com/shiny-pokemon">Wayback Machine</a>), Shiny rates on Community Days are about 1 in 24, which means that if you keep playing throughout the three-hour window, you should find quite a few shiny Pokémon.</p>

<p id="JqBuiK">If you’re short on time or Poké Balls, you can pop an <strong>Incense</strong>, then quickly <strong>tap each Goomy </strong>to check for shiny ones, running from any that aren’t shiny. Notably, any Goomy you’ve already tapped will face where your player is standing, so that should help identify which ones you may have already checked.</p>
<hr id="fCZXnK">
<h2 id="Rck3HW"><strong>What Community Day move does Goomy’s evolution learn?</strong></h2>
<p id="P33K1t">If you evolve Sliggoo into Goodra from 2 p.m. until 10 p.m. in your local time, it will learn the charged move <strong>Thunder Punch</strong>.</p>
<p id="pcrxXf">If you miss out on evolving it during this period, you will likely be able to evolve it during a Community Day weekend event in December to get Thunder Punch. If you don’t want to wait, you can use an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/22557832/tm-elite-fast-charged-best-use-how-to-get-technical-machines">Elite TM</a> to get the move.</p>
<hr id="sJ5mE8">
<h2 id="PRBqBQ"><strong>How does Goodra do in the meta?</strong></h2>
<p id="UnfEw0">For raiding and gyms, Goodra isn’t nearly as good as its fellow pseudo-legendary dragons. You can set it up with Dragon Breath and Draco Meteor, but you should use just about anything else over it (Salamence, Dragonite, or Garchomp, just to name a few).</p>
<p id="nsarC1">Goodra is actually used more in PvP, so you can set it up with Dragon Breath alongside Power Whip and Aqua Tail to give it some good move coverage.</p>
<hr id="wsHYws">
<h2 id="rVGJO4"><strong>How do I make the most of Goomy Community Day?</strong></h2>
<p id="VP2Yku">The following bonuses will be active during Goomy Community Day:</p>
<ul>
<li id="RnqjWH">Tripled Stardust for catching Pokémon</li>
<li id="ygtKvn">Doubled candy for catching Pokémon</li>
<li id="IlHTnG">Doubled chance for level 31+ trainers to get XL candy from catching Pokémon</li>
<li id="PF2Fbg">Incense lasts three hours</li>
<li id="R4eQq7">Lure Modules lasts three hours</li>
<li id="Kt1oY9">Goomy special photobombs when taking snapshots</li>
<li id="3l86uP">One additional special trade</li>
<li id="QaoYEy">Stardust cost halved for trading</li>
</ul>
<p id="kOd6mO">That said, you should definitely pop a Star Piece and an Incense and try to nab some powerful Goomy.</p>
<p id="miKL06">Notably, there will also be a <strong>Timed Research set that rewards you with a Rainy Lure Module</strong> — which you’ll need to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go/22423676/evolve-goomy-sliggoo-pokemon-go-goodra-evolution-requirements">evolve your Sliggoo into Goodra</a> (if it’s not raining for you). That said, if you head to a more populated <em>Pokémon Go</em> spot (like a shopping mall or park), some players may already use Rainy Lure Modules, so you can use theirs rather than using your own.</p>
<p id="tLRqH5">If you can <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/22447919/mega-evolution-list-candy-bonus-buddy-raids"><strong>Mega Evolve</strong></a><strong> Charizard X, Ampharos, Sceptile, Altaria, Salamence, Latias, Latios, Rayquaza, or Garchomp</strong>, you’ll score additional Goomy Candy per catch.</p>
<p id="mfZjRH">In addition to all this, Niantic is still running special four-star raids from 5-10 p.m., where if you clear the Sliggoo raid, Goomy will spawn in a 300-meter radius around the gym for 30 minutes. These raids cannot be done remotely. If the usual 2-5 p.m. spawn increase doesn’t get you the Goomy you wanted, you can try raiding for another chance.</p>

<p>In what was definitely not on my bingo sheet but one I was not-so-secretly wishing for, we’ve heard about an upcoming trailer for State of Decay 3, which will be released during the Xbox Games Showcase. We’re not yet sure if it’s gameplay or another cinematic, like the one they revealed over three years ago, but here’s hoping for the former!</p>



<hr>



<p>This leak stems from developer Undead Labs updating their website with new branding and information to better align with their standing as a first-party Xbox game development studio. Xbox purchased Undead Labs in 2018, following the immense success of their original game, State of Decay, which became a cult classic. Their follow-up, State of Decay 2, continues the franchise, offering a highly replayable zombie survival game of immense quality and entertainment value.</p>



<p>But now, it’s time for something more. In a press release leak that fell through the cracks during the website update, we know there’s a new State of Decay 3 trailer reveal at the Xbox Games Showcase on June 9. Here’s what the press release had to say:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>IT’S A NEW ERA FOR UNDEAD LABS.</p>



<p>Undead Labs engaged with 51 Eggs, a branding practice, on an odyssey to align the studio brand with its evolution from indie to Xbox. Undead Labs was founded in Seattle in 2009 as a scrappy startup with only a handful of developers. The studio’s name was a clever marketing tactic for the first State of Decay game, a surprise hit that launched in 2013. A decade and a half later, Undead Labs bears little resemblance to its early incarnation. Following an acquisition in 2018, its relationship with Xbox changed from publishing partner to parent company. Shortly after, the founder departed, and new Studio Head Philip Holt began his leadership tenure, including overseeing the expansion of satellite oices in Illinois and Florida. It was time for the studio brand to change. “We wanted to give the creatives we work with a collective identity that transcends zombies,” says Holt. Chief of Sta Vicki Ebberts adds, “It felt right — and also the right time — that our brand reflected how much we’ve grown and changed.” Partnering with brand development experts 51 Eggs proved to be an exciting and rewarding adventure. Collaborating closely with the Undead Labs team, 51 Eggs delivered a holistic, studio values-driven brand experience encompassing everything from brand strategy to verbal and visual brand identity design. The end result includes redefining Undead Labs’ name and brand story, a new logo and visual ecosystem, boot sequence animations, website, custom brand launch kits, interior studio artwork, signage, wayfinding, and more. Over nearly two years, these Pacific Northwest-based companies worked together to explore the studio’s legacy, current trajectory, and the shared dreams and aspirations of its beating heart — the people of Undead Labs. “This rebrand evolves the Undead Labs brand and elevates the role of the game studio brand within the category by building a brand-world that feels substantial and immersive in a way previously reserved for games.” Nate Manny, Founder of 51 Eggs.</p>



<p><strong>Undead Labs revealed its new brand during the highly anticipated Xbox Showcase presentation on June 9th, in the newest State of Decay 3 trailer. Explore and experience the new Undead Labs brand at undeadlabs.com.</strong></p>

<p>We’ll share more once the trailer goes live!</p>

<p>I love the setup: you're a duck turned into a human and made an intern of a goddess's "magical startup dedicated to finding lost items". 
</p>
<p>I remember when every hidden object game was a faintly hideous photo-collage about investigating ghost murders in an endless procession of damp sheds. It's been a delight to see the Where's Wallyfication (or Waldofication, if you're American) of the genre in recent years, with a growing number of games featuring richly illustrated scenes packed with humour. 
</p>
<p>Lost And Found Co. seems to be in the same vein as Hidden Folks and Labyrinth City: Pierre The Maze Detective, where it's just a pleasure to hang out in its spaces even when you can't find what you're looking for. I appreciate that there's a story to pull you through each scene, too.
</p>
<p>You can grab <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2101390/Lost_and_Found_Co/">the demo from Steam now</a>, with the full game as yet undated.</p>

<p data-characters="301" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Wave 3 of <em>Persona 3 Reload</em>‘s expansion pass, Episode Aigis: The Answer, has received a release date reveal trailer. This section of the game will include more than 30 hours of new content and a new dungeon for players to explore as they navigate through an epilogue to the climactic main story. </p> <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="314" data-injectable="false">Fans are excited to see this part of the game be reworked, as it quickly became one of the most controversial aspects of the original <em>Persona 3</em> release. Many players have criticized the pacing of the story, as well as the overall difficulty spike of the original version of The Answer included with <em>Persona 3 FES</em>. </p> <figure data-current-count="614" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Persona 3 Reload: Expansion Pass | Episode Aigis Date Reveal" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PTgAlxQyvkE?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="260" data-injectable="false">While The Answer was a controversial release, that didn’t stop hungry fans from asking about it when <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> was first announced. Many assumed that the DLC would be missing from Reload until a surprise announcement confirmed it would be coming. </p> <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="576" data-injectable="true">Although gamers have come to disagree about the way that <em>Persona 3 Reload </em>changes up gameplay in its own ways with the inclusion of Theurgy attacks and changes to each character’s toolkit, the overall outlook from the fandom is optimism at a chance to see this story executed in a way that feels more natural. </p>
 <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="310" data-injectable="false">Additional excitement stems from the fact that a <em>Reload</em> recomposition of the <em>FES</em> version of Mass Destruction can be heard in this trailer. The trailer also shows off some dungeon exploration, Aigis’ new all-out-attack screen, and a sliver of information about Metis, a focal character in this expansion. </p> <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="596" data-injectable="true">Although some players are still holding out hope to see the female protagonist from <em>Persona 3 Portable </em>be included as a DLC somewhere down the road, most of the fandom is just happy to see The Answer be included in <em>Persona 3 Reload</em>, since it was pitched to gamers as a faithful remake. </p>
 <p data-characters="295" data-current-count="295" data-injectable="false"><em>Episode Aigis</em> is the third and final wave of DLC for <em>Persona 3 Reload</em> and will be released on September 10, 2024. Interested players can purchase it via their respective stores. Additionally, Xbox Game Pass members have the opportunity to claim Episode Aigis as a Perk through January 31, 2025. </p>

Why does it need to be set in a virtual reality game show? So it can do things like transport players to Kyoto in the year 1568, which is what will happen when season three arrives on June 13th.

<figcaption>The trailer for The Finals season 3.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8kWYWa3Jv2Q" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>The new season brings a new 5v5 ranked mode, Terminal Attack, in which one team attacks by delivering a decryption key to one of two terminals, while the other team defends them. The mode is designed to empasise "a more tactical and competitive" style of play, with matches being decided by the best of 13 rounds, and with no healing or revives.
</p>
<p>Although set in different cities and slightly different time periods, so far all of The Finals' maps have been modern urban environments. Kyoto in the 16th century, meanwhile, consists of temples, gardens and bamboo forests - all of which you can demolish as per any other environment in the game.
</p>
<p>The setting also brings a set of themed weapons and cosmetics, including dual katanas for Mediums, a spear for Heavies, and a recurve bow for Lights. I love a bow in any game.
</p>
<p>I haven't returned to play it in a while, but I'm still rooting for The Finals. Being able to demolish buildings is fun on its own terms, as are grappling hooks and portable jump pads, but its real strength is making these overpowered tools into tactically significant options in the push-and-pull of its various game modes. I had great fun with it for a couple of months and I hope it continues to draw enough of an audience to keep its servers online.</p>

A demo is available now. <span id="more-890101"></span></p><p>“We’re counting down the days, and the whole team is excitedly awaiting the launch of <em>First Dwarf</em> in Early Access,” said Star Drifters CEO Jakub Wojcik in a press release. “Both the tests and the demo version are immensely popular among players, yet this is just a glimpse of what we aim to deliver to them on June 19 and in further updates. We’re eagerly awaiting feedback from our fans because we want to listen to their opinions and craft our game together with them. We also feel that with the support of the community, we’ll be able to build a title tailored to what players are currently looking for.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Star Drifters:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>In <em>First Dwarf</em>, players become Tru— a dwarven explorer who sets out to build colonies on the floating islands of Driftland. Shipwrecked Tru must prepare for the dangers of the sky-high land, building defenses and infrastructure for the future colonists. Fortunately, with dwarven engineering skills, he can repair and pilot a powerful mech, which proves itself in combat, gathering resources and building. With various upgrades, this pinnacle of fantasy tech will eventually become the ultimate exploration machine. The mech’s offensive arsenal will also come in handy, as the uncharted lands are inhabited by mysterious creatures hostile to the dwarven newcomers.</p><p>But the gigantic mech is not enough to uncover all the mysteries of Driftland. Ragna, a she-dragon, is a playable companion who aids Tru in his quest. Her small size, ability to fly, and breathe fire make her a great addition to the dwarven skills of the protagonist. The game can be played in co-op (split screen and online) with each protagonist doing their job.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Building a colony and managing the settlers is another part of Tru’s job. With <a title="Genres > Tower Defense [19 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/tower-defense">tower defense</a> mechanisms, the settlement can be prepared for the worst. But it’s not all about survival—Tru will have to balance and fulfill the needs of new inhabitants, providing them with resources, shelter, and entertainment to boost their happiness. Only a prosperous society will allow our protagonist to pursue his own personal goal—discovering what evil taints these lands and what happened to the previous dwarven expeditions, including the one led by his father.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li> Control dwarf Tru, pilot the powerful mech and fly with Ragna the Dragon, each with their own skills to upgrade.</li><li>Build, optimize and look after your colonies.</li><li>Upgrade, craft and discover new structures, technologies, tools, and weapons.</li><li>Fight Tainted enemies by engaging in close combat and by building defensive turrets and walls in advance, preparing not only for monster waves, but also natural disasters.</li><li>Heal the Tainted animals or purge the island of them—the choice is yours.</li><li>Unveil the hidden secrets of Driftland and learn the truth about Tru’s father’s past.</li><li>Embark on an <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,540 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> alone or with a friend in <a title="Genres > Co-Op [175 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> assist mode</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>First Dwarf</em> is due out for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, Switch, and PC via XXX in 2024.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Early Access Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="First Dwarf - Early Access Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_uvdR-pXNHA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/06/08/eriksholm-the-stolen-dream-is-a-new-stealth-game-from-former-mirrors-edge<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Publisher Nordcurrent Labs and newcomer developer River End Games have revealed Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream, a narrative-driven stealth-strategy adventure game launching next year. Revealed during today's Future Game Show Summer Showcase, Eriksholm comes from a team of developers whose experience includes Battlefield, Mirror's Edge, Little Nightmares, and Unravel.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Set in the titular Eriksholm, a fictional city inspired by a Nordic aesthetic of the early 1900s, Eriksholm follows three protagonists united in their hearts to defy their oppressors. In the reveal trailer below, you can see one of those protagonists, Hanna, an adolescent orphan searching for her brother Herman. That journey transforms Hanna into a reluctant hero, inspiring herself and her friends to rise from the gutters of Eriksholm to become symbols of change.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Check it out for yourself in the Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream reveal trailer below</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w5sWLWF20uc" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>From Eriksholm's top-down 3D perspective, players will control the game's three protagonists to navigate through the city (aboveground and underground) while utilizing unique character skills, tools, weapons, and more to overcome enemies and complete puzzles. River End Games says players can freely move the in-game camera to survey the environment, plan their next steps, and execute strategies with perfect timing.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"All of us at River End Games are proud to finally reveal Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream to the world," studio founder and creative director Anders Hejdenberg writes in a press release. "This is just the first glimpse of what we've done, and we hope it will capture your hearts and minds, just like it has captured ours. We can't wait to show you even more in the future."&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Here are some screenshots from the game</strong>:&nbsp;</p>



<p>Eriksholm: The Stolen Dream will launch in 2025 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (via Steam and the Epic Games Store).&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The advertising bonanza formerly known as E3 continues into its second day with another set of streams. The Wholesome Direct was today's highlight, in my mind. The yearly collection of games that may or may not be cosy, but which definitely do not involve stabbing men in the neck, always contains some games worth keeping an eye on. This year was no different, and you'll find the archived stream below.

<p>I like the dark edge of Discounty, which takes the familiar shop simulation loop of stocking shelves and serving customers and puts it to work in service of creating a sprawling - and potentially exploiting and polluting - supermarket. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2274620/Discounty/">Steam page</a> warns that not everyone wants you to succeed, which seems only sensible.
</p>
<p>I also liked Littlelands, a cute action-adventure game about catching bugs, exploring caves, and searching for treasure. It's Zelda by way of Boku no Natsuyasumi, maybe? The announcement during the Wholesome Direct above included mention of a demo that would be playable today, although sadly it seems <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2083660/view/4146206204944399615">the developers have decided to delay it at the last moment</a>.
</p>
<p>Lastly, I loved the look of Spilled!. It's a relaxing game about cleaning up oil spills in your little tugboat, then upgrading the boat, and it has had a playable demo for a while. The announcement here was that its getting a graphics upgrade later this summer, following its successful Kickstarter earlier this year.

      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Yellow Brick Games [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/yellow-brick-games">Yellow Brick Games</a> has released a new trailer and screenshots for single-player third-person fantasy <a title="Genres > Action [1,908 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,540 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure game</a> <em><a title="Games > Eternal Strands [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/eternal-strands">Eternal Strands</a></em> dubbed “The Enclave.” <span id="more-890104"></span></p><p>“In this trailer, we wanted to show a glimpse of the various creatures to fight, armors to craft, and environments to explore that the world of the Enclave has to offer,” said Yellow Brick Games director Frederic St-Laurent B. in a press release. “With the massive challenge it presents, we can’t wait to see how players will use their creativity when facing a giant flying epic such as the Ashpeak Drake. Climb up and hold on, Brynn. Watch out for those barrel rolls!”</p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p><strong>New Flying Epic <a title="Companies > Creature [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/creature">Creature</a></strong></p><p>Following a preview of the Ark of the Forge boss fight with his massive flaming hammer last April, Yellow Brick Games unveiled a new fire-based creature in the latest trailer: the Ashpeak Drake. This colossal foe introduces a new dimension to combat mechanics, demonstrating that players can not only climb these 25-meter creatures but also battle them mid-flight as they soar around the world. So far, three fire-based Epics, each with distinct styles and abilities, have been revealed. Six more creatures remain to be discovered, each boasting unique appearances and different magical powers.</p><p><strong>Custom Combat Style</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The new trailer also provides a glimpse of the customized armors and weapons players will be able to craft with the loot they gather. In the constantly changing environment that is the Enclave, players will encounter environmental events like flash freezes and droughts, requiring adaptation with the right materials for combat readiness. Players can also define their own playstyle by taking on the challenge of mastering the art of ice, telekinetic, or fire magical weapons.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_890105"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>The World is Your Weapon</strong> – At the heart of <em>Eternal Strands</em> is a revolutionary new system for gameplay interactions: heat spreads, cold chills, and real-time destruction allows for unprecedented reactivity in combat. Hurl burning tree trunks at enemies with telekinetic, snap nearby trees to block opposing fire, or channel raw telekinetic force to rip boulders from the ground.</li><li><strong>Weaver of Magic</strong> – Wear the Mantle, a magical cloak that channels raw magic into raging flame, chilling ice, and telekinetic force. Combine your growing array of powers with enchanted weapons and armor crafted from slain enemies to create a custom look and style. Block incoming attacks with a wall of magical ice, lash out waves of flame from a massive two-handed blade or turn a dragon’s fiery breath against ice-covered minions.</li><li><strong>Stand Against Giants</strong> – Face gigantic adversaries and defeat them through a mix of sword, spell, and mobility. Leap onto and climb their massive forms to attack from different angles. Shatter armor or slice at weak spots to diminish their protection. Use ice to pin limbs of a towering foe, arcane flames to burn their fur, or catch lobbed projectiles and turn their attacks back upon them in battles that will leave scars upon the land.</li><li><strong>Unstable Climate to Master</strong> – <a title="Companies > Enhance [31 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/enhance">Enhance</a> the effectiveness of your ice abilities during a flash freeze to open up new paths. Use a heatwave to start a wildfire and watch it spread towards enemies as it consumes the tinder-dry trees and grass around it.</li><li><strong>A World Rich with Secrets</strong> – Explore the wilds, the capital city of Dynevron, and the secrets beneath as every surface is climbable.

We also learned that players can get their hands on it before its August launch.</p>

<p>Dustborn stars Pax, an ex-criminal with the unusual ability to weaponize words. As in, words are literally power for her as she can fight with shouts or manipulate people in conversations. While Pax can crack skulls using a bat and create new shouts to battle enemies, the game also focuses on building relationships with her crew of misfits (who have their own special powers). Set in an alternate Neo-western version of the U.S., you’ll travel across the country to transport an important package under the disguise of a traveling punk band. Check out its new trailer below.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ogIq4hscX0" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>If Dustborn piques your interest, you can play a 30-minute demo next week during Steam Next Fest from June 10-17. Dustborn launches on August 20 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.</p>

<p data-characters="432" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The long road to the launch of the anticipated <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake is coming to an end, as the official <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fill-your-eyes-with-a-silent-hill-2-remake-trailer-and-its-release-date/">release date</a> was finally revealed last week (with the title, probably predictably, set to come out just weeks before Halloween). But there’s a bit of a stink in the air surrounding the game, and it seems like this modern take on one of the most influential horror releases ever is going to have to be pretty much perfect.</p> <p data-characters="421" data-current-count="421" data-injectable="true">In the current era of remakes, remasters, and re-imaginings, it can be easy to feel a little bogged down by an industry that’s too eager to tick the nostalgia box rather than deliver something fresh. However, a quick look at games like <em>Resident Evil 4</em>, <em>Dead Space</em>, <em>Final Fantasy 7</em>, and the work Nightdive Studios has been doing on classics like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/quake-iis-nightdive-remaster-is-live-right-now/">Quake 2</a></em> shows there’s still room for it in the market, it seems.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Silent Hill 2 - Release Date Trailer | PS5 Games" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sU3pyYi5hz0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="196" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true">But despite the excitement that should be surrounding Bloober Team’s <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake, there are a number of doubts that are putting the whole project under a lot of pressure to succeed.</p>
 <h2 id="h-reigniting-the-influence" data-injectable="false">Reigniting the influence</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="476" data-current-count="776" data-injectable="true">There’s an argument to be made about not fixing something that isn’t broken. As one of the most influential horror games of all time, remaking it is surely a tall order. <em>Silent Hill</em> – especially the second one – has made its mark on the genre, preserved in the annals of gaming history as a staple of how to create something atmospheric with lashings of delicious psychological torment to go with it. To some, the second installment is the perfect horror game.</p>
 <p data-characters="467" data-current-count="467" data-injectable="true">That’s not to say it can’t be done. You only have to look at Capcom’s remake of <em>Resident Evil 4</em> to see there’s scope for revitalizing older games to give them another go in more modern eras. Much like <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, the original <em>RE4</em> has been hugely influential, which renders a potential remake a dangerous line to tread, but we know it can be done. However, there’s one thing that’s probably crossed people’s minds about it.</p>
 <p data-characters="569" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true">What’s the connection between these remade franchises: <em>Resident Evil</em>, <em>The Last of Us</em>, and <em>Dead Space</em>? They were all done by the developer who created the original. Maybe not the exact same people, but certainly the studio itself. With <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, it’s being made by a different team entirely; one that, although it has a reputation in the horror sphere – as well as being influenced by Team Silent’s work – was not even around when the original was released. Placing a remake of a beloved game into the hands of another is an exercise in trust.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">What we’ve seen so far</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="600" data-injectable="true">The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/silent-hill-transmission-october-19-2022/">Silent Hill Transmission that took place in 2022</a> had a lot of people excited. Finally, after years of speculation and dormancy, Konami’s horror series was getting new games, a new film, and more attention than ever before. Would this be the triumphant return many of us had been hoping for?</p>
 <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="296" data-injectable="false">But the outpouring since then has left much to be desired. The interactive <em>Ascension</em> has not stood as a bastion of achievement in terms of rejuvenating the <em>Silent Hill</em> name. <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/silent-hill-ascension/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metacritic</a> is currently showing a user score of 0.8 out of 67 reviews, with the likes of IGN giving it just 50 out of 100.</p> <p data-characters="468" data-current-count="764" data-injectable="true">Perhaps less tragic – though still not really noteworthy – was this year’s <em>A Short Message</em>. Although it’s done better than <em>Ascension,</em> with a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/silent-hill-the-short-message/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metacritic</a> review score of 53 and a user score of 6.3, it leaves the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake with a lot of slack to pick up. <em>SH2</em> is not a brand-new entry in the series, but it’s seemingly going to have to do more than coast on nostalgic reputation alone given what we’ve seen of the reemergence so far.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Bloober Team’s track record</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="444" data-current-count="744" data-injectable="true">Whatever your thoughts on Bloober Team, the studio has managed to make a name for itself in the horror genre, despite going up against the likes of Naughty Dog, Capcom, and even Frictional Games of <em>Amnesia</em> fame. But this esteem is not without its criticism. Bloober has a knack for visual quality and a disturbing aesthetic that has pricked up a few ears, but there are some problematic things about the developer that people can’t shake.</p>
 <p data-characters="453" data-current-count="453" data-injectable="true">This <a href="https://www.techradar.com/features/six-years-after-layers-of-fear-bloober-team-still-cant-get-mental-health-right" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TechRadar</a> article from a couple of years ago laments the studio’s inability to represent mental health in any agreeable way. The troubled artist from <em>Layers of Fear</em>, the protagonist in <em>The Medium</em> who was abused as a child; there’s a sense that the developer uses these angles as a demonizing tactic, and it’s unclear whether Bloober has learned from this. The writer of that article <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/pm86ed/can_somebody_explain_to_me_why_bloober_team_is/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">does not appear to be alone</a> in such criticisms.</p>
 <p data-characters="565" data-current-count="565" data-injectable="true">Given that <em>Silent Hill 2</em> deals quite heavily with trauma and psychological issues, there’s bound to be concern that a remake from the <em>Layers of Fear</em> studio could encounter similar backlash. However, if Bloober is aiming for a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-team-interview-faithful-dreadxp/">faithful recreation of the original</a>, then such issues should not be a problem, right? But therein lies a further question: why remake something like-for-like (only with modern visuals and control schemes) without an injection of new sensibilities, mechanics, techniques, the developer’s own flavor, etc.? Answers on a postcard.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">It’s not <em>P.T.</em></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Sabukaru.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="700" data-injectable="true">We all miss it. We all wonder what the final product would have been like, especially with Hideo Kojima and Guillermo del Toro’s names attached. Although it’s been ten years since <em>P.T.</em> came and went, it still hangs in the air to some extent, and it’s likely the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake will get compared to the canceled project. But maybe I’m doing Bloober a bit of a disservice.</p>
 <p data-characters="477" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="true">A game with such recognition and high praise is going to be the subject of scrutiny when it comes to releasing an official remake of it. Taking a beloved franchise and handing the reigns over to a studio that’s not without its fair share of detractors is likely going to draw a bit of ire regardless. Everyone’s going to be watching Bloober Team on October 8, and I don’t think it’s beyond the realms of possibility that some may be scathing by default.</p>
 <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true">Personally, I think some of the current negativity surrounding the remake is a little unfair, likely down to a frustrated audience that wants to see this new era of <em>Silent Hill </em>succeed. But I think – judging by some of the YouTube comments posted on the video linked above – things are in danger of bordering on nasty, maybe even verbally aggressive, from a fan base that’s hungry for blood.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="578" data-current-count="878" data-injectable="true">Maybe there’s some legitimate criticism of what we’ve seen in trailers and teasers so far. <a href="https://aftermath.site/silent-hill-2-remake-maria-outfit-sexy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This article</a> dives a little deeper into some of the design choices of the remake, with particular reference to how changing the clothes of Maria detracts from her significance as a duplicitous femme fatale who reminds James of his dead wife. How much of this is simply the wailing sound of “dudebros” upset that a female character has been modernized to look less sexual, as opposed to this new look missing the point of the original’s intent, is not clear.</p>
 <p data-characters="549" data-current-count="549" data-injectable="false">At any rate, Bloober is under a lot of pressure to make sure <em>Silent Hill 2</em> is pure and flawless; not one iota less. If it strays too far from the original, it’ll displease the older fans. Similarly, if it’s a 100% retelling of the 2001 release, it’ll feel a little pointless (see also: the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psycho_(1998_film)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1998 shot-for-shot remake of <em>Psycho</em></a>). If it doesn’t straddle the line between freshness and nostalgia, but with a fair representation of the game’s themes, the backlash could be brutal. Honestly, it feels lose-lose at this point.</p>

			<p>At Summer Game Fest, we checked out the tactical first-person shooter game Delta Force: Hawk Ops. The game will feature a premium 'Black Hawk Down' campaign mode and two free-to-play multiplayer modes: the large-scale PvP Havoc Warfare and the extraction shooter Hazard Operations. Following <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-hands-on-preview-timi-studio-goes-next-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our hands-on preview</a>, we interviewed lead developer Leo Yao, who revealed that the game is entering early access in October with a projected release window in early 2025. It will be available on PC (where there's an Alpha test scheduled next month), consoles, and mobile devices.</p>
<p><iframe title="Delta Force: Hawk Ops | Official Summer Game Fest 2024 Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WkSYEuGzFss?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Why did your team decide on Delta Force as the franchise that you wanted to create a new title for?</strong></p>
<p>Delta Force is very popular in China's net cafes. In college, we usually played Delta Force with our friends. When we knew there was a chance that we could acquire the IP, we just rushed to get it. We think this is a very good IP.</p>
<p><strong>Can you describe the tactical gameplay that players will experience in Delta Force: Hawk Ops in a bit more detail?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Firstly, we have different Operators who have different skills. The battles are not very arcade-like like some other fast-paced FPS games. Especially in the mode you have played today, the pace is not that fast. You have to observe first, then use some of your team's skills and cooperate with your teammates. In some of the very fast-paced traditional games, like Call of Duty, you just rush and shoot, right?</p>
<p><strong>What modes of communication are there in Delta Force: Hawk Ops, whether it's voice chat, text chat, pinging on a map, or anything else?</strong></p>
<p>Sure. We have a good quality-of-life design. We have voice and text chat, and we encourage people to communicate and cooperate at all times. Also, when your teammates get down, you can revive them or move them to a more secure position.</p>
<p>Also, as part of the gameplay of the extraction shooter mode, chests can be acquired. If one of the teammates gets this, all of your team's gonna get a reward to encourage people to collaborate toward a singular goal. Furthermore, it is indeed possible to ping the locations, the items, or the bosses so that all teammates can have a mutual target.</p>
<p><strong>In the extraction mode, can you drop a weapon on the ground and have your teammate pick it up?</strong></p>
<p>Sure. But you can't drop very high-value gear to give to your teammates. The risk there is that some of the people would just help the other players by gifting them high-value items, so there's gonna be some of the limitations on that.</p>
<p><strong>To modify or customize your weapon, are you only spending in-game currency, or do you pick up new customization items, like a different scope for your weapon?</strong></p>
<p>We only use in-game currencies.</p>
<p><strong>If you have a gun, can you find a scope anywhere in the world and add it to your gun while you're playing?</strong></p>
<p>If you mean the accessories, those are only bought with in-game currency.</p>
<p><strong>Yes, but can you find the accessories during matches, as a regular item in the extraction mode?</strong></p>
<p>Sure. But in the two game modes of Delta Force: Hawk Ops, it's separated. In the large-scale PvP mode Havoc Warfare, there is a progression system where if you level up, you unlock a lot of different weapons and different attachments. In the extraction shooter Hazard Operations, you can loot some of the attachments, and then you can directly use them on your guns.</p>
<p><strong>In Havoc Warfare, as you level up, are you leveling up a specific weapon and unlocking attachments for that weapon, or are you leveling up your character as a whole, which unlocks everything?</strong></p>
<p>I think we support the weapon experience card to unlock specific weapons. So you get a lot of the weapon experience card, which we already use in Call of Duty Mobile, which is very good. People can just get a lot of the experience card after a match and can use that on any of the specific weapons to upgrade it.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have something similar to Call of Duty's Pick 10 system for your loadout, where you can only select a certain number of attachments and items to bring with you?</strong></p>
<p>No, we don't have something like that. You can have two weapons with every attachment on.</p>
<p><strong>How do players unlock or earn new Operators?</strong></p>
<p>It's through some of the events or some of the progression systems, but we don't make them premium. All operators are free. You only pay for the cosmetics.</p>
<p><strong>Will you have a battle pass?</strong></p>
<p>Sure, we have a battle pass.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have two separate tiers (free and premium)?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Yes. The premium battle pass includes a higher level of cosmetics.</p>
<p><strong>How long will a season of Delta Force: Hawk Ops last?</strong></p>
<p>For now, it should be one and a half months to two months.</p>
<p><strong>That sounds very similar to Call of Duty Mobile. With a new season, what kind of new content would you add?</strong></p>
<p>Firstly, new maps, new operators, new weapons, new vehicles. We did a lot of similar things in Call of Duty Mobile: maps, operators, weapons, and vehicles.</p>
<p><strong>What engine are you using to develop the game?</strong></p>
<p>For the Black Hawk Down campaign mode, we use Unreal 5 because we're using Lumen and Nanite. For the multiplayer modes, we use Unreal 4 because they are also on mobile and Unreal 4 is very good for cross platform.</p>
<p><strong>Will you be launching the different versions simultaneously?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, and we share the progression. For now, we don't encourage people to matchmaking across mobile and PC and console, but we do mix PC and console as the other FPS games do.</p>
<p><strong>If you purchased the premium battle pass on PC, do you get that battle pass on mobile as well?</strong></p>
<p>Sure. We share that.</p>
<p><strong>How do you unify the platforms?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>Players will use a Level Infinite account.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have a release window?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, early access should be in the fourth quarter, and our expectation is that the final release will be in Q1 next year.</p>
<p><strong>How can players enter the early access?</strong></p>
<p>In October, we will open early access on Steam. We also encourage people to give advice or suggestions to us as we listen to the feedback, and we will continue to polish the game.</p>
<p><strong> Can players use keyboard and mouse controls on consoles? </strong></p>
<p>Ah, that's a good question. It is always a very tough question. For now, we only matchmake controller with controller and keyboard &amp; mouse with keyboard &amp; mouse.</p>
<p><strong>Are you planning to support gyroscopic aiming on mobile?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Nice. That is a very popular feature I often use in Call of Duty Mobile. Do you have a target resolution or frame rate for consoles? </strong></p>
<p>Yeah, that's a good question. I think we should support 4K. Okay. And the framerate should be 60 at least, and we support unlimited.</p>
<p><strong>Have you talked about which consoles you're supporting, whether it's just current gen PlayStation 5, Xbox Series SX, or are you also supporting PlayStation 4 and Xbox One?</strong></p>
<p>That is a very good question. So, for now we are considering PS5 and Xbox Series X. But we found there is potential to also support PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. I think we hope that we can support all of the consoles, but it's hard work because, to be honest, we didn't have much console experience before. But on PC, we can support very low-end devices like the GTX 960.</p>
<p><strong>Are you planning to make Delta Force: Hawk Ops Steam Deck compatible?</strong></p>
<p>We don't have that plan for now, but we'll surely support it in the future.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk a little bit about the campaign? Like how long it is or how many chapters it will be?</strong></p>
<p>The campaign is basically the Black Hawk Down film. Because we have the copyrights of the film, we use some of the cutscenes from the film.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have any of the actors from the film doing voice work?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, and we also have the soundtrack of the film. It's a very classic song soundtrack. At first, we only considered a single-player campaign, but now we want to support co-op, maybe at most three people's co-op. It's going to be a very hard campaign.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have the operator system for the campaign, or are you playing one specific person?</strong></p>
<p>No, we don't share the operator from the other two game modes.</p>
<p><strong>Great. Well, thank you both very much for your time.</strong></p>

Make deals with gullible monsters. Seduce attractive elves into one-night stands. Everyone is expendable, most of all, the band of happy bastards you recruit as mercs to take all the risks while you enjoy the high life. Because in this world, you make a name for yourself through the loot you find, the monsters you kill, and how badass of a show you put on. How will YOU forge your path to fame?</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->

		<p>Goat Simulator 3 is set to receive its first significant DLC on June 19th, named “Multiverse of Nonsense.” Coffee Stain North announced the DLC at the Future Games Show, introducing a new realm for players to engage with, with the goal of restoring balance to the multiverse by gathering gems dispersed within rifts that lead to all sorts of places.</p>
<p><iframe title="Goat Simulator 3 – Multiverse of Nonsense | DLC Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vI5Tll-iujo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Santiago Ferrero, Creative Director at Coffee Stain North, said, <em>“We know what you’re thinking – Multiverse? No one has been bold enough to explore such a complex theme with goats just yet. But that’s what we do at Coffee Stain North. We push the boundaries of next generation goat simulation technology, and we can’t wait for our players to explore some of the most exciting content we’ve worked on since Goat Simulator 3 itself.”</em></p>
<p>The “Multiverse of Nonsense” DLC for Goat Simulator 3 takes players on a journey through various locations such as a cartoon town, a city named Goatroit, where goats act like humans and humans act like goats, and a mythological mountaintop city. This expansion introduces new gear for your goat, and a crossover with another title from Coffee Stain Publishing has been teased, though specifics remain under wrap.</p>
