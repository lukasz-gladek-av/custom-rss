            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/27/24353227/sony-m10s-inzone-oled-burn-in-warranty<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Sony is upping the limited warranty on some InZone gaming monitors to three years and is <a href="https://www.sony.com/electronics/support/televisions-projectors-monitors/sdm-27q10s/articles/00350326">tossing in OLED burn-in coverage</a> for the 27-inch M10S. The company announced the additional coverage today after launching both the InZone M10S OLED and M9 II LED in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/24/24253167/sony-inzone-gaming-monitor-m10s-480hz-oled">September</a> with only one-year limited warranties out of the box. Sony says other than that, the limited warranties remain as they were.</p><p>Manufacturers have long been averse to talking about burn-in or have outright categorized the phenomenon as ‚Äúnormal use,‚Äù denying warranty claims to fix it on various panel types. However, OLEDs have historically been more susceptible to burn-in, especially when used with many static images like those from a PC. In recent years, OLED has improved to be less sensitive to burn-ins.</p><div><p>Sony is the latest in a trend of manufacturers adding burn-in coverage. Alienware was one of the first to specifically include OLED burn-in within its three-year coverage on the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/9/22966303/alienware-curved-aw3423dw-qd-oled-34-inch-quantum-dot-pc-gaming-monitor-hands-on">QD-OLED monitor launched in 2022</a>, and for its latest 27-inch 4K model <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335564/alienware-27-inch-4k-240hz-oled-price-date">coming this year</a>. And in 2023, The Verge‚Äôs Sean Hollister asked LG to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22336413/lg-27gr95qe-b-oled-gaming-monitor-review#:~:text=Originally%2C%20LG%20wouldn%E2%80%99t%20confirm%20that%20to%20me.%20In%20fact%2C%20the%20company%20had%20originally%20reserved%20the%20right%20to%20reject%20warranty%20claims%20if%20this%20monitor%20experiences%20burn%2Din">explicitly warrant the company‚Äôs OLED monitors</a> against burn-in and they agreed and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23827701/lg-oled-burn-in-warranty-two-desktop-monitor-windows">changed their verbiage</a>.</p></div><div><figcaption><em>A Samsung representative on this Best Buy product listing says the three-year warranty on the 32-inch Odyssey OLED G8 covers burn-in.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot: The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Since then, companies like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/7/24064465/asus-rog-msi-oled-monitor-warranty-burn-in-cover-expanded">MSI and Asus</a> have also pledged to cover OLED burn-in on some models, including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/2/24334049/asus-samsung-msi-27-inch-4k-oled-240hz-monitors">their latest ones</a> (in some countries). It‚Äôs important to research the warranty included in the model you‚Äôre buying to determine whether burn-in coverage is included. For instance, Samsung‚Äôs website shows a general policy for its warranty that <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/support/legal/LGL10000300/#standard-limited-warranty">excludes burn-ins</a>, however, an online rep <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/questions/samsung-32-odyssey-oled-g8-g80sd-4k-uhd-240hz-0-03ms-smart-gaming-monitor-with-hdr-silver/6573686/question/2a8f4805-d47e-3416-9cec-dad034fbce5b#:~:text=OLED%20Safeguard%2B%20helps%20prevent%20burn,year%20warranty%20for%20this%20model">confirmed it does cover it on a 32-inch Odyssey OLED G8</a>. However, the company still <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/2/24334049/asus-samsung-msi-27-inch-4k-oled-240hz-monitors#:~:text=Samsung%20hasn%E2%80%99t%20confirmed%20its%20warranty%20situation%20for%20its%20latest%20G8%20model">hasn‚Äôt clarified</a> if burn-ins are covered for its latest 27-inch Odyssey OLED G8 gaming monitor.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>As Aftermath‚Äôs resident hardware freak, my goal is to tell you about tools that I have bought and thoroughly enjoy. Sometimes, this process requires weeks of in depth testing and modification. Other times, it‚Äôs a pretty simple suggestion. Today is the latter: I love my NT Cutter cutting tool. It costs just over six dollars, is incredibly versatile, and I use it basically every single day. You should get one.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Tokyu Hands (Flagship store), Shibuya | Virtual Shopping Tokyo" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IbpreAPHkio?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Here is an hour long tour of my favorite big chain in Japan. It's like I'm there. Skip to 10:49 for some pocket knives.</figcaption></figure></div><p>Of all the chain stores in Japan, the one I miss the most outside of combinis like Family Mart and Lawson is the DIY chain <a href="https://info.hands.net/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hands</a>, formerly known as Tokyu Hands. For Americans, imagine if Michaels, The Container Store and the now defunct Bed Bath and Beyond fused and was seven stories tall.&nbsp; Imagine a building full of all the tiny, beautiful tools needed to make hyper detailed Gunpla and model trains, do woodworking, and cook. The one in Shibuya has a map that looks like it came out of <em>Metroid</em>. I daydream about it sometimes.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>An NT Cutter Premium Evolution PMG series. I got this because I can't find my other knife and it costs slightly more. </figcaption></figure><p>I did not buy my NT Cutter at Hands, but going there does impress upon you how alienating and boring the experience of going into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category_killer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">category killer</a> craft or hardware store can be in America. It also shows you, in case you could not guess, that Japan takes its knives and craft tools very seriously. This extends beyond kitchen knives&nbsp; to small pocket knives like kiridashi and razor blades. Japan takes this stuff so seriously that every time I look for a new tool I often add ‚ÄúJapanese‚Äù to the end the way people affix ‚Äúreddit‚Äù to searches.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>These things come apart easily. They're simple, convenient and made in Osaka.</figcaption></figure><p>This is how I came across the much beloved NT Cutter and Olfa brands, the latter of which actually invented the iconic snap-off razor blade. Both OLFA and NT Cutter‚Äôs entry level items are quite cheap online, at around six dollars as of this writing. Both brands offer knives in a variety of colors and shapes. They both feature a notch at the end for snapping off the blade when it gets dull and a clip for fitting into a pocket. OLFA is well loved and you can‚Äôt go wrong either way, but I find the NT Cutter PRO AD-2P to be quite handsome with its distinctive red dot. I use mine every single day of my life and just ordered more because I lost mine somewhere; backups are so cheap that it‚Äôs basically a rounding error for me.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Japanese Cutting Tools üáØüáµ OLFA ‚Ä¢ NT Cutter" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5mSQUv3d4HA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>A comparison between various OLFA and NT Cutter tools. </figcaption></figure></div><p>This does not take anything away from American utility knives. X-ACTO makes a bunch of great tools, and I hear good things about Lenox. And for precision work like model crafting, I know a bunch of people who don‚Äôt even mess around with utility knives and go straight for medical scalpels. But for a tiny everyday cutting, the knife I go back to the most is my NT Cutter. I love that little guy so much.</p><figure><figcaption>As a total aside, NT-Cutter makes some kind of blade disposal pyramid that I really want now.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/phoenix-labs-fae-farm-developer-lays-off-majority-of-the-studio/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been announced that Phoenix Labs, a small indie developer that created Fae Farm and Dauntless have now laid off the majority of the studio in an announcement made on LinkedIn. It's uncertain how many staff were still working at Phoenix Labs during this time, as they also had layoffs in May 2024, where over 100 staff were laid off, and all projects were canceled. This was so they could focus solely on Dauntless and Fae Farm. Below is the message left by the company on LinkedIn today.</p>
<p><em>"Today is another difficult day at Phoenix Labs. We have made the tough decision to part ways with the majority of the studio as part of unfortunate but necessary changes to our operations.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>We recognize and deeply appreciate the contributions of every individual impacted. Their talent, dedication, and creativity have left an indelible mark on our company and our games.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>We will share more details in the coming weeks about what this means for Dauntless and Fae Farm. For now, our focus is on supporting those affected through this transition.</em></p>
<p><em>To our industry peers, we encourage you to reach out to these exceptional individuals - they are some of the best in the business."&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>At the moment, the full number of layoffs hasn't been announced, and as the statement says, details regarding Dauntless and Fae Farm will be released in the coming weeks. However, the mention of them in the announcement gives a sense of foreboding and that the games are likely to lose support or Dauntless will be taken offline due to lack of resources or revenue. Of course, this is all speculation, and it could be that those games will continue to be worked on, with updates released in the future.</p>
<p>These layoffs come just two years after being acquired by the blockchain firm Forte Labs. The dealings that came with being acquired by a <a href="https://wccftech.com/garena-acquired-phoenix-labs-dauntless-now-eyeing-mobile-release/">blockchain firm</a> led to a lot of questions and tense environments within the company, such as the fact that they were told to keep the purchase a secret, with <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-happens-when-a-secretive-blockchain-company-buys-your-game-studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">former employees having to sign NDAs</a>.</p>
<p>After this happened, Dauntless launched on Steam but was immediately criticized by those who played it due to the in-app monetization and erasing any previous progress made by players thanks to the Awakening update. As a result of this update, Dauntless currently sits at "Overwhelmingly Negative" on Steam.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/dauntless-hands-on-at-e3-2017/">Dauntless was highly successful</a> when it was first released in 2019, with the game initially launching on the Epic Game Store, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4. It was a title funded and published by Epic Games. For the time, cross-platform functionality was a selling point of Dauntless. However, that is increasingly more common nowadays and is no longer a special feature for players to look out for.</p>
<p>Already, this month has seen a significant amount of layoffs, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-closes-uk-studio-lays-off-185-staff/">Ubisoft also laying off staff today</a> and closing one of their studios. It doesn't look like it'll be slowing down any time soon.</p>

The games are about killing thousands of orcs using traps, swords, and bows. They have never cost much, always been solid, and stuck pretty close to their straightforward, satisfying formula. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195734" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What‚Äôs Coming Out Beyond Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="157" data-playlist="195734,196411,195189" data-current="195734"><div><p>The Week In Games: What‚Äôs Coming Out Beyond Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195734/195734_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21246.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>But the latest game in the series, <em>Deathtrap</em>, does shake that recipe up.

And once again these orcs come in massive waves and funnel through maze-like maps that you can fill with deadly traps and barricades to create spots that kill all of them while you stand by and watch. In past games you completed levels in a set order and reached the end of the game that way.</p><p>However, this time around, the game is more like a roguelike and you end up replaying maps with randomly generated modifiers activated. You might have to deal with bigger enemies or you might be unable to revive co-op team members. Between waves of enemies you pick a randomly offered bonus or ability, like extra damage, which stays with you for the rest of that run. Runs are made up of two or more randomly generated missions and a harder boss fight featuring even more orcs and more places to put traps. Finishing runs earns you skulls that can be used to upgrade your traps or unlock new skills.</p><p>In theory, the random features should add to the replayablity of <em>Deathtrap</em>. But the problem is that, while in past games each new level led to a new map, here you end up playing on the same maps a lot. In fact, you‚Äôll likely play on the same maps a few times during a co-op session. And that, coupled with the fact that you now have a limited number of barriers to place (which can change where orcs travel), means you‚Äôll likely ‚Äúsolve‚Äù a map once and just more or less do that every time you play it again.</p><p>Sure, the modifiers can change that up a bit, but it does start to feel like a grind. And to actually to beat the game, you‚Äôll need to do a lot of grinding to get all your traps boosted up and your skills maxed out. </p><p>Don‚Äôt get me wrong, <em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap</em> is still a good time with a friend, and building a giant kill-box filled with a dozen traps all firing at once to massacre a horde of orcs in seconds is still very satisfying. But I do hope that a future <em>Orcs Must Die!</em> sequel returns to the level-based formula while sprinkling some of the roguelike elements from this one on top. Like a good, cheap burger that‚Äôs not missing the ketchup and is also improved with some bacon or better cheese. </p><p><em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap </em>is out January 28 on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC. It‚Äôs also available day one on Game Pass. </p><p> . </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer expressed support for Nintendo--and hinted that Xbox games will be coming to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>--in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAl5yVpNc3o">recent interview with GamerTag Radio</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"I want people to be able to experience the games that we build, the services that we offer, on as many devices as we can," Spencer said of Microsoft's push to put Xbox games on as many screens as possible.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAl5yVpNc3o" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mAl5yVpNc3o" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"We're really taking the approach of, 'We want people to be able to play Xbox on many different screens,'" Spencer said. "We're not gonna put walls up around where people can engage with the great games our studios are building, or where they can experience Xbox through different forms. Whether it's cloud [gaming], whether it's on PC, whether it's on handheld, whether it's on phones... I want everybody to be able to play on Xbox, and it does mean more of our games shipping on more platforms, not just on PlayStation. We love the work that we do with Nintendo, we love what we do with Valve on Steam, and that's what we're going to continue to do, we'll just continue to do more of it because what we learn is, 'Put the games first, make sure the games can be as great as they can.'"</p><p dir="ltr">Spencer said he wants players to choose the hardware that's right for them, and while he'd ultimately like to see that hardware be Microsoft-made, getting Microsoft's games in front of a wider audience is ultimately the more important goal. Spencer said that part of the reason for this is simply the level of success reached by games that are available on multiple platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">"I always applaud the moves that [Nintendo] makes," he declared, adding that he's "really looking forward to supporting [Nintendo] with the games that we have [at Xbox]." Spencer even said he personally congratulated Nintendo CEO Shuntaro Furukawa on the announcement of the Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">"I just think they're such an important part of this industry," Spencer said of the Japanese gaming giant. "Who would ever bet against the success of that team? I mean they are just masterful in what they do--Switch is a massive success--and I think Switch 2 will be as well."</p><p dir="ltr">"More and more, that's an important thing [as a player], that my save game travels to whatever screen I want to play on, that my community's always there, and I just think that should be an expectation for all of us: That the games we invest in are able to be played on any screen that we want to play them on."</p><p dir="ltr">"We love the experience on our own hardware, our own platform," Spencer said. "But our games will show up in more and more places, no doubt."</p><p dir="ltr">Microsoft is currently working on its own handheld gaming platform, but it's reportedly still <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-handheld-device-is-a-few-years-out-apparently/1100-6527758/">a few years away</a> from release. The publisher has already made several of its games available for the Switch, and it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-coming-to-switch-2-and-ps5-in-2025-alongside-gears-flight-sim-and-more-report/1100-6528744/" data-ref-id="1100-6528744">rumored that Halo: The Master Chief Collection will be coming</a> to the Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Spencer also discussed other topics, like the lessons Microsoft learned from the launch of the Xbox 360, his favorite game of 2024 (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metaphor-refantazio/">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>), and handling player feedback.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's how I learn, it's how I stay balanced," Spencer said regarding the way he deals with critical feedback from Xbox users. "Getting out of my bubble of the people I see every day I think is critical."</p><p>The 26-minute interview can be watched in full on GamerTag Radio host <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAl5yVpNc3o">Danny Pe√±a's YouTube channel</a>.</p>

			<p>Today, Techland <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-confirmed-for-this-summer-as-franchise-celebrates-10th-anniversary-with-new-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> several Dying Light news as part of the franchise's 10th anniversary. Events and updates are coming for both games, and the next title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-qa-techland-on-the-games-origins-the-return-of-kyle-crane-vehicles-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Beast</a>, is landing this Summer. More unannounced projects are already in the works, and Techland is also preparing board games and a comic series.</p>
<p>To dive into all of that and much more, we had a nice, long chat with Dying Light Franchise Director Tymon Smekta≈Ça. Keep scrolling to read the transcript; we've also embedded today's episode of the Dying to Know show for those who haven't watched it yet.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dying To Know ‚Äî Celebrating 10 Years of Dying Light" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CvqFjEILJao?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>We've read the press release, of course, but please give us an overview of the key announcements today.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smekta≈Ça:</strong> We are actually having a very special day today at Techland because it's the 10th anniversary of the release of the original Dying Light. It's a series with quite a long history. Not all the games are lucky enough and fortunate enough to be able to celebrate that.</p>
<p>In today's stream, we talk and reminisce a little bit about where we are with the franchise. The celebrations are basically packed with a lot of activations for fans. All of this starts today in both games. For Dying Light, we decided to go with a medley of the most liked, the most respected, and the favorite events from the history of that game. There's HyperMode, Super-Crane, all the stuff that players have come to love over those 10 years. Then next week, when we are at the same time celebrating the third anniversary of Dying Light 2, we'll start an anniversary celebration for that with a set of bounties, goals for players to achieve that will provide them with rewards that refer back to the whole series.</p>
<p>Of course, we want to use this as an opportunity for players to check out Dying Light if they haven't already done so. So, both games have cool promotions on all platforms. At the same time, we are also announcing that the series so far has reached 45 million players. It's something that we are very proud of. And we are also giving players a small update on our work forward for The Beast. We focus this period on the celebration of the anniversary, so we don't go into much detail regarding The Beast, but the stream will give players a very nice look behind the scenes on how we work on the game where we are. There will be some Easter eggs hidden for our community so they can discover that and see how the work progresses on the beast. We are also telling players that we have a couple of things planned outside of videogames, like board games. We are even announcing some new comic initiatives, but the main message is that Dying Light is celebrating its 10th anniversary as a series and that we feel strong about its future. We stick to our plan of growing the franchise and hope that one day, Dying Light will become the go-to zombie game for players.</p>
<p><strong>I also read that you're planning to release an update for the first game.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smekta≈Ça: </strong>That's part of the celebrations. Players will actually get two things from us. The first one is a kind of celebratory anniversary bundle where you can dress according to the occasion and also paint your buggy from Dying Light The Following in the same way. And yes, we are also preparing an update that will squeeze a little bit more from our graphics engine. It will also include the remastered soundtrack by Pavo Bashak. Don't expect a complete overhaul, but there will be a small update where we look at various areas of the game to try to squeeze a little bit more out of it, like increasing the resolution of textures here and there, improving the lighting, especially in dialogues, but it's a set of tweaks here and there that will just give the game a slightly nicer look.</p>
<p><strong>When is it coming?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smekta≈Ça: </strong>It will arrive soon. We're not revealing an exact date because this is basically a tech achievement to work with an engine that already has its years. So we didn't want to jump the gun too early, but it will happen very soon. We just want to make sure that when we announce the exact date, it will be delivered on that date. I think that's the best answer I can give you without kind of having to say, we missed the date for a few days, but it's going to happen soon.</p>

<p><strong>Looking at the new Dying Light roadmap that you put in the press release, you confirmed that The Beast is coming in the Summer. I guess you must be very close to finishing the game. Is it content complete yet? Is it just polishing at this point?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smekta≈Ça:</strong> Yes. One small thing that I said at today's anniversary is that we have basically finished recording the voice lines. We'll have all of them in the game within a few days. We are definitely in a stage where the game is complete, and we are just trying to look at all of its areas and polish as much as possible. I would say we are mostly focusing right now on general quality and seeing how we can improve the look at this particular location or this particular set of enemy animations. We are also at the stage of making a proper, final balance pass on everything, so it's shaping up to be a really nice experience. We still have a few playtest rounds ahead of us, so we'll see what will come from that, but I don't expect anything more than maybe another set of tweaks, pulling the knobs here and there to make sure that everything is ready for the launch.</p>
<p><strong>You said Summer, but that's three months. Could we narrow it down a bit more, like early Summer or late Summer?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smekta≈Ça:</strong> I don't want to answer that question. I think that at Techland, we have a history of being a little bit optimistic and saying days that we then had to move a little. Every developer has that. The game will definitely be released in the Summer, but you'll have to wait a little bit longer for the final date.</p>
<p><strong>Alessio Palumbo: Okay. I had to try. You're still working on Dying Light 2 as well, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smekta≈Ça:</strong> Yes, of course, absolutely. The roadmap also reveals our plans for this year. We are definitely sticking to the promise of supporting the game for five years. We are moving strong in the third year. I think we have found a rhythm that is comfortable both for us as developers and for our community. We have four big events each year. In every quarter of the year, there's a nice big event inside Dying Light 2, which brings new activities, new rewards, new cosmetic items, and at the same time, in between, we release slightly smaller updates.</p>
<p>New weapon types are coming. We plan to introduce a set of technical improvements mostly inspired by our work on The Beast. I would say we definitely managed to improve our tech for The Beast, so we plan to bring back some of those improvements to Dying Light 2 at some point this year. In the second half of next month, on February 19, we plan to release an update that will bring the Tower Raid. It's a co-op mode, which we worked on over the course of last year, but this time, it's going to stay as a permanent addition.</p>
<p>It's something quite unique for us. We created it as a response to players' requests and we plan to work on this and develop it further. We're waiting for feedback from our community. We are also introducing a set of improvements to our prologue and the initial hours of the game. We are making the story and player progression a little bit more seamless because we have realized that there are a couple of bumps, some tricky moments in the initial hours of the game. Since it still brings a lot of new players, we wanted to ease it out a little bit, make it more engaging and flowing more naturally for players.</p>
<p>We also plan to look again at and energize our content creators. As you know, Dying Light 2 is one of the unique games where we have released our tools for players to create their own maps and, at the same time, we made those maps easily accessible both on PC and consoles. I think there are maybe three, four, five games that really do it. We have some ideas on how we can direct and help our content creators to create premium content for the UGC part. When I say premium, of course, what I mean is high quality, not paid, because this is a part of the game that will stay absolutely free forever.</p>
<p>Going back to the Tower Raid, I think it's also worth noting that over the course of last year, we gave players access to it on two occasions for a few weeks. The goal was to treat it as an early access, open beta type of thing. We wanted to gather feedback and players' expectations. The permanent version of the Tower Raid will be an answer to that. It will be accessible from the main menu, so you don't have to be in the open world to access it.</p>
<p>Players will get to choose one of four characters with their own progression trees, skills and roles. Since it's a roguelite experience, it will change with each attempt, giving players access to different floors, different enemy combinations, sets of mutators, and so on. If they succeed, the loot they earn will then be usable in the classic open world part of Dying Light 2.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of co-op improvements are you making to the game outside of the Tower Raid mode?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smekta≈Ça:</strong> I would say those are mostly focused on technical stuff and making it easier for players to connect. Dying Light 2 was never intended or envisioned as a fully online game. We realized that we missed some features on the matchmaking front. It's a little bit harder, it takes a few too many steps to connect with your friends to create a group and play together. Post-launch, Dying Light 2 has received more and more content that supports, promotes, or is just fun to play with your friends or in co-op groups, so we wanted to make sure that players would be able to connect more easily. We also looked at the user interface to make sure that it's easier to understand what's happening to other players, where they are, and what kind of level they are.</p>
<p>We feel that this is something that we want to explore. We realized that we don't have as many things to play for players in co-op as probably would make that form of playing the game even more popular, so we'll be looking at this side of the game for any future ideas that we'll have.</p>

<p><strong>You mentioned <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-will-get-mod-tools-techland-looking-for-ways-to-deliver-mods-to-console-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Community Maps</a>. What kind of improvements are you going to make to that area of the game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smekta≈Ça:</strong> I think they are already quite integrated and very accessible thanks to our partnership with mod.io, which delivers those super cool tools that make access to maps created by the community in a very easy way. We managed to have them available both on PC and consoles, and especially the consoles part is something that requires a little bit more effort. Not every developer is willing to go in that direction, but for us, it was very important to keep our community intact. The community maps are already available on PC and consoles, and the map creators have access to all of those players when they make their creations. Now, we are growing and improving our relations with the content creators, talking to them every day and trying to understand what kind of features they are missing and what kind of additional options, abilities, and opportunities they would like to have on the editor side.</p>
<p>We have a team that is trying to deliver that to them as quickly as possible. But at the same time, we realize that maybe we could help them a little by coming up with ideas and directions for what they create. Aside from a set of technical editor side tweaks that will make creating maps easier and also iron out some of the kinks that happen when you download the maps, we also want to support the most talented map creators specifically and individually to make sure that they are able to deliver their vision. This way, we hope that the maps that they will create will just get better.</p>
<p>We have had a lot of discussions with a lot of those people where they say, okay, we want to make this kind of map. We have this idea for it, but we were able to make it only up to this point because we are missing a feature or two to fully realize our vision. What we intend to do this year with Dying Light 2 mods is to get more intimate with those creators and deliver them the features that they need to fulfill their visions. For example, we have a map which is called Stadium. It is a set of sports events that use our mechanics. It's a great map, but when you start playing it, you quickly realize that it misses some features. There's a football match that you can try to play, with two goals and a ball, and you can play it with your friends, but then there's no mechanic that would allow you to count the score, so we talked to the content creator, and he told us that he didn't have the features needed to do this.</p>
<p>With this new approach, we'll look at a map with such potential and say, "Okay, let us help you, and we will deliver you a solution that will allow you to count the goals." That's just an example to present the mindset that we'll have for this year when working with the most talented map creators from the community.</p>
<p><strong>There are also new firearms and melee weapons on the way. Can you share something more about those?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smekta≈Ça:</strong> I think we don't want to kind of spoil the surprise, but definitely, this year will bring a number of new melee weapons and firearms. When you look at the roadmap and you see new firearms and new melee weapons, you can expect new items within the types that have already been established. And yes, we'll also add some new weapon types, both in the melee and the firearms sides, that we didn't have before.</p>
<p><strong>In general, are you happy with how <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-reloaded-edition-qa-franchise-director-talks-firearms-10-new-hours-of-gameplay-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">firearms have been integrated into Dying Light 2</a>? Because I know that was a big sticking point.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smekta≈Ça:</strong> I think we have managed to do that in a way that makes sense both for us and for our community. We feel that our implementation achieves one thing, which is actually a challenge for a game like Dying Light, where one of the pillars is first-person melee combat. We chose this as something that makes us unique, standing out on the market.<br>
Of course, we still think of new ways we can develop it and what more we can do with it, but Dying Light is a game built on melee combat and bringing firearms to it is a design challenge about how you want to implement them into the game so they don't overpower your core gameplay mechanic, which is first person melee combat.</p>
<p>And I think we did actually a nice job on it with various design decisions on how often players get access to bullets. What's the value of one bullet? Does it make sense to use it in every situation? Maybe not. Then also, with additional mechanics that are well embedded into the worldbuilding where if you make noise, you wake up the zombies, making it always a double-edged sword. Then, it supports and builds up on our other gameplay pillar, which is parkour and being able to traverse with great agility. We created this loop where it's okay for you to use firearms, but you cannot stay in that place for long because the zombies will come and maybe when they do, you will have to use your parkour to run away or maybe even parkour to find a better shooting position.</p>
<p>Of course, we had firearms in the first game, so we have some experience in that regard. I think we'll be using both of those experiences in The Beast. I think the relation between melee weapons and firearms is even stronger in that game because the firearms are introduced to the player from the beginning. It's not like we did in Dying Light 2 where it was a game without firearms and only at some point did we add firearms to this already built mechanism. With The Beast, it was slightly easier because we knew from the start that, of course, we'd have firearms there. We are also increasing our range of firearms in that game. So far, we have mentioned that we'll have a grenade launcher. We have also shown a bit of flamethrower, and that's not all, as we have more announcements coming on that front.</p>
<p><strong>You also revealed that the franchise has a number of unannounced projects in the works.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smekta≈Ça:</strong> Yes, we wanted to use the anniversary occasion to affirm to our players that the future is bright, and we're definitely not stopping here. But we'll talk about those projects after the release of Dying Light The Beast because there's no denying that currently, our focus is on Dying Light the Beast and sticking to the support of Dying Light 2. So, we just wanted to give this little kind of heads-up to players that the future is bright, and we have ambitions for it.</p>
<p><strong>The franchise is going beyond games with board games and stuff like that, but did you look into TV or movie adaptations, which are increasingly active in the gaming industry? Was there ever anything that maybe could have happened or could still happen for the IP?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smekta≈Ça:</strong> Absolutely. We are still looking at all of our options here. As you can imagine, anything in this kind of glossy Hollywood area takes a little bit more time than the creation of a board game or a comic. So, we are still considering our options. Nothing to announce at this stage, but this is an area where we are constantly having conversations and discussions about trying different approaches and seeing what we can do. Definitely, our belief is that it has the potential to take off outside of games. I think that with 28 Years Later, we'll see a slight renaissance of the zombie setting in pop culture, and I think it makes a lot of sense for Dying Light to also be a part of it. But once again, there is nothing to announce at this moment.</p>
<p><strong>I guess you probably can't answer this, but I'm going to try anyway. A couple of years ago, you <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-techland-fantasy-game-new-concept-art-climbing-huge-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Techland was working on another IP, a fantasy franchise. It's been a while since that new franchise has been discussed. Could you confirm if it's still being made?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smekta≈Ça:</strong> Well, my role is Dying Light franchise director. I will let my friends speak about their project. I can answer all the questions about Dying Light, but I will not steal the shine from my friends at Techland. So, nothing to comment on this topic.</p>
<p><strong>It's just that, while I love zombie games, I also dearly love fantasy. So, it's something I would love to see eventually.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smekta≈Ça:</strong> Same here.</p>
<p><strong>Finger crossed. Just a final question. The Nintendo Switch 2 has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-officially-revealed-with-a-new-trailer-dedicated-direct-confirmed-for-april/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>, at long last. Are you looking into supporting it for Dying Light 2: Stay Human and/or The Beast? The first game was eventually released on the Switch.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smekta≈Ça:</strong> It's too early to comment on this because we have just basically learned the basics about the console, at least publicly. The only thing I can say right now is that I'm waiting for the orders on the Nintendo Switch 2 to open so I can secure my own version of it right away. But nothing to announce on this topic officially at this moment.</p>
<p><strong>OK, fair enough. Is there anything you'd like to add?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tymon Smekta≈Ça:</strong> I would like to say that it has really been an amazing journey for us and I think none of us at Techland realized that 10 years after releasing Dying Light we'd still be talking about the game and it would still be such a popular series which really left its mark the zombie genre in the open world survival horror genres. We really feel proud about our work on the game and the series, but we also understand that the series wouldn't be where it is today if not for our community and the players, 45 million of them who have spent their time with the Dying Light titles. So, if I may, I would like to thank all of our community and all the players who have enjoyed Dying Light over the years because we wouldn't be there without them. And it's a great honor to be able to deliver at least a slice of entertainment and fun to their lives. It's an honor for us. It's a pleasure for us and something that we are very grateful that this could happen.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

The company was founded in 2020 by former <em>Dragon Age</em> creative director Mike Laidlaw and a group of ex-Ubisoft Quebec developers. And with its first game, the studio is leaning on its developers‚Äô past.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/january-2025-game-release-calendar-ff7-rebirth-pc-1851730310/slides/10&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/january-2025-game-release-calendar-ff7-rebirth-pc-1851730310/slides/10"><em>Eternal Strands</em> is a large, map-based open-world fantasy action game</a></span> set in a new universe where people who practice magic‚Äîknown as weavers‚Äîare shunned from society after a horrible event scarred the world. The epicenter of that disaster is a large kingdom of weavers who locked themselves away and disappeared after all that destruction. You play as Brynn, a young woman who has joined a band of weavers determined to explore that locked-away kingdom and discover what actually happened. To do that, you‚Äôll need to explore various open-world maps, collect resources, craft better gear, fight a lot of enemies, and use your magic to survive.</p><p>If you‚Äôve played <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/immortals-fenyx-rising-the-kotaku-review-1845771449&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/immortals-fenyx-rising-the-kotaku-review-1845771449"><em>Breath of the Wild </em>or <em>Immortals: Fenyx Rising</em></a></span>, you‚Äôll be familiar with the type of game Yellow Brick Games has created. Its painterly visuals and character designs feel heavily inspired by the look of those other games. Similarly, the action RPG plays a lot like those games, too. You can block, dodge, parry, lock on to enemies, charge melee attacks to hit harder, and shoot arrows at far-away foes or items. And Brynn can climb practically any surface while you manage a depleting stamina bar that limits how far you can go before needing a rest (or falling). Yeah, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-the-kotaku-r-1850570840&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-the-kotaku-r-1850570840">you‚Äôve played games like before</a></span>.</p><h2 id="h641368"><a id=""></a>Magically blasting enemies off cliffs</h2><p>However, while <em>Eternal Strands </em>is clearly inspired by these past games, it also has its own ideas. A big one, literally, is that each map you visit (the world isn‚Äôt one big open world but a series of distinct locations) contains a massive boss enemy that can be defeated for rare resources. These enemies are truly huge. Usually, you can hear or see them stomping or flying around even when they‚Äôre way off in the distance. These bosses can be killed in standard combat or you can figure out a way to harvest them‚Äîlike climbing on them to attack weakpoints‚Äîto extract the rare energy you need to upgrade your magic abilities. And this is something you‚Äôll want to do because magic in <em>Eternal Strands</em> is awesome.</p><p>You start <em>Eternal Strands</em> with two powers: The ability to create ice walls to trap enemies or put out fires and a telekinesis power that can be used to grab items and enemies and hurl them around. As you progress you unlock more magic, including fire attacks and spells that let you drop gravity wells that suck enemies in and then blow up when triggered. Thankfully, all of these abilities feel really powerful right out of the gate and only get more powerful (and enjoyable) to use as you upgrade them.</p><figure id="" data-id="028c8da018164aca387abc4929158125" data-recommend-id="image://028c8da018164aca387abc4929158125" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Yellow Brick Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="028c8da018164aca387abc4929158125" data-recommend-id="image://028c8da018164aca387abc4929158125" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I especially want to call out the telekinesis power as it‚Äôs mighty powerful right at the start of <em>Eternal Strands</em>. You can straight up grab most enemies and toss them off cliffs instead of fighting them, though you won‚Äôt be able to collect any resources if you do this. One of my favorite video game moments of 2025 so far is grabbing a big object and using my magic power to shunt it at a group of tiny enemies, sending them all flying off in different directions like pins being hit by a bowling ball.</p><p>Sadly, this physics-based action and the ability to set nearly anything on fire or break almost any item or prop you encounter does lead to some wonkiness in <em>Eternal Strands</em>. I‚Äôve lost track of the number of times I flew off a cliff or boss seemingly for no reason. I also encountered issues with fire not always working to melt ice or burn structures. Or enemies getting stuck in debris or their pathing breaking in weird ways. Performance can also get rough if there are too many items breaking and too many enemies around at once.</p><p>There‚Äôs an overall sense that <em>Eternal Strands</em> is probably a tad too ambitious for the smaller team working on it. It‚Äôs like the game is <em>barely </em>being contained and at any point it could suddenly break, sending you flying into the air. It‚Äôs never so bad that the game is unplayable, but it might be too much for some players to put up with. At least the devs seem to know things can get wonky, and let you basically survive any fall from any height without taking much damage.</p><h2 id="h641369"><a id=""></a>Exciting exploration, but boring conversation</h2><p>Once you‚Äôre done tossing enemies around using magic, you‚Äôll eventually return back to your base camp, and this is where <em>Eternal Strands </em>differs from most open-world RPGs. While the locations you visit are big and varied, including swampy forests, caves, and destroyed cities, they aren‚Äôt filled with random quests or objectives to complete. Instead, each map has a few collectibles, a previously mentioned boss (that respawns), and enemies to kill.</p><p>As you talk to the other members of your weaver band back at camp, you‚Äôre given quests that will have you visiting these maps for different reasons, like collecting flowers at night or finding a blueprint in a specific area. Once you‚Äôre done with that, you return, bringing back all the crafting resources you collected. Each of these treks out into the world moves time forward between day and night while also possibly activating different weather patterns and events. One time, I returned to an early area to complete an easy little collecting quest but discovered a nasty magic storm created by a new, harder boss monster. Enemies were more powerful, making the quest harder, but there was rarer loot to be had as well.</p><figure id="" data-id="4593081f3bd27a56c917a5d4af999a33" data-recommend-id="image://4593081f3bd27a56c917a5d4af999a33" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Yellow Brick Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4593081f3bd27a56c917a5d4af999a33" data-recommend-id="image://4593081f3bd27a56c917a5d4af999a33" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Survive your trips out into the world and you return with all your loot. Die, and you come back to camp mostly empty-handed. This setup leads to a situation where as you spend more time in an area collecting good items while completing quests, you start to get nervous about dying and losing your resources. This tension makes combat against big bosses or enemy ambushes all the more exciting. This loop really got its hooks in me after a few hours, making me excited to go back out and get more crafting materials so I could upgrade my camp and improve my gear or even build brand-new weapons and armor.</p><p>It‚Äôs at this point that I‚Äôd love to tell you about how great the other members of your camp are and how talking to them is wonderful, but instead, a lot of the conversations with them are boring or worse, annoyed me. There are some standout moments with your camp leader and your archivist, but most of the time the chats with my camp felt like the vegetables I had to eat to get back to the sweet dessert of tossing trees at enemies and fighting big dragons.</p><p><em>Eternal Strands</em> is a very ambitious fantasy action RPG that‚Äôs inspired by some big-budget titles like <em>Dragon‚Äôs Dogma </em>and <em>Breath of the Wild</em>. The small team behind it mostly pulls it off thanks to a focus on dynamic, but not-too-big sandboxes to play around in, interesting boss fights, and a unique exploration loop that rewards adventurous players willing to take a chance. Sure, the physics don‚Äôt always work as expected and performance isn‚Äôt perfect, but <em>Eternal Strands </em>is fun enough to put up with these problems because when it comes together and works‚Äîwhich is more often than not‚Äîit‚Äôs an impressively fantastic game. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>BLAST has officially revealed the dates for the BLAST.tv Austin Counter-Strike 2 Major, which will be the first Major played in North America in more than seven years. The Austin Major will be the third since the release of CS2, but it will certainly be a historic one with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-confirms-cs2-major-expansion-and-rankings-based-invitations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the expansion of both the format and the number of invited teams</a>.</p>



<p>Between the new qualifiers, the three separate Swiss stages, and of course the playoffs, there‚Äôs a lot of CS2 to watch and a lot of dates to keep in mind. Here‚Äôs our breakdown of the full schedule for the BLAST.tv Austin CS2 Major.</p>

                <p>The Xbox Series S has faced its share of criticism, but Microsoft isn't pivoting away from the console. In fact, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer believes the Series S is part of what helps differentiate Microsoft in the market. The apparent clause at Microsoft that mandates developers support both Series X and Series S for games coming to the platform is not going to change, he said.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/c/savestateplus/home?newFreeMembership=true" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Destin Legarie</a>, Spencer said Microsoft has a "real advantage" right now thanks to the Series S because some of the most popular new platforms, including Steam Deck and ROG Ally, are more in line with the power and performance specs of the Series S.</p><p>"When we look at something like a Steam Deck or a ROG Ally, we've got this Xbox Series S version of the game that's more tailored to the device specs of a lot of devices that are getting introduced right now. I think that helps us," he said, going on to specifically mention the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Nintendo Switch 2</a> as well.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KK8xil5Uy0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-KK8xil5Uy0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>For what it's worth, Spencer separately told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAl5yVpNc3o" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamerTag Radio</a> that he's been in contact with Nintendo's president and plans to put Xbox games on Switch 2.</p><p>Asked directly if Microsoft could remove or amend the apparent "parity clause" between Xbox Series X and S, Spencer said (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xbox-boss-spencer-says-series-s-compatibility-requirement-isnt-going-anywhere/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via VGC</a>), "In a way, I think about it almost exactly the opposite way right now."</p><p>There has been ongoing commentary regarding the performance differences between the Series X and Series S. Quite a few game developers from across the industry have commented on the challenges that getting games to run on the lower-powered system present.</p><p>In the case of Baldur's Gate 3,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-in-development-for-xbox-but-theres-a-series-s-snag/1100-6511819/" data-ref-id="1100-6511819"> issues with the Series S edition held back the game's overall release on Xbox.</a> Stalker 2 developer GSC Game World, meanwhile, said it originally believed bringing the game to Series S was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2-dev-originally-thought-bringing-game-to-xbox-series-s-was-impossible/1100-6527193/" data-ref-id="1100-6527193">"impossible" due to the technical limitations of the console.</a> Concerns exist about how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> might run on the Series S, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-on-xbox-series-s-im-not-really-worried-take-two-boss-says/1100-6527625/" data-ref-id="1100-6527625">Take-Two isn't worried</a>. More recently, the developers of Black Myth: Wukong said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-developer-says-xbox-port-delay-is-due-to-the-series-s/1100-6528607/" data-ref-id="1100-6528607">Xbox port delay is due to the Series S.</a></p><p>In regards to sales volume, the Series S had outsold the Series X in the US since the systems debuted in 2020, but that's no longer the case, as the Series X now <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/september-2024-sales-charts-xbox-series-x-is-finally-outselling-the-series-s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">accounts for 51% of all Series X and S consoles sold stateside</a>. The Series S was more widely available than the Series X during 2020-2022 due to supply-chain issues amidst the pandemic, and this was one of the elements that played a role in the Series S jumping out to an early lead over its more expensive and more powerful sibling. By the end of the Series X|S generation, however, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-s-expected-to-outsell-series-x-according-to-xboxs-phil-spencer/1100-6483412/" data-ref-id="1100-6483412">Microsoft believes the Series S will outperform the Series X due to its lower price.</a></p><p>Spencer said in the interview that he believes the Series S is an important part of Microsoft's hardware offerings, saying it's no slouch and can handle new games capably.</p><p>"The scalability of engines today allows [games] to scale from ray trace-enabled, multi-thousand dollar graphics on desktop PCs all the way through to a handheld, battery-powered device. So for me, Xbox Series S has been helpful in our portfolio," he said. "I'm playing Indiana Jones on the S and it looks great. It's definitely capable of playing current-generation games in a great way."</p><p>The Xbox Series S has been important for Microsoft and will continue to be an "important design point" for Microsoft's teams going forward, Spencer said.</p><p>Also during his chat, Spencer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-on-ps5-isnt-ruled-out-xboxs-phil-spencer-says/1100-6529031/" data-ref-id="1100-6529031">discussed the possibility of Starfield coming to PS5</a>, while in a separate interview he talked about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-we-want-our-hardware-to-win/1100-6529028/" data-ref-id="1100-6529028">Microsoft's desire to "win" in the hardware market.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/horrified-dungeons-dragons-brings-iconic-monsters-to-horror-board-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ravensburger has announced a new entry in the Horrified series. The latest installment, Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons, is courtesy of a licensed partnership with Wizards of the Coast, bringing certain iconic dungeon-dwelling beasts to the board game series.</p>

<h2>The Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons Announcement</h2>

<p>In a press release, Ravensburger provided more details on <em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons. </em>As the name implies, the game will combine the core gameplay of the Horrified board game with the world's most popular TTRPG. This will be the fifth official entry in the <em>Horrified</em> series behind 2023's <em>Horrified: Greek Monsters</em> and 2021's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/horrified-american-monsters-board-game-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Horrified: American Monsters</em></a>.</p>

One of those monsters is the legendary Beholder, the many-eyed aberrations that have doomed many adventuring groups over the decades.</p>

<p>In addition, they will need to handle other game mechanics inspired by the RPG. Players will work together, encounter puzzle-like obstacles, gather item tokens, protect citizens, and avoid attacks. Also to immerse players into a detailed setting and story, each monster will have unique thematic challenges.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúThe extensive lore and world-building of D&amp;D enables players to embark on epic journeys as they quest to battle deadly foes, uncover secrets and make memories together,‚Äù said Dan Rawson, Senior Vice President, D&amp;D, RPG and Hasbro Direct at Wizards of the Coast. ‚ÄúConnection and storytelling are at the core of D&amp;D, and we‚Äôre always looking for new ways for players to immerse themselves in the fantasy realm. Bringing the franchise‚Äôs rich characters to something like Horrified, which features narrative-driven adventure and cooperative gameplay, just feels natural.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> will be available Summer 2025 at an MSRP of $29.99.</p>

And before we go any further, let me just be clear: Unless you have a spare Steam Deck to break open, don‚Äôt do this to your portable device. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://github.com/crastinator-pro/steam-brick&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://github.com/crastinator-pro/steam-brick" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Crastinator-Pro</a></span>, the impetus for creating the Steam Brick might not be what you expect. As explained on GitHub, the Steam Brick was created because the Steam Deck is too big to fit in Crastinator-Pro‚Äôs backpack. And since the Steam Deck was usually plugged into a TV or AR glasses when the modder was using it, they wondered how much smaller the device could be if it didn‚Äôt have a screen or built-in controls. To find out, they ripped one open and started gutting all the unneeded bits.</p><figure id="" data-id="007c6346bd87e729c0b84568dbcd07ad" data-recommend-id="image://007c6346bd87e729c0b84568dbcd07ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="007c6346bd87e729c0b84568dbcd07ad" data-recommend-id="image://007c6346bd87e729c0b84568dbcd07ad" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After some tinkering, the modder realized that they could remove all the inner boards and components related to the touch pads, analog sticks, buttons, and other controls and the Steam Deck would still work. They also removed the screen and any components and bits connected to it and it still worked. Next they printed out a small, basic plastic case and shoved what was left of the Steam Deck‚Äôs carcass into the box, sealed it up and added a USB port and power button and...there you go! A Steam Deck console.</p><p>Now, Crastinator-Pro makes it very clear that you probably shouldn‚Äôt do this yourself, calling it a ‚Äúvery bad idea‚Äù and further explaining that they were ‚Äúhonestly surprised‚Äù this worked. They say not to think of the GitHub post as a guide but instead as more of a ‚ÄúHow I Did It‚Äù post. And while the end result works for the modder‚Äîthey now have a tiny device they can toss in their backpack‚Äîthey aren‚Äôt sure how long the Steam Brick will keep working after all the modifications. </p><p>If you‚Äôre really wanting a Steam console, don‚Äôt do this.<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/everything-we-know-about-valves-fremont-console-and-rumored-steam-devices-2000536791&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/everything-we-know-about-valves-fremont-console-and-rumored-steam-devices-2000536791"> Instead, just wait for Valve to make one</a></span>. Rumors are swirling that Valve is currently working on a TV-based device that will run SteamOS and will operate like a Steam Deck for your TV. That sounds safer than using power tools on a Steam Deck to make it smaller. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dauntless-developer-phoenix-labs-lays-off-50-more-employees-with-studio-likely-to-close.1093191/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/phoenix-labs-layoffs-closure/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The remainder of Phoenix Labs developers have been laid off, with the studios game ‚ÄòDauntless‚Äô and it‚Äôs studio likely to close.</p>



<p>Speaking with now past-employee‚Äôs at the studio, it‚Äôs understood that around 50 employees have been made redundant today. Several of those employee‚Äôs now believe that the Dauntless game is now dead, and that Phoenix Labs is likely to shut down, although Parent company Forte has yet to make such an announcement.</p>



<p>According to those familiar with the situation, no one at Phoenix Labs still has a job with one person saying it was ‚Äúsurprising‚Äù that it was announced as round of layoffs instead of a studio closure.</p>



<p>Forte, a blockchain company, acquired Phoenix Labs around summer 2023 and in May 2024 made more than 100 of its staff redundant. Forte was asked to comment, but did not supply one in time ahead of publication. </p>



<p>Following the internal announcement, Phoenix Labs staff took to their Dauntless Discord server to make the announcement of redundancies, where it was said that ‚ÄúEarlier today, the majority of our development team was impacted by significant reductions at Phoenix Labs. This has been a heartbreaking decision for us, and we are deeply saddened for the talented individuals who are affected.‚Äù</p>



<p>The statement continued, ‚ÄúWe know you may have questions about what this means for Dauntless and its future. While we don‚Äôt have all the answers at this time, we are committed to keeping you informed and will share updates as soon as we can.‚Äù</p>



<p>‚ÄúYour support means the world to us, and we are truly grateful for this incredible community. Thank you for standing with us during this challenging time,‚Äù it concluded.</p>



<p>Phoenix Labs was founded in April 2014 and is best known for Fae Farm and Dauntless, with the company also having had multiple games in development before being cancelled by Forte after the studios acquisition. </p>



<p>The latest rounds of layoffs put 2025‚Äôs count well over&nbsp;<a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">500 known jobs lost</a>, with estimates having it over 700.

Here, the open-world RPG ostensibly improves its arguably disappointing technical performance and presentation issues on console by way of more powerful CPU and GPU combos available in the PC gaming world. It also launched as a Steam Deck-verified game, bolstering an alluring green checkmark on the Steam store page and even saw a promotional video from developer Square Enix touting Steam Deck playability with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/2kQnT3tADKw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/2kQnT3tADKw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a cute, feathery chocobo-themed Steam Deck</a></span>. But as many have found since release, while the game certainly ‚Äúruns‚Äù on the Deck, it‚Äôs far from an ideal experience. This prompts two questions: Should you bother playing <em>Rebirth</em> on Steam Deck? And, perhaps most importantly, is this what we should expect from a ‚ÄúVerified‚Äù Steam Deck game?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196131" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: November 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="328" data-playlist="196131,195905,195189" data-current="196131"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: November 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196131/196131_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21668.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I‚Äôve spent about half a dozen hours with <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> on Steam Deck, using the default settings (with one notable tweak to the framerate). I‚Äôve played up to the Junon section, the game‚Äôs second open-world environment, as I felt this would take me through enough combat, exploration, dungeon crawling, and cutscenes to establish an opinion on how well (or poorly) this game runs on Valve‚Äôs handheld. </p><p>In motion, I‚Äôm averaging a decent-enough 30 frames per second, often a bit more as I lifted the 30 FPS cap in the default graphics settings (which sets all visuals to ‚ÄúLow‚Äù on first boot and doesn‚Äôt feature any AI upscaling tech). Performance will dip into the teens at worst from time to time (moreso when I tried nudging some graphics settings up to ‚ÄúMedium‚Äù). Overall, the experience reminds me of what it was like to play your average AAA game on the Xbox 360 or PS3 during the tail end of their lives: Playable, but it certainly left you wishing your gaming box had a bit more digital horsepower. (Though admittedly, even at their worst, PS3 games typically had cleaner image quality in comparison.) I seem to be getting about two-and-a-half hours of battery life, too.</p><p>At an average of 30-40 FPS, the performance might just be good enough for you. But unfortunately, the image quality really struggles. More often than not, the game looks like‚Ä¶well, it‚Äôs just ugly. Here, have a look: </p><figure id="" data-id="7cad40c8a31e6612b65b5a41ce4e7ac3" data-recommend-id="image://7cad40c8a31e6612b65b5a41ce4e7ac3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth shows Cloud standing in front of a chocobo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth shows Cloud standing in front of a chocobo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot taken on Steam Deck OLED.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7cad40c8a31e6612b65b5a41ce4e7ac3" data-recommend-id="image://7cad40c8a31e6612b65b5a41ce4e7ac3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth shows Cloud standing in front of a chocobo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It‚Äôs not always this bad, mind you. Sometimes the game looks quite good for the form factor it‚Äôs running on. Have a look at a better shot:</p><figure id="" data-id="1a8709db17282172d822f5b2f5074328" data-recommend-id="image://1a8709db17282172d822f5b2f5074328" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Red XIII looks up at the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Red XIII looks up at the camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot taken on Steam Deck OLED.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1a8709db17282172d822f5b2f5074328" data-recommend-id="image://1a8709db17282172d822f5b2f5074328" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Red XIII looks up at the camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But then you‚Äôll move the camera and things will look fuzzy, jaggy, smeary, blurry, blocky, or whatever descriptive term you prefer. Draw distances look funky and dull, diminishing the bold natural beauty of the game‚Äôs world, which is unfortunate not just because it denies you the incredible visual spectacle the game is aiming for but also because that beauty has thematic meaning in-game: it is, after all, the beauty of the very in-game world the protagonists are fighting to save. On top of all this, I find the UI to be a bit too busy and small. And in <em>Rebirth</em>, you‚Äôll spend quite a bit of time menu-diving as you spec out your characters.</p><p>Still, <em>Rebirth</em>‚Äôs somewhat reliable framerate performance on the Deck has kept me playing the game, and I‚Äôll likely keep playing this way for a while as, right now, I‚Äôm just looking to dust off my rusty combat skills for a run at Hard Mode in the future (when I‚Äôll almost certainly play the game on a more powerful machine). </p><figure id="" data-id="a2a06bd584e978699a40b10b7967587b" data-recommend-id="image://a2a06bd584e978699a40b10b7967587b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cloud walks along a beam in the town of Kalm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cloud walks along a beam in the town of Kalm." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot taken on Steam Deck OLED.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a2a06bd584e978699a40b10b7967587b" data-recommend-id="image://a2a06bd584e978699a40b10b7967587b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cloud walks along a beam in the town of Kalm." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I find the game‚Äôs fusion of real-time fighting and command-based action in combat comes through well enough on the Steam Deck for me to keep going. In fact, given how much combat is in the game, and how much time you may wish to spend grinding the open world and Chadley‚Äôs training simulations, the Steam Deck version isn‚Äôt a bad portable companion to a proper PC experience, if you switch to that better hardware for the game‚Äôs more impactful narrative sequences. I could easily see myself grinding out some new weapon skills while playing on the train, only to switch over to my more powerful gaming machine to move the story along and enjoy those far better visuals once I get home.</p><p>If you travel a lot and have a high tolerance for visuals that range from ‚Äúmeh‚Äù to ‚Äúoh, god,‚Äù the reliable performance of <em>Rebirth</em> on Deck might be a compromise you‚Äôre willing to make‚Äîespecially if you‚Äôre an <em>FF7</em> super fan who will be won over by the story, music, and characters. </p><p>I do worry, however, about how well said performance will hold up across the rest of the game. Later combat sequences, such as one featuring multiple opponents in a large arena, or the more climactic, physically larger boss battles that feature way more flashy visual effects, could result in dips that might test your patience.</p><p>And despite being technically playable, <em>FF7 Rebirth</em>‚Äôs messy visuals yet again call into question what Valve is communicating by slapping the ‚ÄúVerified‚Äù green checkmark on a game. </p><h2 id="h638965"><a id=""></a>What should our expectations be for Steam Deck performance?</h2><p><em>Rebirth</em> isn‚Äôt the first game to usher in a conversation about whether or not Steam‚Äôs ‚ÄúVerified‚Äù status is as trustworthy as it should be. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/nLLiYXpFAHU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/nLLiYXpFAHU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023‚Äôs <em>Remnant II: From Ashes</em></a></span> brought up similar issues as it received a Verified status only to be a miserable experience for almost everyone who tried it on Valve‚Äôs portable gaming PC.</p><p>Valve has three tiers to indicate how playable a game is on Steam Deck. A white ‚Äúno‚Äù sign with ‚ÄúUnsupported‚Äù means that the game most likely will not run on the Deck (though many Steam Deck users have found ways around this). This can be because the game is simply too graphically intensive, or something about it simply doesn‚Äôt play well with the Deck‚Äôs behind-the-scenes Linux magic that tricks Windows games into thinking they‚Äôre on Microsoft‚Äôs operating system. A yellow exclamation sign with ‚ÄúPlayable‚Äù means that the game will almost certainly run, but either features text and icons that are just too small for the device‚Äôs screen or it‚Äôs a kind of game that really needs a full keyboard and mouse to enjoy. And then there‚Äôs the green checkmarked ‚ÄúVerified‚Äù status, which in theory should be an open invitation to enjoy the game on Steam Deck with no issues.</p><figure id="" data-id="e99beff2356bf7cdbd08fd05341ca97b" data-recommend-id="image://e99beff2356bf7cdbd08fd05341ca97b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cloud and Aerith stand in the town of Under Junon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cloud and Aerith stand in the town of Under Junon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot taken on Steam Deck OLED.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e99beff2356bf7cdbd08fd05341ca97b" data-recommend-id="image://e99beff2356bf7cdbd08fd05341ca97b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Cloud and Aerith stand in the town of Under Junon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That said, most gamers with at least some knowledge of CPU and GPU limitations probably do (and should) expect compromise on something as portable on Steam Deck. <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, for example, will run on Deck, but no reasonable person should expect it to do so with high graphics settings across the board and ray-tracing turned on. And while <em>2077</em> might run into some framerate troubles here and there on Deck, its visuals are way cleaner than what <em>Rebirth</em> offers on Valve‚Äôs mini-PC. During my time with <em>Rebirth</em> on Steam Deck, I also compared it to the visuals found on Kojima Productions‚Äô <em>Death Stranding</em>, which immediately offered a stark contrast to <em>Rebirth</em>‚Äôs fuzziness with much clearer depictions of its landscapes and highly detailed character models.</p><figure id="" data-id="31cde9c7b3024610a2d92b9b18a73c9d" data-recommend-id="image://31cde9c7b3024610a2d92b9b18a73c9d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sam Porter Bridges carries a dead body in Death Stranding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sam Porter Bridges carries a dead body in Death Stranding." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot taken on Steam Deck OLED.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kojima Productions / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="31cde9c7b3024610a2d92b9b18a73c9d" data-recommend-id="image://31cde9c7b3024610a2d92b9b18a73c9d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sam Porter Bridges carries a dead body in Death Stranding." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If we are to accept <em>Rebirth</em> as being worthy of the Verified status on Steam Deck, it seems clear that this is the very minimum of what we should consider acceptable, and such games should leave us asking just what kind of ‚ÄúVerified‚Äù a given game might be when we choose to purchase it. Why couldn‚Äôt <em>Rebirth</em> have been awarded ‚ÄúPlayable‚Äù status instead? To many, including myself, that would be a more accurate description and is certainly how I‚Äôd describe <em>Rebirth</em>‚Äôs portable experience. Then again, without that Verified status, Square Enix wouldn‚Äôt be able to advertise the game as such and Valve would have one less AAA title to proudly display as Verified on their popular device. It‚Äôs hard not to worry that ‚ÄúVerified‚Äù status can play too much of a marketing role for all parties involved when ideally, it should perhaps be a more scientific, objective assessment of what any given game is like on the Deck.</p><figure id="" data-id="6675bba95ac88cca3374297a69240123" data-recommend-id="image://6675bba95ac88cca3374297a69240123" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Chocobos stand in Junon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Chocobos stand in Junon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot taken on Steam Deck OLED.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6675bba95ac88cca3374297a69240123" data-recommend-id="image://6675bba95ac88cca3374297a69240123" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Chocobos stand in Junon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-13/playstation-5-pro-shows-futility-of-video-game-graphics-race&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-09-13/playstation-5-pro-shows-futility-of-video-game-graphics-race" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Video game graphics</a></span> in general have been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/26/arts/video-games-graphics-budgets.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/26/arts/video-games-graphics-budgets.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an increasingly complicated subject</a></span> of late.

<strong>UPDATE 8pm:</strong> Following the unintentional release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s upcoming Patch 8 on PS5, Larian has provided additional details and a recommended fix for affected players.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/unintentional-ps5-update-and-how-to-return-to-patch-7_133">post on the Baldur's Gate 3 website</a>, Larian offered more context for today's error, explaining, "Our partners have confirmed that some regions mistakenly received the Patch 8 build as an update to their live game version, in preparation for the Patch 8 stress test." The update, it said, was "only accessible for a few hours" and is no longer available.
</p>
<p>
For those that <em>did</em> receive today's download, Larian warns this version is unsupported and won't be updated until after the stress test, when Patch 8 is ready for its full release. It also notes affected players will likely experience compatibility issues with mods, and won't be able to access multiplayer when attempting to join users on Patch 7. As such, it recommends reverting to Patch 7 by uninstalling and reinstalling Baldur‚Äôs Gate 3.

<p>
Unfortunately, the studio also confirms saves made with Patch 8 installed won't be compatible with Patch 7, and it "cannot guarantee saves made in this version will remain compatible when Patch 8 is released." As such, players will need to return to an earlier save if reverting to Patch 7.
</p>
<p>
Finally, the studio notes players that received today's unintentional update aren't necessarily guaranteed access to the stress test. The test itself is due to begin this week, with invites going out to successful applicants in waves.

<p>
<strong>ORIGINAL STORY 6.45pm:</strong> Baldur's Gate 3's eagerly awaited Patch 8 is now live on PlayStation 5 - which has seemingly left developer Larian Studios a little perplexed, seeing as it definitely shouldn't be.
</p>
<p>
Patch 8, officially Baldur's Gate 3's final content update, isn't due to arrive until Larian has held its upcoming closed stress test. As such, Baldur's Gate 3 players on PlayStation 5 were more than a little surprised to see the game update to version 1.800.00 earlier today - and it turns out the studio was equally caught offguard by this turn of events.
</p><p>"No, the Patch 8 stress test hasn't yet begun," it confirmed in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/larianstudios.com/post/3lgqbpk3knc26">quietly exasperated post on Bluesky</a>. "Yes, PS5 players do currently have access to Patch 8. While we work with our partners to understand what's going on, please note that any new saves made while on Patch 8 will not be compatible with Patch 7... How's your Monday going?".
</p>
<p>
Patch 8 might be Baldur's Gate 3's final major content update, but it's still a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-is-getting-new-subclasses-cross-play-and-more-next-year">big one</a>, introducing 12 new sub-classes, cross-play, new camera features, and more. Given its scope, Larian previously explained it would be holding a pre-launch stress test in order to "help us catch things before they can become an issue once a patch has been released."
</p>
<p>
As such, Patch 8's premature launch on PlayStation 5 clearly isn't an ideal situation, saddling players with a version of the game that isn't yet ready for release, while putting the studio in a potentially tricky situation - seeing as reverting Baldur's Gate 3 to an earlier version could leave PS5 players with non-functional saves. We've asked Larian for comment.
</p>
<p>
Despite today's Patch 8 snafu, Baldur's Gate 3's stress test - which doesn't yet have a start date - is still on the horizon, and registrations <a href="https://larian.com/stress-test-register">remain open</a>. And for those players on other platforms who don't yet have access, there's always <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-gives-baldurs-gate-3s-withers-a-pair-of-big-naturals-to-celebrate-100m-mod-downloads">Withers "big naturals"</a> to keep them amused.

<p>Intel is one of the largest computer technology companies in the world. When it comes to consumer CPUs, it‚Äôs often in a neck-and-neck battle with competitor AMD for the processor market. </p>



<p>Because of that, Intel‚Äôs earnings reports are closely watched by investors, analysts, and consumers alike. That makes it important to know when the next one is, what time it starts, and how you can listen to it live. These quarterly updates provide insights into a company‚Äôs financial health, performance across key divisions, and general outlooks for the months ahead. </p>



<p>What is the health of Intel‚Äôs business? What are investors looking for in terms of revenue? Are there any concerns or roadblocks in various sectors? All that gets answered with each call.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-intel-earnings-report-date">When Is The Next Intel Earnings Report Date?</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/intel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Intel</a> is currently scheduled to deliver its fourth quarter (Q4) earnings for fiscal year (FY) 2024 on Thursday, January 30.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While some companies run an April-March fiscal year, Intel‚Äôs fiscal year goes from January to December, and ends on the last Saturday of the month. That means its fiscal year ended on Saturday, December 28th. The company‚Äôs quarters are structured as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>Q1: January ‚Äì March</li>



<li>Q2: April ‚Äì June</li>



<li>Q3: July ‚Äì September</li>



<li>Q4: October ‚Äì December</li>

<p>The next Intel earnings report is scheduled to start after trading closes for the day at 5PM ET/2PM PT on January 30, 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-listen-to-intel-s-earnings-report">How To Listen To Intel‚Äôs Earnings Report?</h2>



<p>If you want to listen to Intel‚Äôs quarterly earnings report‚Äîor just look over the numbers‚Äîyou can do so via the company‚Äôs website. Simply do the following:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to Intel‚Äôs <a href="https://www.intc.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Investor Relations webpage</a> </li>



<li>In the hero section, there will be an option to select ‚ÄúWebcast‚Äù</li>



<li>If you want specific financial results, hover over (or select if on mobile) ‚ÄúFinancial Info‚Äù in the menu bar</li>



<li>Then select ‚ÄúFinancial Results‚Äù</li>



<li>This will take you to a page with recent earnings calls, presentations, infographics, remarks, and more.</li>
</ol>



<p>If you want more than just the most recent earnings call and data, the ‚ÄúFinancial Results‚Äù page will have a catalog of the reports from past years, going back‚Äîas of writing‚Äîas far as 2002.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-intel">What To Expect From Intel</h2>



<p>When Intel releases its latest earnings, it will provide a number of updates on the state of the overall business. Details such as where things stand with its restructuring efforts, early returns from the release of its new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intel-core-ultra-9-285k-review-a-new-era-for-efficiency-but-is-it-right-for-you/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Core Ultra S CPUs</a>, the launch of its Intel Arc <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/intel-battlemage/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlemage graphics cards</a>, its growth in the AI space, and more will be discussed.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-last-intel-earnings-report">The Last Intel Earnings Report</h2>



<p>When Intel announced its earnings for Q3 FY2024, it announced that it‚Äôs year-over-year net revenue fell by 6.17% to $13.28 billion from $14.16 billion. Intel said that the decline in revenue was due to restructuring costs after laying off 15% of its global workforce along with more investments into different areas of research and development.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-company-earnings-calls">What Are Company Earnings Calls?</h2>



<p>Quarterly earnings calls are meetings held publicly traded companies to provide updates on their overall financial performance. Typically, these calls are open to shareholders, analysts, and media to call in and ask questions. The public, regardless if they‚Äôre a shareholder or not, is also able to listen to these calls live as they happen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alongside the calls themselves, companies will often put out a press release and presentation with important details included ahead of the call taking place. This allows investors, analysts, and media to prepare coverage or questions based on the information provided.</p>

Should this hold through the end of the trading day, it would be far and away the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2025/01/27/biggest-market-loss-in-history-nvidia-stock-plunges-15-as-deepseek-shakes-ai-darling/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">biggest single-day trading loss for a company in history</a>. Nvidia's previous $279 billion one-day dip is the existing record-holder.</p><p>Why is Nvidia stock tanking? The stock price had been surging for the past two years as investors felt bullish on the company's fortunes due to excitement in the market about artificial intelligence. Nvidia sells the necessary GPUs to train large-language models and for general AI use, after all.</p><p>But at the end of last week, Chinese AI start-up DeepSeek launched a new model, R1, that the company claims is far cheaper than other models out there, including Open AI's o1. The fear from investors, it seems, is that AI companies may not actually require as much computing power as it was once believed. This, in turn, could have spooked investors and sent Nvidia's stock price down.</p><p>Some of Nvidia's rivals in the AI space, including Arm and Broadcom, also saw their share prices slump on Monday. Stock prices regularly move, sometimes dramatically so, in response to relevant market announcements.</p><p>DeepSeek is not new, but instead was founded after a spin-out from hedge fund High-Flyer in 2023. <a href="https://github.com/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-LLM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DeepSeek's own paper</a> said its R1 model was trained for a cost of about $5.6 million, which is just a small percentage of what OpenAI and others are said to have spent on their systems. Because DeepSeek's systems have made strides in <em>software</em>, they could be less reliant on <em>hardware</em> like the GPUs that Nvidia sells, and some experts believe DeepSeek might signal a sea-change in the AI landscape.</p><p>The emergence of DeepSeek's new model comes not long after President Trump announced a $500 billion AI infrastructure program, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-ai-openai-oracle-softbank-son-altman-ellison-be261f8a8ee07a0623d4170397348c41" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Stargate</a>, led by investments from OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank. At least some of that appears to consist of existing investments that were previously announced.</p><p><a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/01/27/chinas-deepseek-ai-model-shocks-world-sell-nvidia/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">As Motley Fool points out</a>, there are some that believe DeepSeek is not being totally honest in explaining the true costs of its systems. AI researcher Nathan Lampert estimates DeepSeek's true training costs as being as high as $1 billion. Other AI experts, like Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang, believe DeepSeek and others actually have more Nvidia chips than they may be allowed to disclose given export rules.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/MorningBrew/status/1883901050010395123" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">From last week: Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang says that DeepSeek and other Chinese AI labs have more Nvidia chips than they can talk about because of current US export controls <a href="https://t.co/tPzmdEvvik" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/tPzmdEvvik</a></p>  ‚Äî Morning Brew ‚òïÔ∏è (@MorningBrew) <a href="https://twitter.com/MorningBrew/status/1883901050010395123?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The launch of DeepSeek hasn't gone totally smoothly for the company. <a href="https://chat.deepseek.com/sign_in" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">DeepSeek's own website</a> states that it's facing "large-scale malicious attacks" on its services just days after releasing.</p><p>Nvidia is the <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/#google_vignette" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 3 company worldwide based on market cap</a>, only trailing behind Apple and Microsoft.

		<p>Ubisoft has announced a round of layoffs, cutting 185 jobs from across its European studios, and closing one studio down completely.</p>
<p>UK-based Ubisoft Leamington is being shut down, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-studio-closure-as-it-lays-off-185-staff">Eurogamer reporting</a> that almost all of its 50 team members are being laid off. Beyond that, there‚Äôs also ‚Äútargeted restructuring‚Äù that will affect Ubisoft D√ºsseldorf, Ubisoft Stockholm, and Ubisoft Reflections.</p>


<p>In a statement given to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-cuts-185-jobs-in-a-bid-to-prioritise-projects-and-reduce-costs">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, a Ubisoft spokesperson said:</p>
<p>As part of our ongoing efforts to prioritise projects and reduce costs that ensure long-term stability at Ubisoft, we have announced targeted restructurings at Ubisoft D√ºsseldorf, Ubisoft Stockholm, and Ubisoft Reflections and the permanent closure of Ubisoft Leamington site.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this should impact 185 employees overall. We are deeply grateful for their contributions and are committed to supporting them through this transition.</p>

<p>The news comes less than two months after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/04/ubisoft-is-shutting-down-xdefiant-now-delisted-after-just-half-a-year/">Ubisoft announced the closure of XDefiant</a>, laying off team members from San Francisco, Sydeny and Osaka.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs no end in sight, it seems, for the struggles being faced across the industry. Earlier this month a Transformers game was cancelled, affecting <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/08/transformers-reactivate-has-been-cancelled-staff-to-be-laid-off/">Splash Damage</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/11/people-can-fly-suspend-project-and-layoff-120-employees/">People Can Fly also laid off 120 in December</a> after a project cancellation.</p>
<p>As always, our thoughts are with those affected by these layoffs, and we hope they can find new work soon.</p>
