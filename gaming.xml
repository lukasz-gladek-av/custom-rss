			<p>The biggest news of the week is undoubtedly <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/"><strong>Ubisoft</strong> undergoing a <strong>"<em>major reset</em></strong>" as a company</a>, shaking up its portfolio by cancelling six projects, including the <strong>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake</strong>, delaying <strong>seven other projects</strong>, and <strong>spinning up four new IPs</strong>; and that's just what we know happened to its portfolio. <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/"><strong>The whole structure of the company</strong> was shifted around to boot</a>, but through all of this mess, one long-running project survived: <strong>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</strong>.</p>



<p>A game that was said to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-evil-2-reportedly-still-years-away-from-release/">"<em>years away from release</em>"</a> after it had already been in production for <strong>14 years at the time of that report</strong> (which itself is now <strong>four years old</strong>) is still worth burning money on, according to Ubisoft. In fact, the company still believes that the game has something to offer that makes it a "<em>unique proposition</em>" when compared to other modern fantasy games.</p>



<p>"<em>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 remains part of our portfolio and our roadmap and fits with our strategy of focusing on open world adventures</em>," a Ubisoft spokesperson told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-long-in-the-works-beyond-good-and-evil-2-a-unique-proposition-in-the-open-world-adventure-market-studio-says">Eurogamer</a>, before continuing to say that fans of fantasy games are "<em>underserved</em>," and that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 remains a "<em>unique proposition</em>" for players.</p>



<p>We've known about Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 being in development at Ubisoft since <strong>2008</strong>, when it was first publicly revealed. Since then, the last time <a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-and-evil-2-revealed/">we saw an official trailer for it was at <strong>E3 2017</strong></a>. And while Ubisoft deemed the six to seven years spent on the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake were ultimately unsalvageable, the <strong>nearly 18 years it has spent on Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2</strong> clearly aren't in the minds of Ubisoft leadership. They were <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-still-hiring-beyond-good-and-evil-2/">even hiring people for the project <strong>as recently as last November</strong></a>.</p>



<p>(<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lost-nearly-95-of-value-in-eight-years-34-share-price-drop-after-major-reset/">This is the same leadership that led the company to lose <strong>95% of its value in the last eight years.)</strong></a></p>



<p>Ultimately, who knows if this game will ever come out. If it does, and it's a hit, that's great for Ubisoft and for the people who will have likely been waiting a full <strong>20 years</strong> for it to release. But it's more likely that no matter the quality of the final release, no game, Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 included, can live up to the expectations of a 20-year development period. If anything, you might find more people expecting the worst after it remained gestating for that long.</p>



<p>The fact that people are still working on it, and that there are still players waiting on it, is a testament to the mark left by the first game, which you can thankfully still go and play, and will be able to play for many more years now that a <a href="https://wccftech.com/beyond-good-and-evil-20th-anniversary-edition-confirmed-to-launch-on-june-25/">remaster of <strong>Beyond Good &amp; Evil</strong> is available</a>. But with every passing year, the idea of Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 releasing as a 'masterpiece of a video game worth the two-decade wait' is a pitch that becomes less and less convincing.</p>



<p>And that's all without mentioning the real kicker in all of this: by the time it comes out (if that day ever arrives), will anyone actually care? Which is to say, it's always a gamble when trying to bring back something old and make today's consumers who didn't grow up with it care about that thing.</p>



<p>Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 has been in development long enough to go to college, and it wouldn't be a surprise if today's generation of young players, who are more interested in playing 'forever games' like <a href="https://wccftech.com/top-five-played-games-in-us-2025-playstation-xbox-the-same-as-2024/"><strong>Roblox, Fortnite,</strong> <strong>Call of Duty, Grand Theft Auto V</strong> and <strong>Minecraft</strong></a>, couldn't care less about a game from over a decade ago they've only heard of in passing, if they've heard of it at all.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've done a fair bit of camping over the years, and I often had to deal with the disquieting possibility of something going wrong, dozens or hundreds of miles away from civilization. In our <em>The Gold River Project </em>preview, you'll get to see what it's like being stranded in the wilderness, where everything is not quite what it seems.</p><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/gold-river-project" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0e367eee-ab76-47df-bc21-b90a2431ae67" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>The Gold River Project</em></a> has you taking on the role of a person going on a camping trip. Fairview Games Inc. promises a survival adventure coupled with a thrilling mystery. The hints of something interesting are there, and I was curious to see if <em>The Gold River Project</em> could deliver on its promises.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The short time spend in the outfitter's store could have been a great tutorial; it feels like a wasted opportunity.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Arriving in Gold River</h2><p>Your adventure begins in a camping office where you can view brochures and look at some nice decorations. You're promised that supplies will be made available at your campsite; upon arriving, however, you find that the campsite is destroyed and you have nothing to your name other than the clothes on your back.</p><p>By all accounts, absolutely everything has gone wrong. The pilot who dropped you off via seaplane left without checking if everything was okay. Your supplies are gone. There are no other people around other than yourself (and if you're playing multiplayer, your friends).</p><blockquote><p>The tutorial seems a little too bare bones for this game, and the situation only gets more disappointing from there.</p></blockquote><p>A short tutorial directs players to their intended campsite and gives serviceable guidance for basic crafting. Once you've looted the area, you can then go wherever you like. If you paid attention, you'll find a note directing you to a cabin at the end of a nearby trail. You're walked through setting up a basic camp, and that's it.</p><p>I'm all for minimalist tutorials, especially in a game like this; a big part of the fun of survival crafting games is figuring things out yourself. That said, the tutorial seems a little <em>too</em> bare bones for this game, and the situation only gets more disappointing from there.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Your starting supplies consist of whatever you can salvage from this destroyed campground.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Crude Crafting and Survival</h2><p>Crafting in <em>The Gold River Project</em> uses a recipe unlock system; you need to research specific items to unlock crafting recipes using a "Learn" function in your inventory. This also destroys the item. In my first attempt, I couldn't find enough cloth to make a bed and had to restart.</p><p>I managed to find everything I needed on my second attempt and set up a small campsite at a nearby cabin. This cabin had a fishing rod and some animal bones inside. I destroyed one animal bone to learn how to make bone fishing hooks, and then I used the second animal bone to make them.</p><p>Much to my displeasure, I found that fishing did not work at all. Maybe I'm missing something, but the guaranteed spawn of these items and a nearby small dock implies that this would be a good place to fish. I spent a good 10 minutes on the shoreline with nothing to show for it.</p><p>Another issue I had was the inability to unlock a crafting bench. I still don't know what you have to research to unlock it, if the item even exists or functions correctly. This locked me out of many of the more interesting items for most of my short playthrough.</p><p>I had enough supplies where I felt comfortable exploring, but night was falling. I decided to go to sleep for the night and get moving in the morning, and this is where I encountered another problem: I couldn't figure out how to sleep to pass the night. I ended up waiting until the sun came up.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<h2>Hints of a Mystery</h2><p>My first in-game day was rife with problems, but I didn't want to give up on <em>The Gold River Project</em> just yet. A map in the visitor's center at the start of the game showed what looked like a fairly large playable area, so I decided to do a bit of exploring.</p><p>There are quite a few cabins, larger buildings, and other points of interest dotting the landscape. Most of these locations have some kind of useful loot, such as food or healing items. I found many items (such as batteries and electronics) that appeared useful but didn't immediately appear to have a use; they couldn't be researched, either.</p><p>Along the way, I found a few bits of lore. A cassette tape here, a handwritten note there. For the most part, though, I found a largely empty world devoid of any kind of meaningful objective other than surviving to the next day.</p><blockquote><p>I would have loved to explore the mystery in Gold River, but the barebones (and barely functional) survival and crafting mechanics killed any desire I had to continue.</p></blockquote><p>I didn't see much in the way of wildlife, either. At one point, I came across two deer next to a building that had a crafting bench inside it. As this was the only time I saw any animals, I strongly suspect that the appearance of these deer was scripted or otherwise pre-placed.</p><p>There was one element that really piqued my curiosity. Some of the buildings have cameras and spotlights on top of them. If you travel far enough, you'll encounter a futuristic force field keeping you in the playable area.</p><p>There's clearly some kind of high-tech surveillance happening here, and whoever is manning these cameras is definitely watching you. I would have loved to explore the mystery in Gold River, but the barebones (and barely functional) survival and crafting mechanics killed any desire I had to continue.</p><figure role="group">

<h2><em>The Gold River Project</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2><p>From what I've seen, <em>The Gold River Project</em> is a little undercooked. I can forgive a lack of story and a weak tutorial in an Early Access game, but I can't overlook the poorly functioning survival mechanics and crafting system.</p><p>To the credit of Fairview Games Inc., it's quite upfront that it intends for this to be a genuine Early Access experience where it can collect feedback from players and build out the game from there. It's good that this developer is being up front about that.</p><p>If you're keen on providing genuine feedback to a game that is very much still under development, you might want to check out <em>The Gold River Project</em>. If you're looking for a new survival crafting game to play and enjoy right now, though, it's probably best to wait until <em>The Gold River Project's</em> many rough edges have been smoothed out.</p><hr><p>The Gold River Project <em>was previewed over approximately 6 hours of gameplay on PC via </em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1253220/The_Gold_River_Project/" rel="nofollow"><em>Steam</em></a><em> with a key provided by the publisher.

            <p>The Saudi-led acquisition of Electronic Arts is meeting with more friction in the US House of Congress. 46 lawmakers have signed a letter calling on the Federal Trade Commission to investigate the debt-financed $55 billion deal for signs that it could be damaging for workers and anti-competitive to the point of breaking US anti-trust law.</p>
<p>As passed along by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/congress-members-voice-serious-concern-over-saudi-led-ea-buyout">Game Developer</a>, the letter has been organised by Labor Caucus co-chairs Steven Horsford, Debbie Dingell, Mark Pocan, and Donald Norcross – the Labor Caucus being a group of over 120 members of Congress focused on "advancing the needs of working people and the labor movement” in the USA. </p>
<p>Sent 22 January, the letter suggests that the acquisition could lead to cost-cutting measures such as layoffs, the offshoring of development, and studio closures. Which doesn't feel like a massive reach, to me: if the deal goes through, the newly private and majority Saudi-owned EA will <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eas-new-owners-are-making-a-huge-bet-on-generative-ai-cost-cutting-to-help-repay-a-20-billion-loan-claims-report">owe the banks $20 billion</a>. They definitely aren’t going to balance the books by delegating all their PowerPoint presentations to ChatGPT.</p>
<p>“We are committed to preserving fair, competitive labor markets and safeguarding American jobs, and given the impact of this acquisition on workers, labor market concentration, and the long-term competitiveness of the U.S. video game industry, we urge you to thoroughly review this transaction,” the lawmakers – all of them Democrats – write. </p><p>“Workers in the video game industry are already navigating an environment marked by instability, shrinking opportunities, and repeated rounds of layoffs,” the letter continues. “EA is one of the largest employers of video game workers in the United States, and evidence suggests the company already wields significant wage-setting power.” </p>
<p>The lawmakers note that EA has experienced “a steep decline in median worker pay year-over-year” and has “eliminated more than 1,700 U.S. jobs since 2023”, which they consider indicative of “a labor market where workers already have fewer alternatives and employers can impose deteriorating conditions without consequence.” They consider the aforesaid $20 billion debt package a strong incentive “for the acquiring firms to pursue further cost-cutting measures, including layoffs, offshoring, restructuring, or studio closure.”</p>
<p>The Labor Caucus co-chairs further argue that the acquisition could be both terrible for workers and anti-competitive, in that the proposed buyers – that’s Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund, private equity firm Silver Lake, and Jared Kushner's Saudi-backed Affinity Partners - “hold extensive ownership stakes across sports leagues, sports-betting platforms, talent management, and game-development tools”. </p>
<p>“For example, Silver Lake’s ties to WME and TKO, along with PIF’s ownership of LIV Golf, would put EA under the same umbrella as major sports and entertainment brands that its games rely on for key licenses,” the lawmakers write. They’re concerned that if the deal goes through – and given that Kushner is married to the President's daughter, it’s unlikely to have much trouble - the purchasing consortium and EA would control enough of the sports sector to “restrict worker mobility and reduce bargaining power for employees throughout the industry”. They also think it could violate anti-trust laws.</p><p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">Unveiled in September last year</a>, the EA deal has already attracted <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unionised-ea-workers-slam-billion-dollar-buyout-for-risking-layoffs-to-pad-investor-pockets-while-senators-worry-about-saudi-arabia-rewriting-us-history">strong criticism from American unions and senators</a>. The unions argue, amongst other things, that EA is “not a struggling company” right now, making hundreds of millions in profit. As such, they think plunging the company into debt is an exercise in padding investor pockets at the expense of worker livelihoods. Can’t really disagree!</p>
<p>Senators Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren, meanwhile, are worried that selling EA to Saudi Arabia is a national security risk, commenting that the country might use EA consumer data for surveillance and propaganda. As ever, I can see the logic of this, but it’s worth noting that EA among other North American companies routinely publish games that are very flattering to the US military, and that US companies <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cybersecurity-microsoft-idUSBRE96A11R20130711/">have participated in government surveillance operations</a>.</p>
<p>A broader concern is that Saudi Arabia are buying up overseas brands, including a number of eSports organisations, to distract attention from their <a href="https://www.amnesty.org.uk/saudi-arabia-human-rights-raif-badawi-king-salman">terrible human rights record</a>. There's also anxiety that the country’s authoritarian rulers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-eas-buyout-and-creator-exodus-the-sims-team-wants-you-to-know-their-values-and-commitment-remain-the-same">might impose their values on EA games like The Sims</a> that embrace diversity.

            <p>Ah, cool. The world's foremost hosts of unofficial <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> additions you'd rather not have to explain to an elderly relative, Nexus Mods, have committed to bringing SteamOS support to their mod manager Vortex at some point down the line. That'll mean you can use it with the Steam Machine and Steam Deck, if you fancy a modded playthrough on the go or via a smaller package.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/after-killing-its-multiplatform-mod-manager-nexus-revives-its-spirit-with-an-announcement-that-its-windows-only-app-will-support-steamos-in-future/">Parliament Candidate Gamer</a>, the modding site have slipped this confirmation into a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15433">post</a> about their focuses for this year. Upon opting to stop developing the multiplatform Nexus Mods App <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nexus-mods-latest-modathon-isnt-a-typical-modathon-its-a-first-go-at-the-same-for-multi-mod-collections">earlier this month</a>, the Nexus folks hadn't ruled out potentially working the Linux support that was planned to include into what's now their one and only mod manager - the Windows-only Vortex.</p>
<p>Now, they've announced that they're committed to delivering Steam OS support to Vortex at some point in the future. "We’ll be targeting vanilla Steam hardware like the Steam Deck and Steam Machine," product manager Iluviel wrote. "We won’t be officially supporting any other configurations, but as Vortex is an open source project community developers will be free to extend support for their preferred Linux distros as they please."</p>
<p>I can only imagine how chuffed our dedicated treehouse <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Machine</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-steam-deck-performance-settings">Deck</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-search-of-soul-with-the-steam-machine">enthusiast</a> James is about the idea of possibly having to have even more conversations with me on a weekly basis as a result of this. I can see his stoic expression now, as I gently poke him and declare: "That Thomas dragons mod for Skyrim runs great, you should analyse exactly how many frames per train carriage it's averaging". I can see his eyes rolling as I arrive at morning meetings wondering aloud whether I should shove a Steam Machine into a fairly titchy space just to get 40 minutes into a modded <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> playthrough for the millionth time before giving up.</p>
<p>Actually, I can see him aiming his liquid-cooled 4090 blunderbuss at me from across the virtual office as we speak. Hey man, what it it that you w-</p>
<p>Well, that was unpleasant, but I've dusted myself off so I can relay the other stuff Nexus Mods said about their future plans for Vortex here. "Our plans for the year include a steady, iterative modernisation of the Vortex user experience," they wrote. "We’ll be investing in the developer experience, which will allow us to focus on quality-of-life improvements, specifically streamlining navigation, simplifying game management, and introducing more intuitive controls for load orders. You can expect the interface to become cleaner and more responsive as we integrate the design lessons learned from our recent projects."</p>
<p>Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to pick large metal balls out of my face.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/palworld-pocketpair-steam-mhw-patch-pc-performance-2000662592</link>
            <guid>1414435</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Do you want to work on <em>Palworld</em>? Do you have an embarrassingly long Steam history to prove it? Will BioWare use a similar test to hire its new production director for <em>Mass Effect 5</em>? And can the next <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> patch finally fix performance on PC? It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint,<em> Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. This is my new favorite <a href="https://x.com/tct_adventures">behind the scenes game tease</a>. Game companies should spend less time firing people and more time being silly.</p> <h2>Gamers without Steam achievements need not apply</h2> <p>What makes a good game designer? For<em> Palworld</em> maker Pocketpair it’s people who play a lot of Steam games and can explain why their favorite ones are good. Don’t have a Steam game history? Don’t even bother applying. CEO Takuro Mizobe says people have to submit screenshots of their playtime and those without any are screened out.</p>

 <p>“In the interview, we ask them to explain the game mechanics of the titles that rank high in their Steam playtime, why they think those specific mechanics were adopted, and what makes that title stand out when compared to other games in the same genre,” Mizobe <a href="https://x.com/urokuta_ja/status/2014593734827246006">wrote on X</a> (via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/palworld-developer-pocketpair-requires-game-designer-candidates-to-provide-screenshots-of-their-steam-libraries-and-playtime-according-to-ceo/"><em>Automaton</em></a>). “Pocketpair is recruiting game creators who are true Steam gamers!”</p> <h2><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>‘ next big performance patch arrives next week</h2> <p>“This patch will include optimization improvements for Steam-specific processes and options to reduce processing load,” reads an <a href="https://x.com/MHStatusUpdates/status/2011732622435557475?s=20">announcement on the server status account</a> for an outage starting January 27. “It will also include a review of presets.” Another update will follow quickly after on February 18. Fans are hoping this is the one that finally makes a big difference with how the game runs on PC, especially after one modder apparently discovered <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-framerate-dlc-2000660149">a weird DLC check bug</a> that was killing framerates.</p>

 <h2>BioWare is hiring for <em>Mass Effect 5</em></h2> <p>“We are looking for a Production Director&nbsp;with a passion for the&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect</em>&nbsp;universe to serve as a high-impact leader on our next&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect</em> title,” reads a new job posting. “You will partner closely with creative leadership, studio teams, and internal and external partners to champion the game’s vision and ensure its execution at the highest quality bar.” That person will report directly to project lead Michael Gamble. “It’s gonna be awesome,” he <a href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/2014438853273387358?s=20">wrote on X</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Vampire Crawlers</em> will have a free demo next month</h2> <p>The <em>Vampire Survivors-</em>turned-3D-deckbuilder dungeon crawler spin-off will be free-to-try starting on February 23 on Steam and Xbox Game Pass. The 3D pixel-art genre mash-up has been looking very neat and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ael4oMaKQM">has a new trailer</a> explaining more of how its gameplay will work.</p> <h2>Epic has a secret $800 million deal with Google</h2> <p>“Epic’s technology is used by many companies in the space Google is operating in to train their products, so the ability for Google to use the Unreal Engine more fulsome…sorry, I’m blowing this confidentiality,” CEO Tim Sweeney told a court questioning its settlement with the search giant, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/policy/866140/epic-google-fortnite-android-unreal-deal-antitrust-settlement"><em>The Verge</em> reports</a>. The deal, which is for Epic buying Google’s services, is apparently related to “the metaverse” and will include both companies marketing one another’s products. It’s definitely not part of some sweetheart arrangement of the kind that Sweeney <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23996474/epic-tim-sweeney-interview-win-google-antitrust-lawsuit-district-court">previously railed against</a>.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-share-price-crash-prince-of-persia-ai-2000662169">Ubisoft’s stock is on life support&nbsp;</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-3-remake-ugly-alleyway-has-fans-concerned-graphics-downgrade-fix-mod-2000662269">Fans can’t figure out why one of the<em> Yakuza 3</em> remake’s back alleys is so ugly</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-steam-epic-games-publishing-deal-tim-sweeney-2000662259">Remedy defends Tim Sweeney’s honor over <em>Alan Wake 2</em> not being on Steam</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <p>The creator of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> VR mod, as well as a variety of other R.E.A.L VR mods, has taken his works down from Patreon after receiving another DMCA strike. This time, from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghostrunner">Ghostrunner</a> developer 505 Games.</p>
<p>Luke Ross, the creator of many VR mods for games including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>, Cyberpunk 2077, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> and others, issued a post on his Patreon explaining the situation to his supporters.</p>
<p>It reads: "DMCA law is carefully worded to give infinite power to big companies, who only need to write on a slip of paper that they 'believe' their copyright has been infringed in order to nuke from the sky anything they don't like -- and to give infinite headaches to creators like me, who instead have the only recourse of going to court, sustaining huge costs to get through the legal process."</p>

<p>The post continues: "In light of the above facts, I'm being forced to take immediate action. I'm making unavailable all versions of the mods and also all the posts related to the wonderful work we have done here together for years, so that there will be no ground for further claims."

"And since I cannot stop people from subscribing without closing down the account altogether, I'm making it clear on the About and Welcome pages that new subscriptions will have the only effect of supporting me and that no access to the 40+ conversions can or will be provided at this time." Ross also stated his Patreon account is at risk of termination due to repeated DMCA strikes, resulting in his decision to strip his account of all of his VR mods."</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-removed-by-cd-projekt-after-its-creator-wouldnt-release-it-for-free">This comes following a previous DMCA strike from CD Projekt Red</a>, which claimed Ross' Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod broke its fan works guidelines and as such was a breach of its intellectual property. Ross kicked back at the claim, but nonetheless took the mod down. He then felt he was being punished by pirates, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-vr-creator-says-hes-being-punished-by-pirates-after-mod-take-down">who were sharing around his work without contributing to his Patreon account to "punish" him</a>, according to Ross.</p>

<p>Vampire Crawlers fans can check out the game through a demo arriving for Steam and Xbox in February 2026. </p>



<p>A dungeon-crawling, roguelike deckbuilder spin-off of Vampire Survivors, Vampire Crawlers, was announced during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/vampire-crawlers-revealed-at-xbox-partner-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Partner Preview</a> event last year, with a Day One release set for Game Pass Premium and Ultimate. The title is scheduled to arrive in 2026, but could be delayed if the devs think it isn’t ready. However, whether it is ready or not, players can try out the game next month on Xbox and Steam through a new demo. </p>







<h2 id="h-vampire-crawlers-demo-announced-for-steam-and-xbox">Vampire Crawlers Demo Announced for Steam and Xbox</h2>



<p>As revealed through Episode 1 of “Let’s Explore Vampire Crawlers” on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Ael4oMaKQM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>, the demo for Vampire Crawlers will release on February 23 for Steam and Xbox. The video also talks more about the upcoming title, with the devs revealing the main focus this time is “fast turn-based combat”. The devs have recognised that one of the main complaints about some of the most popular turn-based games is that they can be slow and repetitive, and that’s what they want to change.</p>



<p>To circumvent this issue, many devs offer ways to speed up the gameplay by introducing “fast-forward” or “skip-animation” features. However, animations in the games are where all the fun lies, which is why in Vampire Crawlers, players don’t need to wait for the animation to complete to trigger the next abilities. What’s more, the game will not just attack enemies in the front, but will spread to all targets. </p>



<p>The new feature, called Turbo Turn, enables players to perform rapid attacks on enemies without requiring excessive resource management. This feature is particularly beneficial for beginners. However, there’s also something for veterans of the genre. As you play and progress, you can find relics and treasures that unlock new gameplay options involving the cards. Additionally, there’s a gem customization mechanic that allows players to enhance their cards with various effects.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">The creator of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekt-hits-paid-cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-with-dmca-strike-after-creator-refused-request-to-make-it-free-for-everyone"><u>the Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod CD Projekt recently hit with a DMCA strike</u></a> has paused his Patreon page and pulled access to all his mods after receiving another strike from a different publisher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Luke Ross, creator of the R.E.A.L. VR mods for games such as Elden Ring, Days Gone, and Far Cry, reportedly earns $20,000 a month through Patreon, which acts as a paywall for his work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He ditched work on his Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod following CD Projekt’s DMCA strike, and has now said he received another strike from publisher 505 Games for his VR conversion of 2020 first-person cyberpunk action game Ghostrunner. IGN has asked 505 Games for comment. Ross declined to comment further when contacted by IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ross’ Patreon page now carries a warning, telling potential subscribers that “for the moment there will be no benefits available.” That means that even if you subscribe to his Patreon, you won’t get access to any of the more than 40 mods he has locked behind it. Ross said he’ll keep his Patreon locked down “until the legal situation clears out.” Existing subscriptions will have their access extended for one month without further payments, Ross said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ross hit the headlines this month when Jan Rosner, VP, Business Development at CD Projekt Red, <a href="https://x.com/jan_rosner/status/2013219892405604457" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>tweeted</u></a> to say the company issued its DMCA strike because the Cyberpunk VR was a paid mod, which violates its fan content guidelines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We never allow monetization of our IP without our direct permission and/or an agreement in place,” Rosner said. “We were in touch with Luke last week and informed him that he needs to make it free for everyone (with optional donations) or remove it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are big fans of mods to our games — some of the work out there has been nothing short of amazing, including Luke’s mod for Cyberpunk 2077. We’d be happy to see it return as a free release. However, making a profit from our IP, in any form, always requires permission from CD Projekt Red.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ross <a href="https://x.com/LukeRoss_00/status/2013321528679473503" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>responded to Rosner’s tweet</u></a> to take issue with his work being characterized as fan content. Rather, Ross insisted, it is independent software and thus does not infringe on CD Projekt’s IP rights.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I'm sorry but I don't believe you are within your rights in demanding that my software needs to be free,” Ross said. “It is not ‘derivative work’ or ‘fan content’: it supports a large number of games which were built upon different engines, and it contains absolutely zero code or assets from your IP. Saying that it infringes your IP rights is equivalent to maintaining for example that RivaTuner violates game publishers' copyrights because it intercepts the images the game is drawing on screen and it processes them in order to overlay its statistics.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, Ross told IGN that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/creator-of-dmcad-cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-says-people-are-now-pirating-it-to-punish-him-for-breaking-cd-projekts-terms-of-service">people were now pirating his Cyberpunk 2077 VR mod to “punish” him for breaking CD Projekt's terms of service</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Over 50 Ghostrunner Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1qkavjg/luke_ross_removes_access_to_all_mods/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a new post to subscribers</a>, Ross said Patreon automatically complied with 505 Games’ alleged DMCA takedown notice for his Ghostrunner mod.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don't blame them,” he continued. “DMCA law is carefully worded to give infinite power to big companies, who only need to write on a slip of paper that they ‘believe’ their copyright has been infringed in order to nuke from the sky anything they don't like — and to give infinite headaches to creators like me, who instead have the only recourse of going to court, sustaining huge costs to get through the legal process.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ross said his Patreon is now under threat of termination because of repeated DMCA strikes, and must “avoid posting material that will subject your account to further claims of copyright infringement."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In light of the above facts, I'm being forced to take immediate action,” Ross explained. “I'm making unavailable all versions of the mods and also all the posts related to the wonderful work we have done here together for years, so that there will be no ground for further claims. And since I cannot stop people from subscribing without closing down the account altogether, I'm making it clear on the About and Welcome pages that new subscriptions will have the only effect of supporting me and that no access to the 40+ conversions can or will be provided at this time.”</p><span data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><div id="rank-cd-projekt-reds-games" data-cy="rank-cd-projekt-reds-games"><p><span><span><span><h3 data-cy="title3">Rank CD Projekt Red's Games</h3><h3>Rank CD Projekt Red's Games</h3></span></span><span></span></span></p></div></span><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN had asked Ross if he planned to make the Cyberpunk VR mod free, thus complying with CD Projekt’s terms of service. Responding, Ross said that while he wouldn’t rule out doing so, it would be a lot of work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I do not rule out releasing the mod free for everyone,” he said. “But it would take time, because my software supports 40+ games and various completely different engines, which makes creating a version that specifically supports only Cyberpunk 2077 a non-trivial task. Also, the people who have voluntarily given their money to me in order to support my development efforts for the framework might not be happy about seeing the mod being given away all of a sudden to everyone just because I've been bullied into it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ross told subscribers that “people on the web are thirsty for blood because back in the GTA 5 and RDR 2 era, an article came out stating that I was raising $20,000 a month.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: “Is that ‘reasonable’? Assuming that overall the work I poured into making my software support Cyberpunk, turning it into the ‘most immersive gaming experience’ some people had in their lives, amounted to a few months, say $50,000: is that ‘reasonable’ according to the arbitrary criteria of Cyberpunk's publisher? Something tells me it wouldn't be considered reasonable, despite being a tiny fraction of the many millions they would have to invest for porting CP2077 to VR themselves, and despite the fact that the cost was entirely financed by passionate gamers and none of it was incurred by CD Projekt.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Hopefully we'll find a way together, in the next few weeks. But if we can't, we'll always have the memories of the wonderful times we spent in those beautiful virtual worlds. Oh and by the way: if you have existing copies of the mods that you downloaded here before all this drama, you will of course be able to use them indefinitely and without restrictions, just like people have been doing for years with the RDR2 mod, as long as the games do not get breaking updates from the publishers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Nintendo </strong>has officially announced the first <strong>Nintendo Direct</strong> event for 2026, and it's kicking off the year by showcasing what could be its best-selling product: <strong>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>. The sequel to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-illumination-announce-a-new-super-mario-bros-film-due-in-april-2026/">the billion-dollar box-office hit</a> is due to hit theatres this coming <strong>April 3, 2026,</strong> and we're going to get another look at it this coming <strong>Sunday, January 25,</strong> when Nintendo debuts the second <strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie Direct</strong> at <strong>6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BT</strong>.</p>



<p>The announcement was first made through the <strong>Nintendo Today!</strong> app, before hitting all of Nintendo's official social media channels. As per usual, the news also came with an obligatory notice telling fans to "<em>Please note that no game information will be included in this presentation</em>." </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>This will be our third look at the film, going back to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-debuts-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-teaser-coming-april-2026/">its initial teaser in <strong>September 2025</strong></a> and its first dedicated direct back in <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-shows-new-trailer-brie-larson-benny-safdie/">November 2025</a></strong>. In the last direct, we got a look at two characters joining the film franchise: Rosalina, who will be played by <strong>Brie Larson</strong>, and Bowser Jr., who will be played by <strong>Benny Safdie</strong>.</p>



<p>For Sunday's direct, while nothing is necessarily guaranteed, we will almost certainly get a look a <strong>Yoshi</strong> and the actor behind the green dinosaur. In the run-up to the last direct, just two days before it officially premiered, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-collab-with-pillsbury-leaks-first-look-yoshi-super-mario-galaxy-movie/"><strong>a collaboration with Pilsbury</strong> spoiled our first look at Yoshi's design for the film</a>, and spoiled the confirmation of Bowser Jr. as one of the new characters being introduced.</p>



<p>We've known that Yoshi was going to be involved in this sequel since the first movie came out, thanks to a cliffhanger tease at the end of the Super Mario Bros. Movie, so seeing the character as part of a promotional collaboration wasn't the biggest surprise, but we've yet to see him in motion in the film. Now that we're nearly a full month into 2026, and the film's April premiere date is fast approaching, it feels like this Sunday will be when we get to see the green dinosaur in action in the film for the first time.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fable Is Abandoning One Of The RPG Series’ Defining Mechanics And Fans Aren’t Happy]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/fable-reboot-appearance-morality-good-evil-horns-halo-2000662597</link>
            <guid>1414363</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>During yesterday’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-developer-direct-fable-forza-horizon-6-game-freak-2000662291"><span>Xbox Developer Direct</span></a><span>, we got the most expansive look at the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/fable-reboot-features-open-world-release-date-fall-xbox-ps5-2000662295"><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>reboot</span></a><span> we’ve seen yet. Playground Games is picking up the series after original developer Lionhead Studios shut down in 2016, and it definitely feels like the studio is modernizing the action RPG series with an open world and a new morality system. With that new morality system, </span><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>is changing what was one of the core pillars of the series: your appearance will no longer be determined by whether or not you’re making good or evil decisions. In fact, it’s abandoning the idea that any of your actions are objectively good or evil altogether.</span></p> <p><span>For those that didn’t play any of Lionhead’s </span><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>games, like many games of the early 2000s they have a binary “hero or villain” morality system where doing things like helping people in need would move you toward the “good” side of the spectrum while doing things like skinning people alive in front of their weeping mother would move you toward the “evil” side. </span></p>

 <p><span>In the </span><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>games, the decisions you made would gradually alter your character’s look, with good characters appearing pristine and almost angelic, and evil players growing horns and turning into a monster. I tended to play evil characters in these games and wasn’t thrilled that my characters were turning into uggos, but that’s the contract you sign when you play these games. Playground Games’ </span><i><span>Fable</span></i><span>, however, is approaching morality differently, and so this mechanic is going out the window.</span></p> <p><span>As illustrated in the showcase, </span><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>is trying to handle morality in a more “subjective” way, which essentially means the game won’t treat your actions as simply “good” or “evil,” but rather that NPCs will react to the things you do based on their own proclivities. So you can kick people out of their homes as their landlord, and some rich idiot who lives for that shit might still think you’re a standup guy. Since things aren’t so black and white this time around, Playground’s Ralph Fulton tells </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/weve-been-working-on-this-game-for-a-really-really-long-time-the-big-fable-interview-with-microsoft-developer-playground"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span> it’s abandoning the morality-based appearance-changing system of previous games because there is no “objective” morality system to attach them to.</span></p>

 <blockquote><p><span>That sort of character morphing feature, obviously a really central part of the original games. It’s not in ours. And I’ll tell you why. There’s probably a couple of reasons. One, I guess it’s about that high level principle I was talking about, that there is no objective good and evil. And the original games were predicated on there being an objective good and an objective evil, and you were somewhere along that scale, and that’s what determined how your appearance changed.</span></p> <p><span>But for us, that doesn’t really work. The way I’ve described our morality system working, you’re never that thing, absolutely. You’re different things to different people based on what they like or what they choose to value. So, that’s one reason that it didn’t work.</span></p> <p><span>There’s another reason, which is in our game, you build reputation based on the settlement, the town, the city that you’re in, the part of the world that you’re in. But when you go to a new place, a place you’ve never been to before, you walk in without any reputation and thus nobody knows what to think about you. And you can almost, through your behavior, through your choices, form completely different reputations, a completely different identity, if you like, in that place from the place that you were last time. And you can do that across all the locations in the game.</span></p> <p><span>Now, you couldn’t do that if you walked in with horns and a trident. Your reputation would precede you in that instance. And honestly, that ability to be completely in control of your identity and thus what people think of you felt more important to us than that legacy feature. So, it worked great in those games. It didn’t seem to fit in ours, so we don’t have it.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>From a roleplaying perspective, I get why this decision was made, and I’ll be glad that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldur-s-gate-3-cyberpunk-mass-effect-character-creator-1851422575"><span>my future bald, bearded gay</span></a><span> won’t have to look like a demon while I’m trying to woo the men of Albion. But it is leaving behind what was a core pillar of the </span><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>series back in the day, and long-time fans who have been waiting over a decade for a new </span><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>are reacting accordingly.</span></p>

   <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">they've confirmed in an IGN interview that your actions will not transform your appearance. 😠 That's a core part of why I love Fable and I'll miss that.</p> <p>Everything else looks fantastic, though.

You might not be able to plant an acorn and watch it grow into a tree as you play the game, but that element of shaping the world around you with your actions still somewhat persisted with shaping your character with your actions.”</span></p> <p><span>“The location based reputation is cool, but it absolutely could have just been a dual system,”&nbsp; ForestBrah01209 wrote in the same thread. “One town will see you one way, another town will see you a different way. However, if I’m absolutely evil and move to another town, I’m still absolutely evil, even if my new neighbors think I’m just another stranger or even a nice guy. Shame that I won’t be able to rock the devil horns anymore.”</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>is the first game in the series to have a character creator, so at least it’s not like everyone’s characters are going to look the same. We’ll see if there are enough character customization options to let players at least manually emulate some of those old </span><i><span>Fable </span></i><span>transformations when the game launches in the fall. </span></p>

              <p>The Roku Smart Home Wired Video Doorbell &amp; Chime features an ultrawide-angle lens with a 180° horizontal field of view, letting you capture what’s happening at your front door. Night vision keeps you seeing a high-quality image regardless of the time of day. Motion and sound detection automatically send notifications to your mobile device, tablet, and compatible Roku devices when someone approaches your door. In addition to receiving notifications, you can communicate with visitors using two-way audio from your mobile device or tablet.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6850/">You can now purchase the Roku Smart Home Wired Video Doorbell &amp; Chime for $50, down from its regular price of $70, saving you $20 or 28% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6850/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A reliable security method to see everyone who darkens your doorstep</h2>
<p>This hardwired Roku Smart Home Wired Video Doorbell &amp; Chime uses your existing wiring for continuous power, eliminating the need to replace batteries. After installation, you can check the live feed of your front door and review past events on your mobile device or tablet using the Roku Smart Home app. You can also receive notifications on your compatible Roku TV or streaming player, so you know who is approaching your front door, whether your phone is nearby or across the house.</p>
<p>Videos captured by the camera are recorded in 1080p HD. The lens covers a wide area of your front porch with an ultrawide-angle 180° horizontal view, so you don’t need to adjust the camera angle to see both items on the mat and a visitor’s face when they are standing near the door. Night vision lets you capture clear images at night, showing details such as clothing and purses rather than obscuring them in shadows.</p>



<p>Beyond basic motion and sound detection, the built-in smart features notify you as soon as motion or sound is detected at your door. This means you’ll know right away when someone approaches, and if they press the doorbell, you’ll be notified immediately of who pressed it.</p>
<p>The included plug-in chime alerts you when the doorbell is rung, or motion is detected, regardless of your phone’s status. You can choose from 20 available sounds to play when the doorbell is activated and place the chime anywhere in your home to maximize volume. The chime carries an IP65 rating for durability and includes both corner and flat mounting plates to improve stability in inclement weather.</p>
<p>The Roku Smart Home Wired Video Doorbell &amp; Chime includes everything you need for a successful installation, such as a complete hardware kit, guided setup through the Roku Smart Home app, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6850/">and is on sale now for $50, down from the typical $70 retail price.</a></p>

<p>All Gearheads and Petrolheads are eyeing up Forza Horizon 6’s car list like a hawk. For many, the gameplay and content are irrelevant unless you have a carefully curated roster of amazing automobiles, which is where this guide comes to your aid.</p>



<p>Driving around in a pretty car is a perk of the Forza trade. Pulling off an insane drift sequence is cool, and breaking event records is nice for a short time, but everyone wants to know what stick you’re driving!</p>



<p>Luckily, Playground Games is delivering on the car list front in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-forza-horizon-6-gameplay-footage-revealed-at-xbox-developer-direct-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6</a>, and it’s going to be one of the best line-ups ever.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-cars-in-forza-horizon-6">How Many Cars In Forza Horizon 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No matter how big or small, they all count. Credit to Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Forza Horizon 6 will have over 550 cars at launch, with developer Playground Games sure to add many more to the range as post-launch content.</strong></p>



<p>So far, 93 cars have been revealed for Forza Horizon 6.</p>



<p>In comparison, Forza Horizon 5 capped at 902 cars when the game’s content line was finished. Many cars were added as DLC and seasonal updates throughout the game’s lifespan. FH6 is sure to be the same, and you should expect Forza Horizon to easily get near the 900 mark again, if not 1,000.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-forza-horizon-6-cars">All Forza Horizon 6 Cars</h2>



<p><strong>Forza Horizon 6’s car range includes Alfa Romeos, BMWs, Ferraris, Lamborghinis, Nissans, and virtually every other major car manufacturer you’ve ever heard of.</strong></p>

<h2 id="h-forza-horizon-6-cover-car-explained">Forza Horizon 6 Cover Car, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>The Toyota GR GT is a new 2027 car that is debuting early in Forza Horizon 6, even gracing the game’s front cover art.</strong></p>



<p>It’a beauty. The GR GT is described as Toyota’s “Most advanced vehicle,” and it’s more than likely a huge honor for Playground Games and FH6 to get first dibs on the supercar.</p>



<p>Check out the car in action during FH6 gameplay.</p>

<p>It’s a more general question than usual, but what’s your favorite car? Is it a vintage car from the 1960’s? Or are you a sucker for a premium, modern, top-of-the-line supercar?

The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/15/24270763/anbernic-rg-p01-wireless-controller-switch-pc-android-ios-steam">company’s first gamepad</a>, the RG P01, offered features like <a href="https://anbernic.com/products/rg-p01?variant=45681067426049">Hall effect triggers and joysticks</a> for just $18. Pricing for the new Anbernic RG G01 hasn’t been revealed, but it may be more expensive due to several upgrades, including a curved color display on the front and a heart rate sensor.</p></div><p>The RG G01 won’t be the first controller with a built-in screen. Companies like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stealth-Wireless-Controller-Officially-Licensed-PC/dp/B0DJTJDN73/ref=sr_1_11??tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Turtle Beach already offer them</a>. While a display adds to the cost, it lets gamers adjust settings, program macros that automatically trigger a series of button presses, and remap controls, without having to leave a game and connect to a mobile or desktop app. The RG G01 has four customizable buttons on the back that can be reconfigured using the display.</p><p>As for the heart rate sensor that appears to be integrated into the RG G01’s grips? Its functionality is questionable. Nintendo announced a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/5/4496818/nintendo-president-iwata-wii-vitality-sensor-shelved">heart rate-tracking accessory for the Wii at E3 2009</a> called the Vitality Sensor that could have potentially incorporated a player’s pulse into games, but it was cancelled. Anbernic’s RG G01 will display your heart rate on the controller’s screen and it has a pulse alarm, but there’s no details on what exactly it will warn you about.</p><p>The RG G01 will include both Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless connectivity, and the option to tether to a device with a USB-C cable. It’s fully compatible with systems running Steam, Linux, Windows, Android, iOS, and Nintendo’s various Switch consoles. There’s a six-axis gyroscope for playing games with motion controls, “electro-inductive capacitive joysticks,” and dual-mode triggers with switches that limit their travel for faster response times – a feature that was noticeably missing from the Anbernic RG P01.</p><p>Anbernic only says the controller is “Coming Soon!”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/866600/anbernic-rg-g01-smart-wireless-gaming-controller-heart-rate-sensor-display]]></content:encoded>

            <p>After having the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> bit of their R.E.A.L VR mod/framework <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-flatlines-after-cd-projekt-file-dmca-strike-and-request-its-creator-drop-their-paywall">taken down via a DMCA from CD Projekt</a>, modder Luke Ross claims to have had another stike filed against their work. This time, the strike has come from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghostrunner">Ghostrunner</a> publishers 505 Games, according to a post from Ross in which they say they've been "forced to temporarily pause" their Patreon page.</p>
<p>While Ross' Cyberpunk VR mod <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-modder-doesnt-rule-out-releasing-it-for-free-after-dmca-claims-there-was-no-negotiation-with-cd-projekt">being behind a paywall</a> was at the centre of CD Projekt's decision to file a takedown, there appears to have been no indication so far as to whether the same is true of the alleged strike from 505.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://www.patreon.com/realvr/about?">'About' section of the modder's Patreon page</a> now hosts the following message:</p>
<blockquote>Beware! Due to DMCA notices received from CD PROJEKT S.A. (see https://www.patreon.com/posts/148437771) and 505 Games, I am forced to temporarily pause the Patreon page. You can still subscribe if you want to support me, but be advised that for the moment there will be no benefits available. No access to the 40+ mods or detailed information about my VR conversions, until the legal situation clears out. Existing subscriptions will have their access extended for one month without further payments.</blockquote>
<p>An <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1qkavjg/luke_ross_removes_access_to_all_mods/">alleged email</a> from Ross to their subscibers expanding on the situation has been posted to r/virtualreality, as spotted by <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/cyberpunk-vr-modder-luke-ross-patreon-suspended-following-new-dmca-from-ghostruner-devs/">FRVR</a>.</p>
<p>"Fast forward to today, and another publisher just sent a DMCA takedown notice to Patreon: namely 505 Games, for my VR conversion of Ghostrunner," the email reads, following a recap of the Cyberpunk situation. "No mention of any terms of service violation this time. Again Patreon automatically complied. I don't blame them; DMCA law is carefully worded to give infinite power to big companies, who only need to write on a slip of paper that they "believe" their copyright has been infringed in order to nuke from the sky anything they don't like—and to give infinite headaches to creators like me, who instead have the only recourse of going to court, sustaining huge costs to get through the legal process."</p>
<p>I've reached out to 505 Games for comment.</p>
<p>As a result of this alleged second strike, Ross wrote in the email that they've opted to make "all versions of the mods and also all the posts related to the wonderful work we have done here together for years" unavailable, citing the need to avoid incurring any more DMCA strikes in the near future.</p><p>Since I cannot stop people from subscribing without closing down the account altogether, I'm making it clear on the About and Welcome pages that new subscriptions will have the only effect of supporting me and that no access to the 40+ conversions can or will be provided at this time," the modder added. "You don't need to unsubscribe: I paused the billing cycle for one month so that your pledges will NOT be renewed automatically, and those of you who are already subscribed will have their access extended for one month without further payments. I hope one month will be enough for the fog to clear up, and to understand what is going to happen to our collective attempt to make VR available for AAA games."</p>
<p>Ross was previously the subject of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-v-and-rdr2-vr-modder-receives-dmca-takedown-from-take-two-interactive">DMCA strike from Rockstar Games</a> over VR mods for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> back in 2022. For now, it seems the modder's plan is to lock things down and see if this storm can be waited out.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-goes-on-anc-headphone-clearance-new-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-2nd-gen-crash-to-an-all-time-low-2000662534</link>
            <guid>1414327</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds feature an Active Noise Control system and an immersive audio system, and they fit well for extended periods. They also include soft ear tips that seal against the ear to eliminate ambient noise, but do not feel too tight. These earbuds feature Bluetooth compatibility for phones, tablets, laptops, and other devices. Additionally, the earbuds have a white smoke finish, have touch controls, and a compact charging case that is small enough to carry in a pocket. They were made to be portable while keeping the audio front and center.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6849/">You can find the Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds for $249 at Amazon.</a> This is a $50 discount from their normal price of $299. So this represents a 17% discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6849/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Earbuds with the style, comfort, and quality of Bose headphones</h2>
<p>The noise-cancellation on the Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds works to cancel out engine noise, conversations, and other background noise. If you would rather hear some outside noise, then the Aware Mode provides an alternative. It allows you to hear what is happening outside and smooths out sudden spikes in decibel levels caused by loud noises, such as clanging dishes and slamming doors. In addition to providing awareness of your surroundings, if you prefer more isolation, Quiet Mode reduces ambient noise so you can enjoy your playlists, calls, podcasts, etc., at a lower volume.</p>
<p>CustomTune technology in the Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds determines how sound behaves in your ears and adjusts noise cancellation and equalization accordingly. The earbuds produce a test tone when you insert them and measure the response. Then it sets the bass, midrange, and treble to match your ear shape. Bose Immersive Audio provides a spatial effect that creates the illusion that music and video are coming from in front of you rather than inside your head.</p>



<p>The fit and comfort of the earbuds are due to the combination of the soft silicone eartips and the flexible stability bands. There are multiple sizes of each component, and they can be combined in 9 ways. The umbrella-shaped tips provide additional blockage of ambient noise. Plus, they are rated IPX4, so they are suitable for use during sweating or light rain.</p>
<p>The call quality of the Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds depends on the noise-rejecting microphones and processing specifically tailored to ensure your voice is heard clearly. The microphones are focused on capturing your voice while rejecting wind and background noise; therefore, the caller hears you, not the surrounding noise.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, battery life and charging capabilities are configured to provide you with enough time to listen to whatever content you desire. Battery life is approximately 6 hours in Quiet, Aware, or Immersive Modes, and about 4 hours in Immersive Mode. The case supports 3 charging cycles and can be charged via a USB-C port or a wireless charging pad. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6849/">These are great headphones, and you’ll want to take advantage of the $249 sale price instead of the regular list price of $299 now.</a></p>

<p>Xbox Game Pass members will have to pay almost the price of a standard edition for Forza Horizon 6’s 4-day early access. </p>



<p>The Xbox Developer Direct finally gave fans what they were asking for: a release date and a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-forza-horizon-6-gameplay-footage-revealed-at-xbox-developer-direct-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay deep dive</a> for the highly anticipated racing title, Forza Horizon 6. Along with that, we also received details on the pricing and editions for the upcoming title, and it seems Game Pass players will have to put forth some extra cash for early access, more than the usual price. </p>



<h2 id="h-game-pass-members-have-to-pay-almost-the-price-of-a-standard-edition-to-get-forza-horizon-6-early-access">Game Pass Members Have to Pay Almost the Price of a Standard Edition to Get Forza Horizon 6 Early Access</h2>



<p>So, Forza Horizon 6 is available for free for Game Pass Ultimate and PC members; however, that only includes the Standard Edition. To get the 4-day early access, players will need to grab the Premium Edition, priced at $119.99/£109.99 GBP/€119.99 EUR. Game Pass members can get their hands on the Premium Edition by purchasing an <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/forza-horizon-6#purchaseoptions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">upgrade</a> worth $59.99, and that’s where the problem lies. </p>



<p>Players on social media have been calling out the increase in the price of the Forza Horizon 6 Premium Edition upgrade for Game Pass members. For the previous title, FH5, players would only need to pay $50; however, that has now been increased to $60, which is almost the price of a standard edition, $69.99. In the UK, the price for this upgrade is £59.99, the same as the standard edition costs in the region. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>For those wondering about the Forza Horizon 6 deluxe edition, that has been priced at $99.99/£89.99 GBP/€99.99 EUR. </p>

<p>Highguard is looking to claim the FPS crown in 2026 and is trying to do so under a cloak of absolute secrecy. Details about Highguard are few and far between, but release time info is available, and the release date is locked in.</p>



<p>So far, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-release-date/https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> looks like a mix of first-person shooters rolled into one. It has Hero Shooter elements, you can ride huge beasts, there’s a free-flowing speed and nimbleness to traversal: It seems to do it all. People have been wondering when Highguard is coming out and what time you can start playing it, so let’s try to clear some of this up.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-time-does-highguard-release">What Time Does Highguard Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Fire away. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>According to Steam, it will be a universal 6 PM UTC launch for Highguard.</strong></p>



<p>This could easily be subject to change, so take the information with a trusty pinch of salt. If you look at the SteamDB page for Highguard (It might have changed by the time you read this), it clearly says: “<strong>18:00:00 UTC.</strong>“</p>



<p>Given how little we know about Highguard and the lack of promotion, some people are doubting it’ll even release when it claims—let alone hit a specific launch time outed by Steam. Does Steam even know?</p>



<p>Keep checking back, as this information has huge potential to turn around. Or, we can all see what the fuss is all about come 6 PM UTC on release day.</p>



<h2 id="h-highguard-release-date-confirmed">Highguard Release Date, Confirmed</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Stop the presses. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment, Inc.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Wildgate’s Highguard is slated for a January 26 release date.</strong></p>



<p>Whether it does or doesn’t happen is anyone’s guess. It’s one of the most bizarre games and releases in recent memory. Everyone may end up looking back on the confusion as a stroke of brilliance, or wondering how Highguard was ever going to work.</p>



<p>It could be telling that the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-trophy-list-has-revealed-more-details-than-the-devs-have/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard Trophy List revealed more details than the devs did</a>. Check your PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam stores on January 26 at 6 PM UTC to see if the Highguard prophecy actually came true.</p>



<p>There’s been an extraordinary amount of criticism and backlash for a game everyone pretty much knows nothing about. If you, too, have thoughts, share them via the free-to-join <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

When a game gets that popular, while having big barriers to new players, a simplified spin-off is almost guaranteed – and now we have Sanctuary from the same designer. It has the same widely appealing theme and keeps some of the innovative mechanisms of its parent, but how much of its strategic clout can it retain?</p><p id="whats-in-the-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What's in the box">What’s in the Box</h2></p><div id="234656"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234656" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sanctuary Board Game</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sanctuary comes in a big box with considerable heft. When you slide the lid off the reason becomes clear: it contains sheet after sheet of large, punch out, cardboard hexes. Like Ark Nova, these are all illustrated with photos of animals, zoo staff, or pertinent buildings and landscapes. Photo-art in the obviously artificial medium of board gaming can look odd but here it works well, re-enforcing the feeling that you’re building something real and tangible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the hexes are peppered with confusing icons which initially appear very mysterious but, once you’ve internalized the game rules, you’ll appreciate having all the information on the game state front and center. The game thoughtfully includes a plastic rack for each player to hold their “hand” of hex tiles during play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from the hex tiles there’s a bunch of other cardboard to pop out, not only tokens but also action “cards” for each player, which are made of thick cardboard rather than playing-card stock. There are two central boards, one for tracking objectives and another for holding the market of tiles which requires a little assembly, as the edges fold in and stick down to keep the tiles in place. Finally, there’s a two-sided hex map for each player to build their zoo on. Unlike the parent game, everyone here uses the same map during play, one side of the board or the other.</p></div><p id="rules-and-how-it-plays"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Rules and how it plays">Rules and How It Plays</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/pxl-20260113-202224136-1769094969943.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You can get some sense of how much more simple Sanctuary is than Ark Nova simply by comparing rulebooks, which otherwise have similar layouts and fonts. Ark Nova weighs in at 20 pages: Sanctuary a modest eight, with plenty of examples. It jettisons the bigger game’s separation of animals and enclosures, making everything a single tile that you lay onto the hex board representing your zoo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing it keeps, however, is the notion of action card strength. You have four different actions arranged beneath your zoo board in a ranking from weakest to strongest. When you use one, it operates at a “level” equal to its current position in the queue. Then it moves into the weakest slot and the other cards all slide up one rank. All the actions allow you to place tiles into your zoo: three of them are for animals of different habitats while the fourth is for “projects”, which include things like specialist researchers, conservation efforts and the like. All the matching tiles have a strength requirement and the action card you use to lay it must be at that level or higher.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/pxl-20260103-105337696-1769115343227.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Many tiles have additional requirements. The most common is for arrows on the tile edge to line up with empty spaces: you start with a couple in your zoo map but you can add more by playing tiles from your hand face-down. Others need to be adjacent to tiles already in your zoo that carry certain icons. All have at least one icon representing an animal type, a habitat or a continent. Most tiles improve the appeal of your zoo, which is essentially your victory point tally. For many that’s a fixed value, while others depend on how many of a particular icon you have adjacent to that tile or on your map as a whole.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can get bonus appeal by satisfying conservation objectives. Five are drawn randomly for each game, matching particular animal type and continent icons. To claim one you must simply have the matching number of icons in your zoo; the more icons, the more points. You can also spend conservation markers, in place of a missing icon, making these tokens very powerful. They can be obtained by getting matching male and female animal tiles of the same species next to each other on your map, or from certain project tiles.</p><p>These are the parameters of the puzzle that Sanctuary lays before you, fiendishly pulling you in multiple directions at once.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are the parameters of the puzzle that Sanctuary lays before you, fiendishly pulling you in multiple directions at once. Many tiles reward you for specializing in particular icons. Conservation bonuses, meanwhile, reward you for diversity. Your challenge is to try and decide how, given the limitation of what tiles you pick up and the actions at your disposal, you’re going to balance this problem to eke out the highest score. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/pxl-20260103-105404901-1769115363738.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">To complicate matters, each level of conservation bonus can only be claimed once. So if you claim one with two bird icons, say, and then get more birds in your zoo later, you can’t then go back and claim the bigger-scoring four- or five-icon rewards via birds later on. You need to have four or five of a different animal type or make up the difference with those precious conservation tokens. The whole thing is a mess of competing priorities that can make the game surprisingly tense for what is essentially an un-interactive game where you’re focused on building out your own map.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Because you’re being asked to do so many different things at once, how you pick up and hold tiles is very important. At the start of your turn you have to take one tile from the six in the display. However, you can only take that tile from the queue position up to the current level of your projects action card, making this one particularly important. After that you take an “official” action which involves either using a card to play tiles or you can take more tiles. Animal actions used this way give you two random tiles, while the projects action lets you take one tile of your choice from the display. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/pxl-20260108-203602030-1769115377621.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, given that the game is essentially a race, this results in surprising tension. Play ends when someone either fills their map or collects all five conservation bonuses, both of which are reliant on playing tiles. So missing a turn to take more tiles feels like you’re falling behind. But it’s always so tempting! There are often hexes available that you desperately want because their icons fit with the conservation objectives, or others in your zoo, or even male-female animal pairs but the more you collect them in hope of making combos, the further you risk getting behind in the race for points. The fact you can only hold six tiles at once adds a delightfully frustrating element to these decisions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your action order is the final plank in the game’s puzzle. Often, you’ll want to play a given tile and you won’t have the requisite action at a high enough level. So you have to muddle through potentially laying and taking less interesting tiles to get where you want to be. Forward planning your action chains to get cards to the required levels becomes a hallmark of experience when you’re selecting tiles from the display, muddied by the desire to keep projects high to maximize your choices. Cards can also be levelled up to get higher action levels by fulfilling four different criteria, such as claiming your first spot on the conservation track. As is typical for the game’s circular approach to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy</a>, fulfilling these is yet another competing priority to juggle. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/pxl-20260120-200749909-1769115393736.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There are times when all the different things going on become an active problem for the game, however. The need for tiles to support each other, and particularly the reward for animal gender pairs, can be frustratingly hard to fulfill if the tiles you want are simply not in the display when it’s your turn. As such, it works better at lower player counts: with five, especially, it feels overlong. The mechanisms also feel very abstract, especially compared to Ark Nova which at least presents an illusion of running a real zoo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once the game is finished, everyone has to tally up their points, which is an annoyingly time-consuming process. With the score offered by many tiles being dependent on many other tiles it takes a while to tot them up, and it’s very easy to make errors in what is often quite a tight game. While everyone is raring to know who won, the time and effort it takes to chalk up the scores has the unfortunate effect of deflating whatever excitement has built up during play, leading to the final result arriving as a bit of an anticlimax.</p><p id="where-to-buy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to buy">Where to Buy</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/z3Oxqm?object_uuid=fbfe9100-977a-438b-9937-77fa8b902f86&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aD8K3w?object_uuid=fbfe9100-977a-438b-9937-77fa8b902f86&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Capstone Games</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qd8YbK?object_uuid=fbfe9100-977a-438b-9937-77fa8b902f86&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Game Nerdz</a></li></ul></section><p><span><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">If you’re familiar with Ark Nova, then you’ll probably realize that Sanctuary’s similarities with that game are pretty minimal. The novel action card mechanism is a worthwhile carryover, and worth experiencing here if the previous game feels too daunting, and the zoo theme gives both games a wide draw, but Sanctuary is a much less strategically interesting game. The payoff is that it’s also much simpler and faster playing, but that puts it in a bracket with a number of other tile-laying and set-collection games with comparably appealing animal themes like Harmonies and Cascadia which are arguably better. However, Sanctuary is nevertheless a pleasing challenge with a couple of fresh ideas, and is worth your while if zoo management tickles your thematic fancy.</p></div></span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/sanctuary-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>

I'll go on the record with that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the absence of significant law reform, AI deepfakes have exploded alongside the emergence of generative AI and its increasing accuracy and availability.

<p>Launching this <strong>Autumn</strong> on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5, we honestly weren't expecting to see this one on the Switch 2, but according to Windows Central's Jez Corden, it's actually currently "under consideration" for Nintendo's console.</p>
<p>Corden took to <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/2014463781250777444">social media</a> to confirm, stating that it "isn't 100% definite", but if he's to be believed, it seems that Xbox and Playground Studios are at least looking into the viability of a Switch 2 port.</p><div><figure data-videoid="od1TOBPMAIg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/od1TOBPMAIg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytod1TOBPMAIg" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/od1TOBPMAIg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/od1TOBPMAIg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed410fbasjinum&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>"Was told Fable for Nintendo Switch 2 isn't 100% definite for now, but under consideration for the future."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fable has, until now, never really left the Xbox ecosystem other than a few releases on PC and Mac. These days, however, Microsoft is shifting its strategy to include multiple console releases for its biggest games. It's already released the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pentiment">Pentiment</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grounded">Grounded</a> on Switch, and there are ongoing rumours that <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/halo_the_master_chief_collection">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> might also makes its way to Switch 2.</p>
<p>We'd love to see this come to fruition though. Fable's blend of fantasy action and British humour is excellent, and although the third mainline entry from 2010 was a bit lacklustre, we can't wait to see what the new game can do.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The first three <strong>Pirates of the Caribbean</strong> movies were some of the best-looking films of their time, with top-tier visual effects work that remains impressive to this day. For <strong>Gore Verbinski,</strong> the director of all three of those initial films, the visual effects in those three films are still so impressive that it stands above today's Hollywood blockbusters, but according to Verbinski, that's more to do with the tools VFX artists are using now, namely the game engine powering <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/fortnite-everything-we-know-hub/">Fortnite</a></strong> and countless other modern games: <strong>Epic Games'</strong> own <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/with-significant-gpu-and-cpu-performance-improvements-unreal-engine-5-7-is-another-step-in-the-right-direction/">Unreal Engine</a></strong>.</p>



<p>In an interview on <a href="https://butwhytho.net/2025/11/gore-verbinski-good-luck-have-fun-dont-die/">ButWhyTho.net</a>, Verbinski laid out his beef with Unreal Engine, claiming that the rise in filmmakers using it for modern VFX is making modern films look worse than they did over 20 years ago. For Verbinski, it's all to do with how Unreal Engine handles light, giving modern films a "<em>gaming aesthetic</em>" that he believes pushes them into an "<em>uncanny valley</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I think the simplest answer is you've seen the Unreal gaming engine enter the visual effects landscape</em>," Verbinski begins when asked about what, in his mind, qualifies for VFX to be "<em>done right</em>" and how VFX work has changed in the last two decades. "<em>So it used to be a divide, with Unreal Engine being very good at video games, but then people started thinking maybe movies can also use Unreal for finished visual effects. So you have this sort of gaming aesthetic entering the world of cinema</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I think that's why those Kubrick movies still hold up, because they were shooting miniatures and paintings, and now you've got this different aesthetic. It works with Marvel movies where you kind of know you're in a heightened, unrealistic reality. I think it doesn't work from a strictly photo-real standpoint. I just don't think it takes light in the same way; I don't think it fundamentally reacts to subsurface scattering, and how light hits the skin and reflects in the same way. So that's how you get this uncanny valley when you come to creature animation, a lot of in-betweening is done for speed instead of being done by hand</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>That's the first part of Verbinski's answer, and it's overall not the spiciest of takes, but its likely what he said next that got a heated reply from <strong>Pat Tubach</strong>, the VFX supervisor at Epic Games, who it so happens worked in Hollywood VFX for years on several blockbuster movies, from The Mummy, to Jurassic Park 3, to the Avengers, and, as luck would have it, all three of the original Pirates of the Caribbean movies, before working at the Fortnite company.</p>



<p>"<em>And then just what's become acceptable from an executive standpoint, where they think no one will care that the ships in the ocean look like they're not on water. In the first Pirates movie, we were actually going out to sea and getting on a boat...<strong>I think that Unreal Engine coming in and replacing Maya as a sort of fundamental is the greatest slip backwards."</strong></em></p>



<p>Suggesting that Unreal is a step backwards from Maya in such a strong way is likely what emboldened Tubach to hit back at Verbinski, who gave this statement to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-maker-epic-games-hits-back-at-pirates-of-the-caribbean-director-who-blamed-unreal-engine-for-bad-cgi-in-modern-movies">IGN</a>:</p>



<p>"<em>It's inaccurate for anyone in the industry to claim that one tool is to blame for some erroneously perceived issues with the state of VFX and CGI. It's true that there are a lot more people making computer graphics than ever before, and with that scale comes a range of successes and failures - but <strong>aesthetic and craft comes from artists, not software.</strong>"</em></p>



<p>"<em>Unreal Engine is primarily used for pre-visualization, virtual production, and in some cases, final pixels. I can guarantee that the artists working on big blockbuster VFX films like Pirates of the Caribbean 10-15 years ago could only dream about having a tool as powerful as Unreal Engine on their desks to help them get the job done - and I should know - <strong>I was one of them!</strong>"</em></p>



<p>Unreal Engine is not without its faults, <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-7-out-now-with-nanite-foliage-and-megalights-powered-stunning-dynamic-shadow-casting-lights/">but the improvements Epic has put into it over time</a> have genuinely made it look better than ever, and made games look better than ever (<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-pc-performance-benchmarks/">even if it doesn't always help a game's performance</a>). Verbinski isn't wrong to point out that people don't necessarily want their movies to look like Fortnite, but neither is Tubach when he points to the fact that you can only get so far by blaming the tool an artist uses.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Upcoming Viking tactics RPG <em>Norse: Oath of Blood </em>has been delayed on both PC and consoles, and while PC players won't have to wait too much longer to check the game out, it'll be a bit of a longer delay for PS5 and Xbox.</p><p>Originally set to launch on February 3rd, <em>Norse: Oath of Blood </em>will now be arriving on February 17th on Steam, Epic, and GOG, which represents a delay of just two weeks. That's not too bad, if you ask me.</p><p>The PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of the game were initially due to arrive alongside the PC launch, but that's no longer happening; instead, console players will have to wait until spring to check out <em>Norse: Oath of Blood</em>.</p><figure role="group">

<p>Arctic Hazard explains the delay <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/norsegame.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">over on Bluesky</a>, but it's a fairly standard explanation; the devs need more time to "further refine and polish the experience" of <em>Norse: Oath of Blood </em>so that it reflects the studio's "passion for the source material".</p><p>Although the game is being delayed, Arctic Hazard and Tripwire are promising new developer diaries in the coming weeks, which will include "behind-the-scenes looks at development, deeper dives into gameplay, and additional updates".</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Norse: Oath of Blood</em>, it's a gritty tactical RPG that emphasizes down-to-earth realism in a way that I suspect <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/wartales" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fe4a9aa9-b171-4bf8-a97d-e538c2805501" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Wartales</em></a><em> </em>fans will appreciate.</p><p>You play as a young Viking called Gunnar (because of course he is), who's out for vengeance after his home is destroyed by the intimidating-sounding Steinarr Far-Spear.
