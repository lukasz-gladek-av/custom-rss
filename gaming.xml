<p>Nintendo hits its first hurdle</p>

<figure data-uuid="e04c98416aacb"><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e04c98416aacb/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>A few weeks back, we covered news that the US suffered <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/the-us-suffered-its-worst-november-since-1995-in-terms-of-hardware-sales">its worst November since 1995</a> in terms of console hardware sales. Well, as reported by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/nintendo-switch-2-sales-stumble-over">The Game Business</a>, the Switch 2 wasn't immune, with sales down by 35% in the US compared to what the original Switch delivered in the same period during 2017.</p>
<p>Things are <em>slightly</em> better in the UK, though not by much. When comparing the same periods, the Switch 2 was down by 16% compared to the original Switch. It does, however, seem like a lot more people bought the Switch 2 during its first few months on the market, as overall sales for 2025 were actually up by by 6% compared to the Switch (which was also released a full 14 weeks earlier too, by the way).</p>
<p>Over in France, which is typically one of the strongest regions in Europe for Nintendo, Switch 2 sales for the Christmas period were down by "over 30%" compared to the Switch. This means that the UK actually saw stronger console sales than France over the same period.</p>
<p>Sales in Japan were also down, though admittedly not by much. We actually have solid figures here, too, with the Switch 2 shifting a total of 1.32 million consoles during the last nine weeks of 2025, while the Switch managed a total of 1.39 million during the same period in 2017, resulting in a decrease of around 5.5%. Similar to the situation in the UK, overall Switch 2 sales for the year in Japan were up by 11% compared to the Switch's launch year.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 is doing remarkably well, then, and has already nailed the record as the fastest-selling console of all time. But as noted by an unnamed senior Nintendo employee when speaking to The Game Business, the "complicated economic landscape” mixed with higher price points and “the absence of a major Western game” means that the Switch 2 hasn't enjoyed quite as strong a Christmas period as the company might have hoped.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how things pan out in 2026. Nintendo is currently lacking a major "must-have" title for the Switch 2, with the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yoshi-and-the-mysterious-book">Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</a> headlining the line-up so far. However, if rumours of a potential <strong>Pokémon Gen 10</strong> release later this year turn out to be true, then we reckon Nintendo might have the Christmas 2026 period in the bag.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>If you were old enough in 2000 to follow video game news, you probably remember an <strong>urban tech legend</strong> regarding <strong><a href="https://gaming-urban-legends.fandom.com/wiki/Iraqi_Super-Computer">Saddam Hussein's attempt to purchase thousands of PlayStation 2 units</a></strong> to link them into a <strong>supercomputer capable of missile guidance</strong>, which supposedly leveraged the console’s <strong>Emotion Engine</strong> chip.</p>



<p>While it was eventually proven that this was just a legend, a recent statement from a lead <strong><em>Final Fantasy IX</em></strong> and <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-trigger-remake-hopes-reignited/">Chrono Trigger</a></em></strong> developer confirmed that the <strong>Japanese government</strong> of the time was concerned the <strong>Sony</strong> console could indeed be used for <strong>military purposes</strong> due to its unusual power for consumer hardware at the time.</p>



<p><span>Speaking in an interview conducted by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/61817" target="_blank"><em><strong>Famitsu&nbsp;</strong></em></a>to celebrate the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-ix-25th-anniversary-website-remake/" target="_blank"><em><strong>25th anniversary</strong></em></a><em><strong>&nbsp;</strong></em>of the ninth entry in the Square Enix series last year, spotted by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-9-lead-says-the-ps2-was-so-so-overpowered-its-cpu-sparked-military-concerns-so-he-struggled-to-get-an-emergency-dev-kit-during-his-stay-in-hawaii-it-was-a-very-difficult-situation/" target="_blank"><em><strong>GamesRadar+</strong></em></a>,&nbsp;<strong>Kazuhiko Aoki</strong>&nbsp;commented on the development of&nbsp;<em><strong>Final Fantasy IX</strong></em>, which was conducted at a&nbsp;<strong>Square Enix</strong>&nbsp;development studio in&nbsp;<strong>Hawaii</strong>, providing a rather interesting revelation.</span></p>



<p><em>"Come to think of it, towards the end of my time in Hawaii, I was asked to check whether <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">FFIX</strong> would run on the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PS2</strong> by sending some sort of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation 2</strong> test equipment,"</em> Aoki-san said. <em>"However, at the time, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PS2's CPU</strong> was so powerful that there was a possibility that it could be diverted for <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">military use</strong>, and so <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">exports were restricted</strong>."</em></p>



<p>While <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Saddam Hussein</strong> nor anyone else ever launched a missile with the help of a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation 2-based supercomputer</strong>, concerns were grounded, as already mentioned, in the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation 2’s</strong> unusually high performance for a consumer device of the era. A single <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PS2</strong> unit with its <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">128-bit SIMD-capable Emotion Engine</strong> was capable of a theoretical <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">6.2 Gigaflops</strong>, considerably more than a high-end <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Intel Pentium III PC,</strong> which was capable of roughly <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">1.0 Gigaflop</strong> in comparable workloads.</p>



<p>In addition to its <strong>theoretical max power</strong>, the <strong>PlayStation 2</strong> was made potentially appealing for military applications by its two <strong>Vector Processing Units</strong>, which were well suited to <strong>highly parallel mathematical workloads</strong> such as <strong>trajectory calculations</strong>.</p>



<p>Ultimately, what raised the most concern was the <strong>PlayStation 2's</strong> unusual <strong>price-to-performance ratio</strong>. <strong>Sony</strong> was selling "<strong>supercomputing</strong>" power for just <strong>$299</strong>, a price point achieved by selling the hardware at a loss to recoup costs via game sales. This created a unique loophole where a foreign military could theoretically acquire significant processing power at a very low price.</p>



<p>As <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Aoki-san’s</strong> experience in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Hawaii</strong> illustrates, the idea of consumer consoles attracting military interest was not entirely fanciful. That concept later became reality when the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">US Air Force</strong> built the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" href="https://phys.org/news/2010-12-air-playstation-3s-supercomputer.html">Condor Cluster</a></strong> in 2010 using <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">1,760 PlayStation 3</strong> consoles.</p>

            <p>Gerry from the River rides up to a noticeboard for the second time this week. Between contracts, he scans the pinned scraps for a fresh job to take on, only for his eyes to rest on another particularly peculiar bit of prose. 'There's a mysterious extra DLC for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> in the works', this bit of paper claims. 'Oh yeah, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-3-reporting-winds-continue-to-howl-of-mysterious-extra-dlc-allegedly-arriving-this-year-and-theres-one-thing-id-love-to-see-it-do">I heard about that</a>,' Gerry's brain responds. 'Also, it reportedly might be set in Zerrikania,' says the paper. 'Ooh, that's new,' the Witcherman's noggin thinks.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The bit of paper, this time symbolising reporting from <a href="https://pl.ign.com/wiedzmin-3/69405/news/wiedzmin-3-nowe-dlc-zabierze-nas-na-pustynie-ujawniamy-nasze-informacje-sprzed-lat-i-rzucamy-nowe-sw">Ian Games Network Poland</a>, explains that it's heard CD Projekt's developers have previously been interested in exploring Zerrikania. For those who've not stuck their heads deep into the big bucket of witchery lore, that's a region located to the east of the locations throughout The Continent which have served as settings for Witcher games to this point.</p>
<p>If my memory serves correctly, the province has thus far been mentioned as an exotic locale of rainforests, deserts and steppes, ruled by a dragon-worshipping matriarchal society taking cues from the likes of ancient Scythia or Africa. So, a big change of pace from the generally medieval European-inspired climes Geralt's typically seen roaming. One of the bits of the Witcher books which has stuck with me in the long-term is a short story from Sword of Destiny in which Gerry meets a knight called Borch Three Jackdaws, who's accompanied by a pair of female Zerrikanian warriors called Téa and Véa, which has since featured in the Witcher Netflix series. I'll not spoil it here, but there are some dragon-hunting shenanigans.</p>
<p>While IGN Poland's bit of paper makes clear the info it's reporting now dates back several years, with the other recent reporting hinting at an extra Witcher 3 DLC being the reason it's being revisited now, if even a short trip to Zerrikania does turn out to be on the cards, I'd be up for it. I've generally been sceptical of what purpose this alleged extra might serve once the initial excitement at having more of a good game subsides, but offering a first taste of a place in the series' universe folks usually only hear whispers about or seen card art of would fill that blank.</p>
<p>I still struggle to see such a thing being pulled of in anywhere near as expansive fashion as the game-sized Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine DLCs, but much more contained add-ons can always be plenty of fun.</p>
<p>Or they could just stick to my previously outlined wish and put out a DLC in which Geralt becomes a goofy centaur. Oop, speaking of Gerry, he's galloped away from the noticeboard in a huff again.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Leaked Synopsis Of The Next Life Is Strange Has Me Worried]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-5-reunion-chloe-max-summary-plot-leak-2000658198</link>
            <guid>1400749</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Life Is Strange: Double Exposure</span></i><span>, the latest game in the narrative-driven adventure game series,</span> <span>ended on a cliffhanger </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review-max-chloe-1851685215"><span>in 2024</span></a><span>. It’s little surprise, then, that despite some </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/life-strange-double-exposure-award-gdc-2025-layoffs-1851771282"><span>strife at developer Deck Nine Games</span></a><span>, it seems–based on a leaked PEGI rating that has been since yoinked off the rating board’s official site–to be getting a sequel. Despite Square Enix’s efforts to plug the leak, the </span><a href="https://x.com/DomTheBomb/status/2009008464127721907"><span>internet remembers all</span></a><span>, so we know the game is apparently going to be called </span><i><span>Life Is Strange: Reunion</span></i><span>, and we also know a bit about the game’s premise thanks to an accompanying synopsis. Some folks are probably celebrating what </span><i><span>Reunion</span></i><span> might entail, but I have questions.</span></p>  <p><span>The full summary that was removed from the PEGI site reads as follows:</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>Chloe Price was Max Caulfield’s partner in time… Losing her is Max’s greatest regret. Now Chloe has come to Caledon University. Haunted by nightmares and impossible memories, Chloe needs Max’s help. But Max is already in crisis: in three days, a deadly inferno will destroy the campus.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>So there’s a lot to unpack in these few sentences, but to get the obvious out of the way, the “reunion” the game’s title seems to refer to is one between Max and Chloe, the two leads of the original </span><i><span>Life Is Strange</span></i><span>. At the end of that game, you make a choice that either sees Chloe die or sees the two ride off to an unknown future together, though if you choose the latter, the events of </span><i><span>Double Exposure </span></i><span>find the two characters taking some time apart. The decision was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-max-chloe-relationship-1851673763"><span>unpopular with long-time fans</span></a><span>, but </span><i><span>Double Exposure </span></i><span>did suggest that the two may reunite down the line, and even if I was bummed that Chloe wasn’t in the game, I admired </span><i><span>Double Exposure</span></i><span>’s commitment to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-max-endings-chloe-1851538397"><span>respecting both endings</span></a><span> of the original. Now, however, it sounds like Chloe will be part of </span><i><span>Reunion</span></i><span>, perhaps regardless of whatever the player did in the 2015 original?</span></p>

 <p><span>The fact that Deck Nine had players import the Chloe choice into </span><i><span>Double Exposure</span></i><span> through an early dialogue option makes me hopeful the team isn’t just throwing away the possibility that Chloe died at the end of the first game in reaction to the backlash it got for omitting Max’s foul-mouthed, punk rock best (girl)friend. The line in the synopsis about Chloe being “haunted by nightmares and impossible memories” makes me wonder if some time travel nonsense could be used to make Chloe show up in </span><i><span>Reunion </span></i><span>even if you did choose the ending in which she dies. Perhaps these “impossible memories” are ones involving both versions of events? </span><i><span>Double Exposure </span></i><span>has a lot of timeline jumping; maybe this could have affected Chloe as a character existing in many quantum states due to Max’s time traveling?</span></p>

 <p><span>Whatever the case, games that undermine player choice are a pet peeve of mine, which is a big reason why I’m anxious about </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-n7-day-bioware-blog-teaser-url-krogan-2000642122"><i><span>Mass Effect 5</span></i></a><i><span>. </span></i><span>There are a lot of fans who would be content if BioWare just declared one of the original trilogy’s final decisions canon and picked it up from there, so it seems like a real possibility, but I’m not one of them. It was encouraging to see Deck Nine make a big hoopla of maintaining </span><i><span>Life Is Strange</span></i><span>’s continuity in </span><i><span>Double Exposure</span></i><span>, and I hope the team has put in the effort to carry it through to </span><i><span>Reunion </span></i><span>as well. Hopefully we don’t have to wait too long to find out more about this game. The thought of speculating about this for several months is already making my head hurt.</span></p>

<p>It was only a matter of time before it all found its way out of Japan and the company has now confirmed that the line will be launching in the US from <strong>19th February</strong>.</p>
<p>Designed "to offer fun ways for young children and their parents to explore, imagine and play side-by-side," according to the official blurb, the collection will be coming to the Nintendo New York and San Francisco stores in February and appearing at "select retail stores" in the spring. There's no word on a UK or European release just yet, but we'll update this article when we get confirmation on this side of the pond.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067uhwtyj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

            <p>Microlandia deserves a much longer article, preferably written by our resident virtual metropolis judger Sin Vega. For the moment, I will only say that it’s a work-in-progress city-builder fuelled by a poetical mixture of admiration and terror for cities. </p><!--more-->
<p>This is the impression given by the developer’s changelogs, anyway. Here, for example, is <a href="https://explodi.itch.io/microlandia/devlog/1309434/microlandia-14-the-money-edition">how they describe</a> Microlandia update 1.4 on Itch.io, which makes adjustments to the game’s economy, company management and public transport simulation: “A city is a beautiful, but insane machine that survives always in homeostasis and always in chaos. In 1.4 you get a little less narrative, a little more reality, the structures of everyday life exposed, greed companies, economy that doesn't forgive, even the broke. The night mode is a pleasant anesthesia; use it, but do not confuse ambience with robustness.”</p>
<p>I will try not to, Information Superhighway Games. I will try not to confuse ambience with robustness.</p>

<p>Microlandia hit 1.0 release over December, so yes, we are playing Jenny Catch-Up here. In general, it looks to deliver a “brutally honest” rendition of city life and management. It executes the chemistry and causality of the urban human experience with chilly exactitude. Citizens are capable of falling not just into, but out of love. Imagine that. Imagine making it possible for your pops to undergo heartbreak. They also risk being fired if they show up late for work, perhaps because you've screwed up the bus timetables, and if they can’t find a job, they’ll turn to crime. </p><p>The mechanics go beyond pegging out residences, workplaces and leisure facilities while staying in budget. This is a mean town indeed. Landlords are greedy and will raise the rent when accommodation is scarce. Rich folk will embrace their opportunities without qualm: as an older Itch.io update <a href="https://explodi.itch.io/microlandia/devlog/1131465/microlandia-10-the-city-shaken-awake">explains</a>, “high-net-worth citizens will rent only low-density housing, and along with the upper class get NIMBY vibes and avoid buildings with disapproval aura.”</p>
<p>You’ll have to worry about pandemics, heatwaves, and compensating people for rezoning. There’s a local newspaper that tracks your decisions and does not spare the lash; if you reap some bad headlines, your budget may be reduced.</p>
<p>As developer explodi <a href="https://explodi.itch.io/microlandia/devlog/1029279/welcome-to-microlandia-the-brutally-honest-city-builder">explains in last year’s announcement post</a>, Microlandia is both a homage to and a critique of the classic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/simcity">SimCity</a>. “I always wondered what will happen in simcity if citizens live or die because of the many real reasons that determine the length of our lives here on earth,” they write. “Life expectancy, accidents, bad health system, or the lack of access to it. This statistics exist [sic], and we can use the power of new technology [to] create more realistic simulations.” </p>
<p>The game’s mechanics draw on study of research shared by the World Bank, US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the US Environmental Protection Agency, National Equity Atlas and the Center for Urban Future, among others. They’re keeping track of all these sources in a colossal <a href="https://microlandia.city/simulation_parameters">live document</a>, auto-generated from the game’s code. If you’re proper nerdy about this stuff, I imagine you will have Opinions on the facts and figures therein. Do tell. You can also find Microlandia on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4094120/Microlandia/">Steam</a>.</p>

            <guid>1400698</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There is still some good left in this world. We’re getting a new, still officially untitled, <a href="https://kotaku.com/goat-trailer-fart-joke-jackass-sony-zootopia-funny-teaser-2000656133"><em>Jackass</em></a>, and we don’t have to wait a decade like last time. The new comedy is set to arrive in June.</p> <p>On January 8, <em>Jackass</em> ringleader Johnny Knoxville <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTPFikrEXfX/?img_index=1">posted the iconic skull and crutches logo</a> for the franchise on Instagram, with the date June 26 below it. In the text for the post, he confirmed that, yes, a new <em>Jackass</em> movie is a go. Expect lots of wild stunts, gross moments, and of course, some injuries.</p>   <p>“Well, a wang dang and hot damn doodle, we are starting the year off with a bang,” said Knoxville on Instagram. “We wanted to let you know that this summer, Jackass is back!! We will see you in theatres June 26th. More to come, but wanted you to hear it from us first!”</p> <p>That’s all the official information we have at the moment. We don’t know who is returning or which guest stars will be making an appearance in the upcoming comedy flick. In the last movie, 2022’s<em> Jackass Forever</em>, most of the original <em>Jackass</em> crew from the 2000s era TV show on MTV returned, with the notable exceptions of Bam Margera and Ryan Dunn. Margera has struggled with substance abuse issues for years, and while sober now, has had a rocky relationship with the <em>Jackass</em> crew and is likely not returning in the next film. Dunn sadly died in 2011. His last <em>Jackass</em> movie was 2010’s <em>Jackass 3. </em>For <em>Jackass Forever, </em>the crew also added some younger talent to help out. No word if they will be returning this time around.</p>

 <p>The <em>Jackass</em> franchise is a big success for Paramount, with the four main films, and the <em>Bad Grandpa</em> spin-off, bringing in over $560 million worldwide at the box office on relatively tiny budgets. <a href="https://kotaku.com/jackass-forever-the-game-ps2-review-psp-mtv-knoxville-1848487592">There was even a <em>Jackass</em> video game released in 2007. It was bad. Don’t play it.&nbsp;</a></p>

              <p>Do you find yourself routinely trying to improve your computer setup, but you have too many cables to make it feasible? You might want to think about getting a multiport. They’re affordable, and thanks to the deal we’ve located, you can get one even cheaper than usual. Plus, you can set up your workstation using just a single USB-C port.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6707/">Get the UGREEN USB C Hub 5 in 1 Multiport at Amazon for only $9.99 (from $15.99), which is a $6 discount and approximately 38% in savings</a>. For this price, you can buy a few and change up all your computer stations just for the sake of keeping things consistent.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6707/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>An affordable way to improve your compact PC setup</h2>
<p>Here’s how it works. This multi-port adapter instantly adds additional ports to your existing device’s USB-C port when plugged in. When connected via USB-C you can add peripherals like a keyboard, a mouse, a flash drive or external hard drive to your central device, all without needing to swap cables every few minutes. It can essential help turn thin laptops and tablets into more powerful desktop setups when needed. For example, it’s useful whether you’re moving between a home office, a classroom or coffee shop.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can connect your device to a monitor, television or projector for a better viewing experience on a larger screen. This is beneficial for watching movies on a larger screen, displaying slides in a professional environment or extending your display to keep multiple windows open simultaneously.</p>



<p>As compact as they are, most hubs are designed to direct cable flow away from your hands to maintain a clean and organized workspace. The small and lightweight design of the UGREEN USB C Hub 5 in 1 Multiport makes it easy to fit into a laptop case or backpack pocket and allows you to take it wherever you go without giving it a second thought. Most importantly, this is the type of accessory you’ll likely forget about until you truly need a USB port or an external display, and then you’ll be happy it is available.</p>
<p>We’ve lined out the reasons why, so it’s probably obvious by now, but this USB-C hub can make for a super useful gift or addition to anyone’s PC setup. It’s a practical and affordable upgrade that gives you plenty of space to work with when it comes to compact setups. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6707/">And perhaps most importantly, it’s just $9.99</a>. That’s super affordable, and well worth picking up whether you shop for yourself or others as a gift. Anyone can appreciate the gift of efficiency, especially in a world where complex computing can be the norm.</p>

<p>A new report reveals that the Nintendo Switch 2 failed to match the original console’s sales during the first holiday period. </p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has been going strong in sales since its release, helping boost hardware sales across multiple months. The new console also reached a sales milestone of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-10-million-sales-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 million units</a> in November 2025; however, it seems things have been declining since then. </p>



<h2 id="h-switch-2-sales-fall-over-first-holiday-period">Switch 2 Sales Fall Over First Holiday Period</h2>



<p>A report by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/nintendo-switch-2-sales-stumble-over" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Business</a> reveals that Switch 2 sales have slowed during the holiday period, with the change more evident in Western markets. The Switch 2 fell short by 35% in the United States when compared to the original Switch in the same period in 2017. The situation is somewhat similar in Europe, with sales of the new console 16% lower than those of the previous one in the same period in the UK. However, overall Switch 2 sales in the UK were 6% higher than Switch 1’s. </p>



<p>A senior Nintendo employee revealed that a “complicated economic landscape” and “the absence of a major Western game” make it tough to compare the Switch to the original Switch; however, the team is happy with the overall performance. Moreover, sales were down in Japan during the holiday period as well, with the Switch 1 selling 1.39 million units during its first holiday period and the Switch 2 selling 1.32 million. When taking the whole year into account in Japan, Switch 2 sales were up 11% compared to the original console. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>PUBG Studios has announced that its PUBG spin off PUBG: Blindspot will be released into Early Access on February 5th. PUBG: Blindspot is a different experience to Battlegrounds, as this is a top down 5v5 tactical shooter within enclosed spaces instead of a bigger, open world. You can check out the gameplay in the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="PUBG: BLINDSPOT | Early Access Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A5qFiL2pdWc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The PUBG: Blindspot trailer above shows two teams of five battling it out as one side defends while another attacks. Players can only see&nbsp; what is happening in their line of sight, so anything obscured by doors or walls is hidden from view. That is unless you decide to blow a wall up to try and get a jump on the opposition. The attacking team is trying to fight through the building to hack into the hidden Crypt, while the defending team is trying to stop the hack from happening. Players will have access to unique characters that have their own playstyles and weapon preferences, with those including assault rifles, submachine guns, shotguns, long-range weapons like sniper rifles and DMR, pistols, and grenade launchers.</p>
<p>As this will be an early access release the content and experience of PUBG: Blindspot will evolve as the development team tweak the game based on player feedback. A release date for the 1.0 version has not yet been set.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game Review - Perfect Sequel]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>From the rush to find Merry and Pippin to Frodo and Sam’s trek through the Dead Marshes through the clash of forces at Helm’s Deep, <em>The Two Towers</em> goes pretty non-stop in <em>The Lord of the Rings</em>. Which is why I was <em>so</em> excited for this chapter of the story to get its “Trick Taking Game” treatment. But is it a worthy successor to the incredible <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/fellowship-of-ring-trick-taking-game-review-tricksy" rel="nofollow"><em>Fellowship of the Ring: Trick Taking Game</em></a>? Asmodee USA sent me a copy to find out, so follow my trail as I review the newly-released <em>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</em>.</p><p><em>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</em> is a sort of sequel to last year’s hit <em>Fellowship of the Ring: Trick Taking Game</em>, continuing on the story of the novel at Boromir’s fall. You do not need to own or have played the original game to play <em>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</em>, though having played the original will make this one a quick and easy teach.</p><p>A Trick Taking game enters on a series of hands, called tricks, with a player winning (or taking) the trick. The rules differ from game to game (and some famous games include Hearts, Spades, and Pinochle), but usually one player will lead the trick by playing a card, and other players have to follow that same card’s suit if possible. In <em>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</em>, players play cards value one to eight, in suits like Hills, Forest, Mountains, and Shadows.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><strong>How Do You Play </strong><em><strong>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</strong></em><strong>?</strong></h2><p>In essence, this is a cooperative Trick Taking game ala <em>The Crew</em>, where you and your teammates will take on roles of different heroes and villains from <em>LOTR</em> in a series of chapters. Each chapter represents a moment from the story, and each offers its own unique difficulties and complexities.</p><p>In each chapter, you’ll need to fulfill the goals of your hero. If any hero doesn’t successfully fulfill their goal by the end of the hand, you lose the chapter and need to try again. Goals range from needing to win a set amount of tricks, needing to win the lowest amount of tricks (thanks a lot, Pippin), and other fun surprises I won’t spoil here.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>In the first chapter, you’ll play as Boromir, Aragorn, and your choice between Gimli and Legolas. As you progress through the chapters, you’ll open up more twists, turns, and new characters that come and go from the game. You <em>can</em> play these chapters in any order, but the rulebook suggests you play them in order, as do I!</p><h2><strong>How Is </strong><em><strong>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</strong></em><strong> different from </strong><em><strong>The Fellowship of the Ring: Trick Taking Game</strong></em><strong>?</strong></h2><p>The chief difference, along with an entirely new batch of chapters to work through, is the inclusion of new cards - namely The White Tower, Black Tower, and Orc cards.</p><p>Gone (at least in the beginning of the game) are the Ring suit, as the story focuses on the action happening away from Frodo and Sam (and their precious). Instead are the White and Black tower cards, which automatically win a trick if only <em>one</em> of the two towers is played.</p><p>The Orc cards are another nasty addition, they don’t have a value, and if you ever have to lead a trick with an Orc card… you lose the entire chapter! This created many a nasty, desperate moment in my play testing, where the optimal play had to be interrupted to make sure I wasn’t stuck with an Orc as my last card in hand.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><strong>How Does It Feel To Play </strong><em><strong>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</strong></em><strong>?</strong></h2><p><em>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</em> feels very similar to playing the original game… which is a great accomplishment! As I wrote in my original review, “This is, by far, one of the best experiences I've had playing a trick-taking game.” Well… guess what? The same can be said for <em>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</em>.</p><p>The difficulty in this game ramps up right from the jump, assuming that many players would have already played through at least some of the original <em>Fellowship</em> game. Because of this, every single chapter, from first to last, is a satisfying head-scratcher, where you’ll balance hitting your goal with making sure every other player on the field is hitting theirs, as well.</p><p>The pressure of working through a trick is, as in the first game, augmented by the fact that each chapter can be played in about ten minutes, so failing a chapter is no biggie. Maybe you’ll want to switch up your heroes, or try to come to the challenge from a new angle.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Maybe you’ll get a bit lucky the next time you try a chapter, or maybe your luck will be even worse! That’s the beauty of the game, with a simple set of guidelines to work around, each chapter is a Hobbit-sized meal of clever design.</p><h2><em>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game </em>- Final Thoughts</h2><p><em>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</em> does exactly what I hoped it would as a sort of sequel. It expands upon the groundwork laid by the original game without requiring players to have completed that game, and it tweaks without completely overhauling the design of the original game.</p><p>The inclusion of the Orc cards add a fun new wrinkle to the game flow, and new heroes that come across your path will completely switch up how you approach the game. This is high-quality, thoughtful game design from top to bottom.</p><p>Whether you’re a fan of Tolkien’s world, or just love a good Trick Taking game, I cannot recommend <em>The Two Towers: Trick Taking Game</em> highly enough!

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/858127/top-five-most-played-games-xbox-ps5-2025</link>
            <guid>1400668</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s harder than ever for a new video game to crack the top of the most-played list. According to the Circana Player Engagement Tracker and video game market analyst Mat Piscatella, in 2025, the top five most-played games on PS5 and Xbox… <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mbraw2dcfc2s">were the same in 2024</a>. And they likely won’t be changing anytime soon.</p><p>Any gaming enthusiast could probably easily name the top five: <em>Fortnite, Roblox, Call of Duty, Minecraft, and Grand Theft Auto V</em>. These aren’t just the most-played games of ’24 and ’25, but have hovered at or around the top of the most-played list for several years now. Though they vary wildly in genre and gameplay, they have a handful of shared characteristics that inform some of their success. All of them are established games, around for eight years or more. They all are multiplatform and have multiplayer capabilities, numerous gameplay modes, and are constantly updated with new content. With the exception of<em> Call of Duty</em>, all the games extensively feature user-generated content while <em>Fortnite </em>and<em> Roblox </em>are free to play.</p><p>Eager to replicate the financial success of the top five and using those shared characteristics as a guideline, studios and publishers have spent years trying to build their own live-service hits. <em>Overwatch</em>, <em>Apex Legends</em>, <em>Valorant,</em> and the <em>Destiny 2</em> expansions enjoyed decent success, inspiring even more studios to make yet more live-service games. Square Enix, a developer not known for premium multiplayer experiences (<a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/the-critically-acclaimed-mmorpg">with one well-memed exception</a>), released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/24/23736525/this-sure-looks-like-splatoon"><em>Foamstars</em></a>. Rocksteady and BioWare, studios celebrated for their single-player narrative games, announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826586/suicide-squad-video-game-gameplay-trailer-the-game-awards"><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/7/5/17536926/bioware-anthem-gameplay-trailer-ps4-xbox-pc"><em>Anthem</em></a>. In 2022, Sony announced that it was working to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/2/22914016/sony-playstation-live-service-games-launch-march-2026">launch 10 live-service games before March 2026</a>. But a year later, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23953640/sony-pushes-back-its-live-service-game-ambitions">Sony scaled back those plans</a> — nearly every studio did.</p><div><p>Numerous games launched then failed for lack of quality or players. Square Enix announced that it would <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/foamstars-final-seasonal-update-party-goes-on-confirms-the-party-is-very-much-over">cease updates for <em>Foamstars</em></a> less than a year post-launch<em>. </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317407/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-final-season-offline-mode"><em>Kill the Justice League</em> also didn’t make it to a year</a> when Rocksteady released its final content update. <em>Anthem</em> will be a few weeks shy of its seventh anniversary <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/698360/the-end-of-an-anthem">when it shuts down on January 12th</a>, and after spending eight years in development, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/3/24234909/sony-concord-ps5-shutdown-poor-sales-launch-pc"><em>Concord</em> was taken down in weeks</a>. Developers learned too late that the characteristics that make the power five so successful are stopping other games from reaching the top.</p></div><p>The newest game of the bunch, <em>Fortnite</em>, has been around since 2017. It’s hard to ask a player that’s racked up eight years worth of Victory Royales, currency, battle pass progression, and skins to start over somewhere new. People also want to play games with their friends. If everyone you know is playing <em>Call of Duty</em>, guess what you’re gonna play? Meanwhile, as prices increase both <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/782532/game-console-price-hikes-xbox-ps5-switch">in gaming</a> and globally, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-physical-software-and-hardware-sales-just-had-the-worst-november-in-the-us-since-1995">players are buying fewer new titles or consoles</a>. Why spend money on a premium title like <em>Concord </em>and the fancy, expensive PS5 needed to play it, when <em>Fortnite </em>and<em> Roblox </em>are free and work on hardware you already have. It’s similar on PC. While the top of the Steam charts fluctuate more often than PlayStation or Xbox, new live-service games there are always competing against the usual PC suspects — <em>PUBG</em>, <em>Counter-Strike 2</em>, and <em>Dota 2</em>.</p><p>But for all the carnage of games released to little fanfare or killed before they could even launch, it’s not impossible for new live-service games to find success — just not at the same scale as a <em>Fortnite</em> or <em>GTA</em>. Games like <em>Helldivers 2, Marvel Rivals,</em> and (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arc-raiders-review">for better</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/827650/indie-developers-gen-ai-nexon-arc-raiders">or worse</a><em>) Arc Raiders </em>have been able to punch through the seeming inexhaustible noise of the top five, topping player-count charts not only on Xbox and PS5 but PC as well. Gaming in 2025 was also defined by games like <em>Ghost of Yotei, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Hades II,</em> and <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, possibly signaling that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24325371/2024s-best-games-classic-genres-astro-bot-balatro-metaphor">developing single-player narrative experiences might be a safer bet</a>. These five games aren’t going anywhere and will likely top the charts again, but in 2026, they’ll definitely have to make room for at least one new addition: <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> — that is if it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660057/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026">isn’t</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/816005/grand-theft-auto-vi-gta-g-delayed-november-2026">delayed</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/858127/top-five-most-played-games-xbox-ps5-2025]]></content:encoded>

<p>Netflix’s new post has confirmed that 2026 is the year in which The Witcher series comes to an end. </p>



<p>We were <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-final-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">informed</a> back in 2024 that Netflix’s The Witcher series would be renewed for its fifth and final season. Now that the fourth season has aired and the fifth season has been filmed, all we need to wait for is the last season to air. Netflix has confirmed that the fifth season will end its run in 2026. </p>







<h2 id="h-the-witcher-s-season-5-will-end-in-2026-bringing-the-series-to-a-close">The Witcher’s Season 5 Will End in 2026, Bringing the Series to a Close</h2>



<p>The confirmation that The Witcher series will end in 2026 comes from a <a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/new-shows-on-netflix-2026" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tudum</a> post by Netflix, which talks about all the content releasing this year. The summary states that “the time of the end is nigh,” and that dark forces will be coming together across the continent to target Ciri. If Geralt and Yennefer wish to save their daughter and reunite as a family, they will have to face never-before-seen obstacles and enemies. The fifth and final season of the show will air in 2026.</p>



<p>The Witcher series is highly revered in the fan base, even after going through a major recasting with Henry Cavill exiting for Liam Hemsworth to take his place. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witchers-ciri-had-considered-leaving-with-henry-cavill/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actress</a> who plays Ciri in the series also recently stated that she had considered leaving, along with Cavill. Still, she ultimately decided to return and take Henry’s role as “knowledgeable and loyal to the books,” as well as pushing for “certain lines to be included.” Even amid these twists and turns, the series has remained strong, and now fans are eagerly awaiting its epic conclusion. </p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon-review</link>
            <guid>1400644</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When a series such as Trails lasts as long as it has, sometimes things start to get <em>weird</em>. We’ve seen giant mechs, supernatural beings, and even multiversal time travel. After all of that, where else is there to go? Oh yeah, outer space! The vast, unknown territory of the final frontier is filled with possibilities, and The Legend of Heroes: Trails beyond the Horizon breaks through the atmosphere in order to tell a compelling sci-fi fantasy story filled with deception and intrigue. It also continues to refine the Daybreak saga’s hybrid action/turn-based combat system, with battles that are more engaging than ever before. The cliffhanger ending could make for a rocky re-entry for some, but when the dust settles, Trails beyond the Horizon manages to safely touch down as another enthralling RPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Picking up where <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-through-daybreak-2-review"><u>Trails through Daybreak 2</u></a> left off, Trails beyond the Horizon sees the nation of Calvard attempt humanity’s first manned spaceflight, called Project Startaker. Like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-into-reverie-review"><u>Trails into Reverie</u></a>, the roughly 60 to 70-hour campaign is split between the perspectives of three characters: Rean Schwarzer, the Trails of Cold Steel saga’s protagonist, Kevin Graham, the lead of Trails in the Sky the 3rd, and Daybreak’s mercenary hero Van Arkride. Trails beyond the Horizon manages this balance well, but (unsurprisingly) it does mean this isn’t a good starting point for new fans – Van is the star, but it treats each of the three as a “main” character in their own way, so you’ll need to have played the two previous Daybreak games <em>and</em> be familiar with the Cold Steel saga, Reverie, and the third entry in the Sky trilogy to really get everything that’s going on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That said, this story is still good on its own merits. Rean’s route kept me glued to the screen as he uncovered the real objective of Project Startaker and the conspiracy surrounding it. Kevin’s storyline is just as captivating as he picks up the mantle of “Heretic Hunter” once again,learning more about who his assassination target is and how to come to grips with it. Surprisingly, Van’s section is the most boring of the three (at least at first) as he and his crew fight off a mysterious new faction called the Vestiges. Van’s path is as long as the other two combined, and while that makes sense since Trails beyond the Horizon is <em>his</em> story, the first half of his route takes too long to build up, making the faster pacing of the other protagonists’ tales much more exciting by comparison. However, the way their stories tie in with Van’s towards the finale ultimately redeems it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trails beyond the Horizon also successfully manages the character bloat that plagued some previous Trails crossovers. It only includes a few key cast members from Rean’s Thors Academy days as both student and instructor, such as the lively student council president Towa Herschel and the calm but calculated Altina Orion. Kevin has Reverie’s Rufus, Nadia, Swin, and Lapis in tow, and new additions to both his and Van’s casts are smartly kept to a minimum as well. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Don’t fix what ain’t broken</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you played Daybreak 2, this review might sound familiar in spots, as Trails beyond the Horizon sticks quite close to that formula outside of combat. For instance, the Marchen Garten roguelite dungeon returns in the form of Grim Garten, and it’s the same drill as usual. You navigate it by playing a minigame, moving across a board and fighting monsters until you reach a floor’s boss. Only the first half of the dungeon is required for story purposes, with the second being entirely optional, but it’s a shame that Grim Garten isn’t available to continue playing through after the credits roll like Marchen Garten was.  That’s a slight downgrade, as Marchen Garten gave a satisfying “post-game” feeling to Daybreak 2, letting me clean up other tasks as I prepared to jump into New Game Plus, that’s now missing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, Grim Garten still has the same worthwhile incentives to explore it periodically throughout the story. You can earn valuable skill points to level up your party’s attacks, as well as unlock cosmetics and useful items (all of which are earned in game, with no microtransactions involved whatsoever), and even learn more about the backstories of certain characters, which was particularly interesting for some of the antagonists.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Optional activities like this have always been an important part of previous Trails games, and deep side quests and fun bonding events make a return to Trails beyond the Horizon as well. Not only do they reward you with useful and rare items, they also provide a vast amount of insight into the world and the people who inhabit it. It was fun to see how Rean contacted Van, asking if he could accept requests from the city bulletin on his behalf in order to experience the mercenary life. One of my favorite quests involved busting an illegal casino chip trade, with the culprit behind it being a recurring character who has been cooking up schemes since the Crossbell games, Trails from Zero and Trails to Azure, 16 years ago. It’s a nostalgic touch that showcases how expansive this series is.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The LGC morality system from the first two Daybreak games makes a return, too: Sometimes when Rean, Van, and Kevin finish quests, they have the option to decide the outcome, which increases their affinity to either Law, Gray, or Chaos. In the first Daybreak game, your affinity determined which allies joined Van towards one of the later chapters. Disappointingly, like Daybreak 2, there’s no such impact in Trails beyond the Horizon, which made me once again question why the LGC system still exists in its current iteration at all. It was initially a standout feature that separated Van from other Trails heroes, so it’s disheartening to see the mechanic has actually regressed instead of evolved in any meaningful way, especially since it’s now tied to other protagonists as well. For example, what would a “chaos” aligned Rean look like, similar to his berserk <a href="https://kiseki.fandom.com/wiki/Sacrifice" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>“ogre” form</u></a> from Cold Steel III and IV? Ideas like this could’ve been cool to explore. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At least the bonding events, called Connections, remain consistently delightful and charming, letting you hang out with other party members during major story beats. Not only do they offer fantastic character development, but they can also increase a character’s parameters, such as their attacking stats or chance that they’ll initiate a follow-up attack in battle. A favorite bonding event of mine was when Rufus reflected with Kevin about where he’s at in life – introduced all the way back in the first Cold Steel game, Rufus was a high-tier noble at the upper echelon of society, being recognized and revered wherever he went. A fall from grace and several (in-game) years later, he now spends his days in the shadows with his hair down looking after kids, but is content with himself. It’s a satisfying full-circle moment that had me reminiscing about my college days when I started playing the Trails series on my PlayStation Vita.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Teaching a new dog old tricks</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Like the previous Daybreak games, Trails beyond the Horizon uses a hybrid turn-based/real-time action combat system. Out in the field, you can wail on enemies in real time in order to stun them. After successfully doing so, you can then transition to the turn-based battle system with an advantage, dealing extra damage right out of the gate. This was an imperfect but exciting system I liked when it was first introduced, and further refinements here make the field battles feel more fleshed out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are now ZOC abilities that let you temporarily stop time and get a few extra hits in, but the biggest game changer is the Awakening mechanic. Van, Rean, and Kevin can power themselves up to dish out more damage before going into turn-based combat. These Awakenings include Rean’s Spirit Unification, Van’s Grendal, and Kevin’s Stigma, which are clever ways of marrying a story-based power up and a previously turn-based exclusive-mechanic into a real-time action one. Even if the turn-based combat will always be where Trails thrives the most, it’s admirable that developer Falcom is continually iterating on the real-time elements to make them equally engaging.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Further refinements make the field battles feel more fleshed out.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The bulk of the turn-based combat is the same as previous Daybreak and Trails games at large. At the top of your screen sits a turn order timeline that you can plan around and manipulate. There are several bonus icons that will randomly align with either an ally or enemy on the timeline, which can range from bursts of healing or bypassing the casting time for magic to let a character fire off a spell right away. It’s important to pay attention to the timeline order as these bonuses can change the flow of battle, which makes for a compelling combat puzzle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While “stealing” bonuses was possible in Daybreak 2, you could only do so when enemies were stunned or unconscious, and Trails beyond the Horizon slightly revised this mechanic to make it more accessible. If you activate a Shard Boost from your Boost Gauge to power up your next attack and then strike an enemy, you’ll grab whatever bonus was aligned with it and transform it into a more powerful “Plus” version, increasing the effectiveness of it for yourself. Steal a Zero Arts bonus? Not only will your next spell be cast immediately, but its power jumps up by 50%! This adds an extra layer of clever planning to an already well-thought out battle system.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Alternatively, you can still use skills that can inflict Delay on an enemy, pushing a bonus further down the timeline to hopefully land on an ally. In fact, this tactic has even gotten an update in Trails beyond the Horizon as successfully delaying an enemy while under a Shard Boost will also spawn a “Plus” version of that same bonus on the timeline during the next turn. These minor yet impactful boons make the combat more strategic and engaging. They can mean the difference between victory and defeat, especially against the hardest enemies later on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Positioning, once again, is also crucial to combat. Each skill has a certain attack pattern, whether it’s a circle, cross, or a straight line. Maneuvering your characters so that you can hit as many enemies as possible ensures you get the most out of each action you take. Skills also have secondary effects. For example, Rean’s Sixfold Gales skill inflicts Delay, but also gets a damage buff if the enemy is struck from behind. Even if Rean can’t get behind an enemy, the skill is still useful as the Delay effect can help push a timeline bonus away from it. Trails has always had these mechanics, but the consistent quality and improvements between all of the entries is impressive, and a big part of what makes this combat system unique.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Game Order to Play the Trails Series</h3><p>This is the best order to play the Trails games in to best understand the events taking place in the Zemuria saga.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest addition to Trails beyond the Horizon’s turn-based combat is the introduction of Shard Commands. These are basically upgraded versions of Brave Orders from Cold Steel III, IV, and Reverie. By consuming portions of your Boost Gauge, you can apply party-wide buffs that last for a limited number of turns. They can drastically turn the tide of battle, with effects like reducing incoming damage down to 30% or decreasing casting time for spells. Shard Commands are also more flexible than Brave Orders. In previous Trails games, bosses could enact their Brave Orders, called “Disorders,” to overwrite your own, but you couldn’t do the same thing back. You’re now able to overwrite boss Anti-Shard Commands with your own, but it’ll consume an extra bar in your Boost Gauge on top of the normal cost. It’s a smartly implemented trade-off that levels the playing field and feels fair.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, using two bars of your Boost Gauge activates ZOC and lets characters act twice in a row. In previous Daybreak games, you were incentivized to mainly conserve your Boost Gauge to fire off a character’s S-Crafts (ultimate attacks), so between Shard Commands and ZOC, as well as the aforementioned new bonus stealing mechanics, you have exciting new choices for how to spend it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, the customization options remain largely unchanged from the two previous Daybreak games, but that’s not a bad thing since it provides the same kind of fun as tinkering in a toybox and getting lost for hours while optimizing your party’s full potential. Slotting elemental gems, called Quartz, into one of four available lines for a variety of perks is still a clever system. It’s fun to experiment with different elemental combinations and values in order to unlock more potent Shard Abilities, including ones that can help outside of battle – like Golden Eye, which marks every treasure chest on your map in the area, ensuring that you’ll never miss any useful items. The Quartz system has been polished over the past two decades and has become one of the most flexible in any modern RPG. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">After its predecessor took a detour from advancing the Calvard saga in favor of a more interpersonal story, The Legend of Heroes: Trails beyond the Horizon almost feels like an overcorrection as it weaves the plot-heavy stories of three different protagonists into a single adventure. However, splitting it into three distinct routes makes it all much easier to digest. While our main hero is overshadowed by the other protagonists early on, the story eventually finds a satisfying way to weave its paths together, and ultimately sticks the landing. The new mechanics in both the turn-based and real-time combat are welcome additions that continue to refine a battle system that was already a lot of fun. And while its cliffhanger ending will likely be divisive, Trails beyond the Horizon has certainly built an exciting launchpad for what comes next.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon-review]]></content:encoded>

In this quest, you'll have to find any signs that raiders have survived topside near the Abandoned Highway Camp in Buried City. We'll tell you everything you need to know about this quest and how to complete it in this guide.</p><p>You don't need to extract to complete A Warm Place to Rest, but you will be trekking across the entire Buried City map to complete the objectives. With this in mind, a free loadout may not be your best bet, as you're rather likely to encounter raiders or ARC, which means you'll probably need extra healing items. It's your choice, of course, but we'd recommend bringing a decent gun or two, and enough heals to keep you trucking along safely.</p><p>When you're ready to finish A Warm Place to Rest, follow the steps below.</p><h2 id="Locate_the_Abandoned_Highway_Camp">Locate the Abandoned Highway Camp</h2><p>The Abandoned Highway Camp is located on the Buried City map just southeast of the Grandioso Apartments.

Now, with roughly a month to go until <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/mario-tennis-fever">the game's February 12 release date</a>, the company has released a new overview trailer highlighting nearly 6 minutes of gameplay, including a look at the series' largest roster of playable characters.&nbsp;</p><p>That's because Mario Tennis Fever features 38 different characters, ranging from fan-favorites like Mario and Luigi to more mischievous players like Dry Bones and Baby Waluigi. Alongside those 38 characters, Mario Tennis Fever features 30 Fever Rackets, which are all-new to the series and allow you to equip your character with unique abilities. The Ice Racket, for example, turns parts of the court into a slippery tundra, while the Mini Mushroom Racket shrinks your opponent to bite size.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Just fill up your Fever Gauge to unleash a Fever Shot," a press release reads. "And if you're on the receiving end of one, don't worry – you can try and send it back at your opponent before the shot hits the court, so they feel the effects instead." That's an especially useful skill to learn when up against rackets like the Shadow Racket, which causes the receiving player to see double as it duplicates the player using the racket.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check all this out and more in the Mario Tennis Fever overview trailer for yourself below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RSyoMsWRL9I"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RSyoMsWRL9I" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Mario Tennis Fever will feature a single-player Adventure Mode, a campaign in which mysterious monsters turn Mario, Luigi, Princess Peach, Wario, and Waluigi into babies, forcing them to re-master their tennis skills and overcome challenges to return to normal. Elsewhere in the game, the Trial Towers mode forces players to take on a series of challenges as they climb their way to the top of a tower, and Mix It Up mode allows you to play matches with unconventional rules, like Ring Shot, where you have to hit balls with precision through rings to earn points and Forest Court Match, where you can expand the court's size by feeding Piranha Plants tennis balls.&nbsp;</p><p>Returning modes include Tournament, with play-by-play commentary from <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/super-mario-bros-wonder/getting-its-flowers">Super Mario Bros. Wonder's</a> Talking Flower, and online modes like Online Room for casual play with customizable rules and Ranked Matches, where you can play against players around the world.

            <title><![CDATA[Not Even A Video Game Can Convince Me To Read The Directions First]]></title>

            <guid>1400626</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>We had these report cards in elementary school that, in addition to grading us on school subjects, also evaluated how we were doing on general life skills. I did pretty well in classes besides math, but the two skills I repeatedly failed were “penmanship” and “following directions.” I am simply not very good at reading and understanding explanations before I begin a task, and it’s this tendency that’s making the game <em>Uncle Chop’s Rocket Shop</em> a bit of a nightmare for me, but also really fun.</p><p><em>Uncle Chop’s Rocket Shop</em> came out in 2024, and it’s been sitting in my Epic store library for a while before I finally decided to check it out this week. You play as Wilbur, a fox-headed dude who inherits an intergalactic mechanic’s shop and has to fix enough spaceships to make growing rent payments. There’s more plot than this– I’m only a few in-game days in, and I’ve already encountered mystical beings, thieves, meteor showers, and other hints that this isn’t just a job simulator. It’s possible to die, but the game is also a roguelike, with upgrades to your mechanic’s shop persisting between runs. But the bulk of your day is taken up by choosing from a number of repair jobs and getting them done to the customer’s satisfaction.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hr1FwsDDbzY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Uncle Chop's Rocket Shop - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games"></iframe></figure><p>There are two modes to choose from: one with time pressure, where customers will get angry if you don’t fix their ships fast enough, and one that does away with the clock but makes the repairs harder and more exacting. I hate time pressure in games so opted for this more chill mode. This seems like a good way to learn the game, and especially how to come to grips with its giant, weird <a href="https://www.unclechops.com/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">manual</a>.</p><p>When you go to refill a customer’s fuel pump, for instance, you’ll see a symbol that will tell you which tab in the manual to go to, which you do by physically pulling the book out of your inventory and clicking through its pages. There, you’ll get a variety of images, brisk instructions, and references to other parts of the manual that will help you troubleshoot and solve the problem. My fuel jobs have been pretty basic–remove the fuel cell, refill it at my fuel station without filling it too far and exploding it, putting it back in. Oil is a little more complicated–in addition to the oil levels, there’s the oil quality to consider, as well as a pump, heat gauge, and other gadgets that could be busted. A recent job included both of these tasks and two new complications. There was an alarm that wouldn’t stop timing out and locking me out of the other ship modules, which had to be disarmed with a series of puzzles, and a “tomfoolery” module that required buying a new repair station to fix and then playing a whole <em>other</em> video game to calibrate.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Beard Envy</span></figcaption></figure><p>The actual fixing is wonderfully tactile, with lots of <a href="https://aftermath.site/pacific-drive-star-trucker-buttons-steam/"><u>buttons</u></a> to press and levers to pull and bolts to unscrew. Just like in real life, you have to make sure you do all these things–I’ve lost money for forgetting to close a panel back up, or gotten stuck because I was flipping switches in the wrong order. The manual tells you all this, but it’s written like a real professional manual that assumes a certain familiarity with the objects at hand. Everything you need to know is in there, but it can be a little baffling to get your head around, especially if you’re not a great visual learner or are me, who cannot help himself from skimming the instructions before diving into a ship’s guts. In the game’s time-pressure mode, I imagine learning a new task for the first time requires an overwhelming amount of speedreading and making good choices, but in my chill mode I have no justification for not taking the time to look everything over first besides being a dumbass. I find it hard to understand the manual without experiencing the thing it’s describing, but going step-by-step often gets me stumped if a problem is deeper in the book. I’ll plunge ahead with unearned confidence, run into problems, give the manual the most cursory glance, dive back in, and get stumped again, in an absurd loop I have no one to blame for but myself.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Beard Envy</span></figcaption></figure><p>I hate reading directions, but I <em>do</em> like research, so I enjoy looking stuff up in the manual even if I’m not fully digesting it. It’s hard not to get impatient to fiddle with all the strange machines, which give me some great <a href="https://spaceteam.ca/?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>Spaceteam</u></em></a><em> </em>vibes. The computer I’m playing <em>Uncle Chop’s</em> on sits next to an Ikea bookshelf I put together myself <em>also</em> without reading the instructions in full, and which is now listing to one side because I didn’t pay enough attention to the importance of rigorously attaching its shitty plywood back. Looking up from a game that reminds me I apparently haven’t grown at all as a person since third grade to real-world proof of the fact that I haven’t grown at all as a person since third grade is a <em>lot</em>, and the in-game consequences for my bad habit feel like a reminder that there will also be real-world consequences when my bookshelf inevitably collapses. At least in the game I’ll get a chance to start again, unlike my bookshelf, which will destroy everything around it when it forces me to pay for my hubris.</p><p><em>Uncle Chop’s Rocket Shop</em> is available on PC and consoles. </p>

		<p>Publisher Wales Interactive and developer Trapped Predator have announced that the interactive psychological horror FMV game Heart of the Forest will be released on February 12th. The confirmed platforms are PC, PS5, PS4, Series X|S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, iOS and Android. It is a live action story that follows a group of students as they explore Germany’s Black Forest, which is home to an evil spirit.</p>
<p><iframe title="Heart of the Forest - Official Reveal Trailer | Horror Games Award Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r-MNjJEcHkE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Heart of the Forest players will see the world through each character’s point of view, making choices on the information available to steer the story. Each character has their own fears and traumas that are exploited by the forest spirit to scare and hunt the students down. Your choices will determine who lives and who dies. Some of the footage definitely has The Blair Witch Project vibes, which is likely to have been an influence on Heart of the Forest.</p>
<p>In a statement Trapped Predator said, “<em>Heart of the Forest is our modern take on German folklore set in the mysterious Black Forest. In our debut title, we invite you to join our four protagonists on a chilling journey into their darkest nightmares. See you inside the forest!”</em></p>

<p>A price for Heart of the Forest is yet to be confirmed.</p>
