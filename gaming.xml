            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake<em> </em>doesn't open with a jump scare; it opens in a trance. As Mio, you watch helplessly as a crimson butterfly lures your twin sister, Mayu, into a fog-covered forest. There, the Lost Village swallows her whole. For over twenty-two years, this scene has haunted fans, myself included. Seeing the village emerge from the mist, modern lighting draping every rooftop and tree branch in dense volumetric fog, I knew immediately: this isn't a low-budget remaster. The dread in Fatal Frame 2 stems not only from the individually named wraiths stalking you through its haunted Japanese village – a place trapped in a festival of death – but also from the way Mayu grips your hand, dragging you toward dangers you're unprepared for. After roughly four hours with the first four chapters on PC, this remake already has its hooks in me — not only is it a faithful yet modernized take on what many consider the scariest game ever, its added visual fidelity makes the core mechanic of looking directly at what's trying to kill you that much harder to endure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fatal Frame 2's central mechanic remains one of the cleverest in survival horror. Your primary weapon is the Camera Obscura — a modified camera that damages wraiths by photographing them. That's it. No shotguns, no grenades stashed in a locker. You point a camera at something terrifying, and you take its picture. The series has been doing this since 2001, and it's still unlike anything else in the genre.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Camera Obscura uses focal points: crosshairs that identify a wraith's weak spots. Aligning more of these points when you take a photo increases the damage dealt. You can upgrade these focal points with prayer beads found throughout the environment, making each shot more lethal and rewarding exploration in classic survival horror style. But your camera can also deliver special shots that require willpower, and the effect varies depending on the equipped filter. While auto-focus helps you lock onto targets, manual focus rewards precision with more serious damage. And, despite Fatal Frame 2's penalties for proximity, keeping the viewfinder pulled back and standing dangerously close to a spirit was often the better strategy for dealing more damage and taking control of a fight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, willpower is a limited and valuable resource. If you get too close, a wraith will drain your willpower, leaving you vulnerable to a leering attack that flashes your screen and momentarily steals control, or allows the wraith to strike you more easily than it would at range.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Film types serve as your ammunition and create their own layer of resource tension. The basic Type-07 film is infinite but reloads slowly and hits weakly, while stronger film like the Type-61 deals significantly more damage but caps at eight shots and must be scavenged, as you can't buy more when you run out. Interchangeable filters add further complexity: the Standard Filter stuns enemies, the Paraceptual Filter blinds them at range and can eventually be upgraded to see through walls, and the Exposure Filter can unlock secret items and areas by reconstructing certain scenes with the Phantom Exposé mode. Each filter has its own upgrade path covering range, reload speed, and special shot duration, and since special shots cost willpower, you're also incentivized to invest your limited prayer beads into upgrading willpower recovery at the expense of raw damage. There's a lot of strategy here for players who want to dig into Fatal Frame 2’s intricate system.</p><p>There's a lot of strategy here for players who want to dig into Fatal Frame 2’s intricate system.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This excellent combat loop revolves around timing. You enter camera mode by holding the left trigger, frame the wraith with the right thumbstick, and slam the right trigger to activate the shutter. But your shots will typically be weaker unless you wait for it to telegraph an attack — you'll hear the wraith moaning while the screen flashes red — and then you hit the shutter for a Fatal Frame shot, which staggers the spirit and deals massive damage. Nail one while a wraith is already vulnerable and you trigger Fatal Time, a window for rapid-fire photos that automatically burns through your basic Type-07 film. The whole system punishes impatience and rewards the nerve to stand still while something horrible lunges at you, but it is slow. Deliberately so. Film reload times are long, enemies take a while to go down, and the rhythm of shooting, exiting camera mode, backpedaling, and re-entering is methodical by design — kinda like jousting, but with a camera instead of a lance. When the atmosphere is doing its job, which it usually is, the deliberateness feels meditative. Whether it stays that way across a full campaign is one of the bigger questions this preview can't yet answer.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Through the Viewfinder</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Three difficulty modes are available: Story, Normal, and Hard (Battle). Each is meaningfully tuned, with harder settings increasing wraith damage while rewarding more Photo Points for skilled shots. Those points feed into an item shop where you can purchase healing items and equippable stat-boosting charms, creating a risk-reward scale that shifts rather than simply punishing the player. I played most of the preview on Normal before switching to Story after Chapter Three. Even in Story, enemies hit hard enough to maintain tension — meaning these difficulty modes preserve the horror rather than trivialize it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of customizing the experience, I previewed Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake on a machine equipped with a Ryzen 3900X, RTX 4070 Ti, and 32GB of RAM at 3440x1440p ultrawide with max settings. In typical PC gamer fashion, my first adventure was the options menu itself, which deserves mention for its satisfying granularity. You can adjust vibration intensity separately for damage feedback, item searching, and even how hard Mio’s heart races during cutscenes. You can fine-tune camera behavior down to obstacle avoidance and rotation inertia; customize your graphical settings with precision; and even change the Camera Obscura's viewfinder style between a classic and modern look. If you can imagine a setting, this remake probably has it. It also ships with both English and Japanese audio, which is a welcome touch for a series with such deep roots in Japanese horror.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">PC players expecting an unlocked frame rate should note that it is capped at 60fps. Considering the attention to detail in areas like viewfinder styles and vibration settings, Fatal Frame 2's lack of broader accessibility features stands out. It already offers a deep UI and subtitle scaling, customizable text colors, named character labels, and text backgrounds — a solid foundation. However, the absence of screen reading or colorblind modes is particularly striking for a game built around photographing ghosts, where visual feedback like crosshair lock-ons, screen flashes, and color inversions drive the core loop. Screen reader support for the extensive menus, item descriptions, and collectible documents seems a natural extension of the text customization already in place. Games like The Last of Us Part 2 have shown that colorblind accessibility can be addressed through audiovisual indicators that don't rely on color alone, an approach that could work here without undermining the atmosphere.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Spirited Away</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Fatal Frame 2’s engrossing story centers on twin sisters Mio and Mayu, who stumble into Minakami Village — a place that vanished from a mountainside on the night of a failed ritual. The village was built over a gate to the underworld called the Hellish Abyss, and its residents performed a gruesome twin sacrifice to keep it sealed. When the ritual failed, the village was consumed by mist, and now it's full of restless spirits who want to reenact the whole thing using you.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The story setup hooked me immediately. Every room feels handcrafted to maximize unease — items clattering off shelves in adjacent hallways, rain pattering against rooftops while ghosts stalk corridors, the distant wail of a wraith telling you exactly where it is and exactly why you shouldn't be there. The sound design is relentless. Everything is precisely mixed, which makes the jump scares land harder because the baseline atmosphere is already ratcheted tight. Reach out to pick up an item, and a wraith may grab your hand instead, draining your willpower until you frantically mash the A button to shake it off. It's a small touch, but it means even looting feels dangerous.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each ghost has a name and backstory you can piece together through collectible documents and a spirit list that catalogs every encounter: the drowned woman on the bridge, the woman sealed in a box, the spirit in the Osaka house still searching for her lost boyfriend Masumi. It goes deep into the lore as well: by digging into the richly detailed village for scraps of lost journals and other items left behind, I uncovered that Masumi was a folklorist's assistant who vanished while surveying a forest slated for a dam, only for his girlfriend Miyako to follow him into the mist and meet the same fate.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">She's the spirit I fought in the Osaka house, and I loved playing through an entire 30-minute side quest dedicated to demystifying her background. Throughout the campaign, you photograph the former residents’ spectral remnants and slowly build a picture of the tragedy that consumed Minakami Village, giving Fatal Frame 2 a level of world-building that rewards curiosity without requiring it and gives every encounter a layer of melancholy underneath the fear.</p><p>Outside of combat, Fatal Frame 2 plays like a classic Resident Evil game, and that's a specific comparison.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The preview build also featured the Kusabi, a massive, unkillable entity that patrols certain areas. When it shows up, you can't fight it; you hide. It drains your willpower on contact, forces your screen into black and white, and disables the Camera Obscura entirely. One extended sequence in the Kurosawa mansion strips you of your flashlight while the Kusabi hunts you through dark hallways, and it's the most effective horror set piece in the preview. It's the kind of sequence that makes you realize how much the Camera Obscura normally functions as a security blanket.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">What in the Junji Ito?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of combat, Fatal Frame 2 plays like a classic Resident Evil game, and that's a specific comparison. Players navigate interconnected rooms, find keys, solve puzzles to unlock new areas, and occasionally discover that previously safe rooms now contain threats. Save points can be blocked by enemies. The structure creates a loop of dread, relief, and fresh dread that survival horror fans will immediately recognize.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/12/07-focus-point-1770924212486.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Puzzles are straightforward — one has you arranging dolls on a temple altar based on clues from a photograph — but they're woven into the environmental storytelling in ways that keep them from feeling like arbitrary roadblocks. Hidden collectibles include pairs of twin dolls that unlock items at the Photo Point exchange shop when photographed together. The previously mentioned Phantom Exposé system lets you recreate old photographs found in the environment to reveal hidden items. You match the framing of an old photo to uncover something that had vanished, giving genuine reason to revisit earlier areas with fresh eyes and a charged filter.</p><span data-cy="faceoff-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, your flashlight helps spot items but makes it easier for enemies to detect you, adding a stealth element that feeds directly into the tension. Some areas are better to sneak through if you can’t afford to fight a wraith head-on, and running away from a fight to the nearest save point is usually an option. It’s great that you heal automatically at save points, and while holding Mayu's hand also regenerates health, she was separated from Mio for two full chapters during the preview, leaving me reliant on rare healing items and careful play. Equippable charms provide small stat boosts — the Moonstone extends your dodge window, while Mayu’s Charm increases health recovery when holding hands. They're small build decisions that add texture without overcomplicating things.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/12/04-spirit-sae-kurosawa-02-1770924238762.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Fatal Frame 2 Remake’s controls feel deliberately stiff — you dodge on A, crouch on B, and open your inventory on X. There’s also some inertia when entering and exiting the Camera Obscura’s viewfinder with the left trigger. This layout makes sense after a while, but during the first two chapters, I often fumbled for the right input with a wraith bearing down on me. Depending on your tolerance, that's either a control issue or a horror feature.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Point and Shoot</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">It took roughly four hours to clear the first four chapters, partly due to combat difficulty and partly because the world rewards exploration, with plenty of nooks and crannies to dip into while scavenging for critical items and uncovering the elaborate depth of Minakami Village itself. The graphics and UI translate well to ultrawide, and fans will find the rebuilt classic scenes rich with detail. But some questions do remain about how well the rest of the campaign fares. The 60fps cap is an annoying albeit forgivable ceiling; the deliberate combat pacing could grow tiresome over a full campaign. It’s also too early to tell how faithfully the remake handles the original's multiple endings, although Fatal Frame 2's history and the deft handling of its campaign so far suggests greater narrative complexity ahead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Camera Obscura system remains unique in survival horror, the atmosphere is thick enough to feel physical, and the storytelling rewards the slow, careful attention this genre demands. If you loved the original, this is shaping up to be a worthy reintroduction. If you've never played Fatal Frame, this is the place to start — the entries are largely standalone, and this one was already considered the best back in 2003. Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake launches for PC, PS5, Switch 2, and Xbox Series on March 12, 2026.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/fatal-frame-2-remake-makes-a-camera-the-scariest-weapon-in-gaming-ign-preview]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>A video game adaptation of The Bird That Drinks Tears.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > KRAFTON [79 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/krafton">KRAFTON</a> and developer <a title="Companies > KRAFTON Montreal Studio" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/krafton/krafton-montreal-studio">KRAFTON Montreal Studio</a> have officially announced <em><a title="Games > Project Windless" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/project-windless">Project Windless</a></em>, an single-player open-world <a title="Genres > Action [3,395 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> <a title="Genres > RPG [18,037 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPG</a>  adaptation of the Korean fantasy novel series <em>The Bird That Drinks Tears</em> that <a href="https://press.krafton.com/KRAFTON-INC-BEGINS-DEVELOPMENT-ON-A-NEW-GAME-BASED-ON-THE-BIRD-THAT-DR">first began development</a> in 2022. It will launch for consoles and <a title="Platforms > PC [25,501 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a>, including <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,420 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>. A release date was not nanounced. <span id="more-1025968"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via KRAFTON:</p><blockquote><p><strong>A New Premium <a title="Genres > Open-World [829 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">Open-World</a> <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,975 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">Action RPG</a></strong></p><p>Designed as a player-driven open-world experience, <em>Project Windless</em> centers on a continent-spanning conflict, combining epic storytelling with visceral, mastery-driven combat and massive real-time battles. Built with Unreal Engine 5, the game features a non-linear structure where player decisions shape alliances and the broader conflict unfolding across the world through exploration, combat, and interaction with key factions.</p><p><strong>Set in the World of <em>The Bird That Drinks Tears</em></strong></p><p>While <em>Project Windless</em> is designed to stand on its own for new players, its world is rooted in <em>The Bird That Drinks Tears</em>, a landmark Korean fantasy series by author Lee Yeong-do. Instead of directly adapting the novels, the game is set approximately 1,500 years before the original story, during a largely unexplored mythical age when legends were still being formed. This approach allows <em>Project Windless</em> to serve as an entry point for global audiences while also expanding the universe for longtime fans. The world features four intelligent races: Humans, Rekon, Nhaga, and Tokkebi. Each race has its own culture, conflicts, and worldview.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_1026262"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Play as the Hero King</strong></p><p>In <em>Project Windless</em>, players assume the role of the Hero King, a legendary mighty warrior of the Rekon race. Rekons are towering humanoid bird beings known for their overwhelming strength and ferocity. Armed with twin star-forged blades, the Hero King stands as a powerful force facing overwhelming odds—cutting through dozens of foes simultaneously, confronting massive creatures, and leading allied forces when battles escalate to epic scale. As players build reputation and forge relationships across the world, they unite different races and factions, shaping the foundations of a future kingdom through their actions.</p><p><strong>Large-Scale Battles Powered by <a title="Companies > Mas [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>s Technology</strong></p><p>At the core of <em>Project Windless</em> is Mass Technology. This technology enables thousands of soldiers and massive creatures to clash in real time across dynamic battlefields.</p><p>Combat is fully real-time, fast-paced, and skill-based. Players fight directly within massive engagements rather than issuing commands from a distance, combining precise combat mastery with tactical decision-making to influence the flow of battle. The result is a one-versus-many combat experience that blends personal action with the scale of full-scale warfare.</p><p>“From the start, we asked ourselves what it really means to play a legendary figure in a fantasy world,” said KRAFTON Montreal Studio head and creative director Patrik Methe. “For us, that meant giving players real agency, not just in combat, but in how wars unfold, how alliances are formed, and how history is written. <em>Project Windless</em> is built around the idea that legend is not something you observe, it is something you actively create through play.”</p><p><strong>A Global Development Effort</strong></p><p>Development of <em>Project Windless</em> is led by KRAFTON Montreal Studio, KRAFTON’s AAA development hub in North America, in close collaboration with teams in Pangyo, South Korea. This partnership combines Western AAA development expertise with a strong focus on cultural authenticity and worldbuilding inspired by Korean mythology.</p><p><strong>First Developer Diary Now Available</strong></p><p>Alongside the reveal trailer, KRAFTON also released the first developer diary for <em>Project Windless</em>. The video offers early insight into the game’s creative vision, world design, and development philosophy, and is available now on the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ProjectWindless" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Project Windless</em> YouTube channel</a>.</p><p><em>Project Windless</em> is designed as a premium, single-player experience with no multiplayer or live-service components. The game is currently in development for PC and consoles. Additional details, including the release window, will be announced at a later date.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

<p>For those not in the know, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake</em> is<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> not the first remake of the second entry in the series</strong>, which originally launched on PlayStation 2 and Xbox in 2003/2004. In 2012, the game made the jump to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nintendo Wii</strong>, blossoming from its <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">fixed-camera</strong> state reminiscent of the first few Resident Evil and Silent Hill games into an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">over-the-shoulder third-person</strong> game blended with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">motion controls</strong> via the Wii Remote that suited the Camera Obscura mechanics well. The<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)"> enhanced visuals</strong> also served the experience quite well, making it way more eerie and immersive.</p>



<p><em>Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake</em> is another enhancement of the experience, with <strong>modern visuals</strong> powered by the Katana engine for an even more immersive experience, and <strong>plenty of quality-of-life improvements</strong> to enhance gameplay to the highest possible degree. <strong>Having only played the original PlayStation 2 release</strong> once back in the day, it is impossible for me to judge <strong>how an early build of the remake I had the chance to try compares to the Wii Edition</strong>. <span>What I can say, however, </span>is that this remake, which sits between innovation and tradition, is set to deliver&nbsp;a <strong>very engaging experience</strong>, if one can look past a combat system that does feel more frustrating than fun, at least in the beginning of the game.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Fatal-Frame-2-Crimson-Butterfly-Remake-gameplay-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Fatal Frame 2 Crimson Buttefly Remake features some very traditional survival-horror gameplay mechanics</em></figcaption></figure>

Like in the original, the player's choices will shape the siblings' destiny among different possibilities, offering <strong>great replayability</strong></p>



<p>While I only <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">experienced the recreation of the first four chapters in the game</strong>, I couldn't help but remember how <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">gripping</strong> Fatal Frame 2 can be from the start. The combination of<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> cutscenes and environmental storytelling</strong>, which relies heavily on finding documents scattered throughout the village, has only become more <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">powerfu</strong>l in the remake thanks to enhanced visuals that bring Minakami Village to life like never before. Some of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">pre-rendered cutscenes</strong> focusing on past events do seem to be a simple upscale of those of the Wii Edition cutscenes as they feature some rather simple character models that starkly contrast with the high-quality new models, but they do not detract much from immersion, being often very filtered.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/20260203180008_1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The visual improvements of Fatal Frame 2 Crimson Buttefly Remake over the previous versions of the game are considerable</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Focused on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">offering players a chance to experience <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly</em> for the first time</strong>, it's not surprising to see how <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">traditional gameplay feels</strong>. Besides featuring the aforementioned <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">documents and journals</strong> scattered around providing additional details on the world and lore, the remake of the second entry in the series features <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">every staple of the survival horror genre</strong> since its establishment: <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">moderately intricate level design</strong> with multiple paths, locked doors requiring keys, and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">limited resources</strong> upon which the survival aspect is based, and <strong>a stalker enemy</strong> that cannot be defeated. The first few chapters of the game are not <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">very challenging</strong> at Normal difficulty, so those who have never played an entry in the series before will have <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">enough time</strong> to adjust to some of the quirks of the experience</p>



<p>The one element that <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">distinguishes</strong> the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fatal Frame</em> series from every other survival-horror series is the aforementioned <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Camera Obscura</strong> camera, which remains a core element in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake</em>. With this mysterious camera, Mio can fight hostile ghosts and be guided to the next story objective by more friendly ones.</p>



<p>The game's entire <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">combat system</strong> is centered on the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Camera Obscura</strong>, requiring players to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">take the best pictures of ghosts</strong> to defeat them. <span data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">With&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">different film types</strong>&nbsp;coming with different attack power and reload speed,&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">special shots</strong>&nbsp;are possible with any of the four available filters (which must often be used to progress in the story as well) that can blind or slow ghosts, and mechanics that the game's combat system can get rather&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">tactical</strong>.</span> However, t<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">he in-game tutorials don't offer anything beyond a rough explanation of the combat mechanics</strong>, which can lead to frustration. </p>



<p>Thankfully, the remake features a proper <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">dodge maneuver</strong> whose addition is quite welcome, as the game wants the player to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">take pictures of ghosts as they are about to attack</strong> for maximum efficacy, thus alleviating some of the combat frustrations. An <strong>upgrade system</strong> for the Camera Obscura and its filters can also make a huge difference, so, at the very least,<strong> the remake offers tools</strong> to make combat slightly faster and less frustrating. Those looking to enjoy the game's story with minimal challenge can play it on<strong> Easy mode</strong>, which I expect will be popular among newcomers to the series.</p>

<p>Although I am not too fond of the game's combat, <em>Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake</em> delivers an <strong>immediately engaging survival-horror experience</strong>. As such, I am really looking forward to continuing the game and <strong>deciding the fate of Mio and Mayu</strong> when the game launches on <strong>March 12</strong> on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

The math doesn’t quite match up exactly because of those additive pieces, like a storage box and promo cord, but it’s something to consider if you wanted a series of packs without wanting to splash out on a box of 30 of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Do the preorder discounts suggest we should be worried about the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles set?

What a terrible day to be a God of War-like! You put on your fanciest bird suit for your big reveal, then a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/god-of-war-goes-2d-with-pixelated-sons-of-sparta-which-is-out-right-now-as-original-ps2-trilogy-eyes-up-the-remake-treatment">whole bunch of actual God of Wars come along</a> and steal your thunder. But that's not to say Krafton's new open-world PlayStation 5 game Project Windless isn't intriguing.
</p>
<p>
Project Windless is, for starters, based on an acclaimed series of South Korean high fantasy novels known as Bird That Drinks Tears. Four books have been released so far, all set in a world inhabited by four main races: the boring old humans, the reptilian Nhaga, the Tokkebi, and the bird-like Rekon. That's how we get Project Windless' perhaps somewhat unlikely looking protagonist.

<p>
As <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2026/02/12/announcing-open-world-action-rpg-project-windless-for-ps5/">per the PlayStation Blog</a>, Project Windless (which is being led by Patrik Méthé, veteran director on Ubisoft's Far Cry series) takes place over a thousand years before the events of the books, and focuses its attention on the Rekon. We haven't been given the name of its musclebound bird protagonist yet, but Krafton says the Rekon's "speed, reach, and physical presence" were the perfect fit for the "one-versus-many combat fantasy" at the Windless' core.
</p><p>
Elsewhere, its open world is designed with "as little hand-holding as possible" in order to stoke curiosity, and to encourage players "to take risks, to forge alliances, to wage war, and ultimately to decide what kind of legend [they] want to become." As for combat, there are echoes of Dynasty Warriors, as players are battle "dozens (sometimes hundreds) of enemies at once."
</p>
<p>
And that's pretty much all we know so far. Project Windless is currently in development for PlayStation 5 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> (no other platforms are confirmed) and doesn't have even a whiff of a release date.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>I saw one of the wildest things I've ever seen on Linkedin earlier today--and that's saying something--when I saw people posting in earnest about a story called "<a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/jynxzi-slams-supercell-after-clash-royale-historic-year-recap-omits-his-impact-3317074/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Jynxzi slams Supercell over 'spit in the face' Clash Royale statement</u></a>".</p><p>"This can't be a real news item", I thought, before checking all those words were actually in order and meant something. But hey, it turns out this was definitely a thing, and it was a thing so degrading to the medium of video games and the people who cover it that it caused me spiritual damage, to the extent that if I had to see it, now you <em>all </em>have to see it.</p><p>The basic summary of events is: Supercell, the developers of mobile juggernaut <em>Clash Royale</em>,<a href="https://supercell.com/en/news/the-best-games-havent-been-made-yet/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>released their annual roundup of how the game's been going the other day</u></a>, and in doing so thanked, you know, the people who made and are working on the game.</p><p>This led to<a href="https://x.com/jynxzi/status/2021283304649970153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2021283304649970153%7Ctwgr%5E5a9dca7924b2f83ec5e4ad756131d4465ab082f6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dexerto.com%2Fgaming%2Fjynxzi-slams-supercell-after-clash-royale-historic-year-recap-omits-his-impact-3317074%2F&amp;ref=aftermath.site"> <u>a tweet by streamer and YouTuber Jynxi</u></a>, in which he quoted a section of the roundup with the words "Probably the biggest spit in the face i've ever seen", suggesting that he, a content creator streaming video games for money, should have also been thanked by Supercell for contributing to that success, because by streaming the game he had led to an increase in the playerbase.</p><p>He later went on Twitch and said “Don’t you dare take credit for 2025 being the best year that that game’s had since 2016, let’s not do that, because now you’re fucking rage-baiting.”</p><p>As <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/jynxzi-slams-supercell-after-clash-royale-historic-year-recap-omits-his-impact-3317074/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Dexerto</u></a> report, this was not an isolated sentiment! Mr. Beast himself replied to Jynxi’s tweet, saying many people had "only started playing again because of you",<a href="https://x.com/thesketchreal/status/2021304917747470678?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2021304917747470678%7Ctwgr%5E5a9dca7924b2f83ec5e4ad756131d4465ab082f6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dexerto.com%2Fgaming%2Fjynxzi-slams-supercell-after-clash-royale-historic-year-recap-omits-his-impact-3317074%2F&amp;ref=aftermath.site"> <u>while other big streamers and content creators agreed</u></a>.</p><p>The fact these creators, who exist in an economy of their own, where they're paid via ads and deals and subs in their own space, feel so entitled to official thanks from the makers of the actual video games they're playing seemed absolutely absurd to me, a strain of entitlement so virulent it crosses over into delusion. Like yeah, content creators can affect sales, we’ve known that since the dawn of streaming, but streamers have their own rewards and spaces for achievement, just like we do as media. Your audience is your business; nobody should be expecting pats on the head from developers just because you happened to play their game and not someone else’s.&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine my horror, then, when not long after reading that news I saw the headline "<a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/supercell-ceo-sorry-for-failure-to-acknowledge-role-of-content-creators-in-clash-royales-success/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Supercell CEO sorry for failure to acknowledge role of content creators in Clash Royale's success</u></a>", in which <em>the CEO of Supercell </em>Ilkka Paananen<em> </em>says:</p><blockquote>I failed to acknowledge the role that creators, pro players, and the broader community played in Clash Royale's resurgence. That was my mistake — no one else's — and it runs counter to everything I believe about the impact creators have on our games and our business. I am sorry.</blockquote><blockquote>The intent was never to diminish anyone's contribution, but intent doesn't matter when the impact is real. I understand why it hurts, and that's on me.</blockquote><p>I don't know Paananen, but man, if I had woken up one day and felt compelled to write a grovelling apology to a streamer because I didn't show them enough deference in my company's reports to thank them for helping boost income from my cash-grab mobile game that's<a href="https://www.gameswirtschaft.de/politik/verbraucherzentrale-klage-roblox-fortnite-060625/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>built on a succession of 'dark pattern' design elements</u></a>, I would maybe look in the mirror and wonder what it was, exactly, I was doing with my life.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Housemarque’s bullet hell roguelite successor <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/saros">Saros</a> is set to launch on 30th April, and with such little time before release, they’ve shared a look at the overarching progression and structure of the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Saros - Gameplay Overview Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OcLGdMG0L8Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The core of the game will be familiar to anyone that played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/returnal">Returnal</a>, and there’s common ground to a lot of other roguelites in structure. You’ll play, you’ll die, you’ll upgrade and you’ll try again.</p>
<p>Between runs, Arjun Devraj (Rahul Kohli) is returned to the Passage, a Carcosan temple that is a hub to the game. Here you can talk to other crewmembers of the ship, as well as make use of the upgrade portal. Here you can increase armour, generate a material more quickly, upgrade power capacity for the shield and even the Second Chance system.</p>
<p>There’s also the Carcosan Modifiers, letting you tweak parts of the games difficulty, but for every boon, you’ll have to forego something in return to keep th world in balance. Protection Modifiers can make weapon reloads faster, boost the shield and more, but they’re balanced out by Trial Modifiers making enemies more aggressive, adding weapon power degradation and more. You choose the balance.</p>

<p>A great feature for day one is the inclusion of fast travel, so that you can immediately start a run at the last biome you reached. On death your main and power weapon are kept, so you can return right to the fight and try again, effectively. It’s great to see this will be there on day one, and not arrive in a patch months later.</p>
<p>Finally there’ the eclipse. You can trigger this by reaching a gnarly hand thing, causing the sun to be blocked out, but this sets the world ablaze, introducing corrupted enemies, changing the environments and more. The sound of the world is also twisted, with Sam Slater’s soundtrack gaining more distortion and layering.</p>

		<p>The platforming icon Rayman is marking his thirtieth birthday (last year) with Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition, launching… well, today, at the time of writing. 13th February.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rayman: 30th Anniversary Edition – Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6si6GIKIg24?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Developed by Digital Eclipse, this is a love letter to the arm-less helicoptering wonder and his debut game. There’s actually five versions of this game included in the bundle – PlayStation, Atari Jaguar, MS-DOS, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance – &nbsp;all of which have been reformatted for modern consoles and screens. There’s also 120 additional levels from the Rayman’s New Levels pack, Rayman 60 Levels and Rayman by His Fans, and you can step back even further with early prototypes of the game that have been spruced up to be playable.</p>
<p>Throughout, the originals have been enhanced in the way many remakes and remasters are with a reimagined soundtrack by composer&nbsp;Christophe Héral alongside optional gameplay features, like a 60 second rewind, instant level unlocks and infinite lives.</p>
<p>And then there’s the documentary features that include 50 minutes of interviews with the original Ubisoft Montpellier team, concept art, sketches, design documents and more.</p>

<p>Rayman 30th Anniversary Edition is out 13th February digitally, across PS5, Xbox Series X|S, NIntendo Switch and PC, with a physical edition coming to certain regions in June.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <div data-block="true" data-editor="1jih2" data-offset-key="2kn0p-0-0"> <p data-offset-key="2kn0p-0-0">Josh Sobel, who was formerly a tech artist and rigger on live-service shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-the-kotaku-review-is-it-good-free-ps5-pc-5v5-3v3-update-patch-2000664646"><em>Highguard</em></a>, posted a lengthy, eye-opening blog about his time working on the free-to-play FPS that has struggled since launching last month on consoles and PC. &nbsp;Sobel also talks about the response it got after its reveal and the harassment he suffered.</p> <p data-offset-key="2kn0p-0-0">On February 12 Sobel, a former Wildlight Entertainment developer who worked on <em>Highguard</em> for two and a half years, <a href="https://x.com/Joshiepoo25/status/2022003361059631301">shared a post</a> on Twitter containing thoughts he says he has been wanting to share “for a while.” In the post, titled “Reflecting On Shipping My First Game,” Sobel reveals that the day leading up to <em>Highguard</em>‘s big reveal at the 2025 Game Awards was “amongst the most exciting” in his life. “The future seemed bright,” added the developer. However,<a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-trailers-recap-highguard-titanfall-apex-2000653088"> shortly after its reveal in December, it became clear that wasn’t the case.</a></p> <p data-offset-key="2kn0p-0-0">“Then the trailer came out, and it was all downhill from there,” said Sobel.</p>  </div> <div data-block="true" data-editor="1jih2" data-offset-key="ehlt0-0-0"> <p data-offset-key="ehlt0-0-0"><span data-offset-key="ehlt0-0-0">“The hate started immediately. In addition to dogpiling on the trailer, I personally came under fire due to my naïveté on Twitter, which almost all of my now-former coworkers had learned to avoid during their previous game launches. After setting my Twitter account to private to protect my sanity, many content creators made videos and posts about me and my cowardice, amassing millions of views and inadvertently sending hundreds of angry gamers into my replies. They laughed at me for being proud of the game, told me to get out the McDonald’s applications, and mocked me for listing having autism in my bio, which they seemed to think was evidence the game would be ‘woke trash.’ All of this was very emotionally taxing.”</span></p> <p data-offset-key="ehlt0-0-0">Sobel admits that there is plenty of “constructive criticism” about how the game was marketed, but said he didn’t feel like it was his place to comment on that and stated that there is no way to know if the launch would have been better or worse without the Game Awards reveal. Regardless, after the trailer landed, Sobel says the game “turned into a joke from minute one” and blames “false assumptions” about how much the trailer’s spot cost the studio. It was later revealed that Wildlight didn’t pay anything; Game Awards founder Geoff Keighley just liked the game enough to include it.</p> <p data-offset-key="ehlt0-0-0">“Within minutes, it was decided: this game was dead on arrival, and creators now had free ragebait content for a month. Every one of our videos on social media got downvoted to hell. Comments sections were flooded with copy/paste meme phrases such as ‘<a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566">Concord 2</a>‘ and ‘Titanfall 3 died for this.’ At launch, we received over 14k review bombs from users with less than an hour of playtime. Many didn’t even finish the required tutorial.”</p> <p data-offset-key="ehlt0-0-0">The former <em>Highguard</em> dev didn’t entirely blame gamers for the shooter’s failure, but did suggest that <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-layoffs-dead-game-awards-live-service-2000668192">gamers have a “lot” of power over what games succeed and fail.</a></p> <p data-offset-key="ehlt0-0-0">“<span>I’m not saying our failure is purely the fault of gamer culture and that the game would have thrived without the negative discourse, but it absolutely played a role. All products are at the whims of the consumers, and the consumers put absurd amounts of effort into slandering <em>Highguard</em>. And it worked.” <a href="https://kotaku.com/highguard-studio-developer-layoffs-wildlight-entertainment-2000667841">Wildlight recently announced massive layoffs</a>.</span></p> </div> <p data-offset-key="8dhmm-0-0"><span data-offset-key="8dhmm-0-0">“Many of Wildlight’s former devs will now be forced to assimilate back into the actual corporate industry many gamers accused Wildlight of being a part of. Now, every time someone thinks about leaving the golden handcuffs behind in favor of making a new multiplayer game the indie way, they’ll say, ‘But remember how gamers didn’t even give Wildlight a chance.’ Soon, if this pattern continues, all that will be left are corporations, at least in the multiplayer space. Innovation is on life support.”</span></p> <p data-offset-key="8dhmm-0-0">Sobel wrapped up his post by wishing the remaining devs at the <span>studio</span> good luck on <em>Highguard</em>, and saying he believes it can still succeed. He also made it clear that he doesn’t believe the game deserved what it got.</p> <p data-offset-key="9e81n-0-0"><span data-offset-key="9e81n-0-0">“Even if <em>Highguard</em> had a rocky launch, our independent, self-published, dev-led studio full of passionate people just trying to make a fun game, with zero AI, and zero corporate oversight, deserved better than this,” said Sobel. “We deserved the bare minimum of not having our downfall be gleefully manifested.”</span></p>

              <p><em>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</em>&nbsp;finally has a release date, two <em>uncanny</em> new characters, and so much more. Coming August 6th to PlayStation and PC, <em>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</em> is the next Marvel fighting game in the grand tradition of the <em>Marvel vs. Capcom</em> series, <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-vs-capcom-state-of-play-ps5-1851783734">just without the Capcom this time</a>. Developed by <em>Guilty Gear</em> studio Arc Systems Works, <em>Fighting Souls</em> is also the latest in a firehose of Marvel games that’s been spraying almost non-stop since Insomniac released its first <em>Spider-Man</em> game back in 2018.</p>  <p>During tonight’s big State of Play, we got a brief introduction to the game’s story and the new characters joining the roster. Joining Marvel’s usual fighting game suspects such as Spider-Man and Captain America are the “Unbreakable X-Men<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->a new team of X-Men that debuted in Marvel Comics last year. Led by Storm, the team features Storm’s fellow Marvel fighting game staple Wolverine, Magick the sword-wielding metal-head viking, and Danger, the physical manifestation of the program the X-Men use to run their deadly training facility. Comics are silly, y’all. In addition to these four new characters, <em>Fighting Souls</em> will feature a story mode that features motion comics that blend Japanese and American comic styles.</p>

 <p>Over the last decade, the House of Marvel has been on a tear with great games. There’s of course Insomniac’s<em> Spider-Man</em> series, the criminally underrated <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>, the other criminally underrated Marvel game,<em> Midnight Suns</em>, and <em>Marvel Snap</em>. Lately the focus has been on multiplayer games and that, too, has gone well with the massive success of <em>Marvel Rivals</em>.<em> Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</em> looks it’ll be another addition to this renaissance of Marvel-flavored video games when it launches August 6th.</p>

<p>Calling all PlayStation Spartans in training, there’s a hydra-sized God of War Sons of Sparta Trophy List for you to climb, making the arduous trek to Olympus seem like child’s play.</p>



<p>A Metroidvania <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/god-of-war/" id="106" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">God of War</a> title was a constant discussion in the rumor pipeline for a long time. The speculation suggested a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumoured-god-of-war-metroidvania-game-will-feature-kratos-brother-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumoured God of War Metroidvania game would feature Kratos’ Brother</a>, and it does. </p>



<p>Now that Sons of Sparta is here, there’s no mystery left, other than its Trophy List. A mystery solved in this guide right now.</p>

<p>His wife, Amelia Rose Blaire, is also featured in the game. She will be voicing Eleonora.</p>
