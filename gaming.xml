            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/10/phasmophobia-2025-roadmap-features-chronicle-update-new-maps-sound-recorder-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s a packed year of updates and new content coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> with its 2025 roadmap, starting with the Chronicle update, and extending to new maps, various map, character and event reworks, and more.</p>
<p>Alongside the roadmap reveal, Kinetic Games also announced that the game has passed 2 million sales on consoles, and over 22 million sales across all platforms. That’s great going!</p>



<p>The first major update of the year will be Chronicle, which was previewed at the end of 2024. This update will overhaul how evidence is collected, with a new Media tab that will gather together all the photos and videos you’ve collected, as well as audio recordings from the new Sound Recorder tool.</p>
<p>The second update in 2025 will the bring a player character overhaul, refreshing the character models, improving the animations, but stopping short of full player customisation, which will now come in 2026. That will allow the team to focus on the Horror 2.0 update that is also expected in 2026.</p>

<p>But there’s plenty more for 2025 still. A brand new map will be added, and there will be updated version of Bleasdale Farmhouse (arriving in March), Grafton Farmhouse and 6 Tanglewood Drive. The first of which, Bleasdale, will be releasing in March. each will have a complete artistic overhaul, new assets, new animations and a few layout changes to refresh how hunts progress.</p>
<p>Seasonal Events are also getting a bit of an overhaul for 2025, taking the first iteration of these from 2024 and adapting them to player feedback. There will be events for Easter, Halloween and Winter. While the actual event modifiers and goals will be similar, there will be personal rewards, wider map rotations, and more.</p>
<p>We had a great time <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/28/phasmophobia-early-access-console-review-ps5-xbox-series-x/">exploring Phasmophobia for its console launch</a>, saying, “There’s a bunch of rough edges from adapting the controls to gamepad, and from that initial learning curve, but Phasmophobia is absolutely that kind of game – grab a few friends, go to a spooky house, and run around in the dark calling out to “Susan” or whatever their name was. You’ll have a hell of a time while you do.”</p>

Among this crew, Jill is the one who has experience fighting Nemesis in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-3-remake-review-farewell-raccoon-cit/1900-6417441/" data-ref-id="1900-6417441">Resident Evil 3</a> and Wesker in some of the other games. But even with backup, Jill and the others are significantly outmatched by this duo.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dead by Daylight | 2v8: Resident Evil Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The Dead by Daylight collaborations take place outside of Resident Evil continuity, so the game doesn't have to explain how any of this fits into RE's storylines. But the 2v8 mode does feature a map from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/resident-evil-2-review-re-vived-nightmares/1900-6417071/" data-ref-id="1900-6417071">Resident Evil 2</a> and Resident Evil 3 that recreates Raccoon City's Police Department. Additionally, Resident Evil's green and yellow herbs can be found and used for healing by the heroes. But if either Wesker or Nemesis find the herbs first, they can destroy them and get a boost of speed.</p><p>Behaviour Interactive has previously stated that there will be two survivor bots on every team in this 2v8 mode in order to reduce the killer queue time. The current Dead by Daylight x Resident Evil collaboration is only running through February 25. But we know of at least one big crossover coming down the line this summer: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dead-by-daylight-and-five-nights-at-freddys-are-finally-crossing-over/1100-6525552/" data-ref-id="1100-6525552">Dead by Daylight x Five Nights At Freddy's</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Kendrick Lamar's Super Bowl LIX performance has generated a lot of online chatter, and surprisingly, not all of it has to do with Drake. When the Grammy-winning rapper took the stage for the halftime show, the stage itself took the form of a tic-tac-toe board--but X's and O's were accompanied by a triangle and a square, which were meant to evoke the aesthetic of a "PlayStation-style controller," according to the show's coordinators and set designers. The idea--which Lamar personally dreamed up--was meant to represent the rapper's life as though it were a video game.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think the [video game theme] was symbolic, his way to reach young people," art director Shelley Rodgers told <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/true-story-behind-kendrick-lamar-super-bowl-halftime-show/" rel="nofollow ">Wired</a>. "A lot of it is showing his journey, [showing him] traveling through the American dream."</p><p dir="ltr">Creative director Mike Carson added that Lamar and his production company, pgLang, are "really into keeping things clean and minimal."</p><p dir="ltr">"We went with a monochromatic concrete look and allowed the video game motif to come alive through dialogue, lighting, choreography, and music," Carson said.</p><p dir="ltr">But despite the stage's streamlined, minimalist design, the folks running the show had several difficult hurdles to overcome. Lamar, his backup dancers, the lighting, and the stage itself had to be set up and ready to go in under eight minutes. Once the performance ended, production had had roughly six minutes to get everything off the field--without messing up the turf. Even though the Superdome's turf is synthetic, protecting it was still no small task, especially given the fact that part of the set dressing was a real GNX that had been heavily modified to allow Lamar's numerous backup dancers to enter the stage in a clown car-esque manner.</p><p dir="ltr">"They were on board with our vision from day one," Carson said of Shelley Rodgers, who worked to bring the vehicular optical illusion to life. "Even with this being one of the largest halftime footprints ever, Shelley and team came with clever ideas and guidance to help us maintain the design integrity and get this beast across the finish line."</p><p dir="ltr">But every good game needs a villain, and the halftime show appeared to serve as the final act in Lamar's seemingly endless beef with fellow rapper Drake. At one point in the show, Lamar told his female backup dancers that he wanted to perform "Not Like Us," but had decided against it because "people like to sue." But near the end of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDorKy-13ak" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his 13-minute performance</a>, Lamar performed a lightly censored version of the incredibly popular diss track. The "life as a video game" theme also resurfaced at the end of the show, with Lamar yelling "Game Over!" as the same words appeared in lights across the stadium.</p><p>Drake has yet to make a statement about the halftime performance. Lamar's rival was <a href="https://athlonsports.com/entertainment/drake-kendrick-lamar-reaction-halftime-show-super-bowl-beef" rel="nofollow ">reportedly out of the country</a> during the Super Bowl.</p>

			<p>Last Friday saw the release of the newest dungeon in Destiny 2, titled Sundered Doctrine. In this dungeon, Savathûn guides the Guardians through a Pyramid ship filled with Dread. Alongside the release of this dungeon, an official Dungeon Race will take place, where fireteams will be competing against each other to complete the activity with Contest Mode enabled. The first verified team that finishes the dungeon will receive a customized trophy. Those who complete Contest Mode within the first 48 hours will receive a special emblem and Exotic Weapon. Once the Contest Mode has been completed by a fireteam, Normal Mode will then unlock.</p>
<p>This content launched alongside Heresy, the new episodic content in Destiny 2 which followed on from<a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2s-revenant-act-1-comes-up-short-for-players/"> Revenant</a> and Echoes.</p>
<p>For those who want to see the teams that competed, you can watch it on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/evanf1997" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@cbgray" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a> or <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cbgrayYT" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tiktok</a>.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>For anyone who completes the dungeon by 9:59 AM PDT / 12:59 PM EDT / 6:59 PM BST will earn the <a href="https://bungiestore.com/rewards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bungie Rewards</a> offer that will allow you to purchase the Sundered Doctrine assortment, which includes a work shirt, dungeon bracelet, and pin. Additionally, those who complete the Delver Title by 9:59 AM PDT / 12:59 PM EDT / 6:59 PM BST will earn the Bungie Rewards offer to purchase the Sundered Doctrine Title Pin. Above is a picture of some of the gear that you can purchase should you complete the dungeon in the required timeframe.</p>
<p>Along with the Sundered Doctrine dungeon being launched in Destiny 2, Destiny 2: Heresy launched, which takes Guardians back to Oryx's flagship named the Dreadnaught. Along with this comes new weapons, gear, and subclass Aspects. There will also be new artifact mods to collect and help you become more powerful in-game.</p>
<p>For those who like group content, The Nether debuts as a three-player activity that you can participate in, where players are able to harness the power of the Taken and utilize it to disrupt Anchors and stop the Taken invasion.

<p>The Nether event will also feature randomized encounters to keep the content fresh, as well as unique challenges to undertake and opportunities to make your build even stronger by harnessing the strength of powerful boons.</p>

            <p>
Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick has hailed PC gaming's "increasing share of the market", in what you could optimistically interpret as the prelude to a GTA 6 PC release date announcement, and less optimistically, as a simple reassurance to investors who are fretting about the decline of console game sales.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> is slated to release on Xbox and PlayStation in fall 2025. As per Rockstar Games tradition, the PC release remains TBA. For context, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> released on PC around 18 months after hitting Xbox 360 and PS3, while GTA 4 took an extra eight months or so, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> a year. 
</p>
<p>
This strategy of releasing PC versions late persists despite Zelnick's comment in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025">Ian Games</a> that the PC version of a multiplatform game can account for over 40% of overall sales. "We have seen PC become a much more and more important part of what used to be a console business, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that trend continue," he told the site. "Of course, there will be a new console generation." 
</p>
<p>
Here is some slapdash background on the console biz, which is undergoing something of an evolutionary slow period. Only Nintendo - who basically operate their own games industry nested matryoshka doll-style inside the regular games industry - have announced their next big piece of hardware. We've yet to hear about PS6 and whatever Microsoft call the Nextbox, so there's a bit of a gap on the industry earnings forecast. In the meantime, the existing consoles are slowly petrifying like forgotten dragons, shipping fewer and fewer copies between them.
</p><p>
Zelnick reckons the release of GTA 6 might help with flagging console sales, even in a year when the US presidency is <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/esa-warns-of-negative-impact-to-come-with-trump-s-video-game-tariffs">picking lots of fights with trading partners</a>. And if it doesn't, hey, there's always the apparently thriving PC market.
</p>
<p>
"When you have a big title in the market and we have many of them coming, historically that has sold consoles," he told IGN. "And I think that will happen this year. I don't think tariffs are going to be our friend, but I think there will be a meaningful uptick in console sales in calendar 25 because of the release schedule, not just coming from us, but coming from others. So I'm not concerned about that [console sales falling]. I think the trend that you'd want to focus on is this increasing share of the market that is reflected in PC."
</p>
<p>OK, so, once more with feeling: GTA 6 PC release date when? Being a bear of little brain, I can't really explain Rockstar's tendency to show up late on PC, but I imagine it's not a resource question, given that Rockstar have thousands of developers and still earn megabucks from GTA 5 re-releases and GTA Online. The explanation that makes most sense to me is simply that shipping on PC "late" is an excuse to double-dip - max out the console sales initially, then polish up the tech for re-release on more capable PCs and, presumably, the next generation of consoles.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Some of the biggest games of 2025 are out this month, as well as some of the longest, with February bookended by massive RPGs that many players may spend all year slowly chipping away at. </p><p>Fans of open-world games are getting a slight reprieve.<em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>was originally also going to drop this month but was pushed to March at the last minute. That will free players up to take on sprawling adventures like <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>, <em>Avowed</em>, and <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> instead. But there are a lot of cool-looking smaller games to checkout this month as well, at least a few of which could become sleeper GOTY contenders in their own right. Here are all the major game releases in February 2025:<br></p></div></div><div><p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em> is one of those sequels that takes the first game and tries to make it bigger, more detailed, and more immersive in every way. Based on early reviews, it basically accomplishes that. The medieval RPG sim is bursting with detailed side quests and gameplay friction that makes merely surviving a challenge. It’s been topping the Steam charts this month, even if its grueling realism won’t be everyone’s cup of tea. </p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Warhorse Studios</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Deep Silver</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p></div><div><p>The Nintendo Switch exclusive is now on PC. Where <em>Crypt of the NecroDancer</em> was a rhythm-based dungeon crawler,<em> Rift </em>is a more familiar <em>Guitar Hero</em>-style puzzle adventure. It takes the enemy pattern recognition of the previous game and applies the escalating anxiety of combat that doesn’t end until the song’s over. It’s really great. </p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Brace Yourself Games, Tic Toc Games</p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>Klei Publishing</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Switch, PC</p></div><div><p><em>Momodora: Moonlit Farewell</em> is the latest entry in the <em>Momodora</em> series. Released on PC last year, the 2D, magic-infused anime Metroidvania is now on consoles as well. In a crowded genre, it manages to stand out thanks to beautiful art and fun exploration. </p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Bombservice</p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>Playism </p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p><em>Civilization VII</em> is the first new 4X game in the franchise in roughly a decade, and looks to streamline some of the strategy series’ gameplay while also making important changes like altering how historical eras work and adding new crisis events that can upend how things progress. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/civ-7-civilization-6-steam-reviews-ui-early-access-1851757977&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/civ-7-civilization-6-steam-reviews-ui-early-access-1851757977">Early players have hammered it</a></span> for its UI and other elements feeling “unfinished,” but it has a strong foundation to build on. </p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Firaxis Games</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> 2K</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p><em>Urban Myth Dissolution Center </em>is a visual novel in which you investigate cursed relics and paranormal anomalies against the backdrop of creepy, lo-fi cutscenes. As Azami Fukurai, you take on the role of detective, working for a <em>Ghostbusters</em>-like organization where you scrape social media to unravel urban legends. I hope it’s basically <em>X-Files</em> with cool psychedelic pixel art.</p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Hakababunko</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Shueisha Games</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p>Slimes are usually introduced early on in RPGs as the easiest enemies to kill. In <em>Slime Heroes</em>, however, you actually play as one. It’s a souls-like action-RPG platformer in which you collect gems to unlock new abilities and enact your revenge on a colorful, uncaring world. There’s also local and online co-op. Slime buddies unite!</p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Pancake Games</p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>Whitehorn Games</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>Xbox Series X/S, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p><em>The Legend of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II</em> is the latest turn-based RPG in the sprawling <em>Trails</em> series. It takes place directly after the events of the first game, and includes cameos from veteran characters that will be harder to appreciate unless you’re up to speed on the previous entries. But if you’re looking for a long, intricate JRPG, this one’s for you. </p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Nihon Falcom</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> NIS America </p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p>The second batch of remastered classic <em>Tomb Raider</em> games has arrived. <em>Tomb Raider IV–VI Remastered</em> charts the action-adventure series’ shift from PS1 to PS2 and will include some of the bumpier games in the series history. Hopefully, the remastered elements make them easier to appreciate in a new light. </p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Aspyr, Crystal Dynamics</p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>Aspyr</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p>It’s been a while since we had a big, meaty first-person fantasy RPG. <em>Avowed,</em> from the studio behind <em>Fallout: New Vegas </em>and <em>The Outer Worlds</em>, will combine <em>Skyrim</em>-like gameplay with the world and lore of <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>, with a heavy emphasis on side quests and negotiating between various factions. It’ll be on Game Pass day one for PC and Ultimate subscribers. </p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Obsidian Entertainment </p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Xbox Game Studios</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> Xbox Series X/S, PC</p></div><div><p>Four friends reunite later in life to retrace their memories of a pivotal summer long ago. <em>Lost Records</em> seems like <em>It</em> for ‘90s kids, leaning more into tech-fueled alienation than occult horror. It’ll be out in two parts with the first one coming this month. I don’t normally mesh well with narrative-driven adventure games but this one has me more intrigued than most. </p><p><strong>Developer:</strong> Dontnod </p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>Dontnod</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p></div><div><p>  “War is over. War is just beginning.” That’s the slogan of <em>Stories from Sol: The Gun-Dog</em>, a retro sci-fi love letter to ‘80s anime where you manage a patrol ship on the edge of space investigating a strange new anomaly. It’s narrative-focused, so be ready for lots of reading, but the pixel-art animations of everything from ship console controls to mechs fighting in space look incredible. </p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Space Colony Studios</p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>Astrolabe Games, Meridiem Games</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, PS4, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p>When it comes to <em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em>, you either know or you don’t. If you don’t, all that matters is it’s a real-time action spin-off taking place after the events of <em>Infinite Wealth</em>. It follows beloved side-character Goro Majima as he sails around to various islands taking on the local criminal underworld. </p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio</p><p><strong>Publisher:</strong> Sega</p><p><strong>Platforms: </strong>PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC</p></div><div><p>The once-forgotten Game Boy Advance exclusive is finally back. Action platformer <em>Ninja Five-O</em> was one of the Nintendo handheld’s most underrated games. Now players can once again step into the shoes of ninja Joe Osugi as he takes down a group of mystical terrorists in retro side-scrolling levels. </p><p><strong>Developer: </strong>Limited Run Games</p><p><strong>Publisher: </strong>Konami</p><p><strong>Platforms:</strong> PS5, PS4, Switch, PC</p></div><div><p>With an emphasis on wild movement, <em>The Local </em>is a first-person open-world shoot-em-up that looks super rad. All your favorite movement types are here including rail grinding,  sliding, wall running, climbing, air strafing, and bunny hopping.

But sandwiched between the game’s four quarters was a spectacular performance by rapper Kendrick Lamar. Lamar’s performance transcended sports circles and was the talk of the internet last night. For most, it was a final nail in the coffin of the rapper’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kendrick-drake-beef-rap-battle-memes-internet-reactions-1851458972&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kendrick-drake-beef-rap-battle-memes-internet-reactions-1851458972">highly-publicized beef with Canadian rapper Drake</a></span>, but it also had a lot of commentary on the state of America, with President Donald Trump in the audience.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Let’s get the collective cultural catharsis out of the way first. The viral moment of the show was Lamar performing his now five-time Grammy-winning song “Not Like Us.” The song is one of many Lamar released during a public feud with Drake back in 2024, and has become a cultural phenomenon. With over a billion streams and multiple clips of entire crowds performing it (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HtmXTNn2Rw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HtmXTNn2Rw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">including the Grammy’s audience</a></span>), millions of people are celebrating a song that accuses Drake of being a culture vulture pedophile in reference to years of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.stylist.co.uk/people/millie-bobby-brown-drake-texting-relationship-friendship-stranger-things-grooming-twitter-controversy-paedophile-metoo-backlash-celebrity-news/228170&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.stylist.co.uk/people/millie-bobby-brown-drake-texting-relationship-friendship-stranger-things-grooming-twitter-controversy-paedophile-metoo-backlash-celebrity-news/228170" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">allegations of grooming young women</a></span> in the entertainment industry. The song is a scathing diss on its own, but when it goes on to become a record-breaking, award-winning hit, that’s when you know you’ve lost the rap battle.</p><p>Lamar’s performance of “Not Like Us” was a big moment for the show in a few ways. At the midpoint of the show, Lamar had a brief intermission with some of the show’s dancers, during which he said he wanted to “perform their favorite song, but you know they love to sue,” while the instrumental “No Like Us” briefly played. This was seemingly a reference to Drake’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/drake-UMG-defamation-complaint.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/drake-UMG-defamation-complaint.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multiple lawsuits regarding the song</a></span>, and at first, it seemed to imply that Lamar was barred from playing it at the show. He then transitioned into a medley of “Luther” and “All the Stars” featuring the immaculate R&amp;B singer SZA, my queen, and it seemed like that was it. Lamar would omit his biggest hit seemingly to avoid further controversy…until about three minutes later, when he went to chat with his dancers one more time, said this was “bigger than the music,” and that someone “tried to rig the game, but you can’t fake influence.” Again, this was seemingly about Drake’s lawsuit trying to muzzle the song’s cultural impact.</p><p>Then he starts rapping and the crowd goes wild. In Super Bowl halftime shows, artists have to trim down their songs to maybe a minute or two, and the section of “Not Like Us” Lamar chose to perform is the most explicitly aimed at Drake, even calling him out by name. One popular meme is the point when Lamar looks into the camera with a devilish, shit-eating grin and says, “Hey Drake, I hear you like ‘em young.” The word “pedophile” was left out of the song, replaced by a wordless shout in the live show, but he still had the entire Caesars Superdome crowd singing along to, “Trying to strike a chord and it’s probably A Minor.” Fatality.</p><p>Lamar’s cocky strut while he smiles into the camera became an instant meme, but the entire show was a victory lap in a year-long campaign to bury Drake.</p><p>Hopefully not lost in the sauce is that this was also a commentary on the state of the United States and its attempts to silence Black voices. Samuel L. Jackson made multiple appearances during the show as the U.S. propaganda character Uncle Sam. He starts off emphasizing that the Super Bowl is “The Great American Game,” followed by Lamar rapping the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7liwdjvhWc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7liwdjvhWc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>GNX </em>teaser</a></span> that was released before his latest album, but has yet to be put on streaming services. However, he included a new lyric: “The revolution about to be televised. You picked the right time but the wrong guy.” This was seemingly a dig at fear-mongering President Donald Trump, who was in the audience but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/trump-super-bowl-chiefs-eagles-b2695214.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/trump-super-bowl-chiefs-eagles-b2695214.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">left during the second half</a></span>.</p><p>Uncle Sam returns after Lamar performs “Squabble Up,” one of his more rap-heavy tracks, and calls it “too loud, too reckless, too ghetto.” Then Lamar’s dancers, dressed in red, white and blue, arrange themselves to look like the American flag while he raps. Uncle Sam shows up a few more times to berate Lamar for not playing up what America believes the Super Bowl to be about. After the SZA medley, Sam appears one more time to say that “nice and calm” melodic songs are “what America wants.” He then proceeds to drag Drake across an entire football field. . As incredible as it was to see Drake get bodied on the biggest stage possible, this was a critique of the current state of America and the country’s history of policing Black art and voices. A lot of fans are hoping the overarching message of the show isn’t lost.</p><p>Lamar has had an incredible year and isn’t slowing down. Both he and SZA are preparing to embark on a co-headlining tour starting in April, and after seeing this show I might be about to buy tickets. Stream <em>GNX</em> and also SZA’s <em>Lana</em>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>New updates for Phasmophobia aren’t ending anytime soon as developer Kinetic Games has released its planned roadmap for 2025.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-2025-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s website</a>, Kinetic went into details on what Phasmophobia players can expect throughout the year. That includes two major updates, new maps and reworks, and seasonal events.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The first major update is called Chronicle. This update is a revamp to how evidence is recorded during your hunt such as replacing the Photos tab with a Media tab that captures photos, videos, and sound.</p>



<p>“Chronicle will also bring with it a few extra bits aside from what we’ve mentioned, but we’re keeping those a secret until we’re closer to launch,” they said while pointing to a <a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-dev-preview-18" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">prior development diary</a> with more information.</p>



<p>Regarding player characters, the studio is “refreshing character models, improving animations and adjusting the overall experience when it comes to your Phasmophobia character.” A planned full character customization feature is being pushed to 2026 to allow focus on the Horror 2.0 update. </p>



<h2 id="h-more-map-changes-are-coming">More Map Changes Are Coming</h2>



<p>Moving on to the map changes coming this year, Kinetic Games is reworking 6 Tanglewood Drive, Bleasdale Farmhouse and Grafton Farmhouse. Bleasdale will be released first in March with the other two reworks coming later this year.</p>



<p>“These reworks are all about bringing these maps in line with our full vision for them,” the developers said. “So you can expect to see complete artistic overhauls of each map, including new assets and animations, a high level of visual detail as well as a few layout changes. They’ll still be the maps you’ve grown to love through endless investigations, however.”</p>



<p>There will also be a new small map added to the game.  The studio says that all future maps will be “relatively small”  in order to push out new maps more frequently.</p>



<h2 id="h-beyond-2025">Beyond 2025</h2>



<p>Despite the latest updates being about 2025, Kinetic Games is also focused on the future of Phasmobia, including what’s to come in 2026. The studio is working on its major Horror 2.0 update for the year that includes more new maps and reworks. Details on all of that will come later on, though no timeframe was given.</p>



<p>What do you think of the 2025 roadmap for Phasmophobia? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation Might Be Cracking Down on ‘Shovelware’ Spam Games]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/shovelware-playstation-crack-down-spam/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-might-be-cracking-down-on-%E2%80%98shovelware%E2%80%99-spam-games.1105041/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/shovelware-playstation-crack-down-spam/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In recent months, digital storefronts across all gaming platforms have seemingly become inundated with AI-generated games, ‘shovelware’, and rip-off titles. Many games that make it to these storefronts are questionable at best, boasting copy-and-paste assets, paltry mechanics, and rinse-and-repeat content.</p>



<p>IGN carried out a recent investigation into the state of the quality assurance processes protecting these storefronts, focusing most specifically on PlayStation and Nintendo stores. It was noticed in the last couple of days that some of these ‘spam games’ have been silently stripped from the PS5 store.</p>



<p>Are we about to witness a mass exodus of shovelware games from our digital stores?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-churn-them-out">Churn Them Out</h2>



<p>PlayStation users were complaining about a shovelware epidemic on the platform’s digital storefronts <strong>years ago</strong>. It’s a problem that has been brewing for a while, but it peaked recently with an investigation that was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-could-make-fart-fart-boobie-fart-the-game-and-maybe-it-would-eventually-get-taken-down-devs-reveal-why-the-consoles-are-drowning-in-eslop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">carried out by IGN</a>. It seems that QA processes are slacking, encouraging ‘developers’ to push dozens of asset-flip, AI-generated games to storefronts.</p>



<p>PS4 and PS5 users have noticed the vast amounts of shovelware winding up in their search results – and some developers are standing out as the key culprits.</p>



<p>For instance, <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/publisher/RandomSpin-Games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">RandomSpin Games</a>, which releases multiple ‘games’ a month, all of which are low-effort, mostly pointless creations. <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/publisher/breakthrough-gaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Breakthrough Gaming</a> is another name. This developer was releasing two or three ‘RPG’ games a month at its peak. How about <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/publisher/zakym" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Zakym</a>, which in the last five or six weeks has released around a <strong>dozen games</strong> – you can likely imagine how bad they all are.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-quietly-removes-slop-shovelware-ps5-games-following-investigation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> noticed today that stacks of titles from RandomSpin Games, one of the biggest offenders on PlayStation, have been removed on the DL. It hasn’t been highlighted <strong>why </strong>they’ve been removed, but it <strong>could be </strong>a knock-on impact from IGN’s investigation, and PlayStation’s store operators are getting wiser about these deceptive practices.</p>



<p>Now, what will they do about the ‘scam’ copies that pop up, like the fake Black Myth game or the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-switch-clone/">rip-off version of The Last of Us</a> on Nintendo Switch? </p>



<p>Have you been troubled by shovelware on the PlayStation store? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>Valve has seemingly introduced new rules that ban games that require users to watch paid ads (or rely on other such ad-based revenue models) from Steam. However, some sources report that these rules may have already existed, and that Valve has merely created <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/marketing/advertising" rel="nofollow">a dedicated page</a> on Steamworks to clarify this policy.</p><p dir="ltr">The page explains that Steam does not contain paid advertising, and that advertising-based revenue models are not allowed on the platform. It further states that developers are also prohibited from using advertising as a way to provide value to players, such as giving players an in-game reward for watching or engaging with ads.</p><p dir="ltr">"Developers should not utilize paid advertising as a business model in their game, such as requiring players to watch or otherwise engage with advertising in order to play, or gating gameplay behind advertising," the rule reads in part. "If your game's business model relies on advertising on other platforms, you will need to remove those elements before shipping on Steam."</p><p dir="ltr">This apparent change in Valve policy was first reported by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/02/valve-ban-advertising-based-business-models-on-steam-no-forced-adverts-like-in-mobile-games/" rel="nofollow">GamingOnLinux</a>. However, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/steamdb.info/post/3lhsxkmaj7c2c" rel="nofollow">SteamDB</a> posted screencaps on BlueSky that seem to show that this policy has been in effect for at least five years on a different page, and that this new page is a dedicated space for it that states it in a different way. Regardless, Valve did recently introduce a significant change to its storefront: warnings that note if a game in Early Access <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1iibeow/steam_now_warns_about_early_access_that_have_not/" rel="nofollow">hasn't been updated</a> in more than a year. These alerts are ostensibly intended to inform users that the development timeline described on a game's page might not have come to fruition, or if the game has been outright abandoned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-roadmap-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Kinetic Games has shared the&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>roadmap for 2025, showing what you can expect from the multiplayer-focused ghost-hunting horror game throughout the rest of this year.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.kineticgames.co.uk/blog/phasmophobia-2025-roadmap" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its blog, Kinetic splits said&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>roadmap into three elements: major updates, maps and reworks, and seasonal events. In the first column, you can look forward to the Chronicle update first, which will revamp evidence recording and bring "a few extra bits". It has no release date yet, sadly.</p>

<p><em>Phasmophobia</em>'s second major update this year will bring a player character overhaul to give you more choices when it comes to your ghost hunter. You can expect refreshed models, improved animations, and more. Full customization, however, isn't coming until 2026.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-roadmap-2025-map-rework.jpg?itok=dPua6yHl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-roadmap-2025-map-rework.jpg?itok=NY4AhkQm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>will be getting reworks for maps this year, including Bleasdale Farmhouse.</figcaption></figure><p>In the maps and reworks column, a brand new map is coming this year. Kinetic is keeping its cards close to its chest, but the developer does say the map will be "small" and based in a "totally unique" location.</p>

<p>Reworks are also coming for several maps. You can expect redone versions of Bleasdale and Grafton Farmhouses, as well as 6 Tanglewood Drive.</p>

<p>The first rework for Bleasdale Farmhouse will arrive sometime in March, Kinetic says, and the latter two will be coming sometime later in the year. In 2026, more map reworks and new maps will be coming, although Kinetic doesn't share any details about those.</p>

<p>Finally, the new 2025&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>roadmap looks ahead to seasonal events, with the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-crimson-eye-update" rel="nofollow">Halloween</a> and winter events repeating "with the same themes" this year. A "new take" on the Easter event will also be coming in April.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/phasmophobia-roadmap-2025-tape-recorder.jpg?itok=Ax93tSOB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/phasmophobia-roadmap-2025-tape-recorder.jpg?itok=YrZjAmtf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's all go for&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>this year.</figcaption></figure><p>As pointed out by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/02/phasmophobia-2025-updates-roadmap-announced-sales-top-two-million-on-consoles" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>,&nbsp;<em>Phasmophobia&nbsp;</em>has now sold more than two million copies on console, too. That's not bad given it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/phasmophobia-console-sales" rel="nofollow">hit a million back in December</a>.</p>

    <p><span>Major reworks, new ghost-hunting tools, seasonal events, and more.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Kinetic Games [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/kinetic-games">Kinetic Games</a> has announced the 2025 roadmap for four-player <a title="Genres > Co-Op [230 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative</a> psychological <a title="Genres > Horror [553 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror game</a> <em><a title="Games > Phasmophobia [5 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a></em>, including major reworks, new ghost-hunting tools, seasonal events, and a new map. The Early Access version of the game has also sold over two million units across <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,803 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS VR2 [227 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps-vr2">PlayStation VR2</a>, and <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,671 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, 104 days after its console launch. <span id="more-942984"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the upcoming updates, via Kinetic Games:</p><blockquote><p><strong>First Major Update: “Chronicle”</strong></p><p>The first major update, “Chronicle,” will bring changes to the journal and rework the way in which Ghost Hunters can capture evidence. The Photos tab will be replaced with a Media tab featuring three new sections—Photos, Videos, and Sound Recordings—with any photographic, audio, or visual evidence logged in the corresponding pages. </p><p>The game’s media quality system is being replaced too, with a players’ first “capture” of any media type labelled as “Unique.” These will reward lots of cash and XP at the end of a contract, while “duplicates” will reward much less.</p><p>Chronicle will also introduce the Sound Recorder, a brand new piece of equipment designed to record unique paranormal sounds. Players brave enough to do so will be able to listen back to their recordings in the updated journal, letting them discover helpful clues that may previously have been drowned out by terrified screams.</p><!-- AD: content -->

Players will be able to explore a garden just outside the main living room, complete with ghost rooms, as well as revamped areas to explore. Grafton Farmhouse will also receive an update later this year.</p><p><strong>More to Come</strong></p><p>There’s even more to come, with a player character overhaul, new small map, and updates for the Easter, Halloween and Holiday seasons set to arrive in 2025. Plans for 2026 are already underway too, with house map reworks, even more new maps, and Horror 2.0 in the works.</p></blockquote><p>“We’re beyond excited for the new updates and reworks coming to <em>Phasmophobia</em> this year,” said Kinetic Games director and <em>Phasmophobia</em> lead developer Daniel Knight in a press release. “Our early access period so far has given us a fantastic opportunity to listen to our players, and the big changes we’re making are a direct reflection of the feedback we’re seeing. We’re really proud of the direction <em>Phasmophobia</em> is going in, thanks in no small part to our amazing community, and we can’t wait to see what everyone thinks of some of the surprises in store for 2025.”</p><p><em>Phasmophobia</em> is available now in Early Access for PlayStation 5, PlayStation VR2, Xbox Series, and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,305 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/739630/Phasmophobia/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

During the weekend, the game reached its current record of 256,206 concurrent players before settling back down to 188,000 players today. Regardless, the upwards trajectory of this title is impressive and it appears to still have room to grow.

            <p>Good news, ghost-hunting fans - <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/phasmophobia">Phasmophobia</a> has outlined the road ahead for the spooky sim in 2025 will include maps reworks, new ghost-hunting equipment, "thrilling seasonal events", and a brand-new location, too.</p>
<p>With two million copies sold since it came out of early access last October - bringing the total sales across all platforms to 22 million - the first update is Chronicle, which will refresh Phasmo's humble journal and rework the way in which we can record our findings and capture evidence.</p>

<p>The Photos tab will be replaced with a media tab that encapsulates not just polaroid images, but also videos and sound recordings, too, with your first "capture" of any media deemed "Unique".</p>
<p>Also on the cards is a complete rework of Bleasdale Farmhouse (good; I <em>always</em> die there) with "visual enhancements and a complete redesign of the layout, including new locations for ghosts to haunt".</p>

<p>Interestingly, this map will also encompass a new outdoor space just beyond the living room.</p>
<p>The game's other terrifying farmhouse, Grafton, is also getting updated later this year.</p>
<p>"We're beyond excited for the new updates and reworks coming to Phasmophobia this year," said Daniel "Dknighter" Knight, director of Kinetic Games and lead developer of Phasmophobia.</p>
<p>"Our early access period so far has given us a fantastic opportunity to listen to our players, and the big changes we're making are a direct reflection of the feedback we're seeing.</p>
<p>"We're really proud of the direction Phasmophobia is going in, thanks in no small part to our amazing community, and we can't wait to see what everyone thinks of some of the surprises in store for 2025."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phasmophobia-is-getting-more-expensive-later-today">Phasmophobia's price was bumped from £10.99 to a very precise £16.75 ($20/€19.50) last September</a>, with the team saying the price hike was due to "the amount of content and playtime added to the game since Early Access started almost four years ago".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fantasy-at-the-end-of-the-world.1104993/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/metaphor-refantazio-lynch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>This article contains some spoilers for the ending of </em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</p><p>Over the past few months, I’ve picked up a nasty habit that I swore I’d kicked for good: I wake up in the morning, immediately pick up my glowing rectangle, and scroll social media to see what fresh horrors await.</p><p>It’s a terrible compulsion that <a href="https://www.404media.co/you-cant-post-your-way-out-of-fascism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I’ve repeatedly condemned</a>, and the hypocrisy is not lost on me. The shame of not practicing what I preach is outweighed only by the quotidian psychic damage this habit inflicts, keeping me in a state of fearful paralysis. Sadness and rage make my body limp, and I end up exactly where our oppressors want us: caught in a loop of irreverent posting and passive info consumption, instead of organizing against them.</p><p>Everything about the current media environment is engineered to keep us stuck on this hamster wheel, but knowing that doesn’t make it any easier to log off. It’s hard to disconnect completely knowing climate change-fueled wildfires have burned down Los Angeles, or that<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-government-young-engineers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the richest dweeb on Earth is sending Nazi children</a> to dismantle every branch of the US government except the parts that kill and imprison people. Even so, if we don’t learn to step away from all this nonsense, we’ll never be able to imagine anything better or do the hard work to make it a reality.</p><p>One of my few sources of respite during all this has been playing <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>, a game that feels uncannily suited to our current moment in history. It’s a timely reminder that we need fantasy, daydreaming, and time away from the noxious doomcloud of discourse if we want anything to change. If we’re truly witnessing the twilight of American empire, fantasy can show us a new world that lies beyond it—but only if we’re willing to log off and put in the work.</p><hr><p>There are two real-world events that will always define my 100+ hours playing Atlus’<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/metaphor-refantazio-is-the-future-of-rpgs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> much-praised JRPG</a>: the passing of legendary filmmaker David Lynch, and the re-election of Donald Trump as the most powerful psychopath on Earth. This feels weird to type out, given that <em>Metaphor</em> is a fantasy roleplaying game and Trump and Lynch are two real people who exist on opposite poles of the same unreality. One is the ultimate id, a craven narcissist who uses untruth and delusion as weapons to divide and rule; the other taps the realms of fantasy and the subconscious as a guide, his works reminding us to trust our intuition and discover truths hidden deep within the self.</p><p>I felt the long shadows of both men as I played through <em>Metaphor</em>’s six story arcs, along with a lingering feeling that the game’s creators bit off more than they could chew. For the most part, the game drives home its timely themes thanks to a vividly imagined world and some relatable and deeply-written characters. But for a story about “the power of fantasy,” <em>Metaphor</em>’s final thesis still left me feeling a bit empty.</p><p><em>Metaphor</em>’s director Katsura Hashino<a href="https://www.cnet.com/tech/gaming/anxiety-is-the-ultimate-monsters-says-metaphor-refantazio-director/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> has said that the game is about anxiety</a>, a theme he couldn’t have picked a better time in modern history to explore, given the state of everything. More specifically, it’s about how anxiety can turn us into monsters, and the existential question of how we as individuals and a society should deal with it. After all, anxiety is the price we pay for our existence as a sentient species, and all that <em>agita</em> has gotta go somewhere.</p><figure></figure><p>The game’s bleak world shows us how this dilemma can lead down some very dark paths. The most powerful people in <em>Metaphor</em>’s world all offer different solutions to the problem of anxiety, all of which lead to chaos, stagnation, and/or ruin. The late King, whose murder spurs the events of the game, believed the power of government authority could ease everyone’s burdens, using a mystical sceptre that lets him <em>quite literally</em> absorb the people’s anxiety in the form of magic. But in doing so he becomes frail and crestfallen, a puppet-like figurehead of a dying nation who has long since given up on his ideals.</p><p>Exploiting this power vacuum are the game’s two main antagonists. Sanctifex Forden, the leader of the powerful Sanctist Church, would have the people pour their anxieties into a corrupt, racist, and highly-stratified state religion, promising salvation in exchange for their blind faith and obedience. Louis, the smooth-talking bishounen Big Bad, takes the Nietszchean position: Under his Reddit libertarian-esque new world order, these corrupt institutions would be destroyed and “true equality” achieved by forcing people to harness their own anxieties and seize<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_to_power" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the will to power</a>—the ultimate survival-of-the-fittest where the strong survive and the weak die.</p><p>Our heroes, meanwhile, seek another path, forged by unlocking one’s inner power and using it to help and protect others. Just like the <em>Persona</em> games that preceded it, <em>Metaphor</em> borrows these concepts from the work of psychologist Carl Jung, who was all about confronting the deepest parts of the self as a way to achieve personal and societal enlightenment. But to me, the game even more strongly evokes the late David Lynch.</p><hr><p>In Hollywood, Lynch was as rare as they come. The celebrated creator of surrealist mysteries like <em>Twin Peaks</em>, <em>Blue Velvet</em>, and <em>Mulholland Drive</em>, he’s one the few artists whose work always seems to be a true and honest reflection of himself and what he believes in. His films are the kind that can only come from a person who is constantly in deep dialogue with their inner self—scouring the depths of their subconscious for hidden truths, rather than waiting for someone or something external to give the answers. In this sense, <em>Metaphor</em> is definitively Lynchian.</p><p>If it isn’t obvious by now, I’m a bit of a Lynch fangirl—and whatever the opposite of that is for Trump. If Trump’s brand of fascism represents the darkest pits of depravity that fear and anxiety can drive us to, Lynch’s works point to the dual nature of these forces. His films show how mystery—the sublime beauty of the unknown—can evoke a positive kind of anxiety based in curiosity, intuition, and a desire for personal and collective growth.&nbsp;</p><p>This idea of anxiety having the potential to create change for good or ill is the core of <em>Metaphor</em>’s story. Like previous Atlus games, it takes these philosophical concepts and embeds them into the story and gameplay mechanics. When characters awaken to their anxiety-fueled powers, they do so by ripping out their own heart and screaming a declaration of their will into it like a microphone. The powers themselves are “Archetypes,” a term coined by Jung to describe the characteristic patterns that repeat in different people throughout history. Anxiety is also a status effect in <em>Metaphor</em>, notably the only one that can be triggered by things beyond status-inflicting attacks in combat, like being surprised by the enemy or taking too much damage before your first press turn.</p><p>In Lynch’s work,&nbsp; the good things in life glow bright because of the dark, and remind us how easily darkness can consume everything if we don’t find and confront it within ourselves while pursuing the light. He embraces ambiguity and often avoids neatly-wrapped conclusions, showing us how the search for truth can bring us together in shared purpose, even when life refuses to give us satisfying answers. In the end, the journey is always worth it, as long as we keep working and stay true to our ideals.</p><p>Which brings me back to my bad social media habits.</p><p>When you’re lying in bed scrolling through an endless firehose of news, it often feels like you’re afflicted with an Anxiety stat debuff. You know it’s bad, but you can’t shake the feeling that you’re missing one piece of a puzzle—that if you just find the <em>right</em> piece of information, you’ll finally have what you need to start making sense of things. Or at very least, to prepare for things getting worse.</p><p>But the fact is, we already have enough information. No amount of posting or scrolling is going to give us that missing piece. What we need to do is to decide what truth we believe in, embrace the unknown, and take action to manifest our truth into a better world.</p><hr><p>Unless you majorly fuck something up along the way, <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> ends with both of the main villains defeated, the king’s sceptre destroyed, and our protagonist leading the nation of Euchronia on a slow but steady march toward a better future. Progress doesn’t happen overnight, the game repeatedly reminds us, but we need to stick to our ideals and believe that change is possible.</p><p>Many of us need to hear this right now, but it was still frustrating to me that the story ends essentially right back where it began: with a country ruled over by a powerful king, albeit a beneficent one with a much brighter disposition. As the credits rolled, I pondered what David Lynch might say about this conclusion—the way it ties things together with a neatly wrapped bow, rather than giving us space to imagine other possibilities. In <em>Twin Peaks: The Return</em>, Monica Belucci tells Lynch’s character Gordon Cole, “We are like the dreamer who dreams and then lives inside the dream”—so why not dream a little bigger?&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout the whole game, it feels like the townsfolk are all simply waiting to hear what fate the Important People have in store for them. Gaining the support of the people is a big part of the story, and many of the supporters and friends you meet along the way have some great character-building moments as they learn to take control of their anxieties and forge a path forward in their own lives. But ultimately, the macro-scale political problems of the world are all on the shoulders of you and your merry band.</p><figure></figure><p>Fuck that. Even if the entire kingdom is cheering me as their savior, why is it always up to one Good Person and their team of elite do-gooders to save the world? In our world, our leaders have failed us, and there’s no revolutionary vanguard. No one is coming to save us. It’s up to all of us, collectively, to organize and do the work. And despite what the social media doomscroll would have you believe, that work is happening all around us every day.</p><p>The examples are endless. We saw during the Los Angeles wildfires how people sprung into action to create mutual aid distribution hubs for the displaced and the unhoused. In New York City, large networks of veteran organizers dispatch volunteers multiple times a week to keep watch for ICE raids and protect our most vulnerable neighbors from Trump’s deportation machine. Other organizers provided food and warm clothes to migrants after cities closed shelters in freezing temperatures. Others have mobilized to provide legal and material aid to transgender people after a rapid series of illegal Executive Orders claimed to strip them of their rights.&nbsp;</p><p>A better world is possible not because of the actions of a few heroic people, but because neighbors organize and help each other, building local power to sustain their communities where the government has failed. Organizers are doing this in every town and city. Some of them have been doing it for decades.</p><p>To be clear, <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio </em>is an entertainment product made by a large corporation. I held no illusions that it was going to present the gaming public with a collectivist vision of a world beyond capitalism, and from the get-go it seemed clear that the utopia <em>Metaphor</em>’s characters are striving for is essentially a progressive / neoliberal status quo. But maybe that wasn’t the point.</p><p>To paraphrase<a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/AJ3RVFGnwFw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the great Ursula K. Le Guin</a>, no government lasts for forever. Empires can be unmade, giving way to a new world that—while still imperfect—can seem like fantasy to those who came before. But this better world is not preordained.

			<p>One of the newer features added to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest iteration</a> of Sid Meier's Civilization is the inclusion of Crisis Events. This also includes Crisis Policies, which are held on the same page as the Social Policies that you can choose for your empire. If you're getting stuck in Civilization 7 and aren't sure what the Crisis Events have in store for you, this guide will explain everything you need to know about Crisis Policies and the Crisis Events themselves in Civilization 7.</p>
<p>For more Civilization 7, check out our other guides.</p>

</ul>
<h2>What Are Crisis Policies?</h2>

<figure></figure>

<p>For every unique Crisis Event in Civilization 7 comes a unique set of Crisis Policies that you will have to choose between. While some of them may seem like they could be beneficial, a lot of the time, the negative effects of the Policies will be very obvious during your playthrough. The Crisis Policies exist to try and help mitigate the dangers of the ongoing crisis rather than help to resolve it entirely. There will be some difficult choices you'll have to make, and as the Crisis evolves, you'll have to choose more Crisis Policies.</p>
<h2>What are Crisis Events in Civilization 7?</h2>
<p>Crisis Events happen through the Antiquity and Exploration Age typically, where you can have anything from a nonstop invasion to the Plague ravaging your empire and nearby cities. Unfortunately, you&nbsp;<strong>cannot stop</strong> these events from happening. They are guaranteed to happen, but it may just take a while for them to happen. Below are the events that could happen in the Antiquity Age and Exploration Age, respectively.</p>
<p><strong>Revolts</strong> - The rising unhappiness of your population has reached an all-time high. Your settlements go into open revolt, and they want to tear you down.</p>
<p><strong>Invasion</strong> - Independent Powers will begin to overwhelm your lands and assault your troops and cities. You'll need a strong military for this one.</p>
<p><strong>Plague</strong> - The plague is self-explanatory but can be incredibly difficult to handle during this age, as there are minimal medical breakthroughs at this point.</p>
<p>Moving on to the Exploration Age there are two different events that can happen in the Exploration Age, but the Plague can also happen here, too.</p>
<p><strong>Wars of Religion</strong> - Nations begin to spread their religions, but this leads to conflict between different religions that believe in their own tenets. You can choose whether or not you think tolerance of other beliefs can exist.</p>
<p><strong>Revolution</strong> - The Bourgeoisie and the middle class begin to rise up and ask for a change in power, which shocks the noble people. You have the option to dampen their revolution efforts or lead a Revolutionary Government.</p>
<p><strong>Plague</strong> - The Plague can also happen in the Exploration Age. There are more ways to handle it, such as having Medical staff available during this time, but it is significantly more dangerous and more contagious.</p>
<p>While you can't prevent the Crisis Events from happening, if you were to start a new Civilization 7 game, you can <strong>choose to toggle them off</strong>, so you don't have to deal with them in a new playthrough.</p>

He spent over 15 years in IT support before joining The Verge.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Discord is offering users <a href="https://discord.com/safety/safer-internet-day-2025">a new way to block people</a> without the confrontational nature of an actual block. The new feature, called Ignore, is essentially a mute function that can hide annoying or abusive users without attracting unwanted attention — thus avoiding unnecessary anxiety or flare-up drama.</p><p>You can apply the new Ignore feature by going to a user’s profile, tapping the triple-dot menu, and selecting Ignore (in the same menu where Block can be found). Once you activate it, you’ll no longer see that user’s profile and messages, and you will see less of them across Discord, as it will mute their notifications and activity, including in server message notifications (in other words, alerts). However, the big distinction is that, unlike with a Block, Ignore will still let them see your profile and activity and allow them to send you messages (which you won’t know about unless you unhide them). But they will be none-the-wiser about their Ignore status.</p><p>Discord says it’s adding Ignore to its safety “toolbox” to give users, especially teens, more discreet ways to take space from others without making situations scary. Discord is also joining OpenAI, Google, Roblox, and others in establishing a non-profit foundation called ROOST, which will offer open-source technology for detecting child sexual abuse material (CSAM) to various organizations.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There were commercials about Meg Ryan having orgasms at a restaurant with Billy Crystal (a la <em>When Harry Met Sally</em>), Gordon Ramsay and Pete Davidson hanging with alien cookware, and Post Malone drinking beer while acting like...Post Malone. My argument is: If brands are willing to spend an NFL player’s salary on a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it commercial, then why not fork over $40 million more and produce some high quality TV?</p><p>From Matthew McConaughey spouting “foodball”-related conspiracy theories to Michael Shannon and Aubrey Plaza being unimpressed by everything in life, here are the 11 Super Bowl LIX commercials that need to become TV shows.</p></div></div><div><p>You could put Glen Powell in a jet (<em>Top Gun: Maverick</em>), the path of a tornado (<em>Twisters</em>), or a lethal relationship (<em>Hit Man</em>), and he’s going to make you want to watch all of it. So, him donning a blonde wig as the most adrenaline-fueled version of Goldilocks ever in the Ram Trucks Super Bowl commercial was a thrill ride I didn’t want to end. What if he had a lighthearted but high-stakes anthology series where he’s a dad trying to connect with the children he has in the commercial by retelling classic children’s stories with him as the action hero? If he’s dodging dragons and riding over volcanoes as Goldilocks, you could easily fill 15 episodes of him saving Hansel and Gretel from that cannibalistic old witch with an AK-47, or dressing up as one of the three little pigs to interrogate the captured wolf in order to find out the location of his fellow wolves so they can exact revenge. CBS, put this show on after <em>Tracker</em>. </p></div><div><p>Michael Shannon and Aubrey Plaza are a match made in sarcastic heaven as they try to stop delicious RITZ crackers from breaking their veneer of perpetual dissatisfaction. While the concept gets a couple of chuckles for the ad’s 31 seconds, I’d love to see Plaza and Shannon in a TV series where they realize life is too short to hate everything, so they employ Bad Bunny to try to introduce them to things to make them happy, and despite his best efforts, he fails more often than he succeeds. Imagine Shannon and Plaza’s stone-faced reactions to skydiving, an ayahuasca retreat, and front row seats at a Bad Bunny concert. Cut the check, RITZ.</p></div><div><p>When Harrison Ford talks, I listen. This Jeep Super Bowl commercial was simply 120 seconds of Ford exuding enough captivating cool to be able to speak to America about understanding the cost of freedom like he’s our father. Honestly, that’s the show. Ford living on a farm, riding trucks, and looking directly into our souls every episode as he explains life lessons about the benefits of taking the road less traveled, why we pay taxes, and how to cook eggs when you only have a chicken and sunlight in the woods. Think of it like <em>Mr. Rogers’ Neighborhood</em> if it was in the <em>Yellowstone </em>universe.</p></div><div><p>Nostalgia is always in style, especially when it involves a sequel to one of the greatest romantic comedies of all time. This Super Bowl LIX commercial revisited <em>When Harry Met Sally</em>’s iconic scene in which Sally (Meg Ryan) proves to Harry (Billy Crystal) that men can’t tell when women are faking orgasms by imitating an orgasm so convincingly in a restaurant full of people that someone famously says, “I’ll have what she’s having.” The only difference is this time, it appears Hellmann’s mayonnaise is <em>actually </em>that pleasurable. The 1989 classic ends with the pair getting married. If, 36 years later, they’ve gotten to the point where some store-bought mayonnaise is the highlight of their night, there could be comedic gold in uncovering the ways this longtime couple tries to keep things spicy, even if it’s just arguing over condiments. </p></div><div><p>People often wonder what they would say or do if they ever met aliens. This HexClad commercial proposes the idea that Gordon Ramsay would be introduced to out-of-this-world cookware, some of which he’s already used. This could be a really limited series (I’m talking four episodes, tops) of Ramsay berating alien chefs who cook intergalactic meals he’s never heard of but can nevertheless judge because his taste is the best in the universe. Unfortunately, with Pete Davidson as the alien ambassador, something is surely going to blow up in Ramsay’s face. </p></div><div><p>A good mockumentary will always make for good TV. The Uber Eats commercial stars Matthew McConaughey as an executive revealing all the ways in which football is a “conspiracy to make us hungry.” Only, plot twist: it’s actually about McConaughey playing himself and pitching Greta Gerwig on a movie about this conspiracy. A movie with McConaughey acting as a zany version of himself, pursuing the making of this passion project and going to great lengths to break down this NFL conspiracy, could be a comedy hit. As ridiculous as some of the claims are (Football being played on Sundays because of ice cream sundaes?), it would be interesting to see what new and wacky coincidences they can come up with while using McConaughey’s hypnotic charm to make them seem somewhat real. Honestly, why else would the Green Bay Packers’ fanbase be known as Cheese Heads?</p></div><div><p> Post Malone and irreverent comedian Shane Gillis being drunk and disorderly troublemakers in a cul-de-sac is a funny enough premise for a Bud Light Super Bowl commerical and a <em>Workaholics</em>-style raunchy comedy. Can you imagine Post Malone day-drinking and playing acoustic versions of Kendrick Lamar’s “Not Like Us” while Peyton Manning, living next door, is trying to enjoy the silence of retirement? Add in Shane Gills teaching the neighborhood kids how to safely do a keg stand, and you’ve got three seasons of an HBO series. <br></p></div><div><p>I wouldn’t say Booking.com’s Muppet-filled Super Bowl LIX commercial was the best of the night, but it’s probably the most TV-series-ready of them all. The Muppets bouncing around the world trying to find the right vacation spot is cool for a 30-second commercial, but it really makes me want a <em>White Lotus</em>-style comedy. Kermit and Miss Piggy convincing the rest of the gang to spend their summer at an all-inclusive resort, only to find out there’s some shady activities happening right under their noses, is must-see TV. If <em>Bert and Ernie’s Great Adventures </em>can get 52 episodes, <em>The Muppets: White Lotus</em> can get at least enough for a summer. </p></div><div><p>Sure, Instacart gathered the mascots of some of the most popular consumer brands in the world to entice people watching the Super Bowl to get their groceries from them. What they unintentionally did was show us what a cross between <em>Toy Story</em> and <em>Night at the Museum</em> could look like. The same excitement you get from seeing how characters from disparate video game franchises might interact in a <em>Super Smash Bros.</em>-style duel can be achieved by seeing what happens when the Kool-Aid Man bursts through a wall and messes up a floor that Mr. Clean spent all day polishing. But, honestly, I just want to see people’s reactions when their groceries go on strike and move away. </p></div><div><p>Let’s be clear: Dunkin’s Super Bowl commerical is very stupid (borderline insultingly stupid). But then, that’s what makes the sight of Ben and Casey Affleck and Jeremy Strong doing battle with other coffee brands a car wreck of a commercial you don’t want to look away from. As a TV show, the Affleck brothers running multiple Dunkin’ locations while trying to ward off competitors has the same absurdist foundation that made <em>Eastbound and Down </em>irresistible. With guest appearances from Super Bowl-winning coach Bill Belichick, Druski, possibly Matt Damon, and a bunch of others joining the fight, this could be a great late-night binge for the stoner crowd. </p></div><div><p>Anything Walton Goggins does deserves to be on TV, even if it’s just him breaking the fourth wall for a GoDaddy commerical. But, while the man who made a relatable antihero out of a human mutated by radiation in <em>Fallout </em>spends the ad joking about how actors rarely know anything about the professions they pretend to do, I wouldn’t mind a TV show that puts him in an alternate reality where there’s no difference between who you are on TV and who you are in your normal life. People would run up to him to help them stop bank robbers because he played a cop on <em>The Shield</em>, only for those same bank robbers to ask him for help since he also played a thief in <em>Justified</em>. There could be some sentimental overarching message about him having the potential to be anything, or some societal critique on our obsession with stars. Either way, I need Apple TV and the <em>Severance</em> creators to get the scripts going for this one.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds players could not enjoy the recent open beta test 2 over the weekend due to the recent PlayStation Network outage. As compensation, the developers will extend the second week of OBT 2. </p>



<p>The developers had planned to conduct two Open Beta Test 2 sessions, the first between February 6 and 9 and the second between February 13 and 16. However, after the PSN issue hampered the experience during the first week, they decided to extend the second session across all platforms (PlayStation 5, Xbox, and Steam). The extended period for the Monster Hunter Wilds open beta test 2 is “Feb. 13, 7 pm PT / Feb. 14, 3 am GMT – Feb. 17, 6:59 pm PT / Feb. 18, 2:59 am GMT.”&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The developers have <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1888907223285256244" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stated</a> that players will still be eligible for “participation bonuses” during the extended Monster Hunter Wilds beta test. These bonuses will also be available in the full version of the game. The beta test features a new training mode, crossplay, Gypceros, Arkveld, the previously available content, and more.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds’s open beta test 2 was not the only game affected during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-down-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation Network outage</a>. All online games on the platform were rendered unplayable, and players could only access their single-player physical titles. Sony stated that an “operational issue” caused the 20-hour outage, and as compensation, it has provided players with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-gives-reason-for-psn-outage-offers-amends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5 days of free PlayStation Plus</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here’s a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">guide</a> on all Monster Hunter Wilds, including the release time, editions, prices, etc. Also, here’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-beta-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how the previous</a> open beta test went.

            <p>Sony has seemingly delisted a number of games following an investigation into the prevalence of "spam" titles on digital storefronts.</p>
<p>After an investigation by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-could-make-fart-fart-boobie-fart-the-game-and-maybe-it-would-eventually-get-taken-down-devs-reveal-why-the-consoles-are-drowning-in-eslop">IGN</a> found differing approaches to quality control across Nintendo, PC, PlayStation, and Xbox stores, players believe they've found evidence that Sony has removed some questionable developers from the PlayStation Store.</p>

<p>For example, most games from developer <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/publisher/RandomSpin-Games">RandomSpin</a> - including Supermarket Simulator Pro, Bodycam Shooter, and Backrooms Inside The Escape, all of which are allegedly thought to use AI and/or recycled assets - have disappeared, leading some to speculate that Sony has responded to criticism.</p>
<p>As detailed on <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/news/ps5-spam-games-delisted-february-2025">TrueTrophies</a> and <a href="https://forum.psnprofiles.com/topic/159499-upcoming-server-shutdowns-delistings/page/35/#comment-3142794">PSNProfiles</a>, the developer has released <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/publisher/RandomSpin-Games">dozens of games in 2024 alone</a>, in some cases releasing multiple games a month, leading some to speculate about the quality of its products.</p>
<p>This issue isn't unique to just PS5, of course. Just days after the creative director of indie hit Unpacking, Wren Brier, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/unpacking-developer-calls-out-nintendo-after-reporting-cheap-fakes-on-its-eshop">called out Nintendo due to the prominence of copycat games on its Switch eShop</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/now-black-myth-wukong-copycat-games-are-popping-up-on-nintendo-eshop">Chinese fans spotted a game called Wukong Sun: Black Legend had popped up, too</a> with misleading artwork to match its name.</p>
<p>Similarly, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtimes-going-after-google">Poppy Playtime developer Mob Entertainment is suing Google for failing to remove "scam" apps from the Google Play store</a>. In legal papers filed last month, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/poppy-playtime">Poppy Playtime</a>'s creators accused Daigo Game 2020 Inc. of releasing "scam" apps intentionally advertised with names like Poppy Playtime: Chapter 3 and Poppy Playtime: Chapter 4 well before the instalments had been officially released for mobile devices.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
