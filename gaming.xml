          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 Console Review</p>
      </div>
<p>The top three best-selling Switch 2 physical games sold during the first week in the US were Mario Kart World, Cyberpunk 2077, and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's Switch 2 Edition, according to Circana. Mario Kart World has big shoes to fill, as Mario Kart 8 Deluxe sold 68.2 million units, with Mario Kart 8 shifting 8.46 million copies for a combined total of 76.66 million.</p><p>Finally, Piscatella said the Switch 2 set a new all-time record for first-week sales of video game hardware in the US, surpassing a record previously held by the PS4.

			<p>Borderlands 4, the next entry in the series launching later this year on PC and consoles, has become available for pre-order today, finally confirming the game's price.</p>
<p>In a new <a href="https://newsroom.2k.com/news/borderlandsr-4-now-available-for-pre-order-post-launch-content-to-include-story-missions-and-all-new-vault-hunters" target="_blank" rel="noopener">press release</a> shared today, 2K and Gearbox Software confirmed the game's Standard Edition will launch in the United States for $69.99 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. For a few weeks, statements from Gearbox's Randy Pitchford <a href="https://wccftech.com/randy-pitchford-says-a-real-fan-will-find-a-way-to-pay-80-for-borderlands-4-if-that-ends-up-being-the-price/">suggested</a> the fourth entry in the series would be among the increasing number of games retailing at $80 at launch, but thankfully, that was not the case.</p>
<p>Besides confirming the price of the Borderlands 4 Standard Edition, 2K and Gearbox Software confirmed the details of the Deluxe Edition and the Super Deluxe Editions, which will retail for $99.99 and $129.99, respectively. The first will include the Bounty Pack Bundle featuring four separate post-launch DLC packs, each with distinct areas, new missions, and unique bosses; four Vault Cards with unique challenges and rewards; new gear and weapons; four new vehicles, and Vault Hunter cosmetics; and the Firehawk's Fury Weapon Skin. The second will include not only the Bounty Pack Bundle but also the Vault Hunter Pack featuring two new Story Packs, each featuring a new Vault Hunter, story, and side missions, two new map regions, new gear and weapons, more Vault Hunter cosmetics, and new ECHO-4 cosmetics.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on September 12th. The game will also be available at launch on the NVIDIA GeForce NOW cloud gaming service.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nexus-mods-founder-steps-down-from-management-after-24-years.1219557/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nexus-mods-founder-robin-scott-steps-down<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Robin Scott, the founder of modding platform Nexus Mods, has announced he will be stepping down from his management role at the site after 24 years.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, Scott says that he thinks the decision to step back from managing Nexus Mods is "in both [his] and the community's best interests". He says that the "strain" of responsibility for the "behemoth" he's created has "taken its toll".</p>

<p>According to Scott, running Nexus Mods for 24 years and having to be "on call" has caused "anxiety and stress-related health issues" for him, and that since he's been "burning out", it's best for him to "step aside and bring in new leadership".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nexus-mods-founder-stepping-down-front-page.jpg?itok=owbs5AIY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nexus-mods-founder-stepping-down-front-page.jpg?itok=Gagyq0q_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nexus Mods founder Robin Scott is stepping down after 24 years.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Scott, ownership of Nexus Mods has "changed hands", but he says the sale "isn't some corporate 'exit' or a backroom deal". He doesn't specify who exactly owns the site now, instead referring to "structural updates to the company ownership that we aren't shouting about".</p>

<p>Despite this, Scott says the changes are "about long-term stability, not changing the values or direction of the platform"; according to Scott, Nexus Mods will remain "community-first and mod-author-focused".</p>

<p>He says that from a user perspective, "not a lot" will be changing, and that behind the scenes, he was already beginning to reduce his involvement in the Nexus Mods platform. As such, the site will likely continue to run as it has done for the last few months.</p>

<p>As for Scott himself, he says he won't be "disappearing" from Nexus Mods altogether. He'll remain active on the site's Discord channel, and he'll also be "working with the team to help guide the overall direction" of Nexus Mods.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nexus-mods-founder-stepping-down-skyrim.jpg?itok=a-Oi3eT0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nexus-mods-founder-stepping-down-skyrim.jpg?itok=7rymQArt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nexus Mods plays host to mods for games like&nbsp;<em>Skyrim</em>, as well as&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>&nbsp;and many more.</figcaption></figure><p>Nexus Mods was founded by Scott back in 2001, at which point it was a fansite for&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</em>. Over time, it became a modding platform for that game, eventually expanding to encapsulate other games as well.</p>

<p>It hasn't been without controversy; Scott and Nexus Mods have found themselves in hot water numerous times over their decision to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nexus-bans-all-us-political-mods-going-forward" rel="nofollow">ban certain mods</a>, or, indeed, to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/nexus-mods-decides-to-allow-an-oblivion-remastered-mod-that-changes-body-type-options-to-male-female-declares-its-not-a-battleground-for-broader-cultural-or-political-debates/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">allow</a> certain mods. That's doubtless the kind of back-and-forth Scott wants to escape.</p>

<p>In any case, it's not clear how Nexus Mods will change in future, but one thing's for sure: it won't be changing under Scott's leadership. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellar-blade">Stellar Blade</a> modders have made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/40-of-stellar-blade-mods-are-nsfw-but-dont-worry-weve-narrowed-that-down-to-three-guaranteed-to-raise-your-heart-rate">a lot of sexual stuff</a> so far. As it turns out, the game's director is cool with that, though he is hoping that despite the game not having any official tools, modders'll have a go at creating fresh wrinkles that add to what the Stellar Blade experience offers.</p>
<p>Hyung-tae Kim gave his opinion on where the game's modding scene is currently at in a recent interview with South Korean site <a href="https://www.thisisgame.com/webzine/special/nboard/5/?n=214039">This Is Game</a>, translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/stellar-blades-director-doesnt-plan-to-police-modders-but-would-like-them-to-be-mature-and-stay-within-reason-with-what-they-make/">Automaton</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1934199332787679533">Genki</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First of all, the director's general view on Stellar Blade modding's pretty positive. He doesn't see the need to interfere with them except by encouraging folks from being careful with or avoiding stuff that could mess up their base game. Exactly the kind of view you'd hope a developer would have, rather than panicking and calling the lawyers the moment someone figures out how to replace a texture.</p>
<p>He's also cool with the idea of folks making reams of NSFW stuff like nice suits for the game, since Stellar Blade has a strong rating and is therefore aimed at adults. I'd caveat that as adults you might find a bit weird, but I digress. To be clear you can do the dirty to whatever floats your boat, as long as it's not doing any harm. The trouble with Stellar Blade has been misogynistic players and online dicks treating Eve, jiggle physics et al, as an example of how all women should look in games - see some of the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3489700/reviews/?browsefilter=funny&amp;snr=1_5_100010_&amp;p=1">Steam reviews</a>.</p>
<p>Anyway, the director's less of a fan of paid mods that charge high prices, but generally seems to trust players not to engage with anything that crosses a line or involve material that could be classed as harmful or sensitive.</p>
<p>All of that said, Kim is keen to see Stellar Blade modders spread their wings a bit. While acknowledging that the game's lack of official tools will likely make this more difficult, the director's interested in seeing folks make mods that switch up what it's like to play the game, but without straying too far from its original vision.</p>
<p>According to Genki's translation, that wish was accompanied by Kim using the killer phrase "modders' firepower is still weak", as part of suggesting that he thinks the current crop of new cosmetics and minor tweaks don't go much beyond the stuff the base game offers. Which, to be fair, is the norm for games that haven't been out on PC long.</p>
<p>So, we'll have to see if the SteamyBladers accept this challenge, put aside their jiggle physics manipulation for a second, open up new tabs that cover their pretty out there desktop backgrounds, and set about pushing the limits of modding potential rather than the limits of taste. You can do it, high-five Stellar Blade modde...actually, you know what, maybe not. I don't know where that mitt's been.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As such, it makes for a good time to see which pulls from the long-awaited return of Team Rocket are fetching the big bucks, and how much you’re going to need to fork out if you want to add a specific special art to your collection.</p><p>All year long, <em>Pokémon TCG</em> has been plagued by issues of availability, and the accompanying misery of resellers wreaking havoc on the market. Destined Rivals is certainly no exception, and for once it’s not just because of people wanting to turn a profit at the expense of the real players: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-review-pull-rates-mewtwo-1851781001&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-review-pull-rates-mewtwo-1851781001">this is a <em>damned</em> good set of Pokémon cards</a></span>, adding a huge amount of new fun to the live game, as well as being a set packed with stunning art, and most excitingly of all, better pull-rates.</p><p>When it comes to prices, I’m also pleased to report that things aren’t nearly as crazy as I’d expected. Now, for the sake of my own ego, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-price-value-team-rocket-1851779160&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-price-value-team-rocket-1851779160">I did correctly call which would be the biggest cards</a></span>, but I’m  happy to say I got the pricing trends wrong. I’m not sure if that’s because of the better pull rates (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tcgplayer.com/content/article/Pok%C3%A9mon-TCG-Destined-Rivals-Pull-Rates/43ba832e-44c9-45a4-ae2e-594df2defdda/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/content/article/Pok%C3%A9mon-TCG-Destined-Rivals-Pull-Rates/43ba832e-44c9-45a4-ae2e-594df2defdda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they appear to be almost identical</a></span> to those of Journey Together, itself a big improvement since the removal of Ace Specs, but with twice as many cards in this newer set, there’s so much more variety to enjoy), or if perhaps at last the whole global fuss is finally calming down, but either way it’s great news for the hobby. So sorry, if you <em>did </em>pull a Cynthia’s Garchomp, you’re not quite as rich as you might have expected. Although not too sorry, since the numbers here are still double what we’d have seen a year ago.</p><p>I should note on prices, while the individual cards themselves aren’t going <em>quite</em> as mad, the sealed packs themselves still are. Right now, a booster box of 36 packs is selling for $250, over a hundred bucks over its RRP, while Elite Trainer Boxes are also 50 percent higher than they should be at $87. If you’re chasing particular cards, <em>please</em> don’t spend that—it’s far smarter just to pay for the specific card you’re after.</p><p>So, that all said, here are the highest-priced cards in Destined Rivals. All prices are accurate at the time of writing, but likely to change very quickly:</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2a86aae32190513a9aae6cef705053a1" data-recommend-id="image://2a86aae32190513a9aae6cef705053a1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Typhlosion Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Typhlosion Illustration Rare" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2a86aae32190513a9aae6cef705053a1" data-recommend-id="image://2a86aae32190513a9aae6cef705053a1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Typhlosion Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>So, you know what, this one gives me a bit of hope. Prices of <em>Pokémon TCG</em> cards are so often determined by two factors: the rarity, and whether there’s a pretty girl. But here, Ethan’s Typhlosion is <em>not</em> a super-rare card. There are very many cards in this set that are vastly more difficult to find, that are fetching far lower prices than the <strong>$42</strong> this is going for at the time of writing.</p><p>And why? Because it looks so fricking cool! The average price for Illustration Rares in this set is about ten bucks, and a lot of them look fantastic, but damn, this card is incredible. This feels like the sort of card that’s going to gain a lot more value over the next few years, as numbers thin out and people start to reflect on what a stunner it truly is.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="270f0f33c5e4070d0432020461cd5fdc" data-recommend-id="image://270f0f33c5e4070d0432020461cd5fdc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Adventure Special Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Adventure Special Illustration Rare" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="270f0f33c5e4070d0432020461cd5fdc" data-recommend-id="image://270f0f33c5e4070d0432020461cd5fdc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ethan’s Adventure Special Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Ethan’s having a good showing in the top ten, and he’ll be back yet.

Misty, in the fiction, is 10 years old.

If you can get it in play (which requires two evolutions) you’ve got a 120 attack for just two energy, with a massive 310HP. It can dish out the hits while absorbing a lot itself, and the moment it’s looking vulnerable, you can return it to your hand for no cost and save a prize card. Neat.</p><p><strong>$65</strong> makes this a very expensive way to play the card, however! Thankfully, the identical ability is available on the regular version of the card, which is currently selling for 72c!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e7af90b4fb05556dd4950df94726bede" data-recommend-id="image://e7af90b4fb05556dd4950df94726bede" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Nidoking ex Special Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Nidoking ex Special Illustration Rare" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e7af90b4fb05556dd4950df94726bede" data-recommend-id="image://e7af90b4fb05556dd4950df94726bede" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Nidoking ex Special Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Boast though I might, I did miss this card when predicting the big sellers.

This spectacular card, which is so detailed that it’s hard to believe it’s not actually moving when you look at it, will currently cost you a cool <strong>$210</strong>. </p><p>Now, it’s worth noting that the price on this one has been unusual. You’ll usually see these cards get a crazy price on day one, as silly people pay massively over the odds for a card that’ll cost half as much in a week. But in the case of this card alone, its current price is higher than where it began, and that’s <em>after</em> it took a dip. This means that unlike most of the prices here that are now levelling out, this one could still be climbing. The fluctuation hasn’t exactly been significant—it only dipped to $195—but breaking the pattern remains of note, and we could be about to see this climb much higher. At grade 10, it’s currently dancing around the $1,000 mark.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7776a53de97bfc34eb32f92d094d2dfa" data-recommend-id="image://7776a53de97bfc34eb32f92d094d2dfa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex Special Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex Special Illustration Rare" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7776a53de97bfc34eb32f92d094d2dfa" data-recommend-id="image://7776a53de97bfc34eb32f92d094d2dfa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Team Rocket’s Mewtwo ex Special Illustration Rare" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>So yes,  predictably it’s the the extra-rare Mewtwo that comes out on top. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-price-value-team-rocket-1851779160&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-destined-rivals-price-value-team-rocket-1851779160">But like I said before release</a></span>...it’s ugly, right?

It’s also an easy way to stack certain secondary gear bonuses, like increased damage negation and improved ranged attacks. It’s not necessarily going to break the game but it’s a neat little thing players can try if they’re struggling against a particular boss. </p><p>Some players have been experimenting with this item duplication glitch since <em>Nightreign</em> launched weeks ago, so it’ll be interesting to see when FromSoftware actually patches it out. It’s in many ways antithetical to the entire ethos of the game, though anyone who’s been hitting their head against Libra for hours at night might not mind using any extra advantage they can find.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It has plenty of stuff to pick apart for lore fiends. Much like the towering Erdtree, Nightreign is just one branch, one alternate timeline, with roots in the world of Elden Ring. Nightreign  brings its own unique  ideas and new characters to Elden Ring, even if the events of the game don’t tie directly to the original. You’ll know what we mean when we start exploring the ending of Nightreign below. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>This article contains spoilers for the ending of Elden Ring Nightreign.</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Is Nightreign Canon?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Nightreign bends the history of The Lands Between in a different direction, forking off from a pivotal moment in the lore to give us a peek at what might've happened if things had gone much, much worse. It’s better to think of the events of Nightreign as an alternate timeline rather than a canon storyline. You don't need to know everything about Elden Ring to enjoy it, but you do need to spend quite a bit of time running expeditions and fighting Nightlords to get the full picture. Once you do, you'll start to grasp how Nightreign fits (and doesn't fit) into the story of the Lands Between.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/16/2622380-20250519175129-1-1750056432765.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Elden Ring Nightreign Ending Explained</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As the intro cutscene explains: Nightreign takes place in a world where the Tarnished never show up. The war between the gods—known as The Shattering—breaks out after Marika stirs chaos in The Lands Between by smashing the Elden Ring. Thousands of years pass and nobody takes the throne, eventually luring "an abomination" known as the Nightlord to the land. This unnamed being is basically a walking natural disaster. Wherever he goes, the Night follows, and an endless torrent of rain slowly dissolves the world into nothing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leave it to FromSoftware to come up with an even bleaker version of the timeline than what we have in the original game. Here, the Elden Throne is just an empty chair sitting in the ruins of a world fading out of existence. There's nothing to rule or to conquer. And yet a peculiar group of people have been chosen by some unknown master to try and defeat the Nightlord anyway and end the Night. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's where we come in. The Nightfarers team up to hunt down lesser Nightlords on their way to the source of the catastrophe. This involves dropping down onto what's left of Limgrave and battling familiar monsters and bosses from not only Elden Ring, but the Dark Souls series as well. While the game doesn't explicitly state why the worlds have converged, I like to think of it as the result of ruptures in reality as the universe collapses in on itself.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Elden Ring Nightreign Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you bring enough of the Nightlords down, the true culprit is revealed to be the husk of a man named Heolstor. He carries what looks like the Moonlight Greatsword from Dark Souls in one of his three arms, and is one of the most spectacular boss fights FromSoftware has ever created. Defeating him rewards you with the Primordial Nightlord's Rune, which resembles the Great Runes you find in Elden Ring, only with an inky hue. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Usually you return to see your allies hanging out in the Roundtable Hold after defeating a Nightlord, but killing Heolstor leaves you standing in front of a Roundtable Hold that has been long abandoned. A petrified corpse sits inside and when you place  the rune before it, it causes your Nightfarer to dissipate into streaks of light that fly into the sky.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A post-credits scene shows the Lands Between as we know it from Elden Ring—Erdtree and all—with golden leaves wafting in the air. One of those leaves lands on a tree branch atop a giant that looks a lot like Heolstor if he were made out of wood. It rises out of the sea, pausing a moment to face the Erdtree, and then steps away.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's heavily implied that by defeating Heolstor we've retroactively stopped the Night from ever happening in the first place. In other words: We've chopped off Nightreign's branch of the story for good, leaving the events of Elden Ring to play out as we know them from the original game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Who is Heolstor and what happens in the alternate endings?</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/16/spoilers-elden-ring-nightreign-heolstor-the-nightlord-final-boss-fight-youtube-0-11-30-1750056469544.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">We don't know a lot about Heolstor outside of the relic you get from defeating him. It tells a brief story of a knight who was slain by a hero before mysteriously waking up to curse the world. It's vague enough to fit into several different interpretations, but the most plausible one seems to be that he is intentionally a nobody, a cosmic inevitability as natural as the sun setting in the evening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This lines up thematically with the alternate ending the Wylder can get if you finish his <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Wylder_Remembrance_Quest_Walkthrough"><u>remembrance quests.</u></a> Instead of erasing the timeline, the Wylder takes up the mantle of Nightlord by using a Larval Tear, an item from Elden Ring that is associated with rebirth. You learn earlier in his quest that the Roundtable Hold only exists because the Nightlord exists, and his sister, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Duchess_Remembrance_Quest_Walkthrough"><u>the Duchess</u></a>, is locked to the same fate. He sacrifices himself to the Night to keep her alive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring-nightreign/Ironeye_Remembrance_Quest_Walkthrough"><u>Ironeye's</u></a> unique ending, he cuts the throat of the petrified corpse in the empty Roundtable Hold and prolongs the Night. His goal is to protect his clan of undying warriors who you might remember from Elden Ring as Those Who Live in Death. In Elden Ring's timeline, Those Who Live in Death are hunted by the followers of the Erdtree. The Ironeye's decision saves them from this outcome, but dooms the world as a result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Recluse's ending is the second most hopeful one you can get. Her remembrance reveals that she once had a child who she abandoned, leaving it to succumb to an endless hunger and start to devour everything in sight, including her own sister. After defeating Heolstor, the Recluse can find the Night-touched baby in the Roundtable Hold and embrace it. Her love calms the infant and seemingly prevents a new Nightlord from forming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The remaining Nightfarers don't have special endings associated with them. Their stories follow the events of the default ending and they likely disappear along with everything else when it's erased. But Nightreign's story isn't completely over: FromSoftware will eventually release new Nightfarers as DLC and they could provide even more insight into the nature of this sad world— possibly through their own alternate endings.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>This week, Sifu developer Sloclap is releasing Rematch, a new futuristic soccer title that takes a fresh approach to the game known as football outside of the United States. However, fans who want to field challengers from all platforms will have to wait, because Sloclap has announced that cross-play won't be ready in time for Rematch's launch.</p><p>Sloclap shared the news on social media, but also assured players that adding cross-play in a future update remains a priority for the team. The dev didn't put a timetable on when cross-play features will be ready.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/PlayRematch/status/1934529603244028143" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Crossplay between Steam, PlayStation &amp; Xbox won't be available at launch, but it's one of our top priorities for upcoming updates! ⚽🎮<br>We'll share an ETA as soon as possible, stay tuned! <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Rematch?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Rematch</a></p>  — Rematch (@PlayRematch) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayRematch/status/1934529603244028143?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Rematch embraces a semi-arcade style by cutting soccer teams down to five teammates on each side.

Players' POV of the game is shown through a third-person camera.

<figure><a title="Gex Trilogy Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156799/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p><em>Note. Gex Trilogy isn't playable on Switch 2 via backwards compatibility at the time of writing, although a patch has been submitted to Nintendo for review, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/clock-tower-rewind-to-receive-switch-2-exclusive-features-says-limited-run">according to Limited Run</a>. We'll update this note when we hear more.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Dimitris Giannakis’s Carbon Engine is back on behalf of Limited Run Games, and, despite some previously reported bugs, it fairly accurately brings vintage games to new hardware.</p>
<p>Speaking of bugs, Gex the gecko thrives on them. That and gnarly '90s flair. Combining all three titles released on Sony’s original PlayStation, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/gex_trilogy">Gex Trilogy</a> is a slice of a very colourful era, when <strong>Jackass</strong> was king, <strong>Beavis and Butthead</strong> were generational voices, britpop ruled the airwaves, and it seemed like people would do anything to get on TV. And, as it happens, TV is the theme when it comes to Gex, because, you know, like, <em>everyone</em> was watching TV in the '90s, man.</p>
<figure><a title="Gex Trilogy Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156805/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>While the initial <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/3do/gex">Gex</a> was released for the 3DO in 1995, a pack-in system seller that often went hand-in-hand with the console’s marketing, it was on the PlayStation that Crystal Dynamics’ series found a groove. And, since this trilogy reworks the games into a widescreen format, the PlayStation version is the more practical choice.</p>
<p>Gex is a gecko chilling in his Maui mansion when, while looking for a good show on the tube, his telescopic tongue whips a roaming fly down his gullet. This fly is actually a miniature robotic spy sent by Rez, king of the Media Dimension, that sucks Gex into his TV set. Gex then needs to work his way through a hub world, entering themed zones and stages, to recover remote controls that allow him to enter subsequent stages and ultimately return home. It’s wacky, and that’s largely the idea.</p>
<p>A 2D side-scrolling platformer, the first <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/gex">Gex</a> is mostly ok. Its primary novelty is that you can scale walls as a gecko can, and this allows you to navigate stages in an alternative manner, often leading to bonus warps and those elusive TV remotes.</p>
<figure><a title="Gex Trilogy Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156802/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Gex can swat enemies with his tail and use his tongue to lap up various power-ups, affording him different temporary properties or health increases. It’s neither aged considerably well nor poorly, but the patience of the gamer base may have moved on.</p>
<p>The graphics have a real pre-rendered multimedia 3DO smack, that, on the plus side, retroactively suit the game and its '90s-ness well, but are also kind of ugly in places. It gets more interesting in locales like Sumo City, which frankly looks and sounds totally like China but with Sumo enemies; and elsewhere you get to do stuff that breaks the mould like riding rockets and jungle swings.</p>
<p>The controls are a tad stiff and that makes certain clinches, especially boss battles, frustrating at times. There are points where you’re forced to make jumps into the unknown that could drown you (odd for a gecko), land you on a bed of spikes or down a bottomless pit. But the main test of patience is being forced to find those remotes.</p>
<figure><a title="Gex Trilogy Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156806/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Stages are non-linear and searching is required. Get killed and it’s back to the start or a checkpoint, meaning there’s some backtracking to be done, and you spend a lot of time searching and revisiting stages. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world">Mario World</a>, and much of its ilk, also had special coin collecting, but it was optional. Here, you won’t be able to access new stages until you’ve recovered enough remotes to do so, keeping you from progression. It can be frustrating, but if you're steeled for the fairly lengthy journey, there’s some enjoyment to be had.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/gex_enter_the_gecko">Gex 2: Enter the Gecko</a> (1998) goes full 3D, with the camera now forgivingly assigned to the second thumb stick as opposed to just the shoulder buttons. Again, Gex is whipped into the Media Dimension to defeat Rez, but here it’s all gloriously polygonal. And it holds up fairly well, considering, with stages that offer more engagement than its predecessor. Again, you need to find remotes to progress and expand the hub world, and now there are even more objects to collect, including gold remotes that can net you a special ending.</p>
<p>Gex 2 is a lot more interactive and the stage design is pretty clever in places, allowing you to spring from your tail to reach higher points. The vertical crawling is here, but it isn’t used as a main structural device as it was in the original, with only certain walls being climbable.</p>
<figure><a title="Gex Trilogy Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156803/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>On the whole, it’s a solid evolution for the series, and although the early PS1 3D can be visually confusing at times and difficult to control, it can be fun if you apply yourself to its fetch tasks and inherently wacky nature. For those who aren’t so into searching down numerous items, however, it can feel a bit of a slog by the halfway point.</p>
<p>The third and final game, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/gex_3_deep_cover_gecko">Gex 3: Deep Cover Gecko</a> (1999), capped the series after plans for a PlayStation 2 sequel were abandoned. It’s a big technological step up from the previous entry despite only appearing a year later, and incorporates many of Crystal Dynamic's previously unrealised ideas.</p>
<p>Gex starts here in a Wayne Manor-like hub world, with a tortoise butler. Seeing his love interest Agent Xtra (Playmate of the month and <strong>Baywatch</strong>'s Marliece Andrada) kidnapped by Rez, Gex finds himself back in the wacky media land of TV, where the camera is much improved and the scale is altogether broader. Stages are more open and freeform, encompassing tons of interactive objects, swimming, and platforms that work around weight and inertia.</p>
<figure><a title="Gex Trilogy Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156800/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Your tail whipping action, too, is complemented by costume changes and power-ups that transform you into Egyptian Pharoes and mecha robots. Traversing the playfields is varied, incorporating snowboarding, giant enemies, and a fair few layout puzzles to solve. The music remains great, and the whole thing feels smoother and more accomplished. Objectively and not sentimentally, it’s the superior of the three.</p>
<p>While the control and visual improvements are welcome, as are all the little bonuses like art galleries, music players, rewind and save functions, the main appeal with Gex Trilogy is just how '90s it is. In some ways, this makes it more enjoyable to return to than it would be if it wasn’t so undeniably a product of its time. Dana Gould, who appears in interviews in the bonus features, is an American comedian who voiced the intrepid Gecko. He did a great job of stuffing the game full of one-liners that now recall the exuberant decade and its all-pervasive, kid-appealing, gross-out edginess.</p>
<figure><a title="Gex Trilogy Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156801/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>One major downside is that this trilogy doesn’t offer alternate soundtracks, since Gould was actually replaced by different comics in the PAL market, including Leslie Phillips and <strong>Red Dwarf</strong>’s Danny John-Jules for the third game. It would have been nice to have had the regional options in this respect. And, since the original games had a single file that contained each region's audio files — meaning it's easily flipped between — we're not sure why the accuracy of the Carbon Engine didn't rise to the occasion.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Gex Trilogy is a happy throwback. The first game is a little clunky and occasionally laborious, but its sequels do better in their 3D expansion of its themes and idea. The main point of appeal is its connection to the period in which they were made. It’s full of comic quirks, zinging dialogue, and visual gags that scream MTV Generation. Across all three entries, the media hook and its tropes — from horror to Christmas to 1930s prohibition gangsters — work well to keep things fresh, fun and engaging.</p>
<p>That said, while there's a simplicity to the games themselves, the yesteryear technology and the sensibilities of many gamers may have moved on, making their baked-in fetch quests trying at times. Gex Trilogy’s value is bumped up by its invention and still very playable design aspects, but whether or not you can pit yourself through them really comes down to how much your nostalgic mileage varies, dude.</p></section>

<figure><a title="Pik-Sen Lim death" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/03392d0c0bc67/pik-sen-lim-death.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bandai Namco</em></figcaption></figure><p>Pik-Sen Lim, the Penang-born British actress who most of us gamers will know immediately as the legendary narrator of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a> series, has passed away at the age of 80.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.malaymail.com/news/showbiz/2025/06/13/malaysian-born-actress-pik-sen-lim-known-for-roles-in-mind-your-language-doctor-who-and-johnny-english-reborn-dies-at-80/180215#google_vignette">the Malay Mail</a> (thanks <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/dark-souls/dark-souls-narrator-and-prolific-actor-pik-sen-lim-has-died/">PC Gamer</a>), the actress, who moved to the UK to pursue a hugely successful stage and screen acting career in 1961, passed away on Monday 9th June. Lim was a big star during the '70s and '80s on both British and Malaysian TV, with her credits including <strong>Dr Who</strong>, <strong>Coronation Street</strong>, <strong>The Bill</strong>, and her most prominent role in the sitcom <strong>Mind Your Language</strong>, which aired in the UK during the late 1970s.</p><p><figure data-videoid="A1xI46KxTIU" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A1xI46KxTIU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1xI46KxTIU"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>822k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A1xI46KxTIU">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>Of course, without Lim, the Souls games just wouldn't feel the same, would they? The opening narration to Dark Souls, in particular, is just one of those video game moments that sticks in your brain forever after. It's delivered with such artistry that it immediately signals a game you're about to get lost in big time. And oh boy, did we.</p>
<p>As a first sample of FromSoftware's world, and the vibe the developer wished to convey, it's hard to imagine anyone could have rocked it as hard as Pik-Sen Lim did. In fact, let's check it out more more time in her honour...</p>

<p>What a performance. Rest in peace.</p>

			<p>Nintendo has announced a new Direct presentation for this week, a Donkey Kong Bananza Direct that'll premiere this&nbsp;<strong>Wednesday, June 18, at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BT</strong>. It'll be a 15-minute-long presentation and will likely feature a bunch of new gameplay clips we've not seen before, ahead of the game's<a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-launches-this-july-on-nintendo-switch-2/"> July 17, 2025</a>, release date.</p>
<p>The news first came through the Nintendo Today app, and is the latest sign that Nintendo will be using the app to deliver its big announcements before turning to <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1934596827900178721">its social media accounts</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Bananza Direct 6.18.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YVUidGTR8xg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>"<em><span>Tune in at 6 a.m. PT on June 18 for a livestreamed</span> Donkey Kong Bananza <span>Direct presentation, featuring roughly 15 minutes of information about the upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 game</span></em><span>," Nintendo said in its announcement.</span></p>
<p>It'll be good to see more of Donkey Kong Bananza on Wednesday, since there's still plenty about this game we don't yet know. <a href="https://wccftech.com/donkey-kong-bananza-hands-on-impressions/">Wccftech's Nathan Birch was able to preview the game</a> more than two months ago now, and at the time, while he didn't love everything about it, the game's core mechanic of being able to destroy the environment and how malleable the world is, makes for strong potential.</p>
<p>"<em>I spent most of my time with Donkey Kong Bananza thinking about the possibilities presented by its mechanics. The tools are certainly there for puzzles that would require you to, say, mould the terrain in specific ways using your fists, explosives, and other tools to reach a goal. There’s a lot of potential here, and it seems likely the demo I played only showed a portion of DK’s full bunch of abilities.</em>"</p>
<p>Hopefully, on Wednesday, we'll see a little more of what's to come in Donkey Kong Bananza.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/two-killer-soulslikes-we-saw-at-summer-game-fest-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Very few Soulslikes land for me, outside of ones developed by FromSoftware themselves. Still, there's always potential for a hit, as was the case with last year's <em>Black Myth: Wukong. </em>For 2025 and beyond, I'm actually optimistic about the future of the genre, especially after seeing a few potential bangers at&nbsp;Summer Game Fest 2025.</p>

<p>I'm talking about&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers.&nbsp;</em>In the case of&nbsp;the latter, I had a chance to play through the opening hour, though it didn't feel nearly enough to fully grasp what it had to offer.&nbsp;For&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II</em>, we were given a presentation that left me optimistic about this exciting sequel.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Code Vein II</em> - Bigger, and With a Motorcycle!</h2>

<p>Darn, this is one I really wanted to get my hands on. Unfortunately, I only have words and hands-<em>off </em>gameplay to go off of here, but let me tell you why I'm so excited for&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>The first&nbsp;<em>Code Vein</em>&nbsp;was probably the first Soulslike -- again, outside of FromSoftware's own games -- to click with me. The slick anime aesthetic and faster pace of combat resonated with me, and when I was speculating what game this might be based on my SGF appointment's vague description, I hoped it was&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II.</em></p>

<p>And here we are, a sequel! Well, kind of. It's a sequel in name, but Bandai Namco also describes it as a reimagining. Expect some familiar elements, but&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II&nbsp;</em>is very much its own game. The lore behind this sequel is actually quite exciting, too.</p>



<p>Essentially, we'll be traveling between past and present timelines with the help of our player's companion, Lou MagMell. Hopping between timelines, 100 years to the past and then back to the present, is a daunting narrative challenge but one I am excited to see the developer tackle.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Players can befriend various legendary Revenants -- essentially, the vampire-like beings from&nbsp;<em>Code Vein --&nbsp;</em>in both past and present. You are, of course, the hero of your own story. <em>Code Vein</em> was known&nbsp;for its robust character creator, so you'll be happy to know it's expanded to be better than ever.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We only got a taste of actual combat in&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II</em>. Footage is fast-paced and more akin to a traditional hack-and-slash action game than a Souls-like, at least at first glance. I doubt it will deviate much from its Soulsy roots, but there's potential for&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II</em>&nbsp;to grow more into its own thing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>One returning mechanic are blood codes, which essentially dictate the class of the player and the weight of its stats. As this is a sequel, no doubt we'll see new Blood Codes in this one. We have some new mechanics called Jails and Formae, both of which essentially boil down to providing more abilities and techniques to utilize during combat.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There's also a motorcycle. This seems to be a focal point in&nbsp;<em>Code Vein II</em>, because the Bandai Namco booth at SGF had a prop motorcycle that was&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;cool. This is used to traverse the world, which will be much bigger this time around. I'm not going to say it's on&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s scale, but having to use a mount in a Soulslike game has me thinking big.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em> - Wuxia Souls</h2>

<p>I also had an hour to play&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>, but darn it all, I wish I had more. One, because it's a mechanically rich Soulslike game, but also because it was quite enjoyable!&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>&nbsp;is, no doubt, one of the least clunky games I've played in the genre, which is a pitfall far too many fall into.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This demo takes place right at the start of&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers.&nbsp;</em>There's some emphasis on story here, and essentially, you're afflicted with an ailment called Feathering. It looks exactly as it sounds, but Wuchang, the eponymous protagonist of this game, uses it to her advantage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Wuchang is extremely capable with all form of weapons, and there were various styles I could try out in this demo. I landed on using the base longsword, as it felt like it catered to my playstyle of slightly heavier, longer weapons wielded with two hands. There are faster and slower styles players can use, of course.</p>

<p>The core mechanic to&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>&nbsp;revolves around Skyborn Might. As I understand it, perfectly dodging attacks and other actions grant you more power, so combat puts an emphasis on player skill. If you like to cheese your bosses, it's probably possible, but I feel like it's not quite that simple in this one.</p>



<p>Our character, Wuchang, has plenty of abilities at her disposal. Charging up your heavy attack and hitting the back of certain enemies stuns them and allows you to pull off a powerful attack. We can also cast spells, so if an enemy is pressuring you, take a step back, cast a spell, and do some decent damage on them.</p>

<p>There are plenty of other mechanics that are at play here, but I was still in the midst of getting these explained to me by the time my demo ended. Still, I made it to the first boss of the demo and defeating them in a thrilling battle. Combat left me very satisfied, so I'm eager to see how far&nbsp;<em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em>&nbsp;can go.&nbsp;</p>

Doing so can <strong>stretch the game’s length to a staggering 150-200 hours</strong>. Yeah, it’s a lot. But there’s more.</p><p>If you want to complete literally everything in <strong><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, you can reach beyond 300 hours of total playtime</strong>. This is obviously a task best reserved for the franchise’s most dedicated fans, as it requires an immense amount of work. But for those looking to truly absorb every morsel of <em>Zelda </em>goodness, there are months of fun to be had here.</p><p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> is available now for Nintendo Switch. A Nintendo Switch 2 upgrade for the game is also available at an additional cost, providing upgraded visuals and performance.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Following the reveal of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-witcher-4/">The Witcher 4</a> tech demo earlier this month, CD Projekt Red has shared why it has decided to focus on developing the game for consoles first, rather than for PC.</p><p>In case you missed it, the State of Unreal showcase offered us the first in-engine look at The Witcher 4 by highlighting the new, explorable region of Kovir, a brand-new look at the game's protagonist, Ciri, while also showing off the many features of Unreal Engine 5, which the game will utilize rather than the studio's proprietary engine.</p><p>It looked beautiful, but what's more impressive is the fact that the tech demo was captured entirely on the base PlayStation 5 at 60fps, with ray tracing.</p><p>Now, in a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OplYN2MMI4Q" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-cd-projekt-is-taking-a-console-first-development-approach-but-with-good-reason" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), CDPR’s VP of technology, Charles Tremblay, has explained that the studio is aiming for a "console-first" development with The Witcher 4 after learning from its mistakes with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OplYN2MMI4Q" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OplYN2MMI4Q" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"We always do PC and we push and then we try to scale down," Tremblay said. "But then we had so many problems in the past that we tried to say, 'This time around we really want to be more console-first development.'"</p><p>Cyberpunk 2077's launch in 2020 was a disaster, particularly for PlayStation and Xbox. While the PS5 and Xbox Series X versions did have their issues, it was the PS4 and Xbox One versions that suffered most. Performance was so bad on the last-gen consoles that, at one point, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-has-been-removed-from-playstation-store-refunds-will-be-issued/1100-6485659/" data-ref-id="1100-6485659">the game was taken down from the PS Store</a> altogether, and refunds were issued.</p><p>Almost five years and a bunch of updates later, Cyberpunk 2077 is now one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-rpgs/2900-5272/" data-ref-id="2900-5272">best RPGs</a> you can play right now, but CDPR has said it doesn't want to make the same mistakes again with The Witcher 4.</p><p>Jakub Knapik, VP and Global Art Director at CDPR, explained that by focusing on the game's development with consoles, it will make "scaling up" to PC easier, as opposed to scaling down for PlayStation and Xbox.</p><p>"We wanted to solve certain foundations," Knapik said. "It’s pretty logical when you think about it, because it’s easier to scale up than down. We knew that once we set up certain foundations both visually and technically, there’s room to scale up. Now, what that means is another question. We’re CDPR: We always like to push PCs to the limit. It’s just a creative process how to really use it."</p><p>However, Tremblay later admitted that releasing The Witcher 4 on Xbox Series S at 60fps "will definitely be extremely challenging" and that the studio is now actively trying to figure it out.</p><p>Despite the "console-first" approach, the VP of technology confirmed that PC players who invest in their hardware won't miss out.</p><p>"In the past, something that’s super important for the group is that if people pay good money for their hardware, then we want them to have what the game can provide for that, not like a simplified experience," he said.</p><p>"So this is something we will definitely explore. The company started as a PC company, and we’ll definitely want to have the best experience for the PC gamer for sure. But it’s too early to say what this will mean for The Witcher 4."</p><p>The Witcher 4 doesn't have a release date just yet, but it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-release-date-is-not-soon-as-dev-discusses-why-it-wont-use-genai/1100-6530369/" data-ref-id="1100-6530369">not expected to launch until 2027</a> at the earliest. The studio is also actively working on multiple other projects, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/" data-ref-id="1100-6526333">Cyberpunk 2</a> and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-everything-we-know-about-the-open-world-remake-of-the-classic-rpg/1100-6528839/" data-ref-id="1100-6528839">Witcher remake</a>.</p>

            <p>Nintendo has announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> direct for later this week.</p>
<p>It'll be taking place on <strong>Wednesday, 18th June at  6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm UK time</strong>. According to the official Nintendo App where it was announced, the Donkey Kong direct will last only 15 minutes.</p>
<p>We've seen little bits of Donkey Kong Bananza here and there over the past few months. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-is-getting-a-new-3d-donkey-kong-platformer">Back in April the game was officially revealed</a>, alongside some gameplay which shows everyone's favourite gorilla punching through the ground and barrelling through the open world.</p>

<p>He's got a new look too, with S<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/super-mario-creator-shigeru-miyamoto-explains-donkey-kongs-recent-makeover">higeru Miyamoto stating that when going back to the drawing board with Donkey Kong the team developers wanted something "more expressive"</a>. Fans eager for the game also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-bananzas-secret-in-game-language-has-already-been-decoded-months-before-launch">cracked the banana-centric language</a> seen in small clips of the game, way ahead of its release.</p>
<p>It goes without saying, but don't expect any other Nintendo games to show up as part of this direct. It's a pure Kong affair. All monkey, all monkey business. But if you're looking for more info on a brand-new game created for the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a>, it sounds like an event worth tuning in for.</p></div>

		<p>The next Nintendo Direct is set to take place this week, Nintendo has announced, with a presentation dedicated to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> exclusive <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> scheduled for Wednesday 18th June at 2PM UK time.</p>
<p>“Tune in on Wednesday, June 18, for a livestreamed Donkey Kong Bananza Direct presentation,” the simple announcement reads in the Nintendo Today app. Adding the event to the in-app calendar also reveals that it will take place at 2PM.</p>


<p>And that’s the full extent of the announcement.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/02/donkey-kong-bananza-revealed-for-nintendo-switch-2-coming-in-july/">Announced back in April for the Switch 2 game and gameplay reveal</a>, Donkey Kong Banaza is the first fully 3D platformer in the DK series since the N64’s Donkey Kong 64, and so the gameplay is understandably rather different to Rare’s 90s classic.&nbsp;There’s a big emphasis on DK’s massively strong, letting him just smash through enemies, smash through walls, and even smash down into the ground…. then use chunks of the ground to smash more stuff around him!</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Bananza Hands On –&nbsp;3D Platforming with a punch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LJIOuYCS414?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We got to go hands on with the game at the Nintendo Switch 2 event in Paris a couple days later, find a game that’s as smash-happy as you would have expected. From my <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2-preview-a-3d-platformer-with-a-lot-of-punch/">Donkey Kong Bananza hands on preview</a>, I said, “If your kids are fans of Hulk smashing his way through earlier Avengers movies, then they’ll probably go bananas for Donkey Kong Bananza. As Nintendo and their partners explore platformers in all their forms, there’s some neat ideas built around the frenzy of punching and adding deformable world to the genre. I look forward to seeing how this can be explored in different ways, to hopefully avoid DK becoming a one punch ape.”</p>

<p>This will be the first big game for the Nintendo Switch 2 following the console’s release at the start of this month. The Switch 2’s debut came alongside a must-have game in the form of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/mario-kart-world-review/">Mario Kart World</a>, but the lineup has been rather thin outside of this. DK will lead the way for what will hopefully be a strong second half to the year, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/28/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-confirmed-for-october/">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/metroid-prime-4-beyond-switch-2-preview-worth-the-wait/">Metroid Prime 4</a> and more on the way.</p>

<p>We didn't start the fire</p>

<p>Those looking for something to relax and unwind to after a tough day of Knockout Tour might want to check out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/into_the_emberlands">Into The Emberlands</a>, a "cosy roguelike" from developer Tiny Roar (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/xel">XEL</a>) and publisher Daedalic Entertainment that will be arriving on the Switch eShop on <strong>2nd July</strong>.</p>
<p>This one launched on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2856370/Into_the_Emberlands/">Steam</a> earlier this year and, to put it simply, it looks <em>super</em> cute. Into the Emberlands will see you play as a Lightbearer tasked with reuniting the titular world after it became swamped in a malicious miasma. To do so, you'll have to journey out into the fog with your Ember Lantern, collecting resources and rehoming the adorable little Knacks (the species you'll see in the above trailer) you'll encounter along the way.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>822k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>You only have a limited number of steps per day — room for a little more <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/blue_prince">Blue Prince</a>, anyone? — and the gameplay loop will restart if you run out, with your previous Lightbearer setting up camp to be found on a future run.</p>
<p>It's combat-free, all about helping others, and colourful enough that we can imagine it being an all-round wholesome experience — and we could all do with a little of that every now and then.</p>
<p>You'll find a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots below from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Into-The-Emberlands-2848916.html">eShop listing</a>:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/future-clair-obscur-expedition-33-updates-new-content<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sandfall Interactive, the studio behind the hugely successful turn-based RPG&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, has confirmed it's actively considering "new content" for future updates, as well as various other improvements.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/expedition33.bsky.social/post/3lrpzry3pnk2f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on Bluesky, Sandfall says it's "currently exploring a wide range of future improvements" for&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>updates, including "accessibility features", "new content", and "all sorts of bits and bobs".</p>

<p>One of the major improvements Sandfall says it's thinking about involves expanding localization options for the game, allowing folks to play it in more languages. However, the studio <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/expedition33.bsky.social/post/3lrpzry3ujs2f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">cautions</a> that it doesn't have "specific timelines or confirmed languages" yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-updates-new-content-lune.jpg?itok=8xZg97HD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-updates-new-content-lune.jpg?itok=Zd-eqjMq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>could be getting new content in future updates.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>, it's a turn-based RPG that serves as the debut title from French studio Sandfall Interactive (and once you've played the game, you'll understand why its developer needed to be French).</p>

<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>takes place in a world ravaged by a monstrous figure known as the Paintress, who paints a new number each year. Everyone of that age dies at the conclusion of the year, so humanity sends out "expeditions" to try and defeat the Paintress before the next number is painted.</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise, the game appears to take several cues from classic turn-based RPGs in franchises like&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest</em>, although it has a much darker and more bleak tone than the latter.</p>

<p>It's also got a parry system, being a modern game, and so you'll have to factor in parrying or dodging enemies' attacks as well as strategizing during turn-based combat.</p>




<p>Since launch,&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>has proven immensely popular. It <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-500k" rel="nofollow">sold 500,000 copies</a> within just 24 hours, going on to reach <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">two million in under two weeks</a>. At last count, it had hit the satisfying total of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-3-3m-33-days" rel="nofollow">3.3 million sales in 33 days</a>.</p>

Whilst <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-cards-where-to-buy-in-stock">MTG: Final Fantasy</a> has finally dropped, there's still plenty of buying options for sealed product from big box retailers and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-pokemon-cards-to-buy-tcgplayer-mayhem-sale">TCG Player</a>. I've also found some cracking bargains on <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wRRkq?object_uuid=dd8f7c62-50dd-458a-9254-ce965ea069b7&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">SSDs</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QObbV2?object_uuid=dd8f7c62-50dd-458a-9254-ce965ea069b7&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">portable storage</a>, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7OO7y?object_uuid=dd8f7c62-50dd-458a-9254-ce965ea069b7&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DDR5 RAM</a>, games and more. Let's get into it:</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Pokémon Restock Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Checking these prices against TCG Player secondary market values, a lot of these products aren't far off the mark. Make no mistake, they're still way off MSRP, but finding Pokémon products on shelves that haven't been marked up past the point of anyone caring is a positive. Still refusing to pay over MSRP for new sets? Well played, I'm proud of you. Here's some single card highlights for you to shuffle through instead. Spoiler, there's plenty of deals to be had.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Destined Rivals Singles Are On The Rise (Again)</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's hard to stick a pin on Destined Rivals single card values right now, and the dips in value seem to match the little bits of stock distributors release to stores. Looking at the tracking charts for each of these cards, we can see mostly plummets from day one, then either upticks or cards for sale that exceed the original value at launch. It's crazy, but we now know how low these cards can go. Sure there's always attempts at market manipulation, but I wouldn't buy any cards on the rise right now.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Journey Together Singles Are Settling In Value</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Having keeping an eye on the market since launch, Journey Together singles are now more affordable than ever. Many of these cards have stabilized, with the main chase card - Lillie's Clefairy ex SIR, settling at around $150. If you were planning on getting into Journey Together at some point to collect the illustration rares and SIRs, now is a great time to jump in.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Epic Primastic Evolutions Cards That Aren't Umbreon</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's so many great cards in this set that aren't Umbreon ex SIR, all of which are a damn sight more affordable right now. Because I hate anything popular (Yes, I know I'm a massive fan of the most popular IP on earth), my two favorite cards are Dragapult ex SIR and Roaring Moon ex SIR. The former is now down to a respectable $125, with the latter holding it's value well since launch, floating towards the $200 mark. These prices and below are great deals for these cards, so don't miss out.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Discounted MTG: Aetherdrift Boxes </h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Magic: The Gathering discounts at a big box store like Amazon? Surely not! Aetherdrift turned the MTG meta on its head introducing vehicles and other unique mechanics. This is a great time to jump into it and rip open some packs, it's deffinately one of the most "out there"  twists on the ever popular trading card game.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">Where To Buy MTG: Final Fantasy</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's finally here, Magic the Gathering: Final Fantasy is out in the wild. If you got a preorder for MSRP, well played, but many TCG and Final Fantasy fans missed out.

It’s set for this Wednesday, June 18, at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm UK time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The announcement was made first in the Nintendo Today! app, where it was revealed the Direct will last 15 minutes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now the launch of the Switch 2 itself is out the door, Nintendo can turn its attention to its upcoming exclusives, and next on the list is Donkey Kong Bananza, which comes out July 17. Based on Nintendo's announcement, this Direct focuses entirely on the 3D platforming adventure, which means we won't see any other upcoming Switch 2 games — announced or otherwise —during the livestream.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Donkey Kong himself has a fresh new look for Bananza following his redesign in the blockbuster The Super Mario Bros. Movie. In a recent interview with IGN, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-nintendo-redesigned-donkey-kong-according-to-shigeru-miyamoto">Nintendo developer legend Shigeru Miyamoto explained why the great ape got a makeover in the first place</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So when it comes to character creation and working with characters, I still take an active role in that," he replied. "And looking back to the first generation Donkey Kong Country, we worked with Rare to create Donkey Kong Country.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When we were talking about trying to create new versions, evolving Donkey Kong, we created the game called Jungle Beat. We worked together with the team that made 3D Mario. With the technology that was available at the time, we were able to make Donkey Kong more expressive. And going back to the design that Rare came up with, we reevaluated; what can we do with the design to make it more expressive? And then when it comes to the movie, we decided to move forward with this new generation Donkey Kong design."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out IGN's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-first-hands-on-preview">Donkey Kong Bananza hands-on preview</a> for more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bananza's release will help flesh out the Switch 2's relatively light exclusive games list, which includes launch titles <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Welcome Tour</a>.
