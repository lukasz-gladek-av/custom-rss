		<p>Already one of the most celebrated RPGs of recent years, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/sea-of-stars">Sea of Stars</a> is set to get a big new DLC adventure for free next month. Sea of Stars: Throes of the Watchmaker will arrive on 20th May as a free upgrade across all platforms – PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sea of Stars: Throes of the Watchmaker DLC | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgFi2jXwzVI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Throes of the Watchmaker expands on the inventor known as the Watchmaker that you meet through the main adventure of Sea of Stars. Architect of the Clockwork Castle and the creator of the tabletop game Wheels within this world, he’s now gone and created a miniature clockwork world known as Horloge, which is being threatened by a cursed carnival. So you have to go and get all Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and miniaturise Zale and Valere to delve into this world and put an end to this evil plight.</p>
<p>Through the expansion, Zale and Valere will have a self-contained progression built around completely new classes, skills and combos. Zale will become a skilful juggler, while Valere transforms into an acrobat, fighting alongside new playable party member, the last-wielding sharpshooter Artificer.</p>
<p>As well as having new areas, puzzles and enemies, Sabotage has been able to lavish Throes of the Watchmaker with a cinematics budget equivalent to the main game, so expect some super pretty cutscenes!</p>

<p>Not only that, but the soundtrack will also feature more original songs by guest composer Yasunori Mitsuda (Chrono Trigger), working alongside lead composer Eric W. Brown.</p>
<p>One of the best indie games of 2023, we had plenty of praise for the homage to classic JRPGs. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/31/sea-of-stars-review-a-love-letter-to-jrpgs-of-the-past/">Sea of Stars review</a>, Nic said, “Sea of Stars has clearly been made by people with a deep and abiding love of JRPGs. That level of passion is hard to mimic, and the result is a heavily playable game with morish visuals, a cracking story and deeply considered level design. However, while it is very good, it isn’t quite perfect. Combat needed to be deeper (or at least escapable) and while the dynamism was a great touch, it wasn’t enough to carry it all the way through to the end.”</p>
<p>The game has been well supported over the past year and a half with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/30/sea-of-stars-free-dawn-of-equinox-update-adds-local-co-op-and-more/">major updates</a> that have overhauled combat, revamped the prologue and added local co-op play.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/valves-invite-only-deadlock-has-an-even-more-exclusive-top-secret-hush-hush-build<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Everyone's now heard of Deadlock, the in-development MOBA from Half-Life maker Valve. Maybe you're even playing it, as part of the game's still-invite-only alpha playtest.
</p>
<p>
But are you playing the top-secret even more invite-only version? Probably not. (Although if you are, feel free to get in touch.)
</p>
<p>
The existence of an even more elusive version of Deadlock was spilled publicly last night when a top Deadlock streamer appeared to load up the wrong version of the game, beaming Valve's more-exclusive version to the world. 
</p>
<p>
This version of Deadlock includes a much larger character roster, as well as updated designs for some of the game's current heroes. New faces include the bellhop-styled Doorman, bespectacled Bookworm, and gothic Vampirebat, among many others. 
</p>
<p>
The streamer in question quickly shut down the game and deleted its archived version - but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1kclj5p/streamer_accidentally_leaks_hero_roster_of_a_more/">not before the internet inevitably took screenshots</a>.
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1kclj5p/streamer_accidentally_leaks_hero_roster_of_a_more/">Streamer accidentally leaks hero roster of a more "secret" private Deadlock pre-alpha playtest build</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/atahutahatena/">u/atahutahatena</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>
Deathlock has been in early playtesting now for over a year, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/images-leak-of-valves-next-game-and-its-an-overwatch-style-hero-shooter">leaks happening pretty much ever since</a>. Valve attempted to keep the game a secret for as long as possible, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-finally-admits-deadlock-exists">ultimately dropped its confidentiality requirement last August</a>, when a Steam page for the game finally appeared. 
</p>
<p>
Since then, though, Valve has simply kept working on Deadlock (and seemingly multiple versions) in the background, keeping the game invite-only. When will it publicly launch? There's still no word.
</p>
<p>
Matt Cox previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deadlocks-biggest-update-yet-marks-a-threshold-moment-nows-the-time-to-grab-yourself-an-invite">checked out Deathlock for Eurogamer</a> back in February this year, and noted how a recent update felt "like a huge leap towards Deadlock's full release, but there's still plenty of time to go, as Valve makes a great game even greater".

            <p>The surprise release of Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered hasn't impacted the sales of French JRPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, its publisher has said.</p>
<p>Sandfall Interactive's game was released last week from publisher Kepler and with support from Xbox, but some feared any success would be overshadowed by the Oblivion release that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">leaked ahead of time</a>.</p>
<p>However, Kepler's senior portfolio director Matt Handrahan has drawn a distinction between the two games, adding "proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all".</p>

<figcaption>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Review: Outstanding Artwork And Glorious Combat<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPbW6NcJ0P4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>"We always knew that Expedition 33 had a very specific identity," Handrahan told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/expedition-33-publisher-elder-scrolls">The Game Business</a>. "When I was in the press, I saw the Western-style RPG and the Japanese-style RPG as having quite different appeals and audiences. I knew plenty of people that would play an Elder Scrolls game that wouldn't necessarily play Final Fantasy and vice versa.</p>
<p>"Also, by the time that we rolled around, we had momentum of our own and we felt pretty confident that we could stand beside it. I think there were other aspects, like the price point we were at and the inclusion in Game Pass… so we knew we would have a lot of interest around the game. We were confident in that. And it went as well as it possibly could have done in our eyes. And, actually, proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all. In many ways, I think it just drew attention to quality RPGs that week and everybody was thinking and talking about the genre."</p>
<p>According to data from Ampere, there's a 35 percent crossover between the two RPGs. On Xbox in particular - the number one platform for both games - 55 percent of Clair Obscur players also played Oblivion. Both games were available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.</p>
<p>This crossover percentage drops to 22 percent for Steam players, and 16 percent on PS5. However, average playtime on Xbox has been lower - likely due to players dipping in on Game Pass.</p>

</figure>
<p>Handrahan revealed Kepler didn't sign Clair Obscur straight away, but could see the potential of its battle system.</p>
<p>"My CEO, Alexis Garavaryan, had the most contact with them at [an early stage]," said Handrahan. "He saw the potential in it, but thought there were still some parts that needed a little bit more work. So Sandfall went away, did that work, came back, and on the second time of seeing it, our response was extremely, extremely quick."</p>
<p>When another publisher started looking at the game, Kepler had already snapped it up. "We were straight on top of it," said Handrahan. "If you find a game you like, if you find a game that excites you, you really have to act quickly. There's a lot of good games, but the really remarkable stuff comes along relatively rarely."</p>
<p>He also spoke to the game's promotion during Xbox's Summer Showcase alongside the likes of AAA first party games Gears of War and Fable. "It helped us to kind of claim this AA territory in a much more confident way," said Handrahan. "Because it's a vague space that exists somewhere between small games and extremely big games, and there's a lot of ground that that covers."</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 hit 500,000 sales in just one day, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-hits-500k-sales-in-one-day">quickly rose to a million copies in three days</a>.</p>
<p>"Outstanding artwork and glorious combat bring Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's bold, painterly world to life," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Eurogamer's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Earlier this week, Moon Studios released the big Breach update for its game No Rest for the Wicked. In early access since May 2024, the action role-playing game received a lot of new content, starting with brand-new quests and new high-quality cinematic animation delivered through 18 new story scenes. The world size has almost doubled thanks to the addition of two new areas, Lowland Meadows and Marin Woods, which also include a dangerous new Blight hazard that players must beware of. There are also two new settlements, Hunter's Vale and Marin Village, and several dark caves to explore.</p>
<p>The Breach update has introduced a new endgame Plague System as well, while the Food and Hunger mechanic has been reworked and Status Effects have been overhauled. Of course, a game like this one is heavily focused on loot. No Rest for the Wicked now offers over 150 weapon options, an increase of 50 compared to launch. This includes new Gauntlet and Wand types. There are also multiple new armor sets and a rework for the Shield. Throughout the campaign, players will encounter several new boss fights (and 3 updated ones), 9 new Plague bosses, 2 new enemy factions, and 9 new critters. Those who really seek a challenge when playing the game can now activate the Hardcore mode, which enables permadeath.</p>
<p>The audio was improved with new music by Gareth Coker and new voice-overs. Moon Studios also touts extensive balance changes, quality-of-life improvements (updated item previews, tooltips), and noticeable performance improvements, including NVIDIA DLSS 4 support, memory usage optimizations, quicker load times, and improved physics. Lastly, the patch features 'hundreds of bug fixes'.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this update hasn't been well-received by No Rest for the Wicked players. Recent user reviews on Steam are 'Mostly Negative' due to a very low 36% score. Hopefully, the developers can get to the bottom of the community's feedback. As noted <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-hands-on-extreme-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our hands-on report from May 2024</a>, the game's core does have a lot of potential.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Austrian developer is now fully on its own, <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-gets-new-major-update-moon-studios-purchases-publishing-rights-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having purchased the license back from publisher Private Division</a>.</p>

              <section>

                <p>After a fairly short spring season, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> is trying something new with battle royale: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnites-star-wars-season-galactic-battle/2900-6518/" data-ref-id="2900-6518">a shortened, five-week season that's all about Star Wars</a>. Unfortunately for us, there's just one little thing getting in the way of us diving into all the new stuff: Fortnite servers are down for maintenance while Epic deploys the new season update. Below, you'll find a rundown on when Fortnite servers should be back online.</p><p>Despite the short length, Season 2 has been pretty eventful, introducing the amazing new Kneecapper and Rocket Drill items, and also adding Sabrina Carpenter as the latest Festival headliner just a few weeks ago. But now Season 2 is done, and the Kneecapper is a thing of the past--but you still can't play just yet. There are many fun activities you can try while you wait, like going outside or sleeping, but that's not what we're here to talk about right now. Let's go ahead and cut to the chase.</p><h2>Fortnite's Star Wars Season start time</h2><p>When Fortnite goes offline to deploy a patch, it usually takes about three or four hours, but a new season launch is much more of a thing than your average update is. For a new season, Fortnite typically goes offline for four hours at minimum, and often longer. Sometimes <em>much </em>longer--Fortnite was offline for 18 hours ahead of the start of Chapter 5 Season 2 last year. If all goes well, you can expect Fortnite to come back online, at the earliest, around 3 AM PT/6 AM ET.</p><p>When Fortnite's servers do return to action, the Star Wars takeover will begin immediately in both battle royale and Lego Fortnite. There will be a new battle pass full of Star Wars skins, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-may-the-4th-brings-star-wars-pass-for-lego-fortnite-and-new-skins-instruments-cars/2900-5337/" data-ref-id="2900-5337">new Lego Pass full of Star Wars</a> builds and a Captain Phasma skin, and very likely some new stuff in the shop as well. For those who don't observe May the 4th, other Epic-made modes like Reload and OG will continue doing their own thing, without any injections of Star Wars content aside from skins that other players are wearing.</p><p>Epic started the hype train much earlier than it normally does for a new season of Fortnite, revealing the Galactic Battle season two weeks ahead of launch at Star Wars Celebration in Japan. Epic typically doesn't reveal a new season until the week of launch. So while you're waiting for downtime to end, you can read up on what to expect in the new season, from the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-map-changes-in-star-wars-galactic-battle-season/2900-6519/" data-ref-id="2900-6519">map changes</a>, to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-new-weapons-in-star-wars-galactic-battle-all-guns-and-loot/2900-6520/" data-ref-id="2900-6520">new weapons</a>, to the battle pass lineup, and everything else we already know.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-keeps-its-fans-in-the-loop-with-overwatch-2-stadium-summer-roadmap<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard Entertainment has unveiled its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/overwatch-2"><u>Overwatch 2</u></a> Stadium roadmap for 2025, teasing some of the heroes and features it plans to add in Season 17, Season 18, Season 19, and beyond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team behind the pioneering hero shooter dived into the details of its new mode’s past, present, and future with <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24198087/directors-take-past-present-and-future-of-stadium" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Director’s Take blog post</a> from game director Aaron Keller. It comes with a surprise summer roadmap now that the mode has been available for a little longer than a week, while also clarifying how the mode got its start and how it’s performed so far.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Stadium Gets 7 New Heroes This Summer</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Stadium rollout will press forward when new Damage hero Freja joins its limited roster with a mid-season patch for Season 16, but it’s Season 17 in June that will really kick things up a notch. Junkrat, Sigma, and Zenyatta will be added to the strategic multiplayer mode’s list of playable heroes at this time, bringing along the Esperança Push map and Samoa Control map with them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard will also use this time to further flesh out how Stadium works by adding in things like Unranked Crossplay, new all-star rewards, custom games, additional example builds, and an option to save and share builds. It’s unclear if all heroes and features will arrive at the start of Season 17 or if they will be released throughout the season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Season 18 sends in Overwatch’s gorilla icon, Winston, as a playable character, with Sojourn and Brigitte set to join, too. Route 66 and London maps will also join the pool at this time, as will a Payload Race game mode, which comes with two new maps, a Stadium trials feature, and, finally, the freedom to Endorse your teammates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard’s transparency regarding Stadium’s development comes with the assurance that “multiple new heroes,” both from Overwatch 2’s existing roster and characters that have yet to be revealed, will be added to the mode every season. For Season 19 and beyond, a new China map is on the way, with a Draft Mode feature, consumables, item system tweaks, and more also in the works.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/01/ow2-2025-stadium-roadmap-1920x1080-sa04-1746118213808.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Overwatch 2 Stadium summer 2025 roadmap. Image courtesy of Blizzard Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><h2 data-cy="title2">How has Stadium Performed so Far?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Overwatch 2 team also shared Stadium stats that reveal how players have decided to spend their time with Blizzard’s new mode. It’s currently “eclipsing” Quick Play and Competitive, making it Overwatch 2’s most played mode with 2.3 million matches played across 7.8 million hours during launch week alone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It secures the lengthy game mode’s stats at more than double what was seen with Overwatch Classic’s launch week. Other interesting stats crown Lucio as both the hero with the highest win rate and the lowest pick rate, while players have managed to spend 900 billion Stadium Cash when choosing 206 million items for their builds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keller’s Director’s Take touches on a few important details related to the development of Stadium, too. One important note saw the game director confirming the mode has been in development before Overwatch 2 launched. Though the team has touched on this timeline in the past, his comment should help squash prevailing fan theories that Stadium was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-dev-blizzard-welcomes-marvel-rivals-competition-says-its-never-faced-another-game-so-similar-to-the-one-weve-created"><u>born out of Blizzard’s desire to compete with Marvel Rivals</u></a>, which launched December 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keller says Blizzard will keep up the communication going forward, promising to release more insight into Stadium next week with an additional Director’s take. Meanwhile, he also confirms that, while Stadium has entered the discussion as a massively popular addition to Overwatch 2, Blizzard remains committed to maintaining other core experiences such as standard Quick Play and Competitive options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Before signing off, I'd like to reiterate the team’s commitment to the Core modes of Overwatch," Keller clarified. "We’re still pouring as much time, energy and passion into these as we always have. Stadium isn't competing for those resources: it’s giving us more opportunities to deliver Overwatch in a new, exciting way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We can't wait for you to see what's coming there, especially Season 18. It's going to be a banger! Have fun with Stadium and, as always, let’s make a great game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overwatch 2 brought Stadium to players when Season 16 launched last week. It’s part of Blizzard’s ongoing initiative to reinvigorate its player base, which began with an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reveals-radical-overhaul-of-overwatch-2-including-return-of-loot-boxes-perks-and-third-person-mode"><u>all-encompassing Spotlight presentation</u></a> in February. It’s led to the return of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/some-overwatch-fans-are-thrilled-loot-boxes-are-coming-back-some-not-so-much"><u>loot boxes</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-becoming-the-worst-user-reviewed-game-ever-on-steam-overwatch-2s-recent-reviews-jump-to-mixed"><u>an improved Steam rating</u></a> as players celebrate <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-years-of-struggle-blizzard-has-found-itself-in-uncharted-territory-overwatch-players-are-having-fun-again"><u>what some feel is the best Overwatch experience fans have seen in years</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait for more udpates, you can check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/overwatch-2/Overwatch_2_Stadium_Details">our guide to learn more about how Stadium works</a>.

This set is an intricate recreation of the Batmobile from the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1996/11/02/batman-forever-review">1995 film Batman Forever</a>, starring Val Kilmer as Batman/ Bruce Wayne, Tommy Lee Jones as Two-Face, and Jim Carrey famously (infamously?) as the Riddler. </p><p id="batman-forever-batmobile"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Batman Forever Batmobile">Preorder the LEGO Batman Forever Batmobile</h2></p><div catalogid="8b6a1fc4-a111-4510-9d37-c281936bebb3" id="219980"><div id="219980" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>LEGO Batman Forever Batmobile</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The set itself is a faithful to-scale model of the on-screen Batmobile, complete with the blue neon lights and rims and other features.

It also includes a Batman Forever display stand for the new Batsuit mini-figure.

The news comes roughly 15 months after The Lost Crown's release in January 2024, and Ubisoft appears to be teasing a bright future for the series. </p><p dir="ltr">"Well over 2M players by now," Ubisoft said on the Prince of Persia's official X account." You’ve revived the legend. The Prince is back, and believe us--he's just warming up."</p><p dir="ltr">What Ubisoft has in store for The Prince of Persia is anyone's guess, though. The company disbanded The Lost Crown's development team in October 2024 on account of lower-than-forecasted sales, though those who worked on the game were shuffled around to different parts of Ubisoft and not laid off. It's worth noting that 2 million players isn't the same as 2 million sales. The Lost Crown was available on Ubisoft+, Ubisoft's subscription service, and has also been part of the PS Plus Extra and Premium. </p><p dir="ltr">The Lost Crown released to widespread praise from critics, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review-crowning-achievement/1900-6418167/">GameSpot's Steve Watts</a>, who called it "so confident and impeccably crafted that this should simply be the identity of Prince of Persia for the foreseeable future." Ubisoft reportedly rejected Ideas for a Lost Crown sequel prior to breaking up the development team, though the company never confirmed whether that was true.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time/">The Prince of Persia: Sands of Time</a> remake remains in development, apparently on track for release sometime in 2026. Ubisoft first announced the project in 2020, though it was delayed several times, including an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-delayed-indefinitely/1100-6487180/">"indefinite delay" in 2021</a>, and restarted development completely in 2023. It re-entered full production in June 2024, though Ubisoft has said nothing about the project since.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-team-says-stadium-mode-is-very-popular-outlines-future-roadmap/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Blizzard <a href="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1918062881930711315" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> an updated Overwatch 2 roadmap when it comes to the new Stadium Mode. According to the studio, this is currently the most played game mode by far, eclipsing Competitive and Quick Play modes. There were 2.3 million matches played across 7.8 million hours of Stadium during the mode's launch week, and that's apparently more than twice as much as the previous most popular game mode's launch week (when OW Classic was added to Overwatch 2). In the mode's first week, 900 billion in Stadium cash were collectively earned, and 206 million items were chosen by players during rounds. Ironically, the most successful and yet also the least popular hero was Lucio.</p>
<p>Given the strong interest expressed by fans, Blizzard also took a step back to reveal its development history. Stadium was initially set up as an eight-team tournament that should have been as varied as possible. Each round, players would choose from random upgrades to use in PvP Team Deathmatch or PvE against the AI, losing health if they lost the round. However, it was challenging to develop a coherent strategy or build to counter opponents when decisions were made at random. Now, Blizzard still wants there to be variety from match to match, but it is no longer the top priority. The goal has shifted towards delivering a balanced and competitive mode, while at the same time allowing players to create epic builds through strategic decisions based on the performance and hero combinations of everyone in the match.</p>
<p>Stadium mode will have its builds and Hero balance tweaked in an upcoming mid-season balance patch after Blizzard has collected all the data and feedback. When it comes to new content, the latest hero (Freya) will also be the next to be available in the mode when the midseason patch goes live in Overwatch 2. That's just the beginning, as Blizzard wants to release new heroes on a regular basis to Stadium. Season 17, slated to debut next month, will introduce Sigma, Junkrat, and Zenyatta, in addition to the new maps of Esperanca and Samoa, Custom Games, the ability to save and share builds, and crossplay. It's important to note that this is still a Competitive game mode, which means PC and console players will be in separate groups. However, the developers are looking into coming up with an Unranked mode which could bring everyone together without harming the competitive scene.</p>
<p>Season 18 will land in August, adding Winston, Sojourn, and Brigitte as new Stadium heroes. Players will also find two new maps (New Route 66 and London), the new game mode Payload race, new All-Star Rewards, and the Stadium Trials feature. From Season 19 onward, Overwatch 2 will get a New China map, new heroes with every season, Draft Mode, new consumables, and item upgrades. With Payload race, Blizzard is also adding a new mechanic called Quests, where players will select a random quest that will provide rewards when completed.</p>
<p>Just a couple of months ago, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-adds-in-match-perks-the-biggest-gameplay-innovation-since-overwatch-launched-in-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experimented</a> with adding in-game perks. It seems like they're finally willing to shake up the game's core after a <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzards-steam-debut-stumbles-hard-as-overwatch-2-becomes-worst-reviewed-title/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly underwhelming launch</a>.</p>

I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere. So I can only imagine how absolutely, overwhelmingly irritating it could be on a planet like Arrakis, where a sandstorm could quite easily kill you. Or, I suppose I don't have to imagine, as that's something you can actually experience in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a>. This is a video we're talking about here though, meaning there are fixes for problems like these. Namely, base building, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/funcom">Funcom</a> showed off in a new video of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game yesterday.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
When you start out, your base probably won't be all that fancy or useful. If you've got nowhere to store your bike, it'll likely be wrecked by the time the storm's died down. Over time you can build up bigger and stronger bases, which you can do so either by yourself or with friends (or enemies, if you swing that way). You can then align yourself with one of the two main houses, Atreides or Harkonnen, allowing you to build unique structures depending on who you picked.

<p>
On top of that, you can build and craft your own vehicles. I generally loathe when games let me do this as they can often be a bit too complicated, but judging from the trailer it almost looks like putting bits of Lego together, so I'm down to clown. If you've built your base up enough, you can put up shields so it doesn't get damaged, but you'll literally be taxed for this. At least you'll have a garage to store your cool car.
</p>
<p>
Any of your creations and bases can be turned into blueprints that you can share with or even sell to other players. Once they have the blueprint, they can just make the thing instantly. I'm assuming you'll still need some resources to do this, but it looks cool! Kind of reminds me of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's Autobuild feature, albeit a bit more social.
</p>
<p>
As a reminder, if you looked at your calendar today and thought "gee whizz, May's the month I get to play Dune: Awakening", think again, as last month the game caught a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/may-is-no-longer-the-month-of-spice-as-dune-awakening-catches-a-three-week-long-delay">three week delay</a>. That means you'll be complaining about all that sand on June 10th. At least it'll be better sand than it would have been in May!

                <p>Blizzard has revealed the roadmap for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-2-stadium-mode-is-excellent-but-makes-an-awful-first-impression/1100-6531214/" data-ref-id="1100-6531214">Overwatch 2 Stadium</a>, just a few weeks after the new mode's launch. The roadmap includes information about heroes being added to the Stadium roster, new maps and modes within Stadium, and some stats from players' time with the mode already.</p><p dir="ltr">The newest damage hero Freja will be added to Stadium's limited roster as part of the midseason update for the current season, which Blizzard said is expected to launch on May 20. That will be followed by Season 17 in June, which will see the addition of Sigma, Junkrat, and Zenyatta to the roster. The Stadium roster started with only 17 heroes, as the new mode feature items and powers that you can use to make a build in the mode. These require additional balancing, so Blizzard is slowly adding the full Overwatch roster to the mode. That update will also include two more maps, Esperanca and Samoa, along with the ability to save custom builds and share them. Season 17 will also include cross-play, which hasn't been available in the mode since console and PC players don't share competitive lobbies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4486083-ow2stadiumupdate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486083" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4486083-ow2stadiumupdate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486083"></a><figcaption>Freja will be the next hero to join the Stadium roster.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4486083-ow2stadiumupdate.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Season 18 kicks off in August with Winston, Sojourn, and Brigitte joining the roster, along with a new game mode, Payload Race. Payload Race will come with two Payload maps, Route 66 and London, although Blizzard didn't share any details on how the mode will differ from regular payload matches. The roadmap stops at Season 19, simply stating that more maps and heroes will continue to be added to the mode, along with new items.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard also shared that Stadium is currently the most popular mode in Overwatch 2, "eclipsing" Quick Play and Competitive, the two main modes. The mode saw 2.3 million matches played in 7.8 million hours, which is more than twice the amount Overwatch Classic saw when it launched, the previous most popular new mode. Blizzard also shared that Lucio is both the hero with the highest win percentage and the lowest pick rate.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fantasy-ttrpg-defy-gods-brings-duplicitous-deities-to-kickstarter<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new fantasy TTRPG campaign, <em>Defy The Gods</em>, created by Chris Sellers, has hit Kickstarter. Players can play as characters vying for power and romance and create the cast of gods conspiring against them.</p>

<h2>The <em>Defy The Gods</em> TTRPG Campaign</h2>

<p>According to the campaign page, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hecticelectron/defy-the-gods/description" rel="nofollow"><em>Defy The Gods</em></a>&nbsp; is a sword and sorcery Powered By The Apocalypse TTRPG packed with passionate romance, cursed power, and bold adventure. Its inspirations include <em>Conan</em>, <em>Clash of the Titans</em>, and <em>Princess Mononoke</em>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/defy-the-gods-animal-artwork.jpg?itok=F8qMNEw1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/defy-the-gods-animal-artwork.jpg?itok=mkZztUuA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game is set in a fantasy version of ancient Mesopotamia, one you build at the table. its ancient cities, its pantheon of gods, its untamed wilds, its fate in the Underworld, all are made at the table.</p>

<p>In addition, Defy The Gods, is a game about queer love. It is a game of universal visceral attraction. A game where players can win anyone's romantic interest. Alternatively, you can use that attraction to your benefit, using that attraction to distract or thwart them. In this sense, it is similar to another story of queer love, <em>Thirsty Sword Lesbians</em>.</p>

<p>This queer theming is key to the intended experience of <em>Defy The Gods</em>. This world's pantheon of Gods hates you, and the rulers of the City wish to push your character to the margins. As impressive as your characters are, they will struggle against the forces conspiring against you. Simply living a free life in this context is defiance.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/defy-the-gods-city-artwork.jpg?itok=gSsE11Jk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/defy-the-gods-city-artwork.jpg?itok=Pg_I4mRH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In fact, players are given the chance to introduce those complications to their characters through World Scenes. In between adventures, players take on the role of World Forces. These can be City officials or even the gods themselves. In these scenes, players can get the Game Master's imagination rolling with where they want the story to go in these scenes.</p>

<p>The pledge tiers for Defy The Gods are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>PDF + POD Edition for $20:</strong> A PDF of the Core Rulebook and a code to print-on-demand an at-cost physical copy of the Core Rulebook.</li>
	<li><strong>Standard Hardcover + PDF for $40:</strong> A 6x9 hardcover copy of the core rulebook and everything in the PDF + POD tier.</li>
	<li><strong>Special Edition Hardcover + PDF for $80:</strong> A special edition Core Rulebook with alternate art by Thalie Shelen, and everything from the PDF + POD tier.</li>
	<li><strong>Daring Rogue Bundle for $90:&nbsp;</strong> Everything from the Standard Hardcover + PDF tier, two cuneiform dice, four sorcery dice, four art postcards, and an enamel pin.</li>
	<li><strong>Burning Hearts Bundle for $140:</strong> Everything from the Special Edition Hardcover + PDF tier, two cuneiform dice, four sorcery dice, two unique enamel pins, and four art postcards.</li>
	<li><strong>Big Bundle of Doom for $250:</strong> Everything from the Burning Hearts Bundle, the chance to create a unique character, and joining a three-session game of <em>Defy The Gods</em> GM'd by the creator.</li>
</ul><p>It must be noted that, likely in response to the turbulent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ttrpg-books-might-be-exempt-from-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">trade tariffs</a>, shipping costs for the game will billed separately for backers via the pledge manager.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the campaign for <em>Defy The Gods</em> has raised $11,757, which is barely one-quarter of its initial funding goal of $47,000. The campaign concludes May 29.</p>

		<p>The Age of Bhaarat has been revealed by Tara Gaming Ltd, an Indian gaming studio that is aiming to bring Indian tales to the AAA gaming space. It is a studio comprised of some heavy hitters including Nouredine Abboud, the Founder who has previously worked on Ghost Recon, author of the Shiva Trilogy &amp; Ram Chandra series Amish Tripathi, Studio Manager Siddarth Singh, and legendary Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Age of Bhaarat: Announcement trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ec0IJ6Z0vgo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Age of Bhaarat takes us to Ancient India and it is a world filled with legends, myths, and monsters. What we know is that players take on the role of a Forest Guardian of Anandpur and they must defend Bhaarat, which is another name for India, from the invasion of the Rakshasa demons. Players will have access to traditional Indian weapons, artifacts, a grapple hook to navigate, and the mystical powers that are imbued within the forest. The landscapes of The Age of Bhaarat are taken from Indian epic tales, with these places open to exploration to learn more about Indian mythology. The game will feature choices for players to make which could tip the scales that will either save the world from the demon invasion, or doom it. You will be able to explore Bhaarat alone or party up and fight together in co-op. Going by the trailer it currently seems limited to two player co-op, but we do not know if that is the final number.</p>
<p>There is currently no release date for The Age of Bhaarat and it is only confirmed for PC at the moment. You can wishlist the game at the following links:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/silksong-is-playable-in-a-museum-this-september-but-that-probably-doesnt-help-narrow-down-its-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
It's been six long years <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-gets-surprise-sequel-for-switch-and-pc">since Hollow Knight sequel Silksong was confirmed to be in development</a>, and fans - starved of much in the way of news - have managed to reach such a frenzy of anticipation in that time, it's a wonder the whole thing didn't end in mass spontaneous combustion. Some of the pressure was thankfully released last month when developer Team Cherry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-confirmed-for-both-switch-consoles">finally confirmed a 2025 launch window</a>, but an exact release date remains elusive. What we <em>do</em> now know, however, is Silksong's set to be playable at an Australian museum this September, suggesting it'll either release before, after, or during that time.
</p>
<p>
Silksong is more specifically due to appear at Australia's national museum of screen culture (ACMI) as part of its upcoming <a href="https://www.acmi.net.au/whats-on/game-worlds/">Game Worlds exhibition</a>, running from 18th September 2025 to 8th February next year. The exhibition focuses on 30 video games - including the seminal likes of The Sims and World of Warcraft - and "charts technical and design innovation to uncover what makes these virtual worlds feel alive." And in among that number is Silksong, which has earned its place in the line-up partly for the sheer magnitude of anticipation surrounding its release and partly to celebrate its homegrown origins, given Team Cherry is based in Adelaide.
</p>
<p>
"Since <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s initial announcement in 2019, it has been one of the most anticipated indie games on the planet," Game World co-curators Bethan Johnson and Jini Maxwell wrote in a statement announcing the news, "and we are thrilled to celebrate the design of this South Australian-made game as a centrepiece of Game Worlds in September."

<p>
"From the hundreds of sprites that animate Hornet's different movements and attacks, to the logic behind the game's most challenging boss fights - and of course, having the game playable in-gallery - our Silksong displays delve deeply into the details of the game's artistic direction and design. We're so grateful to Team Cherry for trusting us with their work, and so excited to share that work with you!"
</p>
<p>
It is, of course, tempting to try and divine a narrower Silksong release window from this fresh morsal of news, but that ultimately feels like a fruitless endeavour. ACMI's announcement makes no suggestion Silksong's playable Game Worlds appearance is in any way a first, so there's every chance it'll get a general release ahead of its museum debut. On the other hand, it doesn't say it's <em>not</em> a first, so the opposite might also be true? All we know for certain is Silksong comes Switch, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, and PC later this year, with an Xbox and PlayStation release to follow.

			<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-back-in-cyrodiil-19-years-later/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> was finally revealed after weeks of leaks, many RPG fans began to worry for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</a></p>
<p>Clair Obscur was a brand-new RPG released just days after the Oblivion remaster, and the concern was that Oblivion would swallow up all the attention from Clair Obscur. On the outside, it looked like Xbox had screwed Clair Obscur in a big way.</p>
<p>That was not the case, as Clair Obscur surpassed <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-already-a-million-seller/">one million copies sold</a> days after its launch, and is one of the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/clair-obscur-expedition-33/">best-rated</a> games of 2025 so far.</p>
<p>A report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/expedition-33-publisher-elder-scrolls">The Game Business</a> showed that not only did Clair Obscur not get swallowed up by Oblivion, but the two seemingly helped each other. Both games were available on Xbox Game Pass, so it's not a surprise that, per Ampere Analysis' data, the majority of players for both Oblivion and Clair Obscur were Xbox players.</p>
<p>What is interesting, though, is that 55% of players who played Clair Obscur on Xbox also played Oblivion. 35% of all Expedition 33 players also played Oblivion, showing huge overlap between the two. As Kelper Interactive's portfolio manager Matt Handrahan told The Game Business, "<em>I think it just drew attention to quality RPGs that week</em>."</p>
<p>"<em>We always knew that Expedition 33 had a very specific identity. When I was in the press, I saw the Western-style RPG and the Japanese-style RPG as having quite different appeals and audiences. I knew plenty of people that would play an Elder Scrolls game that wouldn't necessarily play Final Fantasy and vice versa.</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>Also, by the time that we rolled around, we had momentum of our own and we felt pretty confident that we could stand beside it. I think there were other aspects, like the price point we were at and the inclusion in Game Pass… so we knew we would have a lot of interest around the game. We were confident in that. And it went as well as it possibly could have done in our eyes. And, actually, proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all. In many ways, I think it just drew attention to quality RPGs that week and everybody was thinking and talking about the genre.</em>"</p>
<p>Handrahan also spoke about how Clair Obscur's inclusion in the Xbox's summer showcase ahead of the game's release was a major help.</p>
<p>"<em>[During the Summer Showcase] our game was placed alongside Gears of War, Fable and products that are very traditionally known as AAA products,</em>" Handrahan said.</p>
<p>"<em>It let people understand what it was in a way that I think we would've struggled to do if we weren't allied with Xbox in that way. We couldn’t have done it through a Steam demo alone, for example. It helped us to kind of claim this AA territory in a much more confident way. Because it's a vague space that exists somewhere between small games and extremely big games, and there's a lot of ground that that covers.</em>"</p>
<p>Xbox's support in the showcase is a clear help to Clair Obscur, but it's more interesting and hopeful to see that the shadow drop of such a massive RPG was able to help catapult the release of a new entry to the genre.</p>

            <p>
A frustrating thing I frequently find myself thinking about games is that they very rarely try to be more than what they are, at least when it comes to AAA ones (or any kind of game that has enough money for a full blown ad campaign). They're just so often… games. No interest or desire to expand the medium. Luckily, there are people doing the work to rethink what games are, and today we now have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/despelote">Despelote</a>, a "semi-autobiographical", almost documentary-like game about playing football in Ecuador in 2001.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The game follows an eight year old Julián Cordero, one of the lead developers on the game, as he kicks about a football throughout Quito, the capital of Ecuador. Now, I'll be honest, I care about football about as far as I can throw one (it's not very far). That doesn't matter very much to me though because, from the looks of it, Despelote shows a connection to the beautiful game that anyone could get invested in.
</p>
<p>
Kicking around the football is all physics based too, it looks so satisfying just punting it off into the distance. The look of the game is impressive too. It has this filter to it that makes everything look like it's a photo that's been put through one of those free filters that comes with some camera app. I don't mean this derogatorily in any way, there's such a strong sense of texture to it that somehow makes it feel real and surreal at the same time. Exactly my kind of vibe.
</p>
<p>
All of the photos and audio in the game were apparently recorded on location, which is probably why Despelote looks to have such a strong look to it. This is what I'm talking about with expanding the medium. Autobiographical games aren't all too common, it joins works like Cibele and That Dragon Cancer in a very small niche, but I hope that more people consider doing the same.
</p>
<p>
You can pick up <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2367820/despelote/">Despelote on Steam now</a>, and there's even a 10% launch discount until May 15th.

                <p>Microsoft just joined Nintendo in announcing that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">some of its games will sell for $80</a>, and this new rate will seemingly apply to both physical <em>and </em>digital games. The price hike is inspiring a lot of debate and discussion, with some wondering why the price of digital games is going up. Many might be able to understand why a disc-based product might go up in price due to tariffs and other market factors, but why would digital games get more expensive, too?</p><p>Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1917978011661713905" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> it's true there is no "direct" tariff impact on digital games, but publishers may choose to raise prices anyway for a variety of reasons. To begin with, raising the price of a digital product could help offset rising costs in other departments, he said. Second, a publisher might raise the price of a digital game to bring it in line with its physical counterpart.</p><p>Other factors could be that a game's price is going up to reflect the increased cost to develop a particular game, along with a belief that people will, in general, accept the price increase. Lastly, a publisher might decide to charge more for a digital game "because they can," Ahmad said.</p><p>Earlier this year, Nintendo announced that it would sell <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a> would sell for $80, for both its physical and digital edition. Not every Nintendo game will carry the heftier price tag, though, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-release-date-trailer-gameplay-details-and-everything-we-know/1100-6530797/" data-ref-id="1100-6530797">Donkey Kong: Bananza</a> is priced at $70.</p><p>Microsoft announced on May 1 that it is raising the price of some games to $80 later this year, with price hikes on consoles going into effect immediately, making one version of the Xbox Series X more expensive than the PS5 Pro. Microsoft hasn't published a list of its $80 games yet, but the company did say <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Game Pass</a> is not getting a price hike, too, at least not yet.</p><p>Now, many are wondering if Sony will follow suit with an announcement of increased costs for its consoles and games.</p><p>New AAA video games sold for $60 for years before Take-Two was among the first to raise prices to $70 in 2020. The company said there was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/with-gta-6-coming-take-two-sees-no-pushback-on-70-games/1100-6514323/" data-ref-id="1100-6514323">"no pushback" at the time over the higher price</a>, and $70 later became the standard for Take-Two and others. According to one analyst, there is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-costing-as-much-as-100-could-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-says/1100-6528832/" data-ref-id="1100-6528832">hope in the video game industry that Take-Two will charge $100 for GTA 6</a> to help reinvigorate the video game industry. As of yet, however, Take-Two has not announced pricing plans for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a>.</p><p>For comparison, GTA 5 launched at $60 back in 2013. Adjusted for inflation, that would be about $82 in 2025.</p><p>Outside market conditions and development costs, Microsoft is staying rather vague about suddenly raising the prices for so many Xbox products. It's possibly related to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/">new Trump administration tariffs in the US, because they led to Switch 2 preorder delays</a> and eventually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/-/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">some price hikes.</a> </p><p>Microsoft, for its part, is raising prices <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/investor/earnings/fy-2025-q3/press-release-webcast" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as the company overall generates huge amounts of money</a>. For the past three months alone, Microsoft brought in $70 billion in revenue and made a profit of $25.8 billion.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announced-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-surpassed-2-million-players/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft announced today that Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, its 2D action platformer from the Ubisoft Montpellier team, has gone "<em>well over</em>" 2 million players since it launched at the top of 2024.</p>
<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1917609908024856659">X</a>, Ubisoft announced the milestone with a short message that ended with what could be read as a hint that there's more to come regarding The Lost Crown.</p>
<p>"<em>Well over 2M players by now</em>," the post began. "<em>You've revived the legend. The Prince is back, and believe us - he's just warming up.</em>"</p>
<p>That could hint that there's more to come related to The Lost Crown, but that feels unlikely because <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-sequel-isnt-happening-due-to-low-sales-ubisoft-disbanded-the-team/">Ubisoft disbanded the team at Ubisoft Montpellier that made The Lost Crown</a>. More likely, the tease is referring to the fact that there are other Prince of Persia games in the works, like the ongoing development of the early access game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-early-access-review-the-year-of-the-prince/">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-dev-team-adds-ubisoft-toronto-far-cry/">Sands of Time Remake</a>, which was rebooted partway through development.</p>
<p>Sure, Ubisoft could try to get the Montpellier team back together. It certainly wouldn't be the first time the executive branch of a big game publisher/developer went back on a decision everyone and their mother could have told them was poor and short-sighted. If that's what's happening, then great! But it doesn't feel likely.</p>
<p>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown was undoubtedly Ubisoft's best game of 2024. Just because it didn't meet Ubisoft's sales expectations doesn't mean it wasn't a success. It had the best critical reception of any game Ubisoft released in 2024 and was one of the best games released in 2024, period.</p>
<p>Ubisoft could have taken the win of The Lost Crown being regarded as one of the best games they'd made in a long time, and focused on helping that team succeed again. Instead, they scattered that team to the wind, adding to the very public mess that Ubisoft continues to find itself in.</p>
<p>It's also worth remembering that Ubisoft does not hold the Prince of Persia series in the same regard as Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, or Rainbow Six. If it did, Prince of Persia would also be part of that <a href="https://wccftech.com/leaked-internal-memo-details-ubisofts-plans-for-new-subsidiary-with-tencent/">new holding company</a>. Considering what happened with The Lost Crown, fans of the storied series have no reassurance from Ubisoft that they should actually be excited for whatever is next with the Prince of Persia series.</p>

Some of these are achieved by combining abilities and status effects from other characters, such as using Mei’s freezing ability to emulate Luna Snow’s, while others are made by assigning different damage/healing values and hitboxes to abilities through the workshop. This means you’ll see a lot of assets you’ve probably never seen in typical <em>Overwatch</em>, but the end result is that you can basically play <em>Marvel Rivals </em>inside <em>Overwatch 2</em>. You can check out Javofo’s breakdown below:</p><p>It sometimes feels like <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s workshop modes go overlooked, but there’s some truly creative stuff to be found there. Not that the game is lacking in new creative stuff right now. The season 16 update added a new Stadium mode that allows you to craft a hero’s build over the course of seven rounds, and it’s given the game some new life as players find new ways to approach playing old characters. That’s kind of been Blizzard’s M.O. these past few seasons; the new Perks system, introduced a few months ago, allows you to upgrade characters in the middle of a match with big and small tweaks to their kits, giving players more freedom than they’ve had in this game for a hot minute. <em>Overwatch 2 </em>has felt pretty restrictive over the years, and it seems like Blizzard is finally loosening its grip on the leash. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>: The War Within's next patch is bringing with it a little something for everyone, including a new, story-focused way to level characters and even recolored variants of the MMORPG's most iconic tier sets.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard detailed what all will be new in the 11.1.7 patch in a <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24199286" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, and it includes a new story campaign that will explore rising tensions between the Horde and Alliance in the Arathi Highlands with "branching viewpoints," according to Blizzard. While new main story campaign quests are expected, the patch has more than a few surprises in store, too.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> World of Warcraft: The War Within - Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">One of them is a new way to level characters that sounds like a more story-driven version of Chromie Time. By speaking to Lorewalker Cho in Stormwind, Orgrimmar, or Dornogal starting in patch 11.1.7, players can complete three repeatable quest chains containing both old and new quests from previous expansions but that share a common story thread. One quest chain, for example, dives into the history of iconic Warcraft villain Arthas, where players will be able to battle through Strathholme during the culling before jumping to the game's Wrath of the Lich King expansion and stepping into the shoes of Arthas himself. Another questline dives into the history of current main villain Xal'atath, as players experience her origins in Legion, how she regained her physical form in Battle for Azeroth, and a past confrontation between her and the Old Gods.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard didn't elaborate much on the new Lorewalker Cho quests, but it seems a great way to keep new or returning players up to date on plot threads that are currently relevant, with Xal'atath's origins, and another quest chain involving the Ethereals, being perfect examples. Why Arthas and the Lich King are featured prominently with a questline despite having no real connection to The War Within's events is anyone's guess. Perhaps the Lich King still has some role to play, or more likely Blizzard simply knows Arthas is one of the game's most enduring characters. Presumably, max-level characters can also experience these quest chains for a lore refresher, though what rewards they might contain is currently unknown.</p><p dir="ltr">Another surprise is the introduction of Overcharged Delves, more dangerous versions of six specific Delves that will feature more traps and enemies, as well a new trait tree specific to these amped up versions of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-is-finally-adding-a-new-endgame-activity-made-with-smaller-groups-in-mind/1100-6518919/" data-ref-id="1100-6518919">WoW's solo dungeons</a>. Blizzard will additionally be adding Battle for Azeroth dungeons to the game's Timewalking lineup as part of the return of the Turbulent Timeways event, complete with a new Battle for Azeroth Timewalking vendor.</p><p dir="ltr">While it will be coming sometime after the patch's launch, Blizzard also detailed the return of its Diablo-themed Greedy Emissary event that sees players hunting down Treasure Goblins for rare loot. This time the loot will be even more desirable, as there will be a new mount and recolors of WoW's recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-is-bringing-back-its-most-iconic-armor-sets-for-massive-20th-anniversary-update/1100-6526277/" data-ref-id="1100-6526277">remastered tier 2 armor sets</a> that players will definitely want to collect.</p><p dir="ltr">Patch 11.1.7 will additionally bring UI improvements in the form of the recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-one-button-rotation-tool-will-basically-play-the-game-for-you/1100-6531244/" data-ref-id="1100-6531244">revealed Combat Assistant</a>. This feature when enabled will mimic the behavior of popular rotation assistance add-ons by displaying which ability a player should use next for optimal damage, but goes a step further by including a single-button rotation option that will automatically cast abilities in sequence. It's just the latest way Blizzard is looking to bring add-on functionality into WoW's base UI, with its most <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-april-22-update-will-finally-offer-an-easy-alternative-to-a-critical-ui-add-on/1100-6530701/" data-ref-id="1100-6530701">recent patch introducing a Cooldown Manager</a> meant to replace the popular WeakAuras add-on.</p><p dir="ltr">WoW: The War Within patch 11.1.7 doesn't have a release date yet but is now available for testing on the game's public test realm.</p>
