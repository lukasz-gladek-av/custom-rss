			<p>When I played the first&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/28/the-legend-of-heroes-trails-through-daybreak-review/">The Legend Of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak</a> game, I was so excited to experience a fresh start in an otherwise exhaustively long and inter-connected RPG series. The game introduced a really engaging new setting and cast of characters that I loved, and the incredible blend of hack-and-slash and turn-based combat is something I wish more people talked about. I was excited for the sequel to either expand on the original game with upgraded mechanics and expanded environments or utilize those same tools to take the story to even higher heights. Unfortunately, The Legend Of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II doesn’t do much of either of those things, instead feeling like an over-indulgent DLC that provides more filler than anyone would be interested in.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Legend of Heroes: Trails through Daybreak II - Opening Movie (Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, PC)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2PqS_5eWb7A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Legend Of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II kicks off just a few months after the end of the previous game, and at first it drops us into a pretty juicy new dilemma for our smooth-talking protagonist Van. A string of sudden murders has occurred in the region of Calvard, and the only suspect is a crimson-coloured spitting image of the Grendel, Van’s transformed alter-ego. There are some further complications when old flame Elaine Auclair shows up in Van’s city, leading the two to reluctantly team up and get to the bottom of a murder mystery that has sprawling implications for plenty of other strange developments.</p>



<p>If you’re a fan of the series who’s familiar with all the over-arching lore of the dozen or so entries in The Legend of Heroes that preceded this one, you’ll be excited by some of the directions this story goes. Like Elaine Auclair, a lot of the supporting cast in this game are returning faces or debuting names that initially showed up in Trails into Reverie. As someone with a perpetual issue remembering the lore of this series, I was put off by just how deep into the weeds the last few entries got with the sprawling inter-connected narratives and endless callbacks. The Legend Of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II does a good job of keeping things comprehensible if you’ve only participated in Van’s story, but it also provides a massively in-depth glossary system that helps shore up some of the muddier memories of prior games or obscure elements of the world.</p>

<p>In between lore-heavy callbacks and hunting for clues to the mysteries our protagonists are chasing, you’ll often end up having your cast of heroes split up and going their separate ways to find their own answers. This leads to a lot of arcs in the game being split into multiple chapters happening parallel to each other, and you’re given the chance to choose which order you play these chapters in as you bounce around the various groups that embody each one. It’s a really satisfying mechanic that keeps the pacing of the story fresh, but also allows the opportunity for characters to come and go in a natural way that’s honestly kind of a rarity for JRPGs. Early into the game, Van tells his incredibly young part-time assistant Agnès Claudel to stay behind and focus on school for a bit while he goes off to investigate things. Instead of the game contriving a call-to-action that forces her to stick with Van anyways, she just listens to him and sticks back to focus on school for that chapter!</p>

<p>Still, for as much fun as The Legend Of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II has with the way it paces and presents the story, I wrapped up my lengthy playthrough of the game feeling like a vast majority of it didn’t really matter. Several developments throughout the game feel like they’re on the level of anime-filler, or are vaguely interesting ideas stretched out to occupy way more of the game’s runtime than they should have. A “bad-ending” time-loop mechanic introduced early in the story as a fun way to keep you on your toes quickly leads to repetitive and exhaustively frequent interruptions, while the final act of the game is occupied by a strange mind-control plot that rips out a lot of the tension of the experience.</p>
<p>I found myself tuning out from a lot of the story of The Legend Of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II, which was fine since I still had a blast digging into the incredible gameplay. Combat is largely unchanged from the last game, which I couldn’t be happier about. You’re still able to get into Ys-style hack-and-slash battles as you traverse dungeons, although this time you also get to dish out new special attacks during these moments that keep things even fresher and faster.</p>

<p>You can also transition into turn-based combat at any time, and the real-time transition between the two never gets old. Being a huge fan of the combat, I was especially excited about the new Märchen Garten mode. You can dive into a sprawling series of side dungeons that allow you to mix and match party members who would never normally be able to team up in the story – or even play as characters not featured in the story at all! As you progress and earn currency, you can spend it on a smorgasbord of unlocks that I was dedicated to clearing out.</p>
<p>For all the narrative flaws of The Legend Of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II, it’s still an incredibly fun JRPG full of charming characters, and it continues to house the most creative and impressive dual-style combat I’ve seen in a JRPG. I just hope the next game in the series – which was initially planned as a third Daybreak entry but has now been changed into an Avengers-style team-up to close the book on many of the franchise’s long-running mysteries – can improve on the lacklustre storytelling and lack of high-energy takes that plagued so much of this game.</p>

		The Legend Of Heroes: Trails Through Daybreak II is a fun and polished JRPG full of the most electrifying JRPG combat I've ever experienced, but it fails to weave its own compelling narrative, relying on filler to plug the gaps.	</p></div>

			<p>Bloomberg's Jason Schreier has just <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/warner-bros-video-game-division-faces-thin-slate-wonder-woman-issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a paywalled report on what's next for Warner Bros. Games, and the article includes updates on the Wonder Woman game in development at Monolith Productions.</p>
<p>The historic development studio of games like Shogo, No One Lives Forever, The Matrix Online, F.E.A.R., Condemned, and the two Middle-earth: Shadow titles announced the game during Geoff Keighley's The Game Awards 2021. Over three years have passed since, though, and we haven't seen anything more than that teaser trailer, nor do we know anything concrete other than the fact it will be an origin story featuring the Nemesis system that Monolith Productions designed for its most recent games.</p>
<p>According to Schreier's sources, that is because the development of the Wonder Woman project has been troubled, leading to its reboot in early 2024 under a new director. The report also alleges that Warner Bros. Games already spent over $100 million on the game, which makes sense as it's been nearly eight years after the launch of Middle-earth: Shadow of War. Despite all this time and resources spent on it, Wonder Woman is nowhere near ready and will still take years to be released, if that can even happen, according to the report.</p>
<p>This doesn't bode well for the publisher, which had to deal with several blunders after the explosive success of Hogwarts Legacy. Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League famously <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-support-ends-in-january-2025-offline-mode-and-deathstroke-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flopped</a>, and, as many had assumed, Schreier confirms Rocksteady is returning to its safe haven of making single player Batman games. However, a new game will take years to be developed. Then there's MultiVersus, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/multiversus-to-end-with-season-5-game-to-go-offline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is shutting down on May 30</a> after its fifth season.</p>
<p>All these problems led to Warner Bros. Games CEO David Haddad's <a href="https://wccftech.com/warner-bros-games-ceo-leaves-after-suicide-squad-and-multiversus-failures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recent departure</a>. The publisher is now reportedly facing a 'thin' release schedule in the near future, as most of the next triple-A projects will take time to be crafted. For example, following the release of Gotham Knights, Warner Bros. Games Montreal is said to be helping on the Wonder Woman game while also putting together a pitch for a Game of Thrones game.</p>

Both have seen several iterations and the license has changed ownership from the original developer. Both the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-five-rings-lcg-review-new-dynasty" rel="nofollow">CCG</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-five-rings-rpg-review-l5r-rpg-core-rulebook-and-games-masters-kit" rel="nofollow">RPG</a> were unique in that they didn't purely focus on combat, and the social elements played a huge thematic part of the games. They also featured an ongoing narrative, with tournament winners choosing how the story developed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-18.jpg?itok=bMYiZ_ZI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-18.jpg?itok=v6UWts6i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>My retainers brought the chop to the Goblins.</figcaption></figure><p>When I heard that the first <em>L5R</em> video game was being developed, I stepped away from the tabletop, picked up my controller, and stood ready to judge <em>Shadowveil:</em> <em>Legend of the Five Rings</em> as only a tabletop gamer could. It must be noted that I've been playing both the <em>L5R</em> card game and roleplaying game since 1995. I've played through all versions (reviewing the latest versions of both here on TechRaptor), and I've read all the published <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/swords-and-spirits-preview-legend-of-five-rings-fiction" rel="nofollow">tie-in fiction</a>, as well as being a huge samurai and ninja nerd (and Japan in general). So I was going to be a tough audience for this.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-4.jpg?itok=eG9ZykLS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-4.jpg?itok=sYOshyZb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Our demo brief for the first 2 levels of&nbsp;<em>Shadowveil: Legend of the Five Rings</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>As with all my tabletop reviews, I judge theme pretty harshly. If you're going to throw a setting in your title, you better live up to it, rather than it being a paper-thin layer on top. So I was always going to judge it on theme before how good it actually was. If it lived up to the setting, I could forgive poor gameplay, but never the other way around. I got to test <em>Shadowveil</em> with a preview code, so not all elements of the game were available, and some things may change by the time the game releases fully on Mar 04.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-7.jpg?itok=kyroIged 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-7.jpg?itok=WN-VyIAa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Kuni Yori is abolsultey as sketchy as he looks.</figcaption></figure><p>My concerns about theme were immediately alleviated, as soon as the first dialogue box opened. The <em>L5R</em> setting features several clans, all vying for power with different strengths and goals. The Crab clan, who are the focus of <em>Shadowveil</em>, guard the rest of the empire against the Shadowlands, a corrupted realm filled with demons, evil spirits, goblins, and other creatures, are unique in their outlook in that they don't care for honor or social politics. Victory is simply everything, and the methods are immaterial.</p>

<p>This stoic realism was captured immediately, and also told me that I wouldn't need to worry about how <em>Shadowveil</em> would deal with the social politics of the different clans, this was going to be war, the part of the empire that didn't care for etiquette or courtly virtues. But that element wasn't written out, as it could easily have been. It's obvious that not all is as it seems as the lead pair of characters, a brother and sister pair of Crab clan samurai reach a walled outpost in need of repair, and some internal politics are obvious from the off.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-8.jpg?itok=4QZwt1UG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-8.jpg?itok=eyTnTtxt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I was very pleased to see named characters I recognised from the <em>L5R</em> setting.</figcaption></figure><p>In the full game, you will be able to choose between 2 famous characters from the setting, Hida O-Ushi, a berserker warrior, and her bother Hida Sukune, a more thoughtful and tactical samurai. Our build saw us taking O-Ushi, and leading our warriors to war. The first few dialogue boxes take you through the setting introduction, not drawing it out, but giving those new to it enough to go on, and then you're off on your first outing, beyond the wall, and into the shadowlands.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-11.jpg?itok=MToQK16X 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-11.jpg?itok=0ooK3cnw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Your choice of deck focuses on a specific class and the berserker choice is about smashing heads.</figcaption></figure><p>After going through the gate, you're into the game, which&nbsp;features roguelike runs, with you choosing the path of progression. You can select cards for abilities and items for your fighters and choose their placement in combat, but the battles happen automatically, with your fighters attacking as per their class. You start off with your main character and 2 basic samurai, but you can unlock other classes like the scout and witch hunter on subsequent runs, along with upgrading your basic samurai into formidable fighters themselves.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-10.jpg?itok=Hq4XR-FD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-10.jpg?itok=L8wGsjQG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The roguelike journey begins with the first step.</figcaption></figure><p>During the run you collect cards, which unlock abilities. These are either generic or class-locked, and duplicate copies can be combined into a more powerful version. You can also collect items and other resources to unlock further elements as you progress. Some only benefit you during that run, like jade, which is used when you rest to heal and gain temporary boosts, others you take back with you, unlocking character classes and items. Side quests are also available, with some key unlocks early in the game's story. throughout it all, your characters gain experience, which levels them up for subsequent run attempts, and later levels.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-3.jpg?itok=cpbK406d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-3.jpg?itok=XqwmJf2j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In a true RPG feel, everything here is your choice of upgrade.</figcaption></figure><p>The leveling-up screen gives you a whole host of options, from core stats, specific masteries and traits, unlocking more item and ability slots for cards you collect on the way, and also upgrading the core ability itself. When you upgrade stats, you get several stat package options that allow you to focus the character the way you want. The upgrade package was a lot more detailed than I thought, and really gave me a roleplaying feel that captures the the <em>L5R</em> RPG.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-16.jpg?itok=xIh6G1Ea 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-16.jpg?itok=7LEPwxrd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Enemy numbers mean nothing when you've invested everything in a run on a single berserker.</figcaption></figure><p>The&nbsp;roguelike runs are handled very well, with branching level selects with the side quests highlighted further down the route. Each failed attempt isn't death, but a withdrawal to recuperate and rearm, before heading out again, with some friendly banter from your sibling after your failed run. It took me 4 runs on my first go to finish to defeat the first boss, and I'd unlocked 2 other classes, taking 5 fighters total to battle in the last mission. I focused on gaining command points, which lets you deploy extra fighters, rather than upgrading abilities, but it looks like either option is viable, either taking a small force of starting-level abilities or a couple of super-samurai.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The second level was a lot harder, and I hit several walls early on and had to upgrade a couple of times to even make it halfway. Tactical resting became key, and positioning choices at the start of each battle really started to matter.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-14.jpg?itok=QybwHeAH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadowveil-legend-of-the-five-rings-14.jpg?itok=PEfHKgn3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Rest Timing and option selection is as key as to everything else you chose in completing a run.</figcaption></figure><h2>Shadowveil: Legend of the Five Rings Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Thematically, <em>Shadowveil</em> nails it. It captures the setting very well, even with the limited single-clan view, which allows them to focus the gameplay on the combat side of <em>L5R</em> without feeling like it's missing the social side. Yet it still captures the politics, even the internal politics of the very unpolitical Crab clan. The RPG elements had surprising depth, and the blend of permanent development you can control, to the random party development in the runs works very well. As a tabletop gamer of all genres, I love turn-based strategy, but honestly, the auto-battler is doing pretty much what I would be doing only faster, which lets you focus on the overall strategy of the run.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>L5R</em> fans would obviously love to see all of the clans represented, across the full setting with all facets of what we love about the CCG and RPG, but the depth of that game would be huge, and probably not for the mainstream market. What <em>Shadowveil</em> does is capture what's important for <em>L5R</em>, in a perfect mix of theme and gameplay, that while might not be for everyone, looks and plays great and may introduce more players to a deep and incredible setting that tabletop gamers already love.</p>

<p>The studio says the UI is its "top priority", and that fixes will include making the interface "more intuitive", improving readability, and improving polish, among other things. More information will be shared "as soon as [the studio] can".</p>

<p>According to the post, Firaxis' next major area of improvement is implementing community-requested features into&nbsp;<em>Civ 7</em>, including adding teams to multiplayer games, increasing map variety, and enabling the customization of city and religion names. These things will, of course, be included in upcoming patches for free.</p>

<p>The third major area of improvement for&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>focuses on quality-of-life improvements, with the first of such features rolling out as part of Patch 1.1.0 in March. That's where you'll find improvements and tweaks to the game's AI, as well as UI adjustments and more.</p>




<p>Firaxis says it will share a development roadmap for&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>as soon as it's able, but for now, it wants you to know that fixes are coming for some of the problems you might have been having with the game.</p>

<p><em>Civilization 7</em>'s full launch is scheduled for February 11th, but you can play it now if you picked up the Deluxe or Founders Editions of the game. It's available for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/sid-meier-s-civilization-vii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-for-xbox-series-xs/9N23HJHSC6BL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

Super Bowl ads tie the year’s biggest sporting event to every facet of our culture, serving as annual conversation pieces thanks to their high-concept ideas, celebrity appearances, and big-budget production value. The event <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nfl.com/news/super-bowl-lvi-total-viewing-audience-estimated-at-over-208-million&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nfl.com/news/super-bowl-lvi-total-viewing-audience-estimated-at-over-208-million" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">draws nine-figure viewership every year</a></span>, so whether they’re shilling chips, cars, or crypto, Super Bowl ads tend to pull out all the stops. Video game ads during the big game are no exception, and developers and publishers have put out some real standout commercials during the Super Bowl over the years. Let’s look at a few of the best (and worst) video game ads to ever grace a football intermission.</p></div><div><p>When Sony Santa Monica released <em>God of War: Ascension </em>on the PlayStation 3 in 2013, it was during the era when Sony was putting out a lot of high-quality live-action ads that for some reason didn’t actually include any gameplay. But <em>Ascension</em>’s Super Bowl ad still remains one of the most moving live-action trailers for any video game. Set to Ellie Goulding’s cover of “Hanging On,” the trailer shows Kratos’ daughter Calliope running up to her father. When he picks her up, she immediately turns to ash, which is grafted onto Kratos’ skin as a punishment for his crimes. It’s an incredible tone setter for the character, and feels more reminiscent of the prestige storytelling the series would go on to have in the Norse mythology series that began with the 2018 game. <em>Ascension </em>hasn’t had the same shelf life as the rest of the series, as the prequel lacked a lot of the set pieces that have kept the memory of its predecessors alive and well and had a story many found lackluster and superfluous. But this trailer? It’s still a beautiful, tragic take on Kratos’ legacy.</p></div><div><p>Ready at Dawn’s PlayStation 4 exclusive about a steampunk London overrun by werewolves and vampires has largely been lost to time in the grand scheme of Sony’s IP, but there are dozens of us who look back fondly at the game as a strong foundation for a sequel that never came. However, it could have maybe been a more memorable game if its Super Bowl ad hadn’t been so ordinary. Companies are spending millions of dollars to put their products in front of people, and <em>The Order: 1886</em>’s commercial was a pretty bog standard gameplay trailer. Sure, given that the <em>God of War: Ascension </em>and <em>Dante’s Inferno </em>ads have no gameplay whatsoever, there’s merit to trying to show people what they’re actually going to buy, but it’s just missing the pizzazz that makes Super Bowl commercials memorable in the long run. Like the game itself, <em>The Order: 1886</em>’s Super Bowl ad deserved better from Sony.<br></p></div><div><p>The <em>Pokémon</em> ad during the 2016 Super Bowl wasn’t an ad for any specific game, but rather for the series’ 20th anniversary. This was just a few months before the release of <em>Pokémon Go</em>, which would have made for a pretty sensible commercial, but really the <em>Pokémon </em>2016 ad is more about a feeling than it is about any one thing. It shows multiple characters training across different disciplines, including chess, football, and eventually Pokémon battling to be the very best “like no one ever was.” It’s pure hype, and it makes you feel like you can take on the world.<br></p></div><div><p>One of the best examples of a video game company doing more than just advertising its latest thing to buy occurred when Microsoft made an ad for the Xbox Adaptive Controller that showed kids with disabilities demonstrating how the deeply customizable controller accommodates people who weren’t able to play games with a traditional controller. Aired during the 2019 championship, it’s a commercial like any other, but anything that advocates for making video games more welcoming to more people, especially on a stage as big as the Super Bowl, is a-okay in my book. Hopefully when PlayStation releases its upcoming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-project-leonardo-accessibility-controller-1849954609&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-project-leonardo-accessibility-controller-1849954609">Project Leonardo</a></span> controller we’ll see more companies advocating for accessibility in games like this.<br></p></div><div><p>If the job of an ad is to sell you on something, Nintendo’s Super Bowl ad for the Switch during the 2017 game was a colossal success, offering a grand tour of why the company’s upcoming console at the time was going to be such a game changer. It demonstrated every perk of a console-and-handheld hybrid device by showing people playing the Switch in bed, while cooking, at the laundromat, in the public library, and at parties, both in handheld mode and on the TV. It does lose points for being set to Imagine Dragons, though. Alas, that was just par for the course for companies looking for music to accompany their commercials in 2017.<br></p></div><div><p>Six years removed, I’m still not quite sure what Wargaming was going for with its 2017 ad campaign for <em>World of Tanks</em>. While some games on this list don’t include gameplay in their ads, they’re at least thematically in-line with the product they’re selling. <em>World of Tanks</em>’ Super Bowl commercials included parodies of reality shows like the <em>Real Housewives </em>franchise and <em>Million Dollar Listing</em>, all interrupted by a tank rolling through them while a voiceover that sounds like something out of a 90s ad for fruit-flavored gummies says the tagline, “Tanks rule.” If it weren’t for the console logos and the ESRB rating, I would have no idea what was happening here.<br></p></div><div><p>The 2010 <em>Dante’s Inferno </em>ad is similar to the <em>God of War: Ascension </em>one, in that it forgoes any gameplay for a very evocative cinematic trailer. It shows Dante jumping down into Hell to save his lover Beatrice, and as he fights all the demons and other ugly beasties in the underworld, Bill Withers’ “Ain’t No Sunshine” plays in the background. Now that I find myself writing about two Super Bowl ads with similar themes, it dawns on me that video games of the early 2010s sure loved to put trailers about man pain on at the biggest sporting event of the year, huh? I guess men brutalizing each other in real life and men in video games brutalizing others make for an effective combination.<br></p></div><div><p>It’s sometimes confusing to me that some people tune into an hours-long sporting event just to watch the commercials. People who do this tell me the ads are funny, but sometimes I see one like the 2024 Paramount Plus ad and think, “Are they funny, or are they just expensive?” This TV spot shows several people and characters featured on the streaming service’s programming, including Knuckles as voiced by Idris Elba from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/knuckles-review-paramount-plus-episodes-season-one-1851423404&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/knuckles-review-paramount-plus-episodes-season-one-1851423404">his bad self-titled show</a></span>, and Master Chief <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/halo-tv-show-paramount-canceled-season-3-xbox-1851599347&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/halo-tv-show-paramount-canceled-season-3-xbox-1851599347">from the <em>Halo </em>series</a></span>. The group of characters, hosts, and Miami Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa are stuck on a snowy mountaintop and need to throw a rope high enough for them to climb up and escape. Tagovailoa can only throw a football, though. So he’ll need to throw something football-shaped….like the head of Arnold from <em>Hey Arnold</em>. However, it is Patrick Stewart who ends up throwing the classic Nickelodeon character, and then butt-rock band Creed shows up and sings their soaring, vaguely religious anthem “Higher.” Stewart and Arnold sing parts of it, too. This is the kind of shit you dream of when you take an edible before you go to bed.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Warner Bros. Games' only other recent release was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/harry-potter-quidditch-champions"><u>Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions</u></a>, which failed to make an impression.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking in a financial call, Warner Bros. Discovery President and CEO David Zaslav said: "We recognise [the games business] is substantially underperforming its potential right now.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since then, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-officially-ends-after-final-update-offline-mode-and-true-ending">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League post-launch content has come to an end</a> with the delivery of its year one roadmap, and Warner Bros. has announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiversus-dev-calls-out-threats-to-harm-following-shutdown-announcement-i-am-in-deep-mourning-for-the-game">the impending closure of MultiVersus</a>. Rocksteady, meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rocksteady-reportedly-lays-off-staff-following-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop">has suffered significant layoffs</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also question marks over Mortal Kombat 1’s financial performance, although <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dev-chief-ed-boon-teases-t-1000-fatality-and-future-dlc"><u>NetherRealm chief Ed Boon recently announced over five million sales and teased future DLC following the release of the T-1000 Terminator guest character</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the same financial call, Zaslav said Warner Bros. was doubling down on just four games: Hogwarts Legacy (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-2-coordinating-big-picture-storytelling-with-harry-potter-tv-show-storylines"><u>a sequel is already in the works</u></a>), Mortal Kombat, Game of Thrones, and DC, "in particular Batman."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We are focusing our development efforts on those core franchises, with proven studios to improve our success ratio," Zaslav added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it may be some time before fans see the result of this work. Bloomberg said Monolith Productions’ <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/wonder-woman-the-game">Wonder Woman game</a> is in trouble after reportedly rebooting and switching directors early last year. It’s already cost more than $100 million and is still years away from release, Bloomberg added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monolith’s reimagined Nemesis system (it developed the much-loved Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and its sequel) that would see Wonder Woman befriending enemies has been ditched in favor of a more traditional action adventure game. Its fate “remains in question.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gotham Knights developer WB Games Montreal, meanwhile, pitched a John Constantine game but it was never approved. A Flash game was scrapped after the DCU Flash film bombed. It’s now helping out with other games and is reportedly working on a pitch for a new Game of Thrones game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hogwarts Legacy developer Avalanche is, as officially announced, working on new content for Hogwarts Legacy <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/harry-potter-video-game-sequel-hogwarts-legacy-2-one-of-the-biggest-priorities-at-warner-bros">as well as a sequel</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of Rocksteady will be excited to hear the studio “is looking to return to Batman for a single-player game,” but according to Bloomberg, it’s years away. There is no word in Bloomberg’s report on what’s next from NetherRealm.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot of this is Warner Bros. Games has, according to Bloomberg, a refreshed version of Hogwarts Legacy, a Lego game, and a few mobile games in the works for the next two years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

May They guide you to compassion and enlightenment.</li><li>Brant (5-Star) – In the face of danger and adversity, the stage is set for our grandest act!</li><li>Changli (5-Star) – Eons of time on this vast land, all encapsulated in a humble game… I am fortunate to have you as my opponent.</li><li>Lumi (4-Star) – Hehe, busy days, but it feels great to be needed… I should keep it up!</li><li>Chixia (4-Star) – Jinzhou Patroller, Chixia. You can always call on me if you ever find yourself in a pickle!</li><li>Aalto (4-Star) – Well, if it isn’t my loyal patron! What do you wish to inquire about today?</li><li>Youhu (4-Star) – Here you go, a special edition of my poetry collection, hand-signed by moi! You are welcome!</li><li>Taoqi (4-Star)- Phew… All set. Time for a little break.</li><li>Mortefi (4-Star) – Fine, since you’ve done this much for me… Go ahead, tell me the wildest inventions you can think of, and watch me make them happen for you.</li></ul><p><strong>New Content</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Old Man and the Whale</strong> – To the north of Ragunna City lies Rinascita’s largest fishing ground—the Riccioli Islands—an enticing destination for an intriguing <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,028 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>. Ready your sails and prepare for the vast blue waters, Captain!</li><li><strong>Apex Ragunna</strong> – After a decade of anticipation, the long-awaited Carnevale has reignited a fiery passion that refuses to fade. The Water City has just unveiled a corner of its secrets. Now is the best time to set sail, ride the winds, and venture into the uncharted corners of this mysterious land. With the world’s curtain lifting, a new exploration calls! Dive into the adventure now!</li><li><strong>Whimpering Wastes</strong> – Born of evil tides, swarms of Tacet Discords weave a deadly web, luring every passing soul… Once again, it falls to you to cleanse these treacherous waters.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>New Echoes</strong></p><ul><li>Golde Junrock</li><li>Calcified Junrock</li><li>Aero Prism</li><li>Rage Against the Statue</li><li>Hurriclaw</li></ul><p><strong>New Regions</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Vault Underground</strong> – Tucked beneath the Sea of Clouds lies a vast depository zone of the Averardo Vault. Each item moved to the Vault will be meticulously transported to its designated storage location, where it will be safeguarded with the utmost care and precision.</li><li><strong>Riccioli Islands</strong> – A group of islands northwest of Ragunna, rich in various marine resources. Falling out of the governance of the Order of the Deep, these islands have preserved the customs from Rinascita’s Age of a Thousand Islands era, setting them apart from the rest of Ragunna in lifestyle. However, rumor has it a great mystery lies hidden within this secluded paradise…</li><li><strong>Ragunna</strong> – Ragunna City, the administrative center of the Ragunna city-state in Rinascita, is a thriving port city by the sea, its districts linked by winding waterways. The Ragunnesi are devout followers of the Sentinel, who believe Common Echoes to be gifts from the Sentinel carrying Their divine will.</li><li><strong>Whisperwind <a title="Games > Haven [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/haven">Haven</a></strong> – Whisperwind Haven stretches across a vast plain outside Ragunna, adorned with uniquely shaped windmills and babbling streams. When the wind sweeps through, the windmills turn in graceful unison, rippling the streams below. Together, the wind and water merge harmoniously, flowing into the mystical sea of clouds.</li><li><strong>Penitent’s End</strong> – This forsaken island, shrouded in dense sea mist, is dominated by steep cliffs with giant ringed structures. Ships caught in the currents often end up stranded on the island’s treacherous shores. For those lucky enough to survive the wreck, even greater <a title="Genres > Horror [553 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a>s await…</li><li><strong>Fagaceae Peninsula</strong> – This peninsula thick with oak trees was once where Rinascita’s rulers gathered for secret councils. The Oracles carved into the stone and trees have withstood the passage of time, though their messages are now nearly impossible to distinguish.</li><li><strong>Nimbus Sanctum</strong> – The sea of clouds lingering in this place is formed by concentrated Remnant Energy. Local legends of Ragunna speak of a serene, mirror-like area at the heart of Nimbus Sanctum, said to purify the darkest of thoughts and transform them into part of the clouds. At times, a haunting melody can be heard echoing from the depths of the sanctum.</li><li><strong>Averardo Vault</strong> – Built by the Montelli family, Averardo Vault stands like a heavily guarded fortress on the outskirts of the city. Within its walls lies the family’s vast collection of treasures, including precious metals, artworks, and rare Echoes. The vault also provides public services such as secure storage for valuables, appraisals, and acquisition of rare collections.</li><li><strong>Thessaleo Fells</strong> – The rugged mountains of Thessaleo Fells always seem shrouded in the darkness of night, their gloom as deep as the abyssal sea. Once the domain of the Fisalia family, the oldest lineage in Ragunna, this desolate place remains one few outsiders dare to tread.</li></ul><p><strong>Optimizations</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Echo Presets</strong> – Echo Presets allow you to easily save and apply customized Echo lineups for your Resonator. Select any saved preset and use “Apply” to equip the preset to the current Resonator.</li><li><strong>Echo Recommendation</strong> – On the Echo Selection page, use “Suggest” to open the filter. This allows you to check the most commonly used Mainstats and Substats for the current Resonator and quickly filter out suitable Echoes. On the Resonator – Echo page, use “Suggest” to check the most commonly used Sonata Effect for the current Resonator. Use “Auto Equip” to equip all Echoes that best match the selected Sonata Effect. In addition, the Echo storage space has been expanded to 3,000.</li><li><strong>Camera Optimizations</strong><ul><li><strong>Idle Poses</strong> – Capture stunning photos of your Resonators in their idle animation poses.</li><li><strong>More Controls</strong> – Explore more compositions with the addition of Camera Filters, adjustable Filter Intensity, and free horizontal &amp; vertical camera movement.</li></ul></li></ul><p><strong>Ray-Traced Global Illumination</strong></p><p>Ray-Traced Global Illumination will be officially available upon Version 2.1 update.

procedural storytelling in its design. Warner Bros. executives reportedly weren't interested in this proposal, and three years later, the project was canceled. The executives suggested that Monolith should instead work on one of the company's franchises, and after the departure of studio head Kevin Stephens and several key creatives--who would go on to form a new studio at EA to work on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-announces-black-panther-game-with-marvel/1100-6515782/" data-ref-id="1100-6515782">Black Panther game</a>--the rest of Monolith began development on the Wonder Woman game.</p><p>Schrier's report says that an early version of the game attempted to reimagine the Nemesis system from the Mordor games, allowing Wonder Woman to befriend her enemies. This idea was eventually scrapped "in favor of a more traditional action-adventure game" and the future of the project might be in jeopardy.</p><p>Monolith's Wonder Woman game was first revealed at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wonder-woman-game-teased-during-the-game-awards-from-monolith/1100-6498851/">The Game Awards in 2021</a>, but since then, the studio has kept quiet on development aside from confirmation that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wonder-woman-game-isnt-live-service-despite-recent-job-listing/1100-6519317/">it will not be a live-service title</a>. Reports of a troubled development <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wonder-woman-game-reportedly-having-troubled-development/1100-6523971/">first began cropping up last year</a>.</p><p>This follows a trend at Warner Bros. Games, as recent projects have failed to take off. Rocksteady's<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-disappointing-release-led-to-a-200-million-shortfall-for-warner-bros/1100-6523301/" data-ref-id="1100-6523301"> Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League was a $200 million flop</a> for the company, Warner Bros. Montreal's Gotham Knights saw lukewarm sales when it launched, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/multiversus-shuts-down-in-may-but-can-still-be-played-offline-if-you-update-in-time/1100-6529169/">MultiVersus will shut down in May</a>.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>'s next patch, 7.2, will be called Seekers of Eternity and will be released at the end of March.</p>
<p>The news was shared as part of the latest Letter from the Producer livestream, along with artwork for the patch.</p>
<p>It will feature a new character, though her identity has been left a mystery for now beyond featuring in the new artwork.</p>

<p>As with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14s-patch-71-crossroads-is-coming-in-november">previous patch 7.1</a> released in November (Crossroads), Seekers of Eternity will continue the main story after the events of Dawntrail. Eventually these will lead to the presumed next expansion.</p>

</figure>
<p>As part of that story continuation, a new dungeon will be included in this patch called The Underkeep, which - like the story of Dawntrail - appears to take clear inspiration from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy 9</a>'s Alexandria. A new Trial called Recollection against a Beatrix-esque cyborg will also be added.</p>

</figure>
<p>Other additions in this patch include more Hildibrand Adventures, new Cornservant side quests, new Allied Society quests with the Mamool Ja, and a return of the PvP mode Frontline (Secure). The Arcadion will also continue with the Cruiserweight tier, while the Duty Support system will be extended to The Sunken Temple of Qarn.</p>
<p>Further, we've finally received further details on the forthcoming Cosmic Exploration mode.</p>
<p>This new activity is designed for crafters and gatherers as players explore stars, with new stars added in each major patch of the 7.x series. Players will "nurture the development of planets by completing missions and events as a community", including building a base of operations.</p>
<p>Not much more is known yet, though more details will follow in the next livestream. It's clearly meant as a mirror to the Island Sanctuary farming mode from the previous expansion, with a bucolic setting swapped for a sci-fi aesthetic and a new experience aimed more at communal play than solo play.</p>

</figure>
<p>Another addition will be the Occult Crescent field operation, an island shrouded in mystery where players can explore its unmapped terrain and battle against its inhabitants. Players will join forces in small skirmishes against monsters, as well as larger boss battles, with this area also providing a new method of weapon enhancement.</p>
<p>To enter the Occult Crescent players must be level 100, but interestingly it's introducing Phantom Jobs: essentially a secondary Job with additional support actions and traits. These Phantom Jobs include Monk, Bard, Geomancer, Ranger, Berserker, Time Mage, Chemist, and Cannoneer. These will be familiar to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-v">Final Fantasy 5</a> players and its Job system, and while the team wants to implement new Jobs in the next expansion, these Phantom Jobs allowed them to introduce Jobs that may not fit with the game otherwise.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rainbow-six-siege-x-rumored-to-be-announced-next-week.1103100/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-rumored-to-be-announced-next-week/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new rumor suggests that Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege X might be announced very soon. The info was first shared by Rainbow Six Siege leaker<span>fraxiswinning</span>, who <a href="https://x.com/fraxiswinning/status/1887653415683035289" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote on X</a>:</p>
<div dir="ltr">
<p><em>Take everything with a large amount of salt when we talk about ‘Siege X’. Everything is speculative. Nothing is confirmed. </em><em>All we know is ‘Siege X exists’. We’ve been told by sources that it will be revealed at the SI. Things can change. </em></p>
<p><em>Seen some people say Siege X is CODENAMED Siege X. To clarify, It was originally named as ‘Modernized Siege’, traces of it popped up ~5 Months ago. It was renamed to ‘Siege X’ - 4 Months ago. Siege X is the final name.</em></p>
</div>
<p>According to the same source, this will be an engine overhaul and a graphical upgrade for textures and models, making it more of a remaster rather than a full-fledged sequel. Even so, it's been nearly ten years after the launch of Rainbow Six Siege, and a lot of fans have been clamoring for a technical overhaul.</p>
<p>The announcement is expected to happen next week, during the playoffs of the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/esports/rainbow-six/siege/competition/468/14920" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Six Invitational 2025 eSports tournament</a>. This is also where the developers will share other info, such as the new operator for Year 10 - Season 1. According to the leaker, the operator is from New Zealand, codenamed Curtain and named Rauora. The leaker also shared the codename for the operator that will be added with Year 10 - Season 3: Heist.&nbsp;Supposedly, Rainbow Six Siege X might launch during Year 10 - Season 2, which should be released in a few months.</p>
<p>As mentioned by the leaker, take the announcement info with a grain of salt, as publisher Ubisoft could always hold back the news until a later time. However, the veracity of the project itself seems to have been indirectly confirmed by Game Designer Justin Loranger-Ahluwalia, who <a href="https://x.com/trichotome/status/1887681661833277838" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> a long X thread against leaks, asking leakers to 'do something better with their lives' rather than what they've been doing so far.</p>

Originally called <em>Championship Manager</em>, first released in 1992, there has either been a new game or an annual update disk every year since,  changing names to <em>Football Manager</em> in 2005 after a switch from Eidos to Sega but never missing a season.

I would imagine, not least because of its confusing name, <em>Football Manager</em> isn’t quite such a staple of North American gaming life: just think of it as the ultimate fantasy football league, but association football, not your peculiar game of rugby-chess.

This proved trickier than hoped, leading to two big release delays, and now the entire cancellation of the game.</p><p>“Due to a variety of challenges that we’ve been open about to date, and many more unforeseen, we currently haven’t achieved what we set out to do in enough areas of the game, despite the phenomenal efforts of our team,” says Sports Interactive in the statement. “Each decision to delay the release was made with the aim of getting the game closer to the desired level but, as we approached critical milestones at the turn of the year, it became unmistakably clear that we would not achieve the standard required, even with the adjusted timeline.”</p><p>Overall experience and the interface have not reached a point where the developer or its publisher feels comfortable releasing the game, and despite having found a new focus to improve things, “we’re too far away from the standards you deserve.”</p><p>Just the nature of the football season itself means there’s an unmoveable deadline after which releasing the game at all would be folly. SI says that’s March, “as it would be too late in the football season to expect players to then buy another game later in the year,” and isn’t willing to release the game as is by that point. “We could have pressed on, released <em>FM25</em> in its current state, and fixed things down the line—but that’s not the right thing to do.”</p><p>This means 2025 will be the first season not to see a <em>CM</em>/<em>FM</em> game in over 30 years, but also that SI has an extra eight or nine months to beat the new format into shape, updated with the 2026 season’s statistics. Anyone who pre-ordered the game will be automatically refunded, says SI, and as for why this announcement has come so very, very late in the day,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> Due to stakeholder compliance, including legal and financial regulations, today was the earliest date that we could issue this statement.</p></blockquote><p>There are also no plans to release the modern equivalent of an update disk for 2025, as SI says “this is a substantial undertaking” and wants to keep all focus on getting the game finished for the following football season. Finally, when it comes to the various subscription platforms that host <em>FM24</em>,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> We are currently in discussions with our various platform partners and licensors and hope to extend our FM24 agreements.

<p>A new report from Bloomberg has said that Warner Bros. gaming division is struggling to find new success and has rebooted its Wonder Woman game.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/warner-bros-video-game-division-faces-thin-slate-wonder-woman-issues?leadSource=reddit_wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a>, Warner Bros. gaming has had a rough year with a 300 million thanks to Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions, and MultiVersus.</p>



<p>The studio has also apparently rebooted Wonder Woman, which has reportedly cost over $100 million in development costs already.</p>



<p>“One of the company’s biggest bets in development, a video game based on Wonder Woman, has struggled to coalesce, according to people familiar with the project. Early last year, it was rebooted and switched directors. The game has already cost more than $100 million, said the people who asked not to be identified discussing nonpublic information, and is still years away from release, if it ever makes it to market,” the report says.</p>



<p>“According to interviews with two dozen current and former Warner Bros. employees, a lack of a strong, cohesive vision during Haddad’s reign — a tumultuous period in which Warner Bros. struggled through multiple reorganizations — led to years of ineffectual trend-chasing and wasted development time. Along the way, once-revered studios under the Warner Bros. umbrella have taken reputational hits, lost key staff members and burned through hundreds of millions of dollars,” it continued.</p>



<p>According to the report, Rocksteady is now eying up a new single-player Batman game, but is still years away from coming to fruition.</p>



<p>The rumor of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rocksteady-working-on-new-batman-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rocksteady moving to Batman</a> surfaced last year by leaker and rumormonger&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1838116987236655458" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shpeshal Nick</a>.</p>



<p>“Not sure which studio people’s dreams is, but I heard Rocksteady are back making it,” he&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/shpeshal_nick/status/1838116987236655458" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said in a response</a>&nbsp;to a Tweet asking for fans’ dream developers on the next Batman game. “I also think Sony are trying to moneyhat it lol.”</p>

This comes just days after another high-profile publisher, EA, said something similar, indicating the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-may-return-to-nintendo-with-switch-2-ea-ceo-hints/1100-6529253/" data-ref-id="1100-6529253">Madden series may show up on Switch 2.</a></p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/take-two-earnings-stock-price-0c8df088" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Barron's</a>, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick said he's not ready to make any announcements, but fans can expect reveals to come. "Historically, we've supported Nintendo platforms selectively; we've supported them when the platform is right for the property at hand," Zelnick said. "We haven't made any announcements, but I think you can expect it will be supportive when it makes sense."</p><p>During an earnings call, Zenick said there was a time when Nintendo platforms were aimed nearly exclusively at kids and young people in general, but that's no longer the case. The Switch can "support any audience" today, Zelnick said, stopping short of specifically confirming any game releases for Switch 2.</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/take-two-ceo-bullish-on-his-games-but-wary-on-tariffs-strauss-zelnick/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VentureBeat</a>, Zelnick said, "I would have every belief that we'll be supportive of Switch 2."</p><p>People might want to know if <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA VI </a>will show up on Switch 2, and there is no reason to believe it will.

            <p>Blizzard has shared a first look at the housing system it's adding to MMORPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a>, but not without a dig at its main rival <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>.</p>
<p>Though it's still without a release date, the system has been five years in the making and was first revealed at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-in-the-making-world-of-warcrafts-player-housing-the-most-ambitious-expansion-feature-ever-says-blizzard">last year's Warcraft 30th anniversary celebration in November</a>.</p>
<p>Blizzard's main aims for housing are to offer "boundless self-expression", for the system to be "deeply social", and to have a "long-last journey". As such, the toolset will be easy to use, can be experienced solo but is more fun with other players, and will be an evergreen addition to the game with its own roadmap of patches and expansions.</p>

<p>The developer also wants housing to be widely adopted by players. "Most players should want a house in Azeroth, and if a player wants a house in Azeroth, they can have a house in Azeroth," reads this <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24176592">new post on the system</a>.</p>
<p>And that's the first of multiple not-so-subtle digs at Final Fantasy 14. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s MMORPG has had an equivalent housing system for some time, but it's been a notorious point of frustration for players.</p>
<p>Despite changes, players must enter a lottery to purchase one of the popular plots. And even on owned plots, players must enter their house at least once every 45 days to maintain it or it's lost. That means continuing to pay the game's subscription.</p>
<p>"If you want a house, you can have a house," reads the blog post. "No exorbitant requirements or high purchase costs, no lotteries, and no onerous upkeep (and if your subscription lapses, don't worry, your house doesn't get repossessed!)."</p>
<p>It's a cheeky note, but it's also great to see Blizzard learning from its key rival, as both games have long been in competition for players. While World of Warcraft has been praised for its intuitive menus and ease of use, Final Fantasy 14 excels for its story and friendly community.</p>
<p>Executive producer and vice president for World of Warcraft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-says-its-time-to-make-a-bold-statement-with-world-of-warcraft">Holly Longdale spoke to Eurogamer last year</a>, stating it's "time to make a bold statement, it's time to set ourselves up for the next twenty-plus [years]."</p>
<p>Housing is part of that process. The new post details two housing zones, one for Alliance and one for Horde, to promote interaction between players and ensure the zones work as intended. The system is also intended to be "player-first and not revenue-first", though a small number of items will be available in the cash shop (comparable to transmogs and pets).</p>
<p>Houses will also be organised into around 50 plot Neighbourhoods, which will be either public or private, in which players can share rewards.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/world-of-warcraft-getting-customisable-cars-player-housing-and-classic-classics-launching-soon">World of Warcraft's next expansion will be Midnight</a>, which will continue the Worldsoul Saga later this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-release-date-leaked-alongside-a-trailer-showing-off-the-baddies<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>"Kept you waiting, huh?" says Snake. Uh, no, not really. You're actually a bit early this time, mate. The release date for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> was spotted this week, hiding in the long grass of the PlayStation Store. The fancy-schmancy MGS3 remake is coming out in August, according to the store page. And you can also catch sight of a camouflaged trailer if you go looking under the right rocks.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The release date was listed as August 28th on the game's PlayStation page. It has since been taken down and replaced with the vague "2025" but it still appears at the end of a trailer that leaked alongside the date. You can watch it by inspecting <a href="https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202502/0611/2c429928f5c5b20df3c78f5053ace69c011d4f391782ab47.mp4">this mossy URL</a> that looks a bit too human-shaped. </p>
<p>The video shows the bosses our boy must boss about before he beats <em>The</em> Boss and becomes his own Big Boss. You remember all these bad guys from the 2004 original, right? The Fear is a man covered in bees. The Sorrow is a ghostly dude who likes swimming. The Fury is a cosmonaut with a flamethrower. The Vibe is an influencer who vapes eels. Okay I made that last one up. </p>
<p>The release date and trailer haven't been officially announced by Konami yet. It's possible they were planning to unveil it during the next State Of Play broadcast, PlayStation's bi-annual showing off of upcoming games. This has been teased by <a href="https://x.com/Nef_216/status/1885474217132511569">industry rumourmonger NateTheHate</a> as happening some time next week, possibly on Valentine's Day. PlayStation held a State of Play broadcast on February 23rd last year, so there is a precedent for it landing around this time. </p><p>MGS Delta is one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-50-most-anticipated-pc-games-of-2025">our 50 most anticipated games of 2025</a>. A lot of that anticipation rides on good memories of the game going full Kojima. You could kill one boss, an elderly but gifted sniper called "The End", just by fast-forwarding the clock in the settings of your PlayStation 2 until the freakishly accurate geezer died of old age. It is twenty years later, I am almost as old as The End myself, and I still think this gimmick is very funny. </p>
<p>Also, did you know that MGS3's love interest and motor-bi-cyclist Eva was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-will-have-new-dialogue-and-evas-actor-reveals-why-she-chose-a-pseudonym-based-on-her-pet-dog">voiced by the actor who played Ariel</a> in Disney's The Little Mermaid? We got a lot more facts where these come from here at The Rock, The Paper, And Not Forgetting The Shotgun Dot Com. Keep us open in one tab at all times. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-shared-by-super-smash-bros-creator-and-fans-are-going-wild-over-a-new-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Super Smash Bros. creator Masahiro Sakurai has re-posted the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct date and time announcement with a single sound of excitement and fans are freaking out about it teasing a new entry in the beloved brawler series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/masahiro-sakurai-tweets-a-single-syllable-unleashing-avalanche-of-super-smash-bros-6-requests/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>, Sakurai shared the Japanese version of Nintendo's announcement that it will fully unveil the Nintendo Switch 2 on April 2. "Ooh!" he said in the post, and while this could just be his own excitement, fans are hoping it means a new Super Smash Bros. game is coming to the next-generation hardware.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the post doesn't mean too much by itself, there has been a stream of small hints and teases that could signify Sakurai is gearing up for another Super Smash Bros. game reveal. The famed developer began his own YouTube channel in 2022 but wound it down <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/smash-bros-creator-sakurai-says-hes-still-focused-on-making-games">after promising he wasn't done making games</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/smash-bros-creator-masahiro-sakurai-quits-youtube-with-final-video-teasing-mystery-new-game">his final video revealed he'd been working on a new game that could be revealed "sooner or later."</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nothing has been announced regarding a new Super Smash Bros. game, however, and Sakurai said previously <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-smash-bros-director-doesnt-see-how-the-franchise-can-get-any-bigger-than-ultimate">he doesn't know how the franchise can get any bigger or better</a> than the Switch entry, which even includes characters from beyond Nintendo like Sephiroth from Final Fantasy 7, Sora from Kingdom Hearts, Joker from Persona 5, Steve and Alex from Minecraft, and many more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it seems likely there will be a new Super Smash Bros. game for Switch 2, given the incredible sales success of Ultimate (35.88 million and counting). And it's worth remembering Nintendo has released a new Super Smash Bros. game for each of its consoles ever since the launch of the original Super Smash Bros. for N64 in 1999.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

However, it did not resonate with a broad enough audience in this highly competitive market.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most took Wilson’s comments to mean that if Dragon Age: The Veilguard had “shared-world features" and “deeper engagement,” it might have sold more copies. But, as IGN has reported, a development reboot, backed by EA, saw Dragon Age shift from the skeleton of a multiplayer game with repeatable quests, a tech base, and the outline of a story, to a full-blown single-player RPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, former prominent BioWare staff are having their say on social media. David Gaider, who created the setting for Dragon Age and was its narrative lead before leaving BioWare in 2016, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:6idaktmmodnebdn4zeyi7xdn/post/3lhhrokdjcs24" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said EA isn’t learning the right lessons from The Veilguard</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There are certainly all sorts of lessons a company could learn from a game like Veilguard (I still haven't played it, so I'm going off what other people have said), but ‘maybe it should have been live service’ being the takeaway seems a bit short-sighted and self-serving,” Gaider, now creative director at Stray Gods: The Roleplaying Musical developer Summerfall Studios, said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Not that there's any shortage of that, when it comes to deciding why a game doesn't do well. For the anti-woke crowd, for instance, there are woke games that do well and woke games that do poorly and only the ones that did poorly did so *because* they were woke. Says more about them than the game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gaider then said EA should follow the lead of Baldur’s Gate 3 developer Larian and double-down on what Dragon Age did best. Baldur’s Gate 3 is of course a massive hit, and while it has multiplayer co-op, it is a predominantly single-player RPG experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“My advice to EA (not that they care): you have an IP that a lot of people love. Deeply. At its height, it sold well enough to make you happy, right? Look at what it did best at the point where it sold the most. Follow Larian's lead and double down on that. The audience is still there. And waiting,” Gaider continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gaider wasn’t the only former prominent Dragon Age developer to respond to Wilson’s comments. Mike Laidlaw, chief creative officer at Eternal Strands developer Yellow Brick Games and former creative director on Dragon Age, went further and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikelaidlaw.bsky.social/post/3lhhb5ivn3c2h" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> that he’d quit if forced to turn a much-loved single-player game into a purely multiplayer game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Look, I'm not a fancy CEO guy, but if someone said to me ‘the key to this successful single-player IP's success is to make it purely a multiplayer game. No, not a spin off: fundamentally change the DNA of what people loved about the core game’ to me, I'd probably, like, quit that job or something,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Laidlaw continued: “Just thinking out loud, of course. Who'd be silly enough to demand something like that?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“...twice.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot of recent events is that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-dragon-age-fans-fear-the-death-of-the-series-one-former-bioware-developer-offers-words-of-reassurance-dragon-age-isnt-dead-because-its-yours-now">Dragon Age now appears dead</a>, and BioWare is fully focused on Mass Effect 5, which is led by series veterans including Mike Gamble, Preston Watamaniuk, Derek Watts, and Parrish Ley.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA CFO Stuart Canfield touched on EA’s decision to restructure BioWare to focus on the next Mass Effect, which has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-dev-bioware-reportedly-down-to-fewer-than-100-employees-following-layoffs-and-staff-exits">reportedly involved cutting the 200-person studio down to less than 100 people</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Historically, blockbuster storytelling has been the primary way our industry bought beloved IP to players,” Canfield said. “The game's financial performance highlights the evolving industry landscape and reinforces the importance of our actions to reallocate resources towards our most significant and highest potential opportunities.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Ahead of its full release on February 11, Civilization VII developer Firaxis has outlined plans to improve the game with post-launch fixes and new features. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/civilization-7-early-reviews-suggest-a-divisive-experience/1100-6529191/" data-ref-id="1100-6529191">Early reviews for Civilization VII have been mixed so far</a>, while Steam community feedback posts have also highlighted several areas that need to be addressed.</p><p>In a developer update, Firaxis revealed that its primary focus is on the user interface, as it wants to make this part of the game easier to use and read. "We need some time to digest all of your feedback, but some areas that we're already looking into include making UI interactions more intuitive, improving map readability, fixing areas of polish like formatting, and more," Firaxis explained in a <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/message-from-firaxis-games/" rel="nofollow ">blog post</a>. "We're committed to getting this right, and will share more details as soon as we can."</p><p>Firaxis will also be working on implementing several features requested by the community, adding these in via free future updates. While the timing for these has yet to be worked out, the developer says that Civilization VII fans can expect to see the following features added in time:</p><ul><li>Adding Teams to multiplayer games so that you can play cooperatively</li><li>Allowing full player counts in multiplayer in all three Ages through refinements to the Distant Lands system</li><li>Allowing you to pick your starting and ending Age to allow for single- or double-Age games</li><li>Providing a wider variety of map types</li><li>Enabling city and religion names to be customized</li><li>Hotseat multiplayer</li></ul><p>The studio added that is aiming to release Patch 1.1.0 in March, which includes quality-of-life UI adjustments, ongoing AI balance and improvement, adjustments to diplomacy and crises, and additional bug fixes. Currently available in early access on PC, Civilization VII will also be coming to PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Switch.</p><p>The game is also expected to be on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/">Switch 2 via backwards compatibility</a>, and with rumors of the updated Joy-Con controllers having mouse-like functionality, Civilization VII executive producer Dennis Shirk recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-joy-con-rumored-mouse-feature-is-definitely-intriguing-civ-dev-says/1100-6529219/">commented that such a feature is quite intriguing</a>.</p>

                <p>Sports Interactive and Sega have announced that Football Manager 25 is canceled and will the developer will instead focus on their next release.</p><p>The developer provided a lengthy explanation as to why Football Manager 25 was canceled. While many of the game's areas hit the developer's internal targets, the overarching player experience and interface weren't up to standard. Through evaluations and playtesting, the development team was confident in a new direction, but the desired standards were ultimately still too far away. However, the team will take their learnings onto the next project.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/FootballManager/status/1887691360217579847" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Sports Interactive regret to inform that, following extensive internal discussion and careful consideration with SEGA, we have made the difficult decision to cancel Football Manager 25. <a href="https://t.co/tLRbq8305K" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/tLRbq8305K</a></p>  — Football Manager (@FootballManager) <a href="https://twitter.com/FootballManager/status/1887691360217579847?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 7, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>"Each decision to delay the release was made with the aim of getting the game closer to the desired level but, as we approached critical milestones at the turn of the year, it became unmistakably clear that we would not achieve the standard required, even with the adjusted timeline," Sports Interactive and Sega said in a <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/development-update-football-manager-25-1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>.</p><p>Football Manager 25 was already delayed twice from its original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/football-manager-25-delayed-cutting-some-features/1100-6526298/" data-ref-id="1100-6526298">early November 2024 release to later that month</a>, then again to <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/football-manager-25-delayed-until-march-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">March 2025</a>. The developer considered delaying the game further and fixing it down the line via patches, but decided against that. Additionally, anything past a March release would've been too late into the football season to expect players to then buy another game later in the same year, presumably Football Manager 26.</p><p>Those who've preordered the game are eligible for automatic refunds, which are expected to take place soon.</p><p>Football Manager 24 will also not receive an update with 2024/2025 data as that would take away development resources from the studio's next game.</p><p>Football Manager 25 isn't the only game to get canceled so far this year.

            <p>
Civilization 7 players say they can hear coughing and grunting while browsing the game's Age Transition screen - and now publisher 2K has acknowledged the issue. 
</p>
<p>
A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1ij1clt/you_can_hear_a_person_coughing_and_typing_on_a/">lengthy reddit thread discussing the problem</a> includes examples of strange audio clips that players have recorded - and yes, you can clearly hear something going on in the background, behind the Age Transition menu's soaring orchestral music. 
</p>
<p>
"I thought maybe I'd left a stream on or was somehow in a Discord call," one player reported, "but I double-checked and no. You can really hear a person clearing their throat and coughing throughout the music. I'm not sure how this is even possible but it's kind of hilarious if you ask me."
</p>
<p>
Other examples uploaded to YouTube include <a href="https://www.youtube.com/clip/Ugkxa4lknNnwAGn-x5jMADoovq8ix8SxiSbn">snippets of characters grunting</a>, or the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeYvr1q4Ev8&amp;ab_channel=HansAnonymous">sounds of swordfighting</a>.

<p>But rather than the game's actual music track being taped over by someone with a sore throat, 2K has said a more benign reason is likely to blame.</p>
<p>
"During an Age Transition, players might hear strange noises," a 2K spokesperson confirmed, in a <a href="https://support.civilization.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/38315115956371-Audio-from-the-Main-Menu-plays-during-Age-Transition">post on the official Civilization support site</a>. "This is likely due to the audio from the Main Menu being played over Age Transition screens.
</p>
<p>
"This means you may hear short voice lines, shuffling around, and general idle noises while on the Age Transition menu."
</p>
<p>
Other players report hearing audio from the leader they're playing as looping in the background, including mumbling and clothes rustling.
</p>
<p>
Earlier today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firaxis-acknowledges-civilization-7-issues-fixes-incoming">Firaxis issued a blog post acknowledging Civilization 7's mixed response from players so far</a>, and pledging a raft of updates designed to address key community-requested changes and features. 
</p>
<p>
These will include improvements to UI interactions and map readability, as well as adding Teams to multiplayer games and adding in hotseat multiplayer.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-review">Eurogamer's Civilization 7 review</a> described it as "a competent entry with some poorly executed ideas and a striking lack of personality".

<p>Whilst the full number of redundancies has yet to be confirmed, it's thought as many as <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7293546668661088256?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAm1ussB7WN8Nl0t2ZjfV1jBWWgwg3DvGQc">69 employees</a> have been impacted.</p>

<p>It seems few areas of the company are unscathed, with job losses reported across esports, community, design, QA, marketing, and UI/UX.</p>
<p>"Unfortunately the UI/UX team was impacted by the Hi-Rez layoffs today - myself included," said UI/UX designer, Amanda.</p>
<p>"It has been an amazing journey to go from fan of a game to creating content for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/smite">Smite</a> and Paladins. I have had the honour of working with some immensely talented humans!"</p>
<p>These cuts come on top of a similar round of cuts back in October, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/smite-2-studio-hi-rez-lays-off-undisclosed-number-of-employees">Hi-Rez announced it was laying off an undisclosed number of employees</a> in order to "ensure [the company's] long-term success".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Krafton has announced PUBG: Blindspot is the new name for their upcoming 5v5 top-down tactical shooter, codenamed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/project-arc">Project ARC</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to the rebrand and a new gameplay trailer, they’ve also confirmed that PUBG: Blindspot will have a playable demo during Steam Next Fest, starting on 21st February.</p>
<p><iframe title="PUBG: BLINDSPOT | Official Steam Next Fest Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3jP7p9DAKKI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The name’s a pretty good one, to be honest. Blindspot pulls the camera out to give a birds eye view of the level, but shows and hides enemies from view depending on cones of vision that are blocked and obscured by the level scenery and layout. Vision is a shared resource, though, so you get to see what the rest of your team can, helping to coordinate your efforts.</p>
<p>Blindspot currently has two game modes: a straight up Team Deathmatch, and the main mode that is called Demolition – a straight up riff on Search &amp; Destroy, where teams attack or defend an attempt to plant a bomb, with team eliminations also enabled.</p>

<p>We got to go hands on with this late last year, saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/08/project-arc-preview-pubg-studios-tactical-shooter-from-the-top-down/">our preview</a> “There’s just something about the top-down angle and the shared team vision that makes the game feel lighter than Siege, to me, and that’s something that I really hope resonates with gamers at large. I can definitely see this working really well on consoles, as well.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-%E2%80%93-how-to-save-at-any-time-without-using-savior-schnapps-potions.1103022/</guid>

			<p>Like its predecessor, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II doesn't really want to make things easy for the player, featuring some unique gameplay systems that require full understanding to take advantage of them and some other systems that may feel a little dated, such as a saving system that requires you to use a specific item, Savior Schnapps potions, to save the game at any time while away from Henry's bed. As the second entry in the series developed by Warhorse Studios is all about making choices and living with their consequences, such a saving system makes quite a bit of sense to prevent any sort of save scumming.</p>
<p>For some players, however, having to use items to access a very basic functionality like saving the game anywhere is a big no. Thankfully, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II features some workarounds to this issue that are accessible on both PC and consoles and are, overall, rather convenient.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/20250207125020_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Things are obviously easier on PC, as there's a mod called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/kingdomcomedeliverance2/mods/14" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Unlimited Saving II</a> that allows you to save anytime without using Savior Schnapps potions. Better yet, using this mod doesn't disable Achievements if you're into collecting them, so there's really no reason not to use this mod if you don't like the vanilla game's saving system.</p>
<p>On consoles, Kingdom Come: Deliverance II makes it a little harder to cheat the saving system, but not by much. As you probably already know, the game's main menu features a Save and Quit option that allows you to quit the game at any time without losing progress. This option can easily be abused to actually save at any time, as the game doesn't delete your save file as it gets loaded. The only downside to this is that you will have to go through the loading screen again, but this isn't a major problem on both PlayStation 5 and Xbox consoles, as load times are very fast, and you will only have to wait a few seconds before diving back in. Using this saving method is extremely good for beginners who never played the original game, as it allows them to experiment with the game's many somewhat obscure mechanics without risking losing tons of progress due to the vanilla's hardcore saving system.</p>

            <p>Hi-Rez Studios have laid off an unknown number of the studio's employees, only one month after launching MOBA sequel <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/smite-2">Smite 2</a> as a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/smite-2s-aladdin-will-trap-players-in-a-lamp-with-an-angry-genie-as-the-moba-becomes-free-to-play">free-to-play beta</a>. It looks like management has cut at least 20-30 jobs and the full number is likely higher. As a result, three other games that have been long-running staples of the studio will no longer get any updates. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/smite">Smite</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paladins">Paladins</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rogue-company">Rogue Company</a> will have nobody to man the code cannons, so they're being left to gather cobwebs from now on. Although they will remain playable. </p>

<p>"In light of challenging market conditions, Hi-Rez is implementing a reduction in force," the studio said in a Discord message <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/smite-and-paladins-dead-as-hi-rez-lays-off-dozens-of-employees-3058743/">spotted by Dexerto</a>. "Smite 2 will continue to be the focus of the newly streamlined operations. These reductions should enable a steady flow of new content and the continued development of Smite 2, while aligning team costs with revenues."</p>
<p>Hi-Rez haven't stated the exact number of people they've axed from the workplace. But <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Smite/comments/1ij5sjy/hirez_layoffs_megathread/">a Reddit megathread of workers affected</a> includes 23 people at the time of writing, while Smite YouTuber "Hayzer" <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eazBFw1skA4">estimates 50-60 people have been hit</a>. Among those hit are programmers, UI artists, QA folk, marketing people, and producers - a full grab-bag of roles. </p>
<p>This comes just four months after the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-rez-studios-lay-off-unknown-number-of-workers-to-give-smite-2-a-sustainable-future">last round of job cuts at the company</a>, which itself followed a round of cuts in June 2023 (that one saw around 30 people made unemployed). All these emnployees have been shown the door to give Smite 2 "sustainability", according to Hi-Rez management. The CEO of Hi-Rez, Stewart Chisam, deleted his social media account on X in the aftermath of this week's layoffs. </p><p>As for all the non-Smite 2 games, the studio is still keeping Paladins up even if it won't see any further updates. "We plan to keep the servers and currently available content running as long as possible to allow you to continue to enjoy the game," they say. The first Smite will get the same treatment for now. The previous layoffs saw these two games being staffed by "small teams supporting light updates". But now it seems even those small teams are not wanted by the company.</p>
<p>I'm no business bro, but things don't look good for Hi-Rez in general. Aside from the continuing self-bleeding of talent from the studio, they've now gone all-in on a MOBA that frankly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/smite-2-early-access-review">isn't that exciting</a> according to our reviewer Matt (RPS in peace), who noted that Valve's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a> is already halfway up its own lanes and looking quite beefy.</p>
<p>It continues to be a hard few years for workers in the games industry. We keep a tag that tracks recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">layoffs</a>. But to be honest, it's hard to catch and report on them all. Especially when companies like BioWare <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-call-a-job-cut-a-job-cut">refuse to speak in plain language</a> about their job cuts.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
