            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/towers-of-aghasba-early-access-preview-promising-future<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ever since the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4194f220-0158-4c21-86bf-7d9322d3390d" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/towers-of-aghasba-hands-off-preview-revitalize-island-with-new-mechanics" rel="nofollow"><strong>hands-off preview event</strong></a> showcasing&nbsp;<em>Towers of Aghasba,&nbsp;</em>I've been excited to get my hands on a copy and see how the ecosystems and biomes work. The art looked amazing, the creature designs varied, and being able to heal animals and the land is something I love IRL. Getting to try out new mechanics related to restoring the environment, as well as the fresh take it gives crafting games, really drew my interest. After multiple ecosystems, two save games, and more, this is my take on the title.&nbsp;</p>

<hr><p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b2ff7c2f-3a27-4fa4-89cd-ea40cb660f04" href="https://techraptor.net/games/towers-of-aghasba" rel="nofollow"><strong><i>Towers of Aghasba</i></strong></a>&nbsp;is a new crafting-building game under the survival genre. To call it a simple survival game, however, is to diminish the unique mechanics that set it apart from other titles. A focus on restoring the natural world, balancing human expansion, and defeating the Withered corruption combine to create a visually compelling and saturated world that is ever-changing.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towers-of-aghasba-huldra-forest-god.jpg?itok=B3n1F3Gl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towers-of-aghasba-huldra-forest-god.jpg?itok=55EDxTbM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There are multiple ways you can play&nbsp;<em>Towers of Aghasba,&nbsp;</em>each resulting in a different world. Depending on where you put your Colossal Seed, the types of animals attracted will change. Different biomes sprout different plants, and each time you grow the tree, you'll see new plants and animals appear.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You're not tasked with just revitalizing the ecosystems of Aghasba, but the civilization of the Shimu, as well. Collecting resources, building up different villages, and restoring relics of the past are linked to the colossal trees. There's a price for human expansion, however.</p>

<p>Amity, the essence of life found in living things, is used to fuel the environments around the Colossal trees, activate portals, and more. Picking plants, chopping trees, and killing animals all deplete your Amity. Rarer resources take larger amounts of Amity. You'll even take damage if you pick something with no Amity to give.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towers-of-aghasba-king-flower-temperate-colossal-tree-growing.jpg?itok=ZjS9jrhv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towers-of-aghasba-king-flower-temperate-colossal-tree-growing.jpg?itok=d3aU2spM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The give and take of Amity is a mechanic that enforces respecting nature and only taking what you need. Without Amity you won't be able to upgrade ecosystems, unlock any fast travel, or restore Sacred Forests. These are all needed to keep your villages and capital city going.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On top of that, there's the Withered, the main enemies in <em>Towers of Aghasba</em>. A pestilence on the land, Withered areas sap your health. Withered nests are surrounded by various enemies, all looking to take your life. There's some variation to the enemies, but most of the ones you'll encounter are humanoid, giant hands, or spiders. There's an arachnophobia setting for those who fear the creepy crawlies. With that said, there's not a lot of variety in Withered enemies as of yet.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first chapter of the Shimu in&nbsp;<em>Towers of Aghasba</em>&nbsp;is fully fleshed out in the Early Access release. There's humor in the narrative, as well as a serious tone concerning the extinction of the Jubanga and nature. Most of the story revolves around learning the history of the Shimu and their flight from Aghasba.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towers-of-aghasba-underwater.jpg?itok=rXKzppck 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towers-of-aghasba-underwater.jpg?itok=6k03p6SM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This all takes place in a visually rich and diverse land. All backgrounds are hand-painted with inspiration drawn from Studio Ghibli films, such as&nbsp;<em>Naussica of the Valley of Wind.&nbsp;</em>When a shrine is restored or a tree upgraded, the transformation art is amazing. The unfurling of vines, sprouting of grass, and blossoming of flowers is a sight to see.&nbsp;</p>

<p>While it all sounds fantastic,&nbsp;<em>Towers of Aghasba</em>&nbsp;is an early access title that comes with its own share of problems. Some bugs are to be expected, but you can clip through rocks while swimming, lag can cause enemies to jump locations, game crashes, and inconsistent atmospheric music. Some things have been greatly improved in the few patches that have gone live since the game's release, but there are still various glitches that need to be worked out.</p>

<p>This has caused multiple changes in recipes and items. Some recipes haven't appeared where they're supposed to. Stations are having their plans changed, if they show up at all. Animals and plants aren't loading properly, even though a fix was deployed. The first month may be filled with multiple small updates to improve the quality of the game and address issues players experience.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/towers-of-aghasba-rebuilt-shrine.jpg?itok=zuu4NfeV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/towers-of-aghasba-rebuilt-shrine.jpg?itok=gA-L3cfR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Along with the bugs, there's the actual premise of the game. Having different creatures spawn depending on ecosystem proximity, and other location factors, is a complex mechanic. This also impacts resources in the area and what becomes available to the player. Balancing the inputs, outputs, how these resources affect multiplayer interactions, and game requirements all take fine-tuning.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Thankfully, the dev team at Dreamlit is on top of it all, ensuring bugs are dealt with quickly, while focusing on continuing to create more compelling content. The roadmap for future updates is impressive, and will include access to the region the fourth god is in. It's expected access to the Sea Temple to the southwest of mainland Aghasba will also come soon.&nbsp;</p>

Swamp and Mountain are in the works, with a Mountain biome most likely going to the north of Moyo Vale and containing snow. While these ecosystems appear to be coming towards the end of 2025, a new area is set to come in an update in early 2025. With the roadmap going into 2026 it can be surmised that the Early Access phase will last over a year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I know I'm excited to see new enemies, new animals, how creature relationships can improve, and potentially expand the game further. For those that are interested in a new take on city building, and crafting, with some survival mixed in,&nbsp;<em>Towers of Aghasba</em>&nbsp;is the game to try. I'll be keeping an eye for future development and new content to see where Early Access takes the game.&nbsp;</p>

Sony could have chosen any game to end the montage on—<em>The Last of Us</em>,<em> Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, <em>God of War</em>, <em>Astro Bot</em>—and any vague sentiment—love, friendship, action, adventure—to leave players with. Concluding with <em>Bloodborne</em> and its fans’ relentless calls for more <em>Bloodborne</em> was certainly a choice. </p><p>Some have called using a 30th-anniversary celebration to target <em>Bloodborne</em> sickos “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/shinobi602/status/1863626399568785857&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/shinobi602/status/1863626399568785857" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pure evil</a></span>.” “Someone at PlayStation woke up and chose violence today,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Hazz3r/status/1863602943246647347&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Hazz3r/status/1863602943246647347" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> another.

Will the notorious 30fps action game finally get a 60fps mode on PS5? Could fans be in for a full-blown remaster with a PS5 Pro enhanced mode like <em>Demon’s Souls</em> received? Or maybe this is just a knowing wink at a community with a penchant for grandiose speculation and perennial disappointment. </p><p>There have been more rumors than usual flying around following a particularly intriguing coincidence. The December 3 anniversary, an easter egg for which seemed to be teasing more announcements <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-showcase-state-play-30th-anniversary-sony-playstati-1851696796&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-showcase-state-play-30th-anniversary-sony-playstati-1851696796">in a recent PS5 slim trailer</a></span>, also happens to be when <em>Bloodborne</em> servers go <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1h1m2pi/bloodborne_servers_are_undergoing_maintenance_on/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1h1m2pi/bloodborne_servers_are_undergoing_maintenance_on/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">down for scheduled maintenance</a></span>, which was first announced several weeks ago. Probably nothing, right? Right?</p><p>It’s never been exactly clear what the hold-up is, given the <em>Dark Souls </em>spiritual spin-off’s critical acclaim and sales success (7.5 million copies sold by last count). FromSoftware made it, but Sony owns the rights. Maybe neither party can agree on what it would take to bring the game into the future nearly a decade later. Bluepoint Games, which made the <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> and <em>Demon’s Soul</em> remakes, felt like an obvious candidate to work on an update but is reportedly in pre-production for its own original IP. </p><p>Whatever the case may be, <em>Bloodborne</em> fans will never give up. Sony’s acknowledgment of that fact means we’ve just entered a brand new phase of “<em>Bloodborne</em> remake when” chants routinely breaking out on social media and PlayStation showcase livestream chats.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-squid-game-crossover</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-squid-game-crossover-announced-for-january.1049778/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-squid-game-crossover<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Activision Blizzard has announced a&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty Squid Game&nbsp;</em>crossover for January, and if that one was on your bingo card, then I'm going to need you to tell me where you get your bingo cards from.</p>

<p>We don't know too much about the crossover yet; it's presumably set to coincide with the start of&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>'s Season 2, so we likely won't learn more until we're just a couple of weeks away from that season's commencement.</p>

<p>However, we do know that the worlds of&nbsp;<em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>will collide in some way. Presumably,&nbsp;<em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>will worm its way into both&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Warzone</em>, but we'll have to wait and see.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-squid-game-paper.jpg?itok=qpX5rIBU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-squid-game-paper.jpg?itok=fqCLmqDW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The worlds of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>are about to collide.</figcaption></figure><p>In the very brief teaser trailer released earlier today, a soldier walks into a room and sees two other soldiers on the floor, presumably dead.</p>

<p>Between the soldiers' bodies, he sees a small piece of paper, which he picks up. On that paper are three symbols: a circle, a triangle, and a square. They're not PlayStation symbols, though; they're the distinctive&nbsp;<em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>shapes that appear on workers' masks in the show.</p>

<p>We then cut to a rather clever variation on the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>logo that includes the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Squid Game&nbsp;</em>symbols. It's really not much to go on, but hey, if you're a&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>fan, you can have some fun theorizing what the crossover might entail before it lands.</p>




<p>This is, of course, far from&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>'s first weird crossover. The franchise has previously entertained the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shredder-from-tmnt-stalks-into-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-warzone-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>' Shredder</a>, noted gamer fuels <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-teams-up-with-mt-dew-and-doritos-for-charity-and-loot" rel="nofollow">Mountain Dew and Doritos</a>, and other strange collaborations as guests.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>news, the franchise's latest game&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-series-sales-black-ops-6-launch" rel="nofollow">enjoyed the biggest launch</a> the series has ever seen, helping to catapult&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>as a whole over the 500 million sales mark.</p>

<p>That's despite a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-paid-audio-option" rel="nofollow">rather dubious audio pack</a> announced prior to the game's launch, one that seemingly enhances in-game audio like gunshots and footsteps for players willing to fork out a little extra cash.</p>

            <p>
Every now and then, somebody has the marvellous idea of developing technology that <a href="https://www.inverse.com/tech/gamescent-ai-device-smell-video-games-price-release-date">makes video games smell</a>. I have never been more grateful for this recurrent Quixotic daydream's mass market failure than when watching trailers for Urge, an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> survival shooter that is both fuelled and plagued by piss.
</p>
<p>
"But hold your horses, young Edwin," you sternly interject. "I do not wish to hear about, let alone play an open world <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> shooter that is both fuelled and plagued by piss, on a website that children might read. It sounds like a cheap, taboo-jabbing gimmick." Friend, I once thought as you. But then I did a little research, as is my journalistic responsibility, and it turns out Urge's notions about piss - bladdergold, as they call it in the West Country, or Crusoe Cola, as it's known in the States - are rather in-depth. I'm still very glad I can't smell the game, but I definitely have the urge to play it.

<p>
Urge is currently in early access, having launched in 2021 with that most respectable of final release dates - When It's Done, You Grasping Ingrates, And Not One Second Before. It starts with you pulling yourself out of a car crash and investigating a world suffused with a mysterious fog. Not the nice kind of mysterious fog, mind you. Not fog like in Silent Hill, where it symbolises repressed trauma while elegantly covering up the limitations of the game engine. Nothing so wholesome. This fog is, basically, wee smoke. And the world of Urge consists largely of wee. 
</p><p>
Some of it erupts from the ground in stinking geysers. Some of it fills the wobbly heads of the mutants who shamble up to murder you - victims of a strange addiction whose origins may lie in the map's larger industrial areas, or in the tunnels and sewers beneath.</p>
<p>In a fanciful reinterpretation of piss thermodynamics that is seemingly justified by the lore, some of the wee exists as powder - dusting the tops of storage cases, released in gusts by latrine-shaped gourds, or forming horrible ammoniac stalactites indoors. And some of it is contained by your character, and must be regularly excreted in the course of attending to other survival game needs like hunger, thirst and shelter.
</p>
<p>
Whether liquid or powder, piss must be disposed of correctly, because if it's disposed of incorrectly - for example, by widdling on the ground rather than into a proper toilet - it'll add to the world's fog. The more fog there is, the more enemies there are, and the worse those enemies become. Think giant yellow spiders, chainsaw dudes in soiled hazmats, and tall, hollow-eyed creatures who look to me like urine cakes pounded flat. Also, piss meteors. Piss lightning too. 
</p>
<p>
Mitigating the spread of wee-wee is difficult, and not just because you will occasionally need to spend a penny yourself (you can also drink the stuff if you don't have any other potable fluids to hand, like poison or blood). In the world of Urge, piss can be transformed into fuel for things like abandoned vehicles, which emit gauzy yellow clouds of piss vapour when in motion. As such, play appears to involve regular alternations in fog intensity, with you building and crafting to minimise the spillage of urine while periodically, as it were, pissing it all up because you need to drive to another town.
</p><p>
I'm... compelled by all this partly for the extremely online leftwing reason that it feels like a metaphor for climate change. But looking at it from more of a design standpoint, I also like the sound of a survival game that encourages you to survive with delicacy and discretion, lest you bring about a golden apocalypse. Perhaps there's an RPS diary series in it? <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1304350/Urge/">You can read more on Steam</a>. As Ollie noted in the meeting earlier, the Steam page amuses partly for the great care taken not to use the word "piss" too often, presumably to avoid rousing the distaste of Steam's curation algorithms.

Is it because the game is a few days away from launching on December 6? Could it be because it’s a game my friends and I might actually play together after almost all of them stopped playing <em>Overwatch 2</em>? Or is it just because my relationship with <em>Overwatch </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-anniversary-pve-story-events-skins-shop-1851665897&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-anniversary-pve-story-events-skins-shop-1851665897">has grown so cold</a></span> that I’m willing to seek comfort in the warm embrace of another hero shooter? Yes to all of the above, but it’s not what’s fueling my newfound hype; it’s the anime OP-ass launch trailer NetEase put out over the weekend.</p><p>The trailer doubles as both a launch trailer and a reveal of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-character-x-men-avengers-fantastic-1851614564&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-character-x-men-avengers-fantastic-1851614564">final five heroes</a></span> joining <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ launch roster. Iron Fist, Black Widow, Cloak and Dagger (think Ice Climbers from <em>Smash Bros. </em>with two characters being one playable entity), Squirrel Girl, and Wolverine will all join the line-up of 33 heroes pushing legally distinct payloads. That’s all well and good, and I’ll probably give comic-accurate short king Wolverine a try, but what I’m most excited by today is how NetEase and vocalist Chrissy Costanza created the kind of hero showcase music video you only see in front of an anime that makes you believe in the power of friendship. Costanza’s vocals on “Rivals ‘Til the End” soar over action-packed scenes of Marvel’s greatest heroes doing hero shit. All the cool team-ups—like Hulk throwing Wolverine and Magik teleporting Psylocke up the side of an exploding skyscraper—are sick, but every cool moment is elevated by how good the song is. It’s peak anime opening, and I hope it plays when you boot up the game, because you will not catch me skipping it.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196049" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="196049,196653,196880" data-current="196049"><div><p>This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21580.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Luckily, all this excitement isn’t unfounded.

I picked the PS2 theme, and not only did it add all the abstract blue and green objects from the PS2 boot menu to my PS5's dashboard, it also changed all the colors in all the menus and added PS2 menu noises to everything. I didn’t realize until swapping between the different themes how burnt into my brain some of these old PlayStation noises are and how much nostalgia I had for them all these years (decades?!) later. </p><p>However, the big star of this update, in my opinion, and why you should boot up your PS5 as soon as possible is the newly added OG PlayStation 1 boot-up video and sounds. When I restarted my PS5 console after confirming the update and installing it, I was greeted with the techno-operatic and very loud chime of the classic PlayStation boot-up logos, complete with the echo fade out of metal clinking. </p><p>Here’s what the logo looks and sounds like via a phone recording from me: </p><p>I half expected <em>Twisted Metal </em>or <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater</em> to start playing after all the noises had subsided. Later, when I turned off the console to write this post, the PS5 had even updated that screen to add a little message thanking me for playing over the last 30 years. </p><p>Weirdly, while this stuff is rad and awesome, Sony says that it’s just temporary and eventually it will go away. I’m not sure why Sony would remove this stuff from PS5 as it’s a nice way to acknowledge the past and let people enjoy their expensive consoles a bit more. But what do I know? Anyway, if you want to get on this PlayStation nostalgia, don’t wait too long to boot up your PS5. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Virtus.pro was just forcefully ejected from the Shanghai Major by Wildcard, the esports organisation co-owned by Amouranth. In a crushing defeat, Virtus.pro failed to gain traction against the underdog side that is also facing elimination. </p>



<p>It was a particularly sour loss for Virtus.pro, given that the team is made up of champion-grade players but failed to secure a meaningful win during the opening stage of the Shanghai Major.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-poor-show">Poor Show</h2>



<p>Virtus.pro will be heading home with just $10,000 in winnings, which won’t go a long way towards covering the costs of getting to Shanghai in the first place. It was a struggle from start to finish for Virtus.pro, with the team managing to secure just one win – and that was against Rare Atom, a bottom-table Chinese side with short legs in the game.</p>



<p>Rare Atom’s biggest claim to fame in this event is that the team sent Fnatic packing. The European organisation lost against Wildcard, Cloud9, and finally Rare Item, failing to secure a single point before being ejected from the tournament.</p>



<p>Virus.pro is the latest team to leave the competition in Shanghai, and the team is facing some ridicule on social media because the ultimate loss came at the hands of Wildcard, a team co-owned by Amouranth, the scandalous, controversial content creator. In June, Amouranth secured a significant ownership stake in the North American organisation.</p>



<p>The remaining matches in the opening stage of the Shanghai Major will wrap tomorrow, and then from December 5, the elimination stage will unravel. This round features some of the biggest names in CS2 esports, and it will end with just eight teams making it into the playoff stage, fighting for the $500,000 grand prize.</p>

Reliving a story that was foundational to my youth, looking and sounding as great as I remember it, with the opportunity to alter it in sometimes dramatic new ways is clever, and the addition of tools to attempt to create our own stories could elevate the experiment even further if a community can figure out how to make the most of them."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What is Cyber Monday?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Traditionally, Black Friday was the in-store shopping frenzy, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-vs-cyber-monday">Cyber Monday focused on online deals</a>.

                <p>It has been an excruciatingly long wait for Indiana Jones fans, but at long last, a brand-new video game in the franchise is on its way. First revealed in 2021, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" data-ref-id="5000-525173">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</a> will be arriving later this year, giving fans a chance to don the trademark fedora of the two-fisted archeologist as he uses his wits and whip to explore historical landmarks and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesdas-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-denounces-nazis-with-in-game-statement/1100-6527469/" data-ref-id="1100-6527469">pummel Nazis</a>.</p><p>Now that the game is almost here, Microsoft and MachineGames have revealed more of its story details and have shown off some of its whip-cracking gameplay in action. Some elements are still being kept locked up tighter than the treasures in an Atlantean tomb, but for now, here's everything that we know about Indiana Jones and the Great Circle so far.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Release_date">Release date</a></li><li><a href="#Will_Indiana_Jones_and_the_Great_Circle_be_available_through_Game_Pass_">Will Indiana Jones and the Great Circle be available through Game Pass?</a></li><li><a href="#Platforms">Platforms</a></li><li><a href="#Indiana_Jones_and_the_Great_Circle_editions">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle editions</a></li><li><a href="#Story">Story</a></li><li><a href="#Setting">Setting</a></li><li><a href="#Gameplay">Gameplay</a></li><li><a href="#Graphics_and_performance">Graphics and performance</a></li><li><a href="#Is_Lucasfilm_involved_in_the_development_of_Indiana_Jones_and_the_Great_Circle_">Is Lucasfilm involved in the development of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle?</a></li><li><a href="#Is_Harrison_Ford_in_Indiana_Jones_and_the_Great_Circle_">Is Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle?</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="Release_date">Release date</h2><p>First revealed back in 2021, Indiana Jones and The Great Circle is currently scheduled to launch on <strong>December 9, 2024</strong>, which is a Monday.

There's your regular version, the Premium Edition that gets you early access, and a Collector's Edition that comes with an adventure journal, premium digital content, and an 11-inch globe with a magnetic airplane and a secret compartment.</p><h2 id="Story">Story</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4248284-indy-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4248284" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4248284-indy-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4248284"></a><figcaption>Maybe he's seen some snakes.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4248284-indy-4.jpg"></figure><p>Set between Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, The Great Circle sees Jones embark on a globetrotting adventure as the famed archeologist works on uncovering one of history's greatest mysteries. Since it's set in 1937, Jones will face stiff opposition from Nazis looking to plunder the world's treasures for their own nefarious purposes. The relic hunter won't be alone, as he'll reunite with old friends in his adventure and team up with new allies throughout his expedition.</p><p>As for <em>what </em>the Great Circle is? MachineGames isn't ready to spill the beans yet on this concept. Still, game director Jerk Gustafsson did reference how these circles are used for navigation purposes and that a "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-what-the-great-circle-is-in-the-indiana-jones-game/1100-6520454/">very real and mysterious</a>" great circle on Earth connects several historical sites. "Their connection has remained a mystery, and this provides the perfect adventure for our game," Gustafsson said.</p><p>According to MachineGames, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-has-almost-enough-cut-scenes-for-two-movies/1100-6528083/" data-ref-id="1100-6528083">the game will have nearly four hours of cutscenes</a>, which equates to nearly Indiana Jones movies in length.</p><h2 id="Setting">Setting</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4248281-indy-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4248281" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4248281-indy-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4248281"></a><figcaption>A closer look at Sukhotai temple.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4248281-indy-6.jpg"></figure><p>Get ready for some digital tourism, as The Great Circle will take Indy from his familiar stomping grounds of Marshall College in Connecticut to the ancient halls of the Vatican, the arid deserts of Egypt, the sunken temples of Sukhothai, and the icy peaks of the Himalayas. These locations will see Indy face off against human enemies and dodge ancient traps as he solves puzzles, leading to some blockbuster moments of action when all hell breaks loose.</p><p>"We wanted to explore where Indy would be at this time, having just separated from Marion, being sort of lost again, adrift in his own obsessions with his work," Gustafsson added.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-devs-accessed-special-archive-to-create-authentic-adventure/1100-6526571/" data-ref-id="1100-6526571">Indy fans can also expect an authentic adventure</a>, as MachineGames worked closely with Lucasfilm Games, drawing from an archive of unseen Indiana Jones material to help craft this globe-trotting romp.</p><h2 id="Gameplay">Gameplay</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20x3FPB_G5I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/20x3FPB_G5I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>According to design director Jens Andersson, The Great Circle will mostly be a first-person game with a few moments of third-person gameplay. "Our game is about putting you in the shoes of an iconic hero," Andersson said. "Since we are doing this mostly in first-person, you have the chance to truly become Indy. First-person makes you part of this world--allowing you to explore and experience things more intimately."</p><p>In typical Indiana Jones fashion, you'll also be punching, shooting, and whipping your way through enemies, but if you'd prefer a stealthier approach, you can avoid combat and stick to the shadows. If you've played MachineGames' Wolfenstein games, this will sound pretty familiar, as those titles also juggled the ability to play as a covert operative making a destructive entrance. And in case you're worried about harming dogs, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-has-a-humane-solution-for-battling-dogs/1100-6527484/" data-ref-id="1100-6527484">the game has a very humane way of dealing with them</a>.</p><p>Locations also feature optional puzzles to solve, and when things do go pear-shaped, Indy can use his environment, quick thinking, and whip to his advantage. During the third-person sections of the game, the camera will zoom out and give players a better view of Indy as he navigates traps and uses his whip to overcome them.</p><p>"Indiana Jones and the Great Circle feels like an amalgam of many genres but appears to be striking the right balance between them, all in favor of honoring the spirit of Indiana Jones, the archaeology professor <em>and </em>adventurer," Kurt Indovina <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-hands-on-preview/1100-6527431/" data-ref-id="1100-6527431">wrote in a hands-on preview of the game</a>.</p><h2 id="Graphics_and_performance">Graphics and performance</h2><p>On Xbox Series X|S, MachineGames is aiming to have the game run at 60fps. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-targeting-60fps-on-xbox-series-x-and-series-s/1100-6527479/" data-ref-id="1100-6527479">Game director Axel Torvenius said</a> the game should "feel cohesive" and that means "running smoothly at 60[fps] on both [Xbox Series X and S]."</p><h2 id="Is_Lucasfilm_involved_in_the_development_of_Indiana_Jones_and_the_Great_Circle_">Is Lucasfilm involved in the development of Indiana Jones and the Great Circle?</h2><p>One reassuring fact about the development of the new Indiana Jones game is that MachineGames has worked closely with Lucasfilm Games to create an authentic entry in the franchise. You can see the results of this in Indy's design and the world around him, as the game looks like it was ripped straight from the original trilogy of films. Lifelong Indiana Jones fan and Bethesda creative director Todd Howard is also involved, as he'll periodically check in on the game's development in his role as an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elder-scrolls-boss-todd-howard-clarifies-his-involvement-in-new-indiana-jones-game/1100-6497886/">executive producer</a>.</p><h2 id="Is_Harrison_Ford_in_Indiana_Jones_and_the_Great_Circle_">Is Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4248279-indy-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4248279" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4248279-indy-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4248279"></a><figcaption>We recognize that face!</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4248279-indy-1.jpg"></figure><p>Kind of! While Ford's grizzled mug has been digitally transferred to his in-game character model--signature facial scar and all--he won't be voiced by the legendary actor. Instead, Troy Baker will be breathing life into this incarnation of Jones, as Ford had previously committed to never playing the role again after he finished work on Dial of Destiny. Horror movie icon Tony Todd will also be in the game, lending his voice to a "mysterious giant of a man" who steals a seemingly insignificant artifact from Indy's college.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/marketing/the-art-of-balance-in-community-management<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Introduction:"><span>Introduction:</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In community management, keeping in touch with fans is key. A community manager acts as a bridge between devs and players, responds to community feedback, and keeps expectations in check. Communicating with fans is something I know well, because before I was the Community Manager for The Battle of Polytopia, I was a fan of the game myself.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I first discovered The Battle of Polytopia as a fan of Civilisation, another strategy-based game. This was when I stumbled on the Midjiwan Discord group, which had under 100 players in it at the time. I became the moderator of the group, and then the manager, before being given the opportunity to transform it into the official Discord group. In 2019, I became the official Community Manager. From</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> then </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">to now, the group has grown from 2,000 to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>46,000!</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Having experienced both sides of the community, one of my key take-aways has been that a crucial part of fostering strong community growth is striking a balance between fan input and preserving the team’s creative vision.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Organically listening to community feedback">Organically listening to community feedback</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players have the right to be listened to, and community discussion provides novel ways of injecting community ideas into a game. Though player feedback does not have to be implemented, getting players involved is important.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A few years ago, Polytopia’s Discord group allowed players to vote for the moderator of their respective tribe’s Discord channel. Players used a RNG system to randomly appoint the moderator leader of the Bardur tribe. This inspired the development team to choose the leader of the in-game Bardur tribe with the roll of a dice. This goes to show that, as a result of getting the players involved, they can organically and positively impact the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Discord is a key method of updating players and allows you to instantly access suggestions from thousands of fans, but with great fan engagement comes great responsibility. This volume of engagement comes with the duty to manage conversations and moderate. It's also important to expand the community beyond one platform, keeping on top of social media posts and emails; in addition to Discord, we use Reddit, Instagram, and X. Having a variety of platforms also means they can intersect and bring different groups of fans together. For example, we sometimes post fanart from the Polytopia subreddit on X while discussing news about the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">An important part of community management is knowing when to put a stop to things, as this helps to maintain the balance between the fans and the team. When Midjiwan called on the community to design an in-game language for the ∑∫ỹriȱŋ tribe, several challenges arose due to the volume of input and concerns about the moderation of content. In this situation, the best course of action was to politely put an end to the activity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The lesson here? Community input is a natural process, and not always call-and-response. We encourage players to interact and bond with other players, while keeping on top of&nbsp; moderation and dialogues on Discord.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Players and community growth">Players and community growth</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’ve explored the tools, but different players have different needs, and recognising this leads to community growth. Midjiwan’s community consists of three main subgroups; the first are meditative, meaning they play as a pastime and dislike changes to the core game; the second discuss the lore and want to learn more about it; the third are competitive players who are focused on game balancing. Recognising the differences between each section of the community fosters growth in the wider playerbase.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another way to promote discussions and growth is to consciously build the lore. In Polytopia’s case, players gradually learn the lore as they play and through various community events we run. Creating competitions or community initiatives, like having fans create community art, is also very effective.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, it is crucial that you respect the time of volunteers. Part of this is distinguishing between the role of a freelance artist and a fan. This approach helps to keep the creative vision intact, while including the fans and building the community.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion">Conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, the core of community management is keeping the balance. It’s a joy to have a passionate audience engaging with your work, and to take pride in the world you have created. At the same time, it’s important to keep the creative vision intact, and manage your community as fans, not creators.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/threshold-is-a-creepy-mystery-about-jobs.1049742/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/threshold-review-impressions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I keep seeing people talking about <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2580020/THRESHOLD/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Threshold</em></a>, a recent indie game about doing a boring job. Though creepy games aren’t generally my jam, all the praise got me curious enough to check it out for myself. I played it a few days ago, and now I can’t stop thinking about it.</p><p>You play as the new “yellow clerk” at a train station high atop a mountain–so high, in fact, that it’s hard to breathe, which means the clerk training you writes down his instructions rather than speaks. Your job is weird, but basic: there’s a train that has to go a certain speed, indicated by a colored light. If the train gets off speed, you can blow a whistle into a <em>Half Life 2</em>-looking machine to get it back on pace. You’re also responsible for cleaning out some gunk that piles up at the end of a river and depositing it in a machine.</p><p>For these tasks, you’re rewarded punchcards you can use to buy air canisters, which are explained as needing to be glass due to the altitude. You bite them to keep breathing, which makes a dramatic crunching sound and fills an image of your mouth in the corner of the screen with blood.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="THRESHOLD – Release Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jAqq9qqq5XQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The trailer above makes the game seem very high octane, but for most of its short run time it’s pretty slow. While the need for enough air canisters adds some pressure, it’s pretty easy to keep yourself topped up. For a lot of the game, I just did my job: wandering from the river to the dumping place, rushing to the whistle machine when I heard the sound of the train slowing. I had enough downtime to watch the punchcard machine slowly print my air tickets. I had enough downtime to start poking around the station, which is when things start to get <em>very</em> weird.</p><p><em>Threshold</em> eventually nudges you to start asking questions: What’s the deal with the whistle? What's behind the dam? What happened to the previous yellow clerk? Why are some of the buildings broken? Where did these fish in the river come from? What’s in the train? You explore these questions by poking around and staring at things, and clues lead you to other clues. It’s easy to miss things, necessitating multiple playthroughs if you want to find out everything you can, but at about an hour for a playthrough it isn’t too onerous. The more things you find and piece together, the stranger and more oppressive the game gets.</p><p>After finishing <em>Threshold</em>, I went to the internet to look for some kind of consensus about <em>what it all means</em>, but there doesn’t seem to be one. (The game says it’s based on a “true story,” though I’ll be damned if I know what that refers to.) There are so many things it <em>could</em> be a metaphor for or a commentary on, and I both agree and disagree with every interpretation I’ve seen. The more I roll it around, the more I appreciate what it’s doing, how much lurks below its surface and how, for every question it answers, it leaves even more unanswered, letting you bring your own take to it. I feel uneasy about everything I did in the game, from following my routine to <em>not</em> following it. I still don’t know if I should have trusted anything any of its characters said to me. I don’t know if I made the right choices, from its multiple endings to its opaque country-based difficulty system.&nbsp;</p><p>I was worried <em>Threshold</em> would be too scary for me, an inveterate wuss, but it’s more unsettling than horror-y. (It helped that I found a Steam discussion from the creator assuring players there aren’t any <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2580020/discussions/0/4628106589631430155/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">jump scares</a>, though there are a few mildly startling moments, and the Steam page warns of the “presence of dead bodies.”) I enjoyed my time with it, but I’ve enjoyed everyone else’s time with it more, watching other players ponder and evaluate the strange experience. Please play it so you can tell me what you think it’s about.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Tomorrow, December 3rd 2024, will be exactly thirty years since the launch of the original PlayStation and no doubt Sony have a few treats up their sleeves, but they’re kicking things off with a heart-warming video.</p>
<p>It features many classic PlayStation games backed up with an epic remix of Linger by The Cranberries.</p>

			<p>Two years after the PC launch and one year after the Xbox launch, Fatshark is <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-darktide-is-coming-to-ps5-next-month-will-run-at-4k60fps-on-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">preparing</a> for the launch of Warhammer 40K Darktide <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/EP4122-PPSA21255_00-0888672453602469" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on PlayStation 5</a>. The PS5 debut is scheduled for Thursday, but tomorrow, the studio will also <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40000-darktides-free-update-releases-december-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">release</a> the Grim Protocols free update that adds a new endgame mode, a new mission, three new weapon families, a dedicated event for the second anniversary, and even a few quality of life enhancements.</p>
<p>Despite the busy time at the Swedish studio, Fatshark was kind enough to let us have a chat with Chief Technology Officer Mikael Hansson. We discussed the PlayStation 5 launch, the studio's experience with the PS5 Pro hardware, and whether the game will support ray tracing on the enhanced console or cross-progression across all platforms.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zWWPeN3lWG0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Why did it take so long for Darktide to get on PlayStation 5? Was there an exclusivity deal in place with Microsoft?</strong></p>
<p>Yes! It was no secret that we had an exclusivity deal in place with Microsoft extending for a certain period of time after the Darktide Xbox release. That said, this exclusivity window had expired long before the release date of Darktide on PS5. The current PS5 launch date of December 3rd is the result of the development team establishing a robust timeline by the end of which we could have a solid PS5 version of the game ready.</p>
<p><strong>You confirmed that the PS5 version will launch with cross-play. Was it complicated to set up with the other platforms? Also, would you consider adding cross-progression?</strong></p>
<p>The most complicated parts of launching with cross-play support for PS5 were handled during the initial stage of Darktide as a project. We decided quite early not to rely on any platform-specific networking solutions. This work enabled us to deliver crossplay for Xbox and Steam and is what allows us to seamlessly integrate PS5 into our environment as well.</p>
<p>Most of the technical challenges are fairly similar from one platform to another, such as supporting various parental control features and the ability to opt out of crossplay. Here, Steam stands out a bit as it does not require any such features to be supported. As for cross-progression, we are not currently planning to introduce it to Darktide.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned that the PS5 version is getting haptic feedback. Can you share for which events/actions? Also, any chance you'll be adding support for adaptive triggers, too?</strong></p>
<p>The haptic feedback is implemented for a variety of actions related to weapon handling and character abilities, as well as for some environmental effects and events. The feeling of blasting heretics with a full auto Recon Lasgun or revving the Chainsword are particular favorites. And yes, the adaptive triggers do play a big part in tying this all together. This work will make it in time for the wider launch of Darktide on PS5 and its Grim Protocols update on December 3rd.</p>
<p><strong>Would you update the PC version so that DualSense controller users can get haptic feedback on this version as well?</strong></p>
<p>The PC version support for DualSense controllers with haptic feedback is not something we are currently working on at the moment.</p>
<p><strong>How long did it take for you to enhance Darktide for the PS5 Pro?</strong></p>
<p>Once the bulk of the work to bring Darktide to PS5 was nearing completion, enhancing Darktide for PS5 Pro was relatively easy. We already supported features like DLSS/FSR/XESS on PC, so adding PSSR didn’t require too much work. Now, we have more horsepower to get players blasting heretics with bigger frames and faster.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think of the PS5 Pro's hardware? What is the single feature you were most impressed with?</strong></p>
<p>The addition of PSSR is definitely a game changer to get those frame rates up while keeping the image quality as good as possible. That said, PSSR is not purely hardware related so I would have to say that the beefier GPU is the single hardware feature that left us really impressed.</p>
<p><strong>Compared to the jump between PS4 Pro and PS4, would you say the PS5 Pro- PS5 difference is similar or reduced (e.g., the advancement is more or less significant)?</strong></p>
<p>The difference between PS4 - PS4 Pro is more significant hardware wise than the PS5 - PS5 Pro. That said, that leap had both benefits and disadvantages. The PS4 Pro enjoyed more CPU and RAM compared to the PS5 Pro’s GPU increase. The problem is that, in order to fully use that extra hardware, a developer needed to do so much more than when working on generating more frames at a higher resolution. Adding too many/vastly different pieces of hardware might incur the different “generations” to diverge more than one would like, which could result in a game being bottlenecked by the slower of the two consoles.</p>
<p>We had this problem with Vermintide 2, where consoles couldn’t push as many enemies as the PC version could. This caused us to have vastly different enemy numbers and the games were tweaked differently on each platform, which prevented crossplay from being a thing for Vermintide 2. The PS4 Pro solved this problem to an extent, but since we need to support all players, including PS4 users who experienced technical limitations, we were never able to fully utilize all that extra horsepower.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - Havoc Endgame Mode | Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oUzMxKl9qqM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>How much faster does the PS5 Pro hardware run your engine compared to the PS5?</strong></p>
<p>It is really hard to put a number on this, but fast enough for us to be able to hit a comfortable 60 FPS in PSSR-enhanced 4K.</p>
<p><strong>Are you using PSSR? What do you think about it compared to other upscalers like NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we are using PSSR, likewise, we have NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS all integrated on PC as well. It’s really hard to compare as we cannot run PSSR and any of the other alternatives on the same platform and hardware. From what we have seen so far PSSR seems to be able to slug it out with the best of them and provide the expected benefit for the game.</p>
<p><strong>How does the PS5 Pro version stack with the maxed-out PC game? Does the PS5 Pro version feature the highest graphics settings available on PC?</strong></p>
<p>The PS5 Pro version runs PSSR-assisted 4K at 60fps with most settings in what would equal PC High mode. We are running PSSR in the balanced mode equivalent, which puts the internal resolution at 2258x1270.</p>
<p><strong>The Xbox Series X version of Darktide does not support ray tracing, so I expect the same will be true for PS5. The new PS5 Pro adds enhanced ray tracing capabilities, though. Were you able to port any ray-tracing features from the PC version?</strong></p>
<p>We did not put focus on porting any of the raytracing solutions on PC to PS5 or PS5 Pro for that matter. The cost versus benefit wasn’t deemed favorable. Darktide already looks pretty darn good even without raytracing features and our focus for PS5 Pro was to deliver the 60fps performance at the PS5 quality mode equivalent. We just find that the prospect of additional frames appeals to Darktide players more than the addition of slightly better looks.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

Yeah, you know the one.</p><p>For a limited time, players can customize their PS5 UI using themes from throughout PlayStation’s past.

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-season-1-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone Season 1</a> is about to get a fresh mid-season update filled with new content. As with every major update for the free-to-play battle royale, the update will not only bring new weapons and events, but players can also expect huge buffs and nerfs to shuffle the meta.</p>



<p>The update comes during the Holiday season, so if you’re looking to dive into Warzone over the Christmas period, here’s when the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-1-reloaded-release-date-new-guns-codmas-event-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1 Reloaded update</a> is expected to drop.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-warzone-season-1-reloaded-release-date">Warzone Season 1 Reloaded release date</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-new-weapons-in-warzone-season-1-reloaded">New weapons in Warzone Season 1 Reloaded</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-ranked-play-arrives-in-warzone-season-1-reloaded">Ranked Play arrives in Warzone Season 1 Reloaded</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-warzone-season-1-reloaded-expected-content">Warzone Season 1 Reloaded expected content</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-warzone-season-1-reloaded-release-date">Warzone Season 1 Reloaded release date</h2>



<p>The Warzone Season 1 Reloaded update will arrive on <strong>December 5, 2024</strong>, at around <strong>10 AM PT / 1 PM ET / 6 PM GMT</strong>.</p>



<p>Although it has not yet been confirmed, we are confident in this date as Treyarch announced that the new Zombies map for Black Ops 6, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-does-new-black-ops-6-zombies-map-coming-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Citadelle des Morts</a>, would arrive on December 5. In the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2024/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-one-mp-zombies-maps-modes-announcement#Citadelle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoD blog</a>, this new map was confirmed to be released with the mid-season update, so we expect it to coincide with the official Season 1 Reloaded patch.</p>

<h2 id="h-new-weapons-in-warzone-season-1-reloaded">New weapons in Warzone Season 1 Reloaded</h2>



<ul>
<li>Maelstrom</li>



<li>AMR Mod 4</li>



<li>Cleaver</li>
</ul>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-maelstorm-in-black-ops-6-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maelstrom</a> is a new Shotgun arriving in Warzone Season 1 Reloaded, while the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-amr-mod-4-sniper-in-black-ops-6-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AMR Mod 4</a> is a semi-automatic <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-quickscoping-sniper-loadout-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sniper Rifle</a> that packs a mean punch. Players will also be able to get the Cleaver, a new Melee Weapon. </p>



<p>All three of these weapons will be available via an event, similar to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-power-drill-in-black-ops-6-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Power Drill</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-sirin-9mm-in-black-ops-6-and-warzone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sirin 9mm</a>. We don’t yet know what this event is, but considering the update is arriving in the Holiday season, perhaps it will be Christmas-themed. </p>



<p>We’ll have to wait and see exactly how players unlock these new weapons when the event rolls around in Season 1 Reloaded.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Activision.</figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-ranked-play-arrives-in-warzone-season-1-reloaded">Ranked Play arrives in Warzone Season 1 Reloaded</h2>



<p>As promised by the devs, <strong>Ranked Play will return in Warzone with the Season 1 Reloaded update</strong>. It was removed after the Black Ops 6 integration in Season 1, but the devs are reintroducing it at the halfway point of the season.</p>



<p>The Ranked Play format will likely be very similar to what it was prior to the BO6 integration. Just like in multiplayer, players will earn Ranked Points by playing well and placing high. You will climb up Skill Divisions and earn exclusive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-ranked-play-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ranked Play rewards</a> depending on the level you reach – Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Crimson, Iridescent, and Top 250.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 players have been enjoying <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-ranked-play-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ranked Play in multiplayer</a>, but it’s time for battle royale players to have their own competitive fun.</p>



<h2 id="h-warzone-season-1-reloaded-expected-content">Warzone Season 1 Reloaded expected content</h2>



<ul>
<li>New guns</li>



<li>New events</li>



<li>Ranked Play</li>



<li>Buffs and nerfs</li>
</ul>



<p>On top of new guns, events, and Ranked Play, we also expect Warzone Season 1 Reloaded to bring some hefty buffs and nerfs for the game’s weapons and equipment. Major updates often bring meta-shifting balance changes, but we won’t receive the official patch notes detailing these tweaks until closer to the update.</p>

                <p>In October, Microsoft announced that Xbox games would soon be sold in a new place--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-will-soon-be-sold-in-a-new-place/1100-6527117/" data-ref-id="1100-6527117">directly from the Xbox app on Android</a>.

"Our team has the functionality built and ready to go live as soon as the court makes a final decision," Bond said.</p><p>This all stems back to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-will-soon-be-sold-in-a-new-place/1100-6527117/" data-ref-id="1100-6527117">a decision in the Epic v.

Epic's Tim Sweeney spearheaded the initiative in his ongoing battle against Google and its business practices.</p><p>Google said at the time that it planned to appeal, and the company succeeded in convincing a judge to at least delay the decision. It remains to be seen when the stay could be lifted.</p><p>Epic, which created the massively popular Fortnite, convinced the court that Google made it very difficult for any rival store within Google Play to successfully compete in the market. The benefit to Microsoft is that it can sell games directly to consumers via its own store inside the Xbox app, and that also means Microsoft wouldn't need to pay Google a fee.</p><p>Beyond selling games within the Xbox app for Android, Microsoft is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-pushing-ahead-with-plans-for-mobile-game-store-which-isnt-multiple-years-away/1100-6519625/" data-ref-id="1100-6519625">aiming to launch its own entire mobile game store at some point in the future.</a> Microsoft is no longer trying to sell everyone an Xbox console but is instead positioning the Xbox as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">catch-all term for any device that has Game Pass. </a></p><p>Microsoft is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-secret-weapon-for-nextgen-is-xbox-game-/1100-6477138/" data-ref-id="1100-6477138">pushing Xbox Game Pass</a> to create more subscribers that in turn provide Microsoft with a regular and recurring revenue stream.

Sony has rolled out a special limited-time console update for your PS5 which adds a suite of nostalgia-fuelled custom sounds and startup options. 
</p>
<p>
In essence, it makes your PS5 look and sound more similar to Sony's greats of yesteryear: the PS1! the PS2! the PS3! the PS4! And no PS Vita.
</p>
<p>
Turn on your console now and, if updated, you'll be greated by the option to choose your favourite console generation. This adds a themed swirl to your PS5 desktop based around the look and feel of Sony's past consoles.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-history-of-indiana-jones-video-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you go by last year’s finalists for Best Independent Game at The Game Awards, there are indie games, and there are “indie” games. That is, there are independent games financed and made by individuals or teams free from the influence of a major publisher, and there are “independent” games that are… actually owned by billion-dollar South Korean corporations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But if you’re not interested in the debate about what can be named an indie game and what can’t, there is a <em>third</em> type of Indy game, and <em>they</em> are named after a dog.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/last-crusade-fond-memories-1732678475338.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"I got a lot of fond memories of that dog."</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After well over 10 years since his last dedicated digital adventure, Indiana Jones is returning to video games in Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, which is arriving imminently on PC, Xbox, and Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But how did we get here? Well, Indiana Jones games may have otherwise dried up over the past decade-and-change, but <em>before</em> that, the good Doctor Jones’ video game history dates back over 40 years. So kick back as we dust off some antique hardware and whip through the history of Indiana Jones games.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">First created by George Lucas back in the early ’70s, Indiana Jones – originally conceived as Indiana <em>Smith</em> – was heavily inspired by the adventure serials of Lucas’ youth, and the character’s trademark look took a heavy dose of inspiration from the likes of Alan Ladd in the 1943 film China, Humphrey Bogart in 1948’s The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, and Charlton Heston in Secret of the Incas from 1954.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a surname shift, Indiana Jones was brought to life by Harrison Ford on the big screen in one of the most magnificent action adventure movies ever made: 1981’s Raiders of the Lost Ark. As you almost certainly already know, Raiders of the Lost Ark was followed by two absolutely outstanding films and two… other films.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/raiders-nasty-1732678614048.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"Now you're getting nasty."</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What you may <em>not</em> know, however, is where Indiana Jones made his very first appearance on the small screen. The answer is Raiders of the Lost Ark for the Atari 2600. It was created by legendary Atari game designer Howard Scott Warshaw, the man behind Yars’ Revenge – the best-selling first-party game ever on the console. Raiders of the Lost Ark hit the Atari 2600 in late 1982, around a year-and-a-half after the film had arrived.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I only first played my dad’s 2600 <em>later </em>in the ’80s, and about all I remember is instantly bouncing off anything more obtuse than Outlaw, which is a game with a premise that begins and ends at “shoot the cowboy on the other side of the TV.” Despite my unequivocal love of all things Indy, Raiders of the Lost Ark for the Atari was not my type of thing. Looking at it through a modern lens, however, it is certainly a fascinatingly complex and ambitious Atari 2600 game – even if it is confusing and more than a little unfair. Come on, snakes the same colour as the ground?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/raiders-2600-1732678774966.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">1982's Raiders of the Lost Ark, for the Atari 2600.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite being a strictly single-player experience, it required the use of both the console’s joystick controllers to operate. The right joystick moves Indy around the limited assortment of screens, and the left stick allows players to navigate their inventory and select the object you want Indy to use. Of course, utilising both controllers came with the benefit of DOUBLING the amount of buttons players had at their disposal. Twice the buttons!</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/last-crusade-just-the-two-1732678893770.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"It was just the two."</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, yes, Indy is correct: Atari 2600 controllers only have one button, so yep, it was just the two. However, don’t assume Raiders of the Lost Ark is simple on account of having such a limited spectrum of controls. Rather, it’s anything but. With the benefit of hindsight and the fact that the effective route through this game has long since been charted, Raiders of the Lost Ark’s arcane gameplay seems almost quaint in 2024 – but how exactly contemporaneous audiences were meant to blunder their way upon these ambiguous but awfully specific puzzle solutions is a total mystery.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>How exactly contemporaneous audiences were meant to blunder their way upon these ambiguous but awfully specific puzzle solutions is a total mystery.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, Raiders of the Lost Ark holds the <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/88979-first-videogame-based-on-an-official-movie-licence" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Guinness World Record as the first-ever video game based on an official movie licence</u></a>. It would seem it just pipped Alien from Fox Video Games, which also came out in November 1982, although that was literally just a Pac-Man clone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, that, and that <em>other</em> alien movie tie-in for the Atari 2600 from December 1982: E.T. The Extra Terrestrial. Coincidentally, E.T. was actually <em>also</em> designed by Howard Scott Warshaw (at the request of Steven Spielberg himself, no less), though he only had five weeks to make it. Of course, that’s a story for a <em>different</em> documentary.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/raiders-see-this-priceless-1732678989803.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"I take it, I bury it in the sand for a thousand years; it becomes priceless."</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Indy’s next video game would be his first original one: Indiana Jones in the Lost Kingdom, which was released by Mindscape for the Commodore 64 in late 1984. It features a… pretty nifty arrangement of John Williams’ unforgettable theme music, but very little else worth celebrating, depending on how much mileage you reckon you’d get out of a constipated cowboy turning birds into butterflies with an apparently enchanted walking stick. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-lost-kingdom-1732679499488.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">1984's Indiana Jones in the Lost Kingdom, for Commodore 64.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The game’s box boasted that "Nobody told Indiana Jones the rules. And no one will tell you." It wasn’t quite true – <a href="https://archive.org/details/commodore-power-play-15/page/n33/mode/1up?view=theater" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>there was actually a clue hotline for stumped players</u></a> to call and be told how to proceed – but either way it feels like Mindscape was putting a lot of stock in the cognitive powers of the youth of the ’80s here. I was there, and I can’t exactly vouch for it, but maybe that was just the palookas I hung around with back then.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/raiders-not-one-brain-1732679266588.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"They have not one brain among them."</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Indy’s next official movie tie-in came with August 1985’s Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom arcade game, which arrived a little over a year after the movie. Also developed by Atari, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was instantly a huge step up over its Atari 2600 predecessor – and not simply because Indiana Jones no longer looked like a tiny UFO floating over a fire hydrant. The Temple of Doom arcade game was a very early example of digitised speech in video games – something that had only just started in Atari’s 1983 Star Wars arcade game. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/temple-of-doom-arcade-1732679647638.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">1985's Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, for arcades.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With his iconic whip, players were required to hustle their way through Mola Ram’s lair, freeing captured children, avoiding spike traps, and defeating cultists and creatures. A mine cart level obviously made an appearance, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Versions of Temple of Doom eventually made their way to home devices like the Commodore 64 and the NES but, as was generally the case during the golden age of arcades, the home versions looked and played like vastly inferior knock offs of the real thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 1987, Mindscape returned with yet <em>another </em>original Indiana Jones game that flaunted the series’ naming conventions by switching the “and the” for a much clumsier “in”: Indiana Jones in Revenge of the Ancients. It was a text adventure, so Mindscape wasn't just going back in time for Indy’s story matter – it was going back in time for its game design, too. Do you want to hear about it?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/raiders-not-at-all-1732679741253.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"Not at all."</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, good, because that brings us to quite a busy little period for Indiana Jones games, kicking off around the 1989 release of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, which is frankly the most perfect movie ever made and, no, I won’t be taking any questions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade actually inspired <em>three </em>separate games released between 1989 and the early ’90s. One of those was Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Action Game, first published on PCs in 1989 by Lucasfilm Games, which was later renamed LucasArts, and then later still, Lucasfilm Games again. Versions of the game eventually made their way to approximately every other platform on Earth in the early ’90s. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-last-crusade-action-1732680355798.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">1989's Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Action Game, for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, no version of the game was very good and, considering Indiana Jones is supposed to be a teenager in the scene depicted in the above screenshot, the understanding of the movie some versions displayed was rudimentary at best.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/doom-insulting-1732680574031.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"You're insulting them, and you're embarrassing me."</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, be that as it may, it’s hard to get too misty eyed about The Action Game when it was so thoroughly outclassed by its own stablemate, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure. While Lucasfilm Games had outsourced the development of The Action Game to a long-defunct studio called Tiertex, The Graphic Adventure was developed by Lucasfilm Games itself, and was the third game to run on the studio’s now famous SCUMM engine – after Maniac Mansion and Zak McKracken and the Alien Mindbenders. Point-and-click adventure games have always been Lucasfilm Games’ bread and butter, and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure remains a fine example of its work.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-last-crusade-graphic-1732682035503.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade: The Graphic Adventure, from 1989.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Led by adventure game legend Ron Gilbert of Monkey Island fame, The Graphic Adventure sticks far more closely to the events of the film, though it still finds room to colour outside the lines of the script with sequences that allow Indy to talk his way around Nazi encounters if you’re canny enough. Or, you can just punch Hitler right in his goddamn face.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are definitely some quality of life issues present in The Last Crusade that later Lucasfilm point-and-click games would go on to iron out, but there’s no denying the tremendous attention to detail the team managed to squeeze into it.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-last-crusade-taito-1732682148005.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">1991's Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, published by Taito.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The third game based on Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade was a NES-exclusive action game from Taito, which was distinct from “<em>The</em> Action Game”, but <em>did </em>mean there were literally two Last Crusade tie-ins available on NES published out of opposite sides of the planet. For reference, you can recognise the Taito one via Indy’s high-kicking martial arts skills, as it appears Harrison Ford has been replaced with Jean Claude Van Damme. But hey, I guess I love Kickboxer and Bloodsport as much as the next guy.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/last-crusade-complaining-1732682199921.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"Then what are you complaining about?"</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, nothing, I guess, although the topic of recasting Harrison Ford does bring us neatly to 1993’s The Young Indiana Jones Chronicles by Chris Gray Enterprises, Incorporated, and 1994’s Instruments of Chaos starring Young Indiana Jones from the less enterprising but equally incorporated Brian A. Rice, Incorporated. The former was a NES exclusive, and the latter was only available on Sega Genesis, which went by the slightly cooler ‘Sega Mega Drive’ in Japan and Europe, the accidentally mispronounced ‘See-ga Mega Drive’ in Australasia, and the… very different ‘Super Aladdin Boy’ in South Korea. No, that’s not made up.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/young-indy-sega-1732683532535.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">1994's Instruments of Chaos starring Young Indiana Jones, for Sega Genesis/Mega Drive.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, in keeping with the TV show that aired between ’92 and ’93, Harrison Ford was, in fact, replaced with Sean Patrick Flanery – at least for the box art. The platforming action in each, however, was not particularly fun or memorable enough for either of them to be much more than a footnote in Indiana Jones’ gaming history. Certainly not fun or memorable enough to ignore the magnificent game we just skipped: 1992’s legendary Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis finds Indy in a race against time to beat the Nazis to the lost underwater city of Atlantis. Directed by Hal Barwood, the game had initially been intended to be based on a sidelined Indiana Jones script written by Home Alone and Mrs. Doubtfire director Chris Columbus prior to The Last Crusade. However, Barwood – who himself had earlier co-written Steven Spielberg’s first theatrical film, The Sugarland Express – petitioned to create an original story for it.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-fate-atlantis-1732683670616.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis, from 1992.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Barwood collaborated with The Last Crusade co-designer Noah Falstein, who introduced the concept of having three different routes through the game’s story: The Wits Path, which focuses on a more cerebral challenge, the Fists Path, which is a more action-oriented, Hollywood experience with lighter puzzles, and the Team Path, where Indy remains with his partner Sophia Hapgood to solve puzzles together. These paths would branch away after the first act, though they would converge again towards the end.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Fate of Atlantis is not only regarded as one of the studio’s best-ever adventure games – it’s one of the best adventure games of all time.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Representing LucasArts at around the peak of its point-and-click power, The Fate of Atlantis is not only regarded as one of the studio’s best-ever adventure games – it’s one of the best adventure games of all time. That said, it’s hard to say whether it would have been the same smash hit with the name the suits reportedly <em>wanted</em> to give it, which was simply “Indy’s Next Adventure.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/raiders-fools-1732683739962.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"Bureaucratic fools!"</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As with The Last Crusade, LucasArts simultaneously published an entirely redundant second version of the Fate of Atlantis: Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis: The Action Game, which was developed by Attention to Detail, slightly before it briefly hit the big time with the futuristic Rollcage racing series. With its isometric view and its finicky and frankly awful controls, Fate of Atlantis: The Action Game was actually a far poorer action game than the platformers that had preceded it. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-fate-atlantis-action-1732683852882.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis: The Action Game, from 1992.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A CD version of the Graphic Adventure arrived in 1993 with full voice acting, but unfortunately a planned follow-up called Indiana Jones and the Iron Phoenix was cancelled – although the game’s story was still actually published in a limited Dark Horse comic series from December 1994 to March 1995.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, while Indiana Jones’ graphic adventures were wrapping up on PC, SNES owners were in for one final taste of Indiana Jones’ greatest adventures in Indiana Jones’… Greatest Adventures. Released in late 1994 in North America and mid-1995 in Japan and PAL territories, Indiana Jones’ Greatest Adventures is a Super Star Wars-style side scroller that encompasses the events of all three original films. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-greatest-adventures-1732683966889.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Factor 5's Indiana Jones' Greatest Adventures, released in 1994–95.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Developed by Factor 5 – which would go on to develop a string of Star Wars games with LucasArts, including the Rogue Squadron series – Indiana Jones’ Greatest Adventures features a horde of familiar locations from the movies, some seriously impressive Mode 7 sequences to break up the platforming action, and well balanced combat split between Indy’s whip, pistol, and grenades. Sure, it was harder than a woodpecker’s lips, and sure it took a few detours to accommodate some genre-typical boss battles – particularly since Indiana Jones villains in the films have a habit of literally killing themselves – but Indiana Jones’ Greatest Adventures is a much-loved segment of the Indiana Jones gaming tapestry.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/last-crusade-tapestries-1732684050945.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"Tapestries?"</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Less beloved was the peculiar 1996 PC game Indiana Jones and His Desktop Adventures, which was led by Fate of Atlantis creator Hal Barwood but was an entirely different sort of adventure game. With its budget price and retro RPG aesthetic – even for the mid-’90s – Desktop Adventures was officially designed for a more casual audience to idly play in windowed mode while they were doing other tasks, and its procedurally generated approach promised “literally billions of possible games,” as per an enthusiastic claim on the game’s box art. One mission even had Indy retrieving the head of C-3P0. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-c3po-1732684228833.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">This Easter egg was later re-referenced in 2008's LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, this casual take on Indy-themed adventuring was not exactly welcomed by critics. Thanks in no small part to LucasArts’ existing reputation as the home of genre-leading adventure games, Desktop Adventures’ low-fi and frictionless approach was met with an inauspicious reaction. It also probably didn’t help that 1996 also saw the debut of Tomb Raider, a 3D adventure more cutting edge than Lara Croft’s tank top. Though she was certainly inspired by Indiana Jones, Lara rapidly rose to become a certified cultural icon herself. Indiana Jones had some archaeological competition, and she was more than happy to muscle Indiana out of the equation. Indeed, 1999’s Tomb Raider: The Last Revelation even had an Easter egg of Indiana Jones’ skeleton – complete with a fedora and a whip.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/last-crusade-trying-to-kill-us-1732684312693.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"Those people are trying to kill us!"</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Indiana Jones finally entered the third dimension himself in 1999’s Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine for PC – which, coincidentally enough – is about an ancient Babylonian device that facilitates interdimensional travel. Again directed by Hal Barwood, The Infernal Machine is a third-person action adventure heavily informed by Core’s early Tomb Raider games. Run. Jump. Pull blocks. <em>Push</em> blocks. Lara may have begun life as an Indy imitator, but now Indy was looking at Lara, and copying her every move. Puzzles weren’t particularly taxing, though performing them sometimes was with the somewhat cumbersome controls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Set in 1947, The Infernal Machine benched the series’ normal Nazi baddies in favour of Soviets instead, who are intent on harnessing the power of the titular Infernal Machine and its interdimensional properties for an edge in the quickly escalating Cold War. It did, however, bring back Sophia Hapgood from The Fate of Atlantis, which was a neat touch.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-infernal-machine-1732684376376.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">1999's Indiana Jones and the Infernal Machine, for PC.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Infernal Machine was initially set to receive a PlayStation port, but it was cancelled. An N64 version did make it into the wild in 2000, albeit exclusively in the US, and it was only available to purchase via the LucasArts company store, or purchase or rent from Blockbuster. You know, the stores that used to let you borrow games for a small fee, before that beautiful concept was sacrificed in order to let people stream Is It Cake? directly to their phones.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The N64 version was <em>supposed</em> to make its way to PAL territories but after numerous delays that was eventually cancelled. There was also a top down handheld version of Infernal Machine released in 2001, although it unfortunately arrived on the Game Boy Color just as the Game Boy Advance was arriving to replace the Game Boy Color.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/last-crusade-museum-1732684464910.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"That belongs in a museum!"</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Indy’s next adventure came in 2003, courtesy of The Collective, a team fresh off 2002’s Xbox exclusive Buffy The Vampire Slayer. Taking place in 1935, Indiana Jones and the Emperor’s Tomb was actually a prequel to Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arriving first on the original Xbox, then PC, then several months later on PS2, the Emperor’s Tomb remained relatively Tomb Raider adjacent, but it dialled back the brainteasers and block puzzles in favour of lever hunting and light platforming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Emperor’s Tomb was also considerably more combat oriented, with a brawling system borrowed directly from Buffy and the ability to use items lying around the world as weapons, including chairs and broken table legs.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The Emperor’s Tomb had all the core ingredients of a robust Indy adventure, including magnificent music, nefarious Nazis, and a typically powerful ancient artefact the Nazis want.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The Emperor’s Tomb had all the core ingredients of a robust Indy adventure, including magnificent music, nefarious Nazis, and a typically powerful ancient artefact the Nazis want – in this case, the Heart of the Dragon, a perfect black pearl legend says can control the hearts of men. However, it also packed a few surprises, including an appearance by an enormous dragon and a showdown with a huge kraken.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here I was thinking the only crackin’ involving Indy was the sound his whip made. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-emperors-tomb-1732684601305.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">2003's Indiana Jones and the Emperor's Tomb, for Xbox, PC, and eventually PS2.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">LucasArts began work on a follow-up to The Emperor’s Tomb in 2004, destined for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, both of which were set to arrive in late 2005 and late 2006 respectively.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans were treated to a first glimpse of the game in a quirky tech-focused teaser trailer which LucasArts used to illustrate some of the advancements it was promising under the hood. It was actually our first look at the animation middleware Euphoria, the biomechanical AI that would go on to hit the big time in 2008’s Grand Theft Auto IV.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sadly, work on the much-anticipated project faltered, and the game missed its planned 2007 release. To make matters worse for LucasArts, Naughty Dog had also decided to join them in the archaeological arena with November 2007’s Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune for PlayStation 3, the first outing for the now iconic PlayStation hero Nathan Drake.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/raiders-competitor-good-1732684713467.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"A competitor. He was good. He was very, very good."</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Work on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 Indiana Jones project continued for a time, and in the interim LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures from Traveller’s Tales arrived in June 2008, just after the arrival of Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull in cinemas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A whimsical and family-friendly tour of the first three films in the series, LEGO Indiana Jones didn’t stray far from the successful formula Traveller’s Tales established with its brickbusting LEGO Star Wars games, but it didn’t really have to, as evident from the dozen or so licensed LEGO games that have followed over the last decade-and-a-half. With a great sense of imagination and a huge list of playable characters, LEGO Indiana Jones was certainly the most fun way to re-experience the original films in a virtual environment since Indiana Jones’ Greatest Adventures for SNES back in 1994. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/lego-indy-1732684775164.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">2008's LEGO Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures, from Traveller's Tales.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Traveller’s Tales released a quickfire sequel in 2009 dubbed LEGO Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues, which included new levels for the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull but slightly poorer versions of the original trilogy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But back over at LucasArts, how were things going with its belated but bold new biomechanically-driven baby?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/last-crusade-our-situation-1732684924333.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"Our situation has not improved."</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, in early 2009 it was confirmed that LucasArts had permanently iced its Xbox 360 and PS3 Indiana Jones project, and the reportedly largely-unfinished game would never see the light of day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">LucasArts allowed its third-party partners to continue working on the PS2, PSP, DS, and Wii version of the project, published in mid-2009 as Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings, but the reception for an Indy adventure on such superseded hardware was understandably tepid. What did the Staff of Kings get from IGN?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/doom-five-1732685038008.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"Five. You know it and I know it."</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yeah. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Released right in the heart of the motion control fad, the Staff of Kings was hamstrung by its drastic overuse of waggle. Even the Wii-exclusive co-op mode that paired Indy up with his dad was diabolically unfun.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, the general consensus was that the best thing about the Staff of Kings on Wii was that it came with Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis embedded in it as a bonus. Well, that and the absolutely dead-on Sean Connery impersonation from Scottish actor Lewis MacLeod.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/indy-staff-of-kings-1732685128872.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">2009's Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings, for Wii.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But was this just an isolated misstep in the Indiana Jones gaming saga? One bad date before we returned to the banquet? Unfortunately, no.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indiana Jones’ next appearance was Indiana Jones Adventure World, a long-defunct Zynga game that was released in 2011 and shut down in 2012. It was on Facebook, presumably wedged somewhere between all the minion memes and misinformation.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/raiders-dont-look-1732685235248.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">"Don't look, Marion! Keep your eyes shut!"</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Indiana Jones also made an appearance in Fortnite back in 2022 as one of its hundreds and hundreds of skins, designed purely to keep Epic plush and parents poor. Indy was back in the games business after 10 long years. He just wasn’t in a fun one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortunately, for fans of Indy’s traditional single-player adventures, Indiana Jones is finally about to return in a proper game of his own: Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, a first-person action adventure set between Raiders and The Last Crusade.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In case you're not aware, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is being developed by MachineGames, the studio behind the modern Wolfenstein series, and frankly I can’t think of a more perfect place for the world’s most prestigious Nazi-punching professor to end up than the current home of Mr. B.J.

"Those who have already bought the game will be able to download it.

It could be a licensing situation and Triangle Strategy will eventually come back with a different publisher under its name.</p><p>There's also the possibility that it's getting primed for a bigger release to the PS5 and Xbox, which would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/octopath-traveler-2-is-coming-to-xbox-next-year/1100-6517893/" data-ref-id="1100-6517893">be similar to Octopath Traveler 2</a> and would fit Square Enix's recent attempts to bring its games to more platforms.</p>
