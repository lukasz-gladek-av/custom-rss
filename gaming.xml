<figure><a title="Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/db3a512832bcb/xenoblade-chronicles-definitive-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>Among all the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> excitement, we didn't want this to get lost: Xenoblade Chronicles is now 15 years old! To celebrate, Alana recalls something which turned the game from a great one into a special one.</em></p>
<p><em>Warning: This article contains spoilers for Xenoblade Chronicles, so be wary if you haven't at least made it to the final hours of the game</em>.</p>
<hr>
<p>The Bionis and Mechonis. Two great titans, eternally locked in battle until time wore them both away and left them in stasis. Two corpses, dead, but home to various living races, whose populations are at war with one another.</p>
<p>This is the setting for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/xenoblade_chronicles">Xenoblade Chronicles</a>, a world that has become forever etched in my memory. Monolith Soft’s Wii game completely tore up the rulebook as to what an RPG 'world' could be. Planets, islands, recreations of real-life countries – who needs any of those when you can set your entire game on the carcasses of two gods? I’ve spent over a decade and a half marvelling at all the different worlds I’d thought impossible until this game came along. But still, the Bionis and the Mechonis, and the simple dichotomy of nature and technology, has always remained at the top.</p>
<figure><a title="Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c0d5edb5158f0/xenoblade-chronicles-definitive-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I’ll always remember the first time I walked out of Tephra Caves and into the huge, sprawling fields of Gaur Plains, where stone plateaus tower over acres of grass and rivers. And you’ll never speak to anyone who didn’t awe at the nighttime glow of Satorl Marsh. But for all of its spectacular moments and enticingly creative landscape, my favourite place in Xenoblade Chronicles remains its 'quietest': the Fallen Arm.</p>
<p>The Fallen Arm isn’t the first place people think of when you talk about Xenoblade, unless that person is me. The beautiful, dangerous landscapes of the Bionis rightly take centre stage, but the Fallen Arm — the severed left arm of the Mechanical titan’s body — might be the most important place in the game. Not for its simple beauty, its serene, sorrowful music, or its brief moment of respite, but for its <em>place</em> in the story and the tonal shift that takes place.</p>

<p>One of the most prominent themes in Xenoblade Chronicles is revenge, and for about half of the game’s runtime, protagonist Shulk’s rage in particular propels the plot forward. It’s hard to shake the opening hours, where Shulk’s childhood friend and love interest Fiora is brutally murdered by the Mechon Metal Face, particularly as he removes his blood-soaked claws from her 'corpse'. It's this that sets Shulk’s — and Xenoblade’s — quest for vengeance in motion.</p>
<p>From the Organic titan’s foot all the way to its neck, it’s a constant barrage of anger and suffering, of revenge against these supposed bloodthirsty mechanical enemies. Until you reach Prison Island, where you find out Fiora isn’t dead. Instead, she’s been turned half-Mechon, and she doesn’t remember her friends.</p>
<p>That revenge doesn’t go away, but it is joined by a desperation to find out <em>why</em> Fiora is how she is throughout the arm (Valak Mountain) and Mechonis’ sword (Sword Valley), where the Mechon stronghold of Galahad Fortress sits. There, Fiora’s consciousness manages to break through, and in a desperate attempt to save Shulk from certain death, destroys the fortress.</p>
<figure><a title="Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a0665d6efa603/xenoblade-chronicles-definitive-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>A few cutscenes and a sepia flashback later, Shulk awakens on the serene shores of an unfamiliar location, with a gigantic, collapsed claw protruding out of the sands, and the remains of Fiora’s mech, the nemesis, left in tatters in the waters. This isn’t how I’d expected to arrive on the Mechonis — a blistering attack or kidnapping into a huge mechanical structure had played out in my head multiple times, but a calm, quiet beach was far from my mind.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This was the moment Xenoblade Chronicles went from a game I loved to a game that was <em>special</em> to me.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Finally, we get to see Shulk and Fiora together again. We get to see him fluctuate from fear to focused concern as he pulls her limp body out of the water and saves her life by giving her water and mouth to mouth. <em>Finally</em>, the awkward, kind Shulk is back again, for a brief moment.</p>
<p>Fiora, and the Fallen Arm, bring a new side to the plot that the game had gone great lengths to hide – empathy, not just for the Homs, Nopon, and High Entia, but also for the Machina, the residents of Mechonis. There was no other way to <em>arrive</em> in Mechonis — a place that has suffered just as much as the Bionis — than a peaceful, calm beach, populated by the very people who are supposed to be our enemies, but aren’t.</p>
<p>This was the moment Xenoblade Chronicles went from a game I loved to a game that was <em>special</em> to me.</p>
<figure><a title="Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a15e23a11efb3/xenoblade-chronicles-definitive-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Reuniting with my lost party members, discovering the Hidden Machina Village and its rusty walls and pipe pathways, meeting Linada, Miqol, and all the other Machina and finding out why they’re not fighting for, or with, Egil — the leader of the Mechon army — few other moments in the game have stuck with me as clearly as these. And the quests for the Machina in the village that you get for the rest of the game help develop relationships that hate and anger would never foster. It’s a stepping stone towards Xenoblade Chronicles’ eventual fight for hope, and for a united future.</p>
<p>Fiora can’t bring herself to hate the person who was inhabiting her body because she was kind, but Shulk’s immediate reaction is anger. She sways him against that path for a moment, and Shulk remains his more level-headed self. As Miqol, leader of the Machina Village, asks Shulk and his party to kill Egil, his son, I felt the weight of that decision, the impact of those words.</p>
<p>This isn’t just about revenge, it’s about pain, too. And this tiny little metallic haven in the centre of the Mechonis’ collapsed claw is where so much <em>forgotten</em>, unchecked pain has lain.</p>
<figure><a title="Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/51ad4bb6163e9/xenoblade-chronicles-definitive-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Revenge hasn’t gone away at this point, but those bubbling questions I had from Prison Island all the way to Galahad Fortress were now effervescent at the top of the pool. The threads of vengeance were fraying, waiting to be re-knotted in a new strand that becomes obvious at the top of Agniratha and the Mechonis’ head. This isn't the Machina's fault, it’s not Egil’s fault — who himself is a victim of rage and revenge — but it’s those who are in charge of the world who are to blame. The eternal battle that the gods went through, and later the people, is the cause of the pain.</p>
<p>Without the Fallen Arm, Xenoblade Chronicles’ tonal shift just isn’t possible. This beautiful, understated landscape serves as the gentle bonfire that will spark the rest of the game’s events. From here on out, everything I’d understood was slowly flipping on its head, and it made me look at past events in a new light.</p>
<p>It also paved the way for those questions of faith and philosophy that Tetsuya Takahashi, Monolith Soft’s head and one of the writers on the game, is so well known for, which he’d established in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/xenogears">Xenogears</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/xenosaga_i_and_ii">Xenosaga</a> before. No longer was Xenoblade Chronicles a strictly angry game with a beautifully crafted world to explore – it evolved into one that was chiefly concerned with people, no matter their background, of Godhood and responsibility, of power and corruption.</p>
<figure><a title="Xenoblade Chronicles: Definitive Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2595cf4619209/xenoblade-chronicles-definitive-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The beautiful images of this series’ worlds will stick with me forever; Mira, Alrest, and Aionios all have mesmeric qualities to them, biomes full of mystical plants, unusual fauna, crumbling buildings, and glowing corals and structures, that all deserve to be celebrated.</p>
<p>But the Bionis and Mechonis go beyond sheer beauty and awe; they're the conduit for a plot structure that follows a journey up and down two bodies in stasis, an emotional up and down of loss, revenge, hate, relief, fear, empathy, and hope. And all aided by a rusted, broken arm that lay in the seas and sands.</p>

			<p>SAG-AFTRA has <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-and-video-game-employers-reach-tentative-agreement-interactive-media-contract-national">announced</a> that it has reached a tentative deal with video game companies over the Interactive Media contract, potentially bringing the voice actors' strike to an end.</p>
<p>Performers under the Interactive Media Agreement (IMA) have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/sag-aftra-videogame-strike-now-in-effect-due-to-ai-concerns-potentially-leading-to-game-delays/">on strike since July 2024</a>, with the main sticking point being protections from companies abusing generative AI technology to use an actor's voice in perpetuity, without having to compensate them after the first contract agreement, or get consent from the actor to use an AI-generated version of their voice for future projects.</p>
<p>Now, a tentative deal has been reached, which SAG-AFTRA's national chief executive director and chief negotiator, Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, says "<em>puts in place the necessary A.I. guardrails that defend performers’ livelihoods in the A.I. age, alongside other important gains.</em>"</p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA president Fran Drescher added, "<em>Our video game performers stood strong against the biggest employers in one of the world’s most lucrative industries. Their incredible courage and persistence, combined with the tireless work of our negotiating committee, has at last secured a deal. The needle has been moved forward and we are much better off than before. As soon as this is ratified we roll up our sleeves and begin to plan the next negotiation. Every contract is a work in progress and progress is the name of the game.</em>"</p>
<p>Once the details of the deal have been finalized, which is expected to happen "<em>soon</em>," the strike will end<em>. </em>Performers under the IMA are still on strike until such time.</p>

At Summer Game Fest we got to sit down with <em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em>, continuing the story of Will and adding a whole lot more challenge to his adventure.</p>

<p>My time with the game caught me up on Will's story, seeking to adventure and raise money in the small town of Rynoka, as well as set up where we meet the characters at the beginning of the adventure. After opening the 5th dungeon, learning they were connected to alternate dimensions, they were tricked by Morloch the Interdimensional Collector who kicked them out of Ryoka.</p>

<p>This demo was an efficient and effective tutorial. Within moments, you're thrown into combat, have to explore a wasteland, and return to sell your wares. After your first dive you're introduced to a mysterious sentient cube that introduces her/itself as the Endless Vault, from there you're challenged to recover goods enough to gather a large sum of gold.</p>

<p>Combat is a fast-paced hack-and-slash where you'll push to get deeper and deeper into each dungeon with every event. Along the way you'll encounter different 'arenas' where you'll take on enemies, claim a reward, and progress to the next room.</p>

<p>There was some very interesting modifications to each of the runs that I was able to try including causing hazardous effects to deal additional damage or effects, or that certain locations you could travel to as you dungeon crawled would be inhabited by more difficult enemies. The battles would be more difficult, but the reward even greater.</p>

<p>Exploring the town, there were a number of shopkeepers with interesting-looking signs that lent themselves to the idea that, as the story progresses,d there would be a lot to do in terms of upgrading your equipment, abilities, and capacity for items.</p>

<p>In every way this experience felt like <em>Moonlighter </em>but bigger and better. If you were a fan of the original game, or like the idea of a roguelite with a very robust gameplay loop then you should 100% try <em>Moonlighter 2 </em>and it's available demo.</p>

            <p>
When you have a game that is so run focused like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, balance is the key to not getting someone to throw their controller at a wall, cursing their own birth as they do so. Up until now, there were parts of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> that certainly weren't balanced, though that mostly came down to a few bugs. As of today though, there's a new update you can download for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> which brings in some much needed fixes.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For starters, there's a big fix for Libra, Creature of Night. Previously, Libra could get stuck in a loop of doing the same attack over and over again (one worst case scenario seeing this occur a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1l4lm4r/72_consecutive_attacks/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-update-aims-to-fix-one-nightlord-boss-tanking-your-framerate-the-other-from-going-berserk-and-mashing-you-into-paste-with-72-consecutive-attacks/">whopping 72 times</a>), but that's now been fixed. You'll also find that the game won't look as much like a slideshow when facing off against Adel, Baron of the Night anymore, as a bug that meant the game's stability wasn't so stable has now been fixed.
</p>
<p>
One fix I find personally funny is that there would occasionally be an issue where during the "Find the Demon Merchant in Limveld" personal objective, said Demon Merchant just shouldn't show up. That too has now been fixed, but I do love the idea of just being stood up by a Demon Merchant as you set about on your quest. Sad moody fanfic when?
</p>

Bow users will technically be in for a bit of a tougher time, as a bug that caused physical attack power to increase on bows when a passive magic, lightning, or holy effect was added to the weapon has now been fixed. There's a few other small fixes too, you can read about those on the <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-nightreign-patch-notes-version-1012">official patch notes</a>. A small update overall to be sure, but one that's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-now-confirmed-to-be-getting-those-duo-expeditions-plus-enhanced-fights-against-its-current-nightlord-crop">paving the way for duos somewhere down the line</a>.

I’m not sure the revered director ever uttered the words “unrecorded night” in public before his death, yet the mere possibility of it existing made every diehard Lynch fan reflexively try to figure out what it was about. According to Deming, the series was going to continue Lynch’s focus on Los Angeles, which started with films like <em>Mulholland Drive</em> and <em>INLAND EMPIRE</em>.</p><p>“It was definitely a really interesting… mystery,” he explained. “To me, this was another LA canon for him, and one that sort of mixed in filmmaking and Old Hollywood a bit.”</p><p>One thing Deming is definitive about is that <em>Unrecorded Night</em> “was definitely not <em>Twin Peaks</em>,” the surrealist drama series the reclusive genius is most known for. Lynch previously pointed to his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/aug/05/david-lynch-says-he-is-too-ill-to-direct-films-in-person&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/article/2024/aug/05/david-lynch-says-he-is-too-ill-to-direct-films-in-person" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">declining health</a></span> and disheartening <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://pitchfork.com/news/73313-david-lynch-says-he-is-done-making-movies/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://pitchfork.com/news/73313-david-lynch-says-he-is-done-making-movies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">changes in the movie industry</a></span> as reasons for him never making movies again. Even so, he was still a filmmaker at his core, as Deming implied they didn’t know how many episodes <em>Unrecorded Night</em> was going to be, since the script was written as one long story rather than an episodic one. “I really love the feature stuff, but he was like, ‘I’m not going to make any more movies. I’m just going to make longer stories because I love the longer story.’”</p><p>Unfortunately for all of us, Deming revealed that they had only scouted locations to film once before COVID-19 hit, which doused any momentum the series had of being created before Lynch’s death. I’m sure there are legions of fans willing to give up their firstborn child to get a copy of that script for a final dive into one of the most eccentric creative minds of our time. But whether it’s released to the public or not, it’s good to know that Lynch was committed to cinematic storytelling until his dying day.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-slot-machine-roguelike-is-way-too-intense.1214697/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/cloverpit-demo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remember the whole dust-up about whether <em>Balatro</em> is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/602800/gambling-video-games-balatro-luck-be-a-landlord" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gambling</a>? Perhaps inspired by that situation, roguelike <em>CloverPit</em> also insists it’s not gambling. In the most basic sense it’s not–there’s no money involved–but by forcing the player’s attention to the mechanics of slot machines, the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314790/CloverPit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam demo</a> raises questions about what gambling is and what makes it so insidious.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="PC Gaming Show - Release Window Announcement - Teaser Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8MEvTiH66X4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>In <em>CloverPit</em>, you find yourself in a creepy metal room with an ATM, a phone, and a slot machine. When you win money from the slot machine, you put it in the ATM. You need to deposit increasing amounts of money to keep a trap door from opening under your feet and ending your run.</p><p>The slot machine works like a normal slot machine: You pay for a certain amount of spins (weighing the cost of your choice against the money you need to feed the ATM), pull the lever, and a random assortment of symbols comes up. Developer Panik Arcade <a href="https://press.futurefriendsgames.com/cloverpit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writes</a> that, despite this, the game “is <em>not </em>a slot machine simulator. Our slot machine is designed to be broken and ultimately overcome.” You do this by using tickets you can earn to buy trinkets from a display. These trinkets can give you extra spins, increase the money value of certain symbols, give you more luck, or prevent negative outcomes such as turning up “666” and losing all your money. Some trinkets operate on their own, while others require pressing a button to activate.</p><p>You also get calls on the phone that give you additional modifiers, like earning you more money or making some slot machine patterns more valuable. There’s some graffiti scrawled above the phone warning you not to trust the caller, so I’m curious to see what that looks like in the full game.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Panik Arcade</figcaption></figure><p>That’s basically the deal! Despite the developers claiming the game isn’t a slot machine simulator, my brain sure saw it that way. It is terribly compelling to pull the lever and see what happens. Outcomes felt random to me even with my trinkets; in a game with strategy like <em>Balatro</em> this would be frustrating, but faced with little in the room besides the slot machine, the whole thing became exactly as entrancing and exciting as a real-life slot machine. At the same time, because randomness has such a different weight in video games, I felt hyper-aware of this; I felt like I was watching myself do something random and stupid, reaching for the lever before my spin had even fully finished, starting again when I died, certain I could crack the code. When I got a jackpot, filling the slot machine screen with coin symbols, I felt like the greatest player alive; when a 666 came up, I cursed my luck aloud. When I won, making it through a requisite number of rounds to end the demo, I leaned back in my chair with a gasp, my heart pounding, even though I couldn’t be sure what was my own skill and what was just dumb luck.</p><p>Panik Arcade writes, “If you’re looking for a real gambling experience please look elsewhere. Or better yet, don’t look at all. We don’t really like gambling. That’s what the game is about!” I can definitely see this: <em>CloverPit</em>’s horror vibes and limited mechanics really put my focus on me and how I was reacting to the game, whether or not I was getting overly invested in one of the grosser inventions of humanity. As a kid, I had an inexplicable talent for horses and dogs, when my dad would place bets for me at the track and I would consistently win absurd amounts of money. I’ve sometimes wondered if I should see if that skill still stands; the way I felt playing <em>CloverPit</em> made me realize I should probably definitely not.&nbsp;</p><p>The developers write that the full game will have multiple endings and more items, and plan to release <em>CloverPit</em> this summer.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/geoff-keighleys-yellow-sneakers"><h3>You Can Always Count On Sneakers</h3></a><p>The one thing you can count on Summer Game Fest for</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Lots of survival-crafting games get many updates over many years, and though Obsidian's Honey-I-Shrunk-The-Crafting-Game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grounded/" data-ref-id="5000-504764">Grounded</a>, is one such game, I also didn't expect a sequel to come out so soon. During Summer Game Fest 2025, I was able to play 30 minutes of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grounded-2/" data-ref-id="5000-681580">Grounded 2</a>, both from the opening minutes of the game and with a save file that threw me into the middle of the game. Afterward, this topic was the first I brought up with the studio: Why couldn't the team continue building on Grounded instead of moving on to a sequel?</p><p dir="ltr">"So there are a couple of different reasons," game director Chris Parker told me in a roundtable chat. "We did continue to build on Grounded. So there were four major updates after Grounded 1.0 released, and then some other support updates that came out. But on one hand, there were some limitations with technology, because Grounded was supported all the way back on the Xbox One, and so our ability to sort of grow on that platform was pretty restricted," he explained, admitting that it maybe could've been solved if the team really needed it to, but moving on from the Xbox One let the team pursue other new features, too.</p><p dir="ltr">"One of the big things was that there were some features, like in particular, buggies, [the game's new vehicles in Grounded 2,] that we wanted to solve," Parker said. "In order to solve those, we really needed to think about how they worked in the world, and what that world space looked like. They run faster, they fight differently, they do different gathering. We want to make sure all of those things work together really, really well.</p><p dir="ltr">"And in fact, our Grounded 1 team thought about doing buggies. They messed around with them for a little while, but they just found that the world space didn't really work. They made this game where we ran around. And so for us to really take this on and do this thing that we knew the community super, super loved and really wanted, we decided to go from the ground up."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q0HQNOtg1WI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/q0HQNOtg1WI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Buggies are definitely Grounded 2's biggest feature revealed based on what we know so far. When the game launches in Steam Early Access and Xbox Game Preview, two buggies will be available to start: the red ant and the orb weaver spider buggies, and each of them will come with their own abilities. To obtain a buggy, you actually have to steal an egg, then hatch it at your base, creating a friendly version of the normally hostile bug.</p><p dir="ltr">The red ant soldier buggy is more like a "general purpose buggy," Parker explained. "It can harvest and it can place blueprints, and it can build, and it can fight with you on it, or as a companion, sort of alongside you. It can haul stuff, it has its own inventory." The orb weaver, meanwhile, has a more specific use case. It's "much more for exploration and fighting, because it's really, really good at both of those, and it's faster. It's just awesome to ride around on a spider, assuming they don't freak you out too much, but we do have arachnophobia mode coming back again," referring to the oft-praised accessibility feature.</p><p dir="ltr">Parker said "just everything in Grounded 2 is somehow tied to feedback from the community that we had gathered at one time or another. We have a gigantic database of things that the community had asked for on Grounded 1, and when we started Grounded 2, a lot of what we started with was, 'What parts of this are things that we want to dive into and attack? And do we think we can do [them] well and actually serve the community by tackling this stuff?' So pretty much everything is focused on that," he said, revealing that buggies were the "number one most-requested feature," and so the team is excited to get that to players on day one.</p><p dir="ltr">Day one, in this case, means the early access launch, which comes to Xbox Series X|S and PC, including Game Pass, on July 29.</p>

		<p>As is tradition at this point, I have played a ridiculous number of demos in readiness for the launch of the Steam Next Fest. Many of these were interesting, whilst a depressing number were either non-functional, riddled with AI slop, or, in the case of horror games, eerily repetitive due to taking place in the same Unity asset house that I’ve seen countless times before. Those negative aspects aside, there are a load of great-looking titles on the horizon and here’s my top 10 horror demos (notable titles Holstin and Tormented Souls 2 will be getting their own posts once I’ve played them).</p>
<hr>
<h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3555980/Caput_Mortum/?snr=1_7_7_151_150_1">Caput Mortem</a></h3>
<p>Caput Mortum is an immersive sim with an innovative control scheme and a fantastic sense of atmosphere. Your hand is controlled by the right stick while camera controls are carried out through the shoulder buttons. This takes a little getting used to and makes the combat extra challenging but the puzzle-solving potential is obvious. The 16<sup>th</sup>-century setting is an extra bonus.</p>
<p><iframe title="Caput Mortum | Demo Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ESYEM-0cb_g?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2767530/Wicked_Seed/?snr=1_7_7_151_150_1">Wicked Seed</a></h3>
<p>Wicked Seed brings a novel fusion of traditional survival horror and JRPG in a modern third-person perspective. The generous demo contains a significant slice of the game and shows the depth of the combat and an interesting range of puzzles. Whilst a little rough around the edges, this shows immense potential.</p>


<h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2835690/The_Demons_Told_Me_to_Make_This_Game/">The Demons Told Me to Make This Game</a></h2>
<p>This one like a knowing horror take on the RPG/adventure stylings of Disco Elysium as you control a spirit who must possess humans to prevent a demonic catastrophe. Whilst dying is normally the end in games, here it becomes a learning opportunity as you reverse time and use your knowledge to take things in a different direction. Witty and clever, I’m keen to see how complex the time management becomes in the full version.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="The Demons Told Me to Make This Game - Official Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VucibRZS8xg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2768030/Saborus/">Saborus</a></h3>
<p>Saborus sees you take on the role of a chicken trying to escape from a sinister meat-packing facility. Whilst the human workers are a terrifying threat in and of themselves, there is also a strange conspiracy at work trying to use genetic experimentation to create freakishly large animals to maximise production. Whilst I initially thought this was a meme game, it actually plays pretty well with your chicken being able to pick up objects in its beak and wander across computer keyboards to activate machinery.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Saborus - Announcement Trailer | Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X and Steam" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TRAec9RGu-o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2975680/__Revelation_of_Decay/?snr=1_7_7_151_150_1">Revelation of Decay</a></h3>
<p>This top-down pixel survival game is equal parts Stardew Valley and Days Gone with added co-op potential. While the demo establishes the main controls, it is obvious that this is a game that could consume you if you let it, with an absolute wealth of mechanics and content. I’m certainly keen to get my online friends involved (even if just to stop them playing the awful 7 Days to Die!)</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Revelation of Decay: A Pixel-Style Survival Video Game Incorporating Farming and Fighting Zombies" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-oSNHt2PrFY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3462190/PHASE_ZERO/">Phase Zero</a></h2>
<p>A traditional Resident Evil PSX clone with graphics and controls to match. The combat is super challenging in this build, whilst puzzles are fresh but familiar enough for genre fans to appreciate. The demo takes place in a hospital, which feels perfectly on point, but there are plenty of new touches to distinguish it from the games that clearly influence it. Above all else, finishing the demo unlocks a legs-only character model, which indicates the devs have a keen sense of the absurdity of the best classic survival horror games.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="PHASE ZERO - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a1h-GV6rfgc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3197890/LURKS_WITHIN_WALLS/">Lurks Within Walls</a></h3>
<p>Lurks Within Walls is another genre fusion, in this case taking survival horror and mixing it up with classic grid-based dungeon crawling. The end result is a game that cleverly combines the best of both genres to give a real sense of fragility and claustrophobia.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="LURKS WITHIN WALLS | Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SSCKJO84w4Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1645630/FEROCIOUS/">Ferocious</a></h3>
<p>Ferocious is the latest game to capitalise on the terrifying potential of dinosaurs, this time emphasising the survival part of survival horror. When you are capsized on a mysterious island, you must venture forth to find your brother. Along your path, you’ll discover ancient ruins, oversized insects, mercenary gangs and lethal carnivorous dinosaurs. The demo itself is a little too focused on human enemies, but the systems feel soli,d and the potential for prehistoric enemies in this genre is clear.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Ferocious Gameplay Trailer  - Open Playtest Just Started! | tinyBuild Connect 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/E0nB4Hf8zC4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2419670/Eclipsium/?snr=1_7_7_151_150_1">Eclipsium</a></h3>
<p>Eclipsium is one of the most visually striking games I’ve played in a while. Standard first-person exploration is elevated by a highly dithered artstyle that feels like a fever dream. This style is appropriate as the game itself appears to take place in a dreamworld and dying sees you wake up in your bedroom again only to step out of the door and find yourself back in the dream. The demo is largely focused on puzzle solving but has a fantastic sense of atmosphere to accompany the visuals.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Eclipsium Demo Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rMHF5I7p3GU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3511700/Flesh_Made_Fear_Demo/?snr=1_7_7_151_150_1">Flesh Made Fear</a></h3>
<p>Another classic Resident Evil clone, but one that absolutely nails the atmosphere and feel of the original series. You play as one of two alternative members of the special R.I.P. squad and must track down a sinister scientist and prevent him from bringing about a catastrophe. However, it soon becomes clear that you may be too late as you face hordes of shambling zombies and other more dangerous mutations. Everything from the controls to the voice acting screams classic Resi and this sizeable demo really shows off the feel of the game.</p>

<p><em>As always, new demos are being added to the Next Fest as it begins so let me know in the comments if any other interesting horror games have caught your eye. Next up I’ll have a list of other more general games that I enjoyed!</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/mouse-pi-for-hire-preview-spilling-buckets-of-ink<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been following&nbsp;<em>Mouse: P.I. For Hire</em>&nbsp;for quite a while now, and it really is awesome to see a game grow into something truly special. The progress Fumi Games has made since first showing off&nbsp;<em>Mouse</em>&nbsp;is nothing short of incredible.</p>

<p>To that end, I was honored to get a hands-off look at&nbsp;<em>Mouse: P.I. For Hire</em>&nbsp;during Summer Game Fest 2025. We followed the protagonist, Jack Pepper, as he shoots his way through an Opera House in order to prevent an assassination.</p>



<h2>Taking on Big Mouse</h2>

<p>Before my presentation, I was under the impression&nbsp;<em>Mouse: P.I. For Hire</em>&nbsp;was a boomer shooter. The type of FPS that's mostly pure run-and-gun, non-stop shooting. That perception is wrong, and I'm actually glad to see it's something much more.</p>

<p>Boomer shooters are great and all, but it's quite a saturated field at this point. <i>Mouse: P.I. For Hire</i>&nbsp;may or may not have started development as a simple shooter, but it's definitely grown into its own thing.</p>

<p>It's more narrative-laden and exploration of levels also seems to be emphasized in the demo. Jack Pepper talks with several different NPCs throughout the demo, and each character has its own voice actor, too.</p>



<p>Jack Pepper is voiced by Troy Baker, so you know that his performance is going to knock it out of the park. Other characters have a squeaky, gangster-like accent which is what I'd expect from the noir vibes&nbsp;<em>Mouse: P.I. For Hire&nbsp;</em>is going for.</p>

<p>So, our player explores ways to enter the Opera House to prevent an assassination of a mouse named Stilton. It's a bit difficult to understand the context of the story at this point, but the main thing I want to focus on is that there is definitely a goal in the story Jack is working towards.&nbsp;</p>

<p>He combs his way through this Opera House, first incognito through the kitchen (staffed by cartoonish mice, of course) then through an air duct. Either way, his plans on going in quiet go awry, and it's time to take out the big guns.</p>





<p>Gunplay in&nbsp;<em>Mouse: P.I. For Hire&nbsp;</em>looks nothing short of excellent. Every 2D element in the game is hand-drawn the old-school way, so that means guns are expertly animated, as are various NPCs, since they're all 2D too.</p>

<p>Guns have this wiggly look to them that oozes with old fashioned charm. Everything about the firing animations are exaggerated. Enemies die in the goofiest ways. Words really can't do it justice.</p>

<p>One gun, in particular, left me laughing. The Turpentine Gun melts enemies, literally. Since&nbsp;<em>Mouse: P.I. For Hire</em>&nbsp;enemies are hand-drawn, turpentine, a paint, strips their skin down to the bone. Regular guns make enemies bleed ink, which is just as ridiculous and silly.</p>



<p>After fighting through various rooms across this surprisingly large opera house, we reach the backstage and foil the assassination plot. Prima Donna, a portly mouse, drops from the ceiling and attacks Jack.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A short mini-boss battle ensues. Prima Donna seems tough, but it's nothing you can't handle. Her gimmick is charging after you, so dodging and weaving is the key here. She takes more bullets than your normal enemy,&nbsp; but the turpentine gun makes short work of her.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Mouse: P.I. For Hire&nbsp;</em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The remainder of the demonstration involves a chaotic, mad dash to the exit of the building. The building is now burning down, and various enemies are charging after you while parts of the environment crumble away, trying to bar your path.</p>

<p>I really can't praise&nbsp;<em>Mouse: P.I. For Hire&nbsp;</em>enough. It's a game that oozes with creativity in a genre that's already highly competitive. I would still love to get my hands on it and play it for myself, but for now, just watching it is more than enough to know I'm sold.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
Finding <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P: Overture</a> a bit too hard? Don't worry, I'm not going to tell you just "get good" like those randos you see littered all over Twitter. I'm actually here to say that you're not alone on this one. The story expansion for the conceptually weirdest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-soulslike-games">Soulslike</a> in town dropped during Geoff's Onslaught Of Generally OK Announcements (aka, Summer Game Fest) as a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lies-of-p-overture-gets-surprise-release-right-now-so-you-can-play-it-instead-of-staring-at-geoffs-awful-shoes">surprise release</a>, and it seems like the general feedback so far has been "please make it a bit easier so Twinkocchio doesn't get battered so hard."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
In a Director's Letter shared earlier today from Jiwon Choi, the game director shared that the team has been reviewing all of the feedback they've received over the past few days and are "already looking into when to implement some of your suggestions." Specifically, they'll be paying "closest attention to the combat experience.

<p>
"We identified areas that did not turn out quite as we intended. Therefore, we are reviewing various adjustments, including difficulty reduction. However, combat is one of the most fundamental experiences in Lies of P, so any modifications or changes require meticulous work and thorough testing."
</p>
<p>
Probably worth noting that this letter didn't feature any kind of window as to when the patch might be coming. Choi explained that the video was more to let P-Heads (that's what I like to call Lies of P fans) know that changes will be coming somewhere down the line.
</p>
<p>
That previously announced update that includes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lies-of-ps-upcoming-easy-difficulty-modes-have-wonderfully-unhelpful-names">new difficulty settings</a> arrived with the DLC too, allowing you to either make both it and the base game easier or harder. Feeling very thankful to have not seen any of the usual annoying discourse when it comes to such features in Soulslikes, but alas, there's always tomorrow.

And if you want one of these big heads, you’ll have to spend the same amount of money on it as you would on a copy of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-clips-stunts-rewind-wall-1851783907&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-clips-stunts-rewind-wall-1851783907"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a></span><em>. </em></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://amctheatresshop.com/products/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-galactus-361oz-popcorn-container-with-led?srsltid=AfmBOopOPUD0er0nUQmfzxrErX66yJDCsPzQcOJ0xjb3J22EAWpZGQdh&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://amctheatresshop.com/products/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-galactus-361oz-popcorn-container-with-led?srsltid=AfmBOopOPUD0er0nUQmfzxrErX66yJDCsPzQcOJ0xjb3J22EAWpZGQdh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The new AMC Galactus bucket is listed on the website for an eye-watering $79.95</a></span>, and that’s before tax!

I’ve heard similar stories while talking to other AMC employees about these gimmick buckets for a future report. </p><p>Many tell me that they will sit around for ages, and sometimes are sold for a few dollars a few weeks after the movie hits theaters.

So, as always, when you incredulously ask, “Is anyone going to buy this?” the answer is still yes. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<header><section>
<p>But PS5 and Xbox Series X|S have it beat</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c0fc6cf3e7b3c/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Switch 2 is Nintendo's biggest console launch of all time in the UK, according to NielsenIQ data shared with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/how-a-nearly-six-hour-phone-call?utm_campaign=email-half-post&amp;r=357pt4&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email">The Game Business</a>.</p>
<p>While NielsenIQ does not share specific figures, the Switch 2 has reportedly outsold the original Switch by more than 2 to 1 (though it should be noted that the Switch 1 was pretty hard to come by in those early months).</p>
<p>According to Nintendo, the Switch 1 sold over 80,000 units at launch, while the 3DS managed 113,000. So we're probably looking at around 160,000 units for the Switch 2, at least. That said, with the UK being a notoriously difficult market for Nintendo, the Switch 2 has not managed to outperform the PS5, PS4, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the top ten best-selling console launches in the UK:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. PlayStation 5<br>
2. PlayStation 4<br>
3. Xbox Series<br>
4. Nintendo Switch 2<br>
5. PlayStation 3<br>
6. Xbox One<br>
7. Nintendo Wii<br>
8. Nintendo Switch<br>
9. Xbox 360<br>
10. Xbox One X</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's also reported that the Switch 2 has sold more than 200,000 units in France, making it the biggest console launch of all time in the region, selling almost double that of the previous record-holder, the PS5.</p>
<p>Chances are Nintendo will share global sales data for the Switch 2 fairly soon. The company has forecast sales of around 15 million units for the first financial year, and it's said that the Switch 2 could well be the biggest console launch of all time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-out-now-after-a-strong-head-start-weekend/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Funcom's large-scale multiplayer survival game <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-surprisingly-adds-private-servers-at-launch/">Dune: Awakening</a> is now out for all players after its strong head-start weekend, with a new gameplay trailer debuted to mark the event.</p>
<p>Dune: Awakening has already had a great start to its launch, with more than <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1172710/charts/">117K players at once jumping in for the head start weekend,</a> which was only available to those who had pre-ordered the game's deluxe edition. Anyone who just bought the base game is free to head to Arrakis now, but it's a credit to Funcom that the game is already hitting high concurrent numbers like that with just deluxe edition owners.</p>
<p>While Dune: Awakening is out for players on PC today, it isn't out for those looking to head to Arrakis on consoles. We've known for a while now that the game would be coming to PC first, but it looks like players on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S will have to wait until next year to play Dune: Awakening.</p>
<p>In a press release for today's launch, Funcom confirmed that the game will be out on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S "<em>sometime in 2026</em>."</p>
<p>The studio also debuted a new trailer for the full launch, which is a massive cut of previous trailers smashed together for the game's full launch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dune: Awakening — Your Path to Awakening" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YOGwZO_i-6o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Just yesterday, ahead of today's launch, Funcom's chief executive and technical officer, Rui Casais, delivered a message to players, thanking those who had already jumped in for play, and their patience, as Funcom does its best to respond to any issues that come up in the course of the game's launch.</p>
<p>"<em>Believe it or not, we do look at all your feedback across social media, Discord, support tickets, and Steam reviews. And we're working around the clock to mitigate any issues you find and improve the overall experience,</em>" Casais said in his video to players.</p>
<p>He also addressed players who have expressed issues with long queue times, saying that more servers will be added for today's full launch, and that Funcom is working to make sure player distribution between servers is evenly balanced. "<em>Worry not, there is enough capacity for all of you,</em>" Casais said.</p>
<p>And though Casais expressed confidence that Funcom is on top of everything with the launch of its latest big online multiplayer game, that didn't stop him from asking players to have some patience with the studio in these early days.</p>
<p>"<em>Funcom has been making online worlds like this for 25 years, and I have been personally doing it for soon 24, and I can tell you this is my most exciting launch so far. I can't wait to see more of you enjoying the game, and would ask you to please bear with us, if not everything is silky smooth when we open the game tomorrow. This is only the beginning. We have years' worth of plans for Dune: Awakening, and I want to once again thank you all for joining us on this journey.</em>"</p>
<p><iframe title="Dune: Awakening — A Word From Our CEO Before Full Launch" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4LATnWmRFbQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Now that the game is out, players can also pick up the Season Pass, which includes the Wildlife of Arrakis DLC, which includes "<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">four in-game statues celebrating some of the planet’s most tenacious creatures: the sandworm, chiroptera, kulon, and Muad’Dib.</span></em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">" The three other DLCs included in the Season Pass are expected to launch in Q4 2025, Q1 2026, and Q2 2026, with Funcom also releasing free content updates between the paid DLCs.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/684247/xbox-ally-x-hands-on-gears-of-war-reloaded<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Xbox has revealed its new handheld line, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682009/microsoft-asus-rog-xbox-ally-devices-new-windows-xbox-experience">the ROG Xbox Ally and the Xbox Ally X</a>, made in partnership with Asus. And I got the chance to play it during Summer Game Fest. My colleague Tom Warren has already broken down <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices">how the handheld works</a> with its operating system, UI, and integration with the Xbox app and third-party game stores. Meanwhile, I’ll get into the simple experience of playing the dang thing — and the biggest selling point, for me, was comfort.</p><p>Despite my best efforts, the Xbox PR reps did not let me peek at the device’s storefronts or play the much-anticipated <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>. So for this brief hands-on overview, I’ll cover the game that I did get to play — <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em>. </p><p>I can sum up my experience with the Xbox Ally X (as I recall, the less powerful white Xbox Ally was not available) with a few words: I need this. The Xbox Ally X felt roughly the same weight as a Steam Deck. But with its hand grips, modeled to resemble the form factor of an Xbox controller, it felt like a literal dream. </p><p>I’ve struggled with my Steam Deck for a long time because it’s not comfortable to hold. After extended gaming sessions, my hands stiffen into claws that take a moment to regain their flexibility and normal use. While I wasn’t able to spend hours playing the Xbox Ally X to test my hands’ endurance, I could already notice the difference in my fingers within moments of picking it up. It felt <em>good</em> to hold, both in weight and form factor.</p><p>As for playing <em>Gears</em>, it was a seamless experience. Microsoft had the remaster of the seminal Xbox shooter (its second remaster in the game’s 25-year history) set up across the different platforms that the game supports. I played on a regular Ally at first, then I moved over to the Xbox Ally X, and the differences were subtle but noticeable. The device’s weight felt comparable to a Steam Deck. I performed better on the Xbox Ally X, which could be a component of having already warmed up, but my shooting was tighter and more accurate. </p><p>Visually, between the Ally and the Xbox Ally X, I didn’t notice a difference, but I really wasn’t looking for one. I was so enamored with how comfortable it felt in my hands that any graphical differences seemed less important in comparison. I wish I could have seen more of the home UI to judge the ease of loading in games or jumping from Steam games to Xbox games or judge Xbox Play Anywhere games versus those streamed from an Xbox or over the cloud. But like I said, the eagle-eyed PR folks kept this to a <em>Gears </em>demonstration only. </p><p>I love the portability of my Steam Deck, Switch, and PS Portal. Those three are my preferred ways to play over my desktop and consoles. While there are still a lot of question marks around the Xbox Ally X, particularly with its interface and how it holds up over long sessions, that little bit of comfort has gone a long way to selling me on a portable Xbox.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Players are fighting for their lives just to survive early kangaroo and elephant mobs. </p><p>Two things seem to be going on. 1) the base game of <em>Overture</em> is very hard. 2) enemy scaling for New Game Plus has ramped up significantly. As a result, players who should in theory be the most experienced at the game are finding the DLC the most difficult. “It’s beyond overtuned,” wrote one fan. “Like I’m all for difficulty but my lord is it wild how much more difficult it is from the main game.” Another added, “They messed up DLC NG+ scaling there is no doubt. I think there will be patches that fix this, but for now...We suffer or reduces the difficulty lol.”</p><p>Some players have been doing exactly that, taking advantage of Neowiz’s controversial decision to add difficulty options to its Soulsborne, to make progress after hours of hitting their heads against brick walls. The South Korean studio has been taking notice, and released a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BY3Zw_nOCI&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BY3Zw_nOCI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Lies of P</em> Director’s Letter on YouTube</a></span> on Tuesday to share cryptic details about upcoming changes to the DLC. </p><p> “We identified areas that did not turn out quite as we intended,” Ji Won Choi told fans. “Therefore, we are reviewing various adjustments, including difficulty reduction. However, combat is one of the most fundamental experiences in <em>Lies of P</em>, so any modifications or changes require meticulous work and thorough testing. We are still reviewing the specific details and schedule for a patch, but we wanted to let you know as soon as possible why it’s taking our team some time, and the general direction we’re heading.”</p><p>The citizens of Krat can breathe a small sigh of relief than knowing that their slog through Overture might become a little more forgiving in the weeks ahead, though a set release date for the upcoming patch, as well as what Neowiz actually plans to change, remains pending. In the meantime, we can liberate ourselves from our Soulsborne shame and make use of the newly-introduced easier modes. </p><p>“The release of additional easier difficulties alongside the DLC almost seems like a justification for how much of a difficulty wall there is between the base game and the DLC—enemies hit stupidly hard, and have stupidly high HP,” wrote one player on Steam. “If you’re into that, great, but I found the DLC far more enjoyable when I went down a difficulty, and it felt like a far more natural progression on the base game.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/invincible-vs-is-a-brutal-bloody-3v3-tag-fighter<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Some things just feel right. When I first laid eyes on Invincible VS, my thoughts were something along the lines of, “Yeah, that makes sense.” If you were going to choose a comic book to adopt into a fighting game, you could do a lot worse than Robert Kirkman’s magnum opus. It’s got everything you need for a tag fighter: bone-crushing hits, a big cast to draw from, a cool art style, plenty of unique superpowers that can easily be converted into special moves, the works. But Invincible VS has a secret weapon, too: its developer, Quarter Up. That name might not be familiar to you yet – they’re a new studio – but they’re anything but rookies. Several members of the 40+ person development team played a core role in the development of 2013’s Killer Instinct, and you can feel that influence. Seeing Invincible VS is one thing, but when I sat down to play it and speak with members of the team, I knew I was among fellow sickos – and I mean that in the most complimentary way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the problems with previewing a fighting game is that you never have enough time with it to really dig into its systems. This is an incredibly complex genre; every time you sit down with a new fighting game, it’s a new experience. Some of it is like riding a bike. Hold back to block. Your assist button will also tag if you hold it. That sort of thing. But a lot of it is new. You gotta learn your button layout; you gotta figure out how combos work, what kind of defensive systems you have, what your special moves do, all kinds of stuff. If I had my way, I would have spent hours in Invincible VS’s training mode just tinkering with teams and learning how things worked. As it was, I only had about an hour. But even with such limited time, I left feeling like I knew what Invincible VS was by the time I put my fightstick down.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Invincible VS - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Let's get the elephant in the room out of the way: Invincible VS is still very, very early in development. It absolutely nails the look and general vibe of the show, mostly because Quarter Up is working directly with the folks who made it. There's still a lot left to do (the build I played didn't have proper lip syncing yet, for instance), but if you’re worried about whether this will honor the source material, don't be.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If you’re worried about whether this will honor the source material, don't be.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Invincible is a brutal, bloody, often shocking story, and that’s reflected in how the characters interact on-screen. If you’re the one dishing out the hurt, your character will quite literally get blood on their hands. It just isn't theirs. Meanwhile, if you’re the one getting hit, it'll be obvious. If you’ve been blocking with your face, the bruises will make sure everyone knows it. That pristine costume will look like you’ve lost a fight with a lawnmower; the rest of you will resemble a prizefighter who just went 12 rounds with a heavyweight… or just Mark himself after he’s been fighting his dad. Invincible VS is far from the first fighting game to do real-time battle damage, but it looks great, and I appreciated how I could tell who was winning without looking at the health gauge at the top of the screen,  and that it matched the show’s visual language. There’s <em>a lot</em> of blood here, folks. And hey, if you end a fight with the right special or super move (and we’ll dig into the gameplay in a second, I promise), you can pop Atom Eve’s head off or turn Bulletproof into a series of limbs missing a torso.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And it’s not just the characters absorbing all this damage. The environments will feel the impact of these super-powered brawls, too. There’s less of a visible impact on the moon because… well, the moon is kinda empty. But in a city? You’re gonna see buildings falling down, cars getting totaled, streets getting torn up, the works. Superheroes trying to kill each other generally doesn't go well for anyone (or anything) else in the immediate area. And hey, just because you start a brawl in a city street doesn’t mean it’ll end there. You can absolutely punch somebody so hard they break orbit (or end up on another, different stage).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, so the presentation stuff is really cool, but the appeal of any fighting game is the actual fighting. I didn’t have enough time to really dig into Invincible VS’s core systems, but a fighting game can’t just have smart design choices backing it. Landing hits has to feel good, too. And Invincible VS has that part down pat. In a lot of ways, it resembles the tag fighters of yesteryear, but there are some unique twists here. You’ve got your standard light, medium, and heavy attacks, as well as a light autocombo for folks like me who were just starting out. Special moves are their own button, but Invincible VS doesn't use motion inputs. You choose your special kind of like you do in Super Smash Bros: pick a direction and press that special button.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So the core gameplay is a lot like Marvel or Dragon Ball FighterZ. Lights go into mediums, which go into heavies (though you can do things like switching between crouching and standing normals to spice things up and open up new routes), and down and heavy gets you a launcher for an air combo. You can also enhance your special moves for special properties and extra hits if you’ve got the meter, and bone-crushing, human-smushing, jaw-removing supers for when you’re ready to cash out (and see a slick animation that will likely leave your opponent getting literally scraped off the area floor; plus, they’re easy to do. Just press heavy and special at the same time, and you’re golden). Standard tag fighter stuff, but what makes Invincible VS cool are the core systems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of them you’ve seen before: you’ve got a pushblock to get people off of you, snapbacks to bring a damaged backliner back in so you can keep pouring up the hurt, defensive saves where you can bring in another character to save the one getting comboed, assists for each character that isn't on the field (this is a tag game, after all), ground bounces to set up interesting combo opportunities, and the like. There are way, way too many options to dig into here, but if you’re worried that the simplified control scheme means Invincible VS might not have the juice, let me alleviate that concern for you right now. Once I got put into a high/low mixup I blockstun by Bulletproof’s rekka, I knew this was a game for degenerates (which, again, I saw as a compliment).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing I will dig into is how Invincible VS determines combo length. As you hit your opponent, you’ll see a meter build up. Fill it, and your combo will end because your opponent will fall out. This means that while basic combos in Invincible VS aren’t short, they’re not as long the ones you'll find in Marvel 3 or Dragon Ball FighterZ. You’ll be out of that combo and back in the action (or dead) before your next birthday.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>While basic combos in Invincible VS aren’t short, they’re not as long the ones you'll find in Marvel 3 or Dragon Ball FighterZ. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But there is a way around that. Tag in one of your other characters, and you’ll reset part of that combo meter, allowing you to lay additional smacketh down. Getting the most out of your characters requires spending meter or cycling through your team. Neither of these concepts is new, but I appreciate what Quarter Up is doing to make Invisible VS unique. I also like how different the characters feel. The build I played only had four fighters to choose from, but Bulletproof and Thula quickly stood out to me, though neither Invincible nor Atom Eve felt bad. Part of the fun of a tag fighter is building a team that works for you; these characters already feel quite different from one another, and that’s a good thing. Thula slicing you to pieces with her hair? Rad. Bulletproof calling you a cab? Iconic.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The other thing I appreciate are the little touches, from the unique intro dialogue between the characters (this is becoming more and more rare in modern fighters) and the Dragon Ball FighterZ-style clashes when a new character comes in. These serve to reset the playing field and let you take a breath, but there’s also more ubique dialogue here, too. I love stuff like this, and I'm happy Quarter Up has embraced it wholeheartedly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When I set my arcade stick down after about an hour with Invincible VS, I felt pretty good. Trying a new fighting game is a lot like driving a new car for the first time. You’ve got a general idea of what you’re getting, but the devil’s in the details. I left pretty pleased with my test drive. Quarter Up still has a lot of work to do, but I can’t wait to kick Invincible VS’s tires for real and see what she can do on the track. Fighting games are a tricky business, but it’s also easy to tell when they’re on the right track. Invincible VS has a killer team behind it, the tools and the resources they need to do the comic and the show justice, and a lot of good ideas. Let’s just hope they can pull off a superhero landing, and look good doing it.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/grounded-2-first-hands-on-preview-bigger-than-before<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">In a delightful surprise for Grounded fans, Obsidian took to the stage at the Xbox Games Showcase last weekend to reveal an unexpected sequel simply dubbed Grounded 2. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian has shared that Grounded 2 will take cues from its predecessor by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/honey-i-cant-believe-grounded-2-is-real-and-launches-in-xbox-game-preview-next-month">similarly launching into early access</a> and growing over time with the support and feedback of the community. That early access launch is soon, too; next month, to be exact. I got a chance to play a little bit of what players will be shrinking into next month at the Xbox Games Showcase in Los Angeles over the weekend. And my overall impression, which I say as a full-throated compliment, is that yup, that's a little bit bigger Grounded all right!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's admitedly hard for me to say much about the ways in which Grounded 2 differs from the first Grounded just based on the small, small snippet I played. I was given the option to jump into a later section of the game, but I opted for the tutorial to refresh my Grounded skills, which have gotten a little rusty.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thus, much of what I saw through that tutorial was, pleasantly, more Grounded. It's the same kids (albeit two years older now) shrunk down to ant size thanks to the shady dealings of a company called Ominent. Once shrunk, they suffer from a touch of amnesia that leaves them with little memory of what they were doing pre-shrinking, but luckily, our teens <em>do</em> remember the gist of their <em>last</em> tiny backyard adventure, even if they must reacquire many of the skills they developed the first time around. Crafting, for instance - you'll still be analyzing every item you come across, learning new crafting recipes, and slowly building new pieces of armor, weapons, tools, and other items to help you survive. Or you'll be scrounging around the early areas for food (mushrooms, in my case) and drink (dewdrops) so you don't starve to death. Or maybe you'll be fighting bugs or other critters, poking at them nervously with a crudely-made stick spear. All the fundamentals are still in Grounded, familiar and waiting for everyone who just wanted more of what the original was selling.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It's wild that the first Grounded didn't have a dodge button before now!</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What's new here was a little less obvious in a short, early-game sample, but I did get a taste of some of it. You'll get a new Omni-tool, for instance, that combines all of your tools into one for easy use without taking up inventory space. I didn't get to experiment with its myriad uses much, but I did use it to hack away at some enormous grass blades in place of an axe. Another new mechanic is the addition of a dodge button in combat, which fit in so smoothly I briefly forgot dodging wasn't a part of the first game. Both of these examples are relatively small quality-of-life features, but they seem poised to smooth out some of the wrinkles in the overall experience long-term. It's <em>wild</em> that the first Grounded didn't have a dodge button before now!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest new piece of Grounded 2 that I actually got some decent hands-on time with was the Buggy system - essentially mounts. I was able to ride proudly astride a big ol' ant. It...kinda ruled? It's fun to ride a big bug? Galloping around on my ant steed aside, the Buggy actually comes with quite a few other interesting features packed in. You can sprint, or you can swap to a much slower gathering mode that will have your Buggy collect any resources it runs into as you pass them, eliminating the need for time-consuming harvesting. Buggies can also fight on your behalf, or chomp down on blades of grass or other choppable items to hack them down. At one point, I skittered through a nest of mites, gripping a glowing mushroom torch and letting my ant do the dirty work of munching away every mite that threw itself at me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was told in an interview after our preview session that it's these Buggy mounts that essentially necessitated Grounded 2, albeit alongside other factors. The first Grounded was never designed for the speed at which mounts can cover ground. As a result, the map was too small for Obsidian to ever implement Buggies as a real, useful feature for anyone. The only way to get the oft-requested rideable bugs into the game was to make the game much, much bigger.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And that's what I'm told has happened here. Grounded 2 takes place not in a backyard, but in Brookhollow Park, which Obsidian says is roughly three times the size of the backyard from the first game. I think I saw, like, maybe the teensiest, tiniest, earliest-gamest corner of that park - the nice, easygoing space that's intended to acclimate both new and returning players to the world of Grounded before sending them off on an ant-riding adventure into the unknown.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I still have a lot more questions about what Grounded 2 is bringing to the picnic table that will justify an entirely new game as opposed to just expanding the existing Grounded. Mechanically, I'm not fully sure rideable bugs is going to sell me on it. Then again, Grounded is heavily story-focused, and Grounded 2 opens the gate to a brand new story. It lets Obsidian age up its protagonists, progress Ominent's nefarious nonsense, and expand the world. And it remains true that the first Grounded was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grounded-review">pretty dang fun just as it was</a>. So sure. I'll take more of it, plus bug riding. Ride like the wind, bugs-eye.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
