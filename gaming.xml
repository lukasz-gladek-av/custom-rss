			<p>Today, a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/11/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-september-the-plucky-squire-night-in-the-woods-under-the-waves-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new blog post</a> dropped on the PlayStation website, announcing the PlayStation Plus game catalog for September. Compared to previous months, this month seems to be a heavy focus on indie games, with it getting the most recent release of The Plucky Squire, which will be a day-one release for PlayStation Plus. Those who have an active PlayStation Plus Premium or PlayStation Plus Extra will get access to these games and can own them until their subscription runs out.</p>
<p>The Plucky Squire is the headliner, joined by games such as Night in the Woods and Under the Waves, new classics, and a PS VR2 game offering to those who are on PlayStation Plus Premium, which includes the game Pistol Whip. All of the games being added to PlayStation Plus will be available from September 17.</p>
<p>In addition to the game mentioned, games such as Chernobylite, Wild Card Football, Space Engineers, Road 96, Ben 10, and Far Cry 5 are being added to September's catalog, giving players a lot of variety and games for all the family. Far Cry 5 has been in the PlayStation Plus catalog before and is being re-released again for PlayStation 4 users.</p>
<p>Regarding PS VR2 and classics being added to the list, Pistol Whip is the main PS VR2 game that will be available to play and is the only PS VR2 game on the PlayStation Plus September catalog. However, for those who want a hit of nostalgia, games such as Secret Agent Clank, Sky Gunner, and Mister Mosquito are all being added to the PlayStation Plus September lineup.</p>
<p>Already, the comments under the blog post are not happy with this month's lineup. People say last month was terrible, and this month is giving away games that are already on sale, which feels disingenuous to some of the PlayStation gamers out there. However, some people are happy with the games, especially with games such as Under the Waves, Sky Gunner, and Mr. Mosquito being some of the more hyped-up games in the comments for those who want a hit of nostalgia.</p>
<p>Overall, Sony appears to be in murky water regarding&nbsp;<span>its&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-specs-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> announcement. The console costs</span>&nbsp;an exorbitant amount of money, not including a disk drive and stand. On top of that, the PlayStation Plus catalog has been predominantly disappointing for gamers for multiple months now, with nothing seeming to be worth adding to the library, according to some of the comments.</p>

		<p>FromSoftware has released a brand new patch for Elden Ring, and patch 1.14 addresses issues players raised about the difficulty of the final boss in Shadow of the Erdtree.

Elden Ring patch 1.14 also adjusted some elements to the PvP, and there have been general balance adjustments too. You can read the full patch notes below.</p>

</ul>

<p>In our Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree review, Jason said, <em>“I find myself wishing Shadow of the Erdtree had a continuation from one of the endings of Elden Ring, or ventured back to explore the Shattering itself. Instead, it feels like a filler episode in Naruto. Sure, the fights are cool, and there’s a new progression system to work through, but what is the point if nobody is going to acknowledge it again for the rest of the series. But hey, at least the Convergence Mod team will have a field day with all of this new stuff to play with.”</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Space Marine 2 Tips and Tricks for the Ultimate Ultramarine]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-tips-and-tricks/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/space-marine-2-tips-and-tricks-for-the-ultimate-ultramarine.978273/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-tips-and-tricks/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On the surface, Space Marine 2 appears as a straightforward action game. You move through a level, smashing, ripping, and tearing apart Tyranids, but it’s much more. If you don’t time your parry or dodge properly, you’ll take severe damage that can end your mission early. We’ll help you complete the task, Ultramarine. Here are our Space Marine 2 tips and tricks to help you better serve the Emperor!</p>



<h2 id="h-first-complete-the-space-marine-2-campaign">First, Complete the Space Marine 2 Campaign</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Most people want to dive straight into the PvE Operations or PvP Eternal War game modes in Space Marine 2, but we recommend completing the campaign first. The story mode, which does allow for three-player co-op, unlocks additional PvE content in Operations mode, and if you choose to skip the story, you might spoil the tale.</p>



<h2 id="h-don-t-be-afraid-to-lower-the-difficulty">Don’t Be Afraid to Lower the Difficulty</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>There’s a certain power fantasy that stems from playing as an Ultramarine. You want to be the meanest machine in the galaxy, stomping on Tyranid tails and tearing apart your foes with a Bolter, right? But on higher difficulties, you’re a piece of meat, and Titus can and will die with as little as a single well-placed strike. While you grasp the game’s combat and mechanics, don’t hesitate to lower the difficulty. It’s super satisfying to stomp through a level unrivaled by any Xenos!</p>



<h2 id="h-learn-to-parry-and-dodge">Learn to Parry and Dodge</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Saber Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>Just because you’re a massive Primaris Space Marine doesn’t mean you’re immune to any and all damage. It would help if you still took care to avoid damage by learning to wield the parry and dodge mechanics effectively. The campaign teaches you both early on, but they take time to master. </p>



<p>When you spot the blue circle around an enemy, parry. When you spot the red circle, dodge. It’s all about timing your prompts and knowing when to click the correct button on your controller or keyboard.</p>



<h2 id="h-explore-your-surroundings">Explore Your Surroundings</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>As you move through each level, specifically in the story mode and PvE Operations, you’ll note various pathways, outcroppings, and crates. Occasionally, you’ll spot the body of a fallen Ultramarine, and they usually have some equipment, like a weapon or a Relic, that will help you complete your objectives. </p>



<p>But people tend to forget about crates. After all, this is a video game. If you crush, shoot, or smash the crates littering the levels, you’ll often receive ammunition, grenades, and Medicae kits that will come in handy!</p>



<h2 id="h-executions-keep-you-in-the-fight">Executions Keep You in the Fight</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>When you deal enough damage to an enemy, they’ll flash red, indicating they’re vulnerable to an execution or finishing move. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve played Operations only to witness players either outright ignore the flashing notification or continue shooting the enemy with a Bolter. Don’t! Race into the fray, slam that execute button, and perform a finisher on the Tyranid foe!</p>



<p>When you perform a melee finishing move, you’re invulnerable. It’s a few seconds of breathing room to regain your composure and plan your next steps. But it also restores your armor.</p>



<p>This is just the beginning of our Space Marine 2 tips and tricks! We’ll have more as we delve deeper into the game!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/video-game-industry-layoffs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been a hellish few years for people employed in the video game industry,<a href="https://aftermath.site/search?s=layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> as big studios have been laying off workers every chance they get while smaller studios are just straight up closing</a>. We’ve all read the stories, and scanned the numbers of people affected, but what happens to the individual in the wake of their career (and life) being upended?</p><p>A career video game developer's first instinct upon being laid off--or quitting a job that had become too much--might naturally be to go and find another job in video games. That's how previous boom and bust cycles have tended to work in this business. But as the layoffs continue and funding for new studios dries up, in 2024 the math simply doesn't add up. There just aren't enough jobs for all those looking.</p><p>Leaving those affected with a dilemma: they can either keep trying to find a job in the cruellest game of musical chairs imaginable, or they can walk away and try to do something else with their lives. For some, this means feeling pushed away from the career they'd once given their lives to, but for others it’s a chance at a fresh start that won't condemn them to decades of secrecy, turmoil and exploitation.</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-site-back-to-school-week" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As part of our Back to School week</a> we spoke with a number of video game developers who, over the past few years, have been forced out of their jobs and are now trying something new. In doing so we're not trying to advocate for people leaving video games, nor are we trying to glorify the act of pursuing something else; each story is an individual story, some of them full of regret, others grateful at new opportunities.</p><figure><blockquote><p>There is a joy in doing something you are really good at, and I miss that feeling.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Bruce </strong>(not their real name) has had a rough few years. Having left a small indie studio whose funding fell through in 2022, they'd been working as a level designer on an online multiplayer game before being laid off in April 2023. Deciding to walk away from games entirely, they're now trying to find a desk job, in particular one as "boring and stable as possible".</p><p>"I'm currently doing a state-sponsored web development program for unemployed people, which is about 630+ hours and is basically a condensed, fullstack web dev course aimed at developing web apps (like storefronts, managing employer databases, etc). I wanted to pair it up with a two-year program of the same type, but since it's a very popular course I couldn't get a spot. So I'm probably going to do some more certifications and try and get a job in web dev early next year."</p><p><strong>Saf Davidson</strong> had been Lead Narrative Designer on a project (now cancelled) at Eggnut,<a href="https://www.gameshub.com/news/news/eggnut-tails-noir-studio-shut-down-layoffs-2637769/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a New Zealand studio that closed down a few months ago</a>. She was laid off on Christmas Eve, 2023. After spending a few days feeling "super miserable and terrified of the future", she woke up one day and just went "nah, screw this".</p><p>"I'd been travelling around the States visiting family/friends for a few weeks before getting laid off, and the whole time I was there, everyone kept remarking on how much I knew about plants and how big of a nerd I was being about the different ecosystems", she says. "I think that kind of triggered the unconscious thought process of 'hey maybe I'd like to do something with this'".</p><p>Having finally snapped after being "treated like shit" in games, she decided to go back to university and study plant science. Albeit, with some inspiration from...games. "<em>Halo's</em> Dr Halsey is one of my favourite characters in the world, which I know is insane to say because she's absolutely not someone to idolise as a scientist, but there's a biologist in the last episode of season 2 of the terrible terrible <em>Halo </em>show who says something like 'Doctor Halsey is the reason I became a biologist' and I've never felt more called out in my life.</p><p>"Halsey's got pretty awful morals, but I have to admire her work ethic, you know?", Davidson says. "I can also trace wanting to be a botanist specifically back to playing <em>Control</em> when it came out. The person/people who did the plants in that game put an insane amount of love into them, which broke through my plant blindness (a real thing!) and made me really start paying attention to plants. Not sure I'd be here without the adeniums of <em>Control</em>. So it's largely thanks to games that I want to be a scientist, for good and bad reasons."</p><figure><blockquote><p>...you really do only live once. So I saw the layoff as an opportunity rather than a dire end.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Frank </strong>(not their real name) had been a Senior Concept Artist in video games who, after struggling for months with an IP director who did everything from ask "extremely unprofessional questions during team meetings" to uploading the team's NDA-riddled work to AI platforms without the artist's permission, was recently laid off. Having originally planned to spend a career working in games, their experience has encouraged a dramatic workplace shift.</p><p>"The interactive story element of games has always drawn me in", they say, "but my heart breaks to see this medium stolen by people who only see dollar signs. The game industry won't get better until we profoundly unionize, which I'm hopeful (and doubtful) for, but until then I need to take care of my own.</p><p>"The experiences I had at that game studio did so much more damage than mentioned here. Two therapists have now been so shocked and appalled by what I've relayed that they've been stunned speechless."</p><p>They're now hoping to transition to live-action movies, and are currently working on an initial film, with dreams to turn it into a franchise. "I wanted to do this for decades now, honestly", they say. "My work in games was a career, but it was never my life goal. It sounds silly, but you really do only live once. So I saw the layoff as an opportunity rather than a dire end."</p><p><strong>Anna Willoughby</strong> worked in UX at Blizzard, but after being laid off recently has decided to leave not just games, but the tech space entirely.</p><p>"The games industry is just such a mess", she says. "There's WAY too much enthusiasm around generative AI and generally scammy vibes coming from the C-suite at these companies. Creators and developers are just being abused left and right. The community is amazing but the management is awful. I'm also disillusioned with tech more generally right now, and am just not sure where to go from here".</p><p>Anna is now working as a line cook. "My current role was kind of just…I needed some money and knew I wanted as physical a job as possible. I've been at a desk for 20 years. It's wreaked havoc on my body and brain. My brother was working for a family friend at a country club restaurant and I was like…please let me do some manual labor, I need to move my body [laughs]".</p><p>While Anna would love to return to games if the industry is "regulated a bit more, and the labor movement keeps building", she's not holding her breath. Instead, she's hoping to soon open up her own food truck.</p><figure><blockquote><p>A lot of game dev career changes are actually really difficult because a lot of disciplines are super specialized to games.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Devon Wiersma</strong> had been part of an indie studio in Canada called Beans, working on a game for Devolver Digital. When the publisher pulled the plug on funding in early 2023, Devon--and around 30 of his co-workers--were laid off. While he's now able to work on his own personal games in his spare time, he's spending most of his days as a Course Director at a local university, while also applying for part-time jobs everywhere from libraries to fast food.</p><p>"I used to work at McDonalds for years before getting into game development, and ironically over the years I worked in game dev the prospect of working in a kitchen has become more appealing than being in games", he says. "My reasoning is that at least positions like these would allow me to actually spend my day getting some amount of exercise (vs. game development where I spend all day trapped sitting in chairs) and I always felt it was just more personally fulfilling to help feed people as a baseline."</p><p>While many of the career changes highlighted in this piece might seem swift, Devon reminds us that moving out of video games into something else isn't as easy <a href="https://x.com/simonparkin/status/1833418977944514798?s=46&amp;t=j3I4mG5u4HJArgR7jOFk_g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as driving an Uber or going to the beach for a year</a>. "A lot of game dev career changes are actually really difficult because a lot of disciplines are super specialized to games", he says. "The remark I always hear from programmers in games is that if they didn't like working in games they'd simply go off and work at a bank, because it's boring work but pays way better, or how UX designers might just leave games to work on apps, or webdev, or products as a last resort.</p><p>"For disciplines like Game or Level Designers (which is what I'm specialized in) it's a really tough thing to do without significant retraining, because our skills are so specialized to games; while soft skills are helpful, some of the closest parallels to Level Design outside of games, like architecture or city planning, require super specific training that would involve diving back into post-secondary education. I just often see the sentiment of 'If you don't like games then work somewhere else' and well...for some people in this industry that's nearly impossible to do without reshaping your whole career."</p><p><strong>Chris Ory</strong>, a veteran developer who had spent over a decade in video games, was recently laid off<em> twice in one year</em>, both times at companies with what he describes as "unbelievably toxic work cultures".</p><p>"After almost three years of toxicity and struggle I was completely burnt out", he says. "The idea of rolling the dice interviewing to join another possible shit show was paralyzing. I couldn't even step into my home office without a feeling of dread. I still don't go in there. I've given it to my wife as an exercise room. There were not a lot of interesting options encouraging me to fight through the negativity and get back on the horse. Also I am 46 and looking at my future in a notoriously ageist industry, I started calculating how much longer I was even going to be marketable."</p><p>During this time Chris, a vintage BMW bike enthusiast, inadvertently stumbled upon a new, very different career. Moving to Wisconsin after the second layoff, he sent his '81 R65LS to a place called<a href="https://boxerworks.org/pages/about-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Boxerworks</a>, one of the few shops in the entire United States that specialised in old BMWs. "Shortly after I got laid off the second time Nathan, Boxerworks' owner, called to let me know he had found an engine I had been waiting for. We started talking about my situation and it came up that he was looking to hand his business off to the right person.</p><p>"It was very important to him that someone would come in and continue his legacy, run the shop as a mom-and-pop operation and maintain the reputation, quality and positive work environment he had cultivated over the years", Chris says. "The opportunity to take over something so established and well respected in a hobby I loved seemed too rare to pass up. I took the plunge and came down here to see if I was that 'right' person. Four months in and things are going well."</p><p>Despite living over <em>four hours</em> away from Boxerworks, Chris is making it work by staying at home for four days then commuting to the store and staying overnight for three. As rough as that is (and it's something he's looking to rectify by opening a second shop closer to home), and as unpredictable as owning a small business can be, when I ask him if he'd ever be willing to go back to games, he's not so sure.</p><p>"That is a question I've been asking myself a lot over the last few months", he says. "There are lots of feelings mixed up there. I've seen so much of the games industry and been through the grinder enough to know the industry is pretty much as shit as it looks from the outside, but there are amazing people in it and working with them can be absolute joy. That makes it hard to think rationally about diving back in.</p><p>"I was very good at what I did. I was a great designer, I was a great design manager, I really deeply understand player behavior, player needs and the business of games. There is a joy in doing something you are really good at and I miss that feeling. But I feel an incredible freedom not having the whims of some tech exec be in control of my livelihood for the first time in a decade. Completely changing careers with little forethought at 46 is terrifying. I have so much to learn before I could even begin to take Nathan's place in the shop. I am totally over my head in a way that I have not been in nearly 15 years, my income has been decimated, I have 6 employees I am responsible for, a 75 year-old man's legacy in my hands, and I am happier than I have been in years."</p><figure><blockquote><p>...my heart breaks to see this medium stolen by people who only see dollar signs.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Trudy</strong> (not their real name), a writer, left their job in games earlier this year, and are now pivoting away from the industry given not just everything that has happened in the last 12 months, but everything that's been happening in games for a lot longer than that.</p><p>"Harassment and abuse has become an occupational hazard with a high mental and emotional cost, which makes it difficult to do the work with a clear head", they say. "Pile this on top of the contracting industry and the cost-benefit analysis doesn't add up."</p><p>With a background in education, they're now returning to that "to remind myself how rewarding it is to help people directly", while pledging to continue making games on the side. "A job in the industry doesn't affect my ability to make games for myself. Games is as much an artistic practice as it is a career path, so I'll protect my peace as much as possible."</p><hr><p>Remember, every time you read about 10, or 100, or 1000 layoffs in the video game industry, they're not cold statistics. Every one of those figures is a person. A life that has been upended, with enormous consequences for not just the individuals directly involved but their family and friends. Every single person affected by layoffs and departures has their own story to tell, their own history in the business and their own motivations for pursuing whatever comes next.</p><p>As we've seen here, sometimes a move away from the video game industry, with all its toxicity and uncertainty and exploitative working conditions, can be the best thing for a person. Other times it can be a traumatic experience, a lifetime's worth of expertise and passion crushed in an instant. Regardless of the circumstances behind someone leaving video games behind, I think the one thing that's clear hearing everyone's stories is that the choice, no matter its outcome, should have been theirs to make.</p><p><em><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://aftermath.site/category/back-to-school" target="_blank">Back to School&nbsp;</a>is a week of stories about changes, nostalgia, and learning new things.

The budget-friendly tablet starts with 64GB of storage and ads and features an eight-inch 1280 x 800 screen. That’s not as crisp as the display found on Amazon’s higher-end Fire tablets, but it’s sharper than the Fire HD 7 and good enough for basic entertainment needs.

If you’re new to gardening or are just looking for something relatively low-maintenance, I can’t recommend the AeroGarden enough. The LED-equipped planter is easy to use, with six pods that can grow vegetables, flowers, and herbs. You’ll have to buy most seed pods separately, but AeroGarden does include a complimentary starter kit and a bonus packet of lettuce seeds, so you can get started growing your indoor garden immediately. </li></ul></div><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/will-ps5-pro-run-gta-6-at-4k60-probably-not-say-the-experts<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The PS5 Pro is now a fast-approaching reality. The $700 mid-generation upgrade arrives on November 7, approximately a year in advance of the game that will likely push the four-years-old base PS5 to its very limits: Grand Theft Auto 6. But how essential will the PS5 Pro be to enjoying GTA 6 at its very best? It’s a question more complicated than it first seems.</p><p>“I think there's good evidence to suggest that the [GTA 6 trailer from last year] was running on either PlayStation 5 or Xbox Series X,” says Richard Leadbetter, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/authors/richard-leadbetter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">technology editor at Digital Foundry</a>. As such, the impressive level of graphical detail seen in that trailer should be achievable using the power of the original 2020 model PlayStation 5. It stands to reason, then, that the new PS5 Pro will be more than capable of delivering what we saw in that short glimpse of Vice City.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Frame rates, though, are an entirely different thing. When asked if GTA 6 could realistically run at 60 frames-per-second on the PS5 Pro, Leadbetter is blunt in his analysis: “No. Grand Theft Auto games have always run complex simulations that push the CPU hard, which is why every GTA game has initially launched on their target platforms at 30fps (or lower!). </p><p>“The PS5 Pro uses the same CPU as the PS5 and it would be extremely challenging to hit 60fps if the base PS5 version is targeting 30fps,” he explains. “This isn't a GPU problem, it's a CPU problem.” </p><p>There’s a multitude of simulation work running concurrently and constantly in GTA to keep its open world ticking. Every street is, at the very minimum, a stage for complex traffic and pedestrian simulations – AI routines and physics calculations that bring those roads and sidewalks to life. GTA 6 will very likely feature one of the most realistic depictions of city life we’ve seen in a video game, and so will be significantly taxing on the CPU as it renders all sorts of NPC behaviours. That leaves little bandwidth to boost those frame rates. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Grand Theft Auto games have always run complex simulations that push the CPU hard, which is why every GTA game has initially launched on their target platforms at 30fps.</p></div><p>Still, thanks to the PS5 Pro’s other enhancements, GTA 6 will undoubtedly look better on the new console. It just likely will not be the 4K 60fps experience many will be expecting following Sony’s boastful presentation. “What you will get will be higher quality visuals, but likely still running at similar frame-rates [to the base console],” says Leadbetter. “If GTA 6 can't sustain a locked 30fps (GTA 4 and GTA 5 couldn't on PS3 and Xbox 360), PS5 Pro can run the CPU with a 10 percent bump to clock speeds – so you may get more stable performance.</p><p>“Of course, all bets are off if Rockstar is targeting 60fps on the standard PS5 - but we've seen no evidence so far to suggest it is.” </p><p>While it seems unlikely that the PS5 Pro will run GTA 6 at 4K 60fps, there’s still reason to believe the new console will prove an impressive machine. Right now, though, there’s little evidence of its transformative abilities. “I think the hardware's certainly capable, but the actual presentation confused me,” says Leadbetter. “Nine minutes just isn't really enough to describe in depth the features the machine has and the philosophy behind the design.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Leadbetter also notes that the games showcased during the presentation were already fantastic graphical showcases in their original forms, and so were not ideal demonstrations of the Pro’s machine learning-based upscaling technology. Why was it the already gorgeous Horizon Forbidden West and Spider-Man 2 being shown off when we could have seen how transformative PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution could be for games that have shaky image quality on the standard PS5? </p><p>“Combine that with poor presentational techniques and YouTube's inadequacies as a video delivery platform and you didn't see much of an improvement,” says Leadbetter.  </p><p>While Sony has chosen to so far only preview enhancements to games that barely require them in the first place, we can at least be relatively confident that those titles in desperate need of a performance boost will be catered for. The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/10/welcome-playstation-5-pro-the-most-visually-impressive-way-to-play-games-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation Blog</a> states that up to 8,500 games will be improved thanks to the PS5 Pro Game Boost feature. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We might even <em>finally</em> get Elden Ring locked to 60 frames per second.</p></div><p>“I think [the improvements will] be quite cool actually, assuming the extra 45 percent of GPU power is fully available to existing games,” enthuses Leadbetter. “Many titles have dynamic resolution scaling. You should see clear image quality improvements there. Similarly, a lot of games have frame-rate issues in their 60fps performance modes – I'd expect those to be cleaned up. We might even finally get Elden Ring locked to 60 frames per second.”</p><p>One thing Leadbetter thinks is less likely to make an impact is the Pro’s 8K capabilities. While he foresees a very small number of tech-focused developers, like Gran Turismo 7 creator Polyphony Digital, making 8K resolution options available for PS5 Pro, he doubts other studios will work on such modes “because the audience out there is vanishingly small.” </p><p>“I had an 8K screen for four years, but even as an RTX 4090 owner, I have little interest in 8K gaming when high frame-rates at max 4K are so much more desirable,” he says.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Game Enhanced for PS5 Pro So Far</h3></div></output><p>Talking of Nvidia’s RTX graphics cards, PC gaming has been the much-debated topic following Sony’s reveal of the PS5 Pro’s eye-watering $699.99 price tag. I’ve seen several suggestions across social media that it’s better value to just save up a ‘little extra’ money and buy a PC that will prove more powerful than the PS5 Pro. It’s an argument I personally think is flawed – a strong 4K, high frame-rate PC will set you back notably more money than the cost of the new console. And, when it’s built, it simply won’t be capable of doing the thing many prospective PS5 Pro owners want: playing GTA 6 at launch with the best possible graphics. (GTA 6 will ship on console first, remember.)</p><p>Leadbetter has a similar outlook. “You will struggle to get that kind of visual quality on a similarly priced PC,” he says. “The closest GPU on the market now with that kind of feature set and performance is the RTX 4070 – which is a fair bit better, I'd say. But your base cost there is $540/£480. And then you need to factor in CPU, motherboard, memory, storage, power supply and case. </p><p>“You could offset the extra cost against the fact that you don't need extra subscription costs over time, I suppose, but I think you're missing the fundamental point of what PS5 Pro is and who is going to buy it.</p><p>“It's a console, not a PC – and there are still key differences there, not least in a viable living room experience. I'd also say the Pro is designed to appeal to core PlayStation users with a library built up over many years. That library will not transition over to PC so those users are effectively starting from scratch.”</p><p>Of course, that’s not to say that the PS5 Pro is a ‘good deal’. “That user base likely has a physical game library, too – so the notion you don't even get a disc drive for your £699/$699 is nuts,” Leadbetter concludes. </p><p>There may be other people looking at the PS5 Pro and failing to see a good value proposition, too, although for entirely other reasons. “I think Phil Spencer watched the presentation and felt vindicated in the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-reiterates-there-is-no-need-for-a-mid-generation-refresh-for-xbox-series-xs-right-now">decision not to make a 'pro' console for this generation</a>,” Leadbetter theories. “Xbox players already have a great way to play high-end Xbox games – and that's on PC, where the enthusiast has more freedom to pick and choose the kind of hardware they want.” </p><p>It’s true: Microsoft has been running three different platforms from the very start of the generation, offering a solution for players of all tastes and budgets. It is arguably Xbox’s biggest advantage over PlayStation. Who needs a Series X-X when you can play Starfield at 4K60 on a PC? <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/avowed-runs-at-30fps-on-xbox-series-x-and-s-obsidian-confirms">Avowed’s 30fps lock</a> simply isn’t a problem if you’ve already shelled out for an RTX 40-series graphics card. </p><p>But, as we’ve already said, the PS5 Pro is not a PC. It’s a different beast entirely. Is it the console the PlayStation hardcore needs, though? Let's see how fast it flies off the shelves this November. </p><p><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Warhammer 40k: Space Marine 2 - Space Marine Arsenal Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Epic released this statement to clarify Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2's usage of an Epic online services. The game installs an Epic Online Services client after the player accepts a EULA, even on Steam. Developer Focus confirmed in a <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/forums/27-bugs/threads/43800-quick-note-on-the-most-common-issues#post-207833" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">forum post</a> that the Epic client facilitates optional cross-play and syncs friend lists across services. However, linking Steam and Epic accounts is completely optional and will not affect gameplay.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/maligned-epic-account-login-requirement-results-in-new-steam-game-getting-review-bombed/1100-6525349/" data-ref-id="1100-6525349">Earth Defense Force 6 got criticized</a> for requiring an Epic Games login for online play. Helldivers 2 faced similar complaints for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-pc-players-will-be-forced-to-link-a-psn-account-sarting-this-month/1100-6523147/" data-ref-id="1100-6523147">requiring a PSN login</a>. As for Space Marine 2, the sequel has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-is-already-breaking-franchise-records/1100-6526389/" data-ref-id="1100-6526389">broken Warhammer records</a>. Nearly a quarter-million players booted the game up on Steam, besting Total Warhammer III's previous concurrent player-count.</p>

                <p>Last year saw a megaton of fantastic games arrive on PC and consoles, including the surprise release of Dead Island 2. Stuck in development hell for what seemed like an eternity, Dead Island 2 wasn't a GOTY contender, but it still had plenty of cheeky charm. And if you've been waiting to play it, you can grab the upcoming Dead Island 2: Ultimate Edition which includes the base game and tons of extra content for $70.

You'll also get some gear to help you survive the zombie apocalypse, like various weapon packs, premium skins for all six Slayers, and more cosmetics to apply to each character. Here is a list of all the included weapon and item packs:</p><ul><li>Deadly Weapons Pack</li><li>Memories of Banoi Pack</li><li>Golden Weapons Pack</li><li>Pulp Weapons Pack</li><li>Red’s Demise Pack</li><li>6 Slayer's Premium Skin Packs</li></ul><p>Preorders for the PS5 and Xbox Series X versions of Dead Island 2: Ultimate Edition are available for $70 at Best Buy.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you missed it when it first came out, Dead Island 2 is a horror-action first-person game that unfolds in Los Angeles after the city was overrun with zombies. It has a great sense of humor, plenty of interesting gameplay systems, and it's one of the best 7/10 games of 2023. Basically, it has a few annoyances, but the positives far outweigh the negatives.</p><p>"Games labeled as being in "development hell" rarely release in a state anyone would want to experience--if they release at all. With Dead Island 2, however, Dambuster Studios kicks away a decade of dev hell problems like they’re a zombie lunging for its throat to deliver an undead RPG that is surely imperfect, but also enjoyable and even inventive," Mark Delaney wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-island-2-review-eat-the-rich/1900-6418055/" data-ref-id="1900-6418055">Dead Island 2 review</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stanley-kubrick-the-shining-compendium-stephen-king-adaptation-preorder-guide/1100-6526309/">The Shining Compendium Box Set Is A Staggeringly Ambitious Examination Of Kubrick's Horror Classic</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/walmart-exclusive-lego-batman-bundle-comes-with-three-sets-for-only-50/1100-6526223/">Walmart-Exclusive Lego Batman Bundle Comes With Three Sets For Only $50</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-popular-pokemon-labyrinth-board-game-is-getting-a-glow-in-the-dark-edition/1100-6526286/">The Popular Pokemon Labyrinth Board Game Is Getting A Glow-In-The-Dark Edition</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cult-of-the-lamb-the-first-verse-graphic-novel-is-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6526253/">Cult Of The Lamb: The First Verse Graphic Novel Is Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trigun-manga-preorders-amazon/1100-6523338/">Save Big On Trigun Deluxe Edition Manga Ahead Of Next Week's Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-nightmare-before-christmas-manga-is-returning-to-haunt-the-winter-holidays/1100-6526230/">The Nightmare Before Christmas Manga Is Returning To Haunt The Winter Holidays</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sixth-sense-and-signs-are-finally-releasing-on-4k-blu-ray/1100-6526328/">The Sixth Sense And Signs Are Finally Releasing On 4K Blu-Ray</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/berserk-the-complete-1997-tv-series-is-only-37-at-amazon-best-price-yet/1100-6524954/">Berserk: The Complete 1997 TV Series Is Only $37 At Amazon, Best Price Yet</a></li>   </ul> </div>

Thanks to Sony’s new refurbished website for PS5s, you’ll soon be able to buy an older version of the console for a lot less money than the PS5 Pro’s eye-watering cost.</p><p>You can see everything that’s on offer on Sony’s <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/certified-refurbished">certified refurbished website</a>, which lists a bunch of products as “coming soon.” A refurbished PS5 in the original launch design with a disc drive will cost $399.99 (a $100 discount from a new PS5 slim with a disc drive), while a refurbished all-digital PS5, also in the original design, will cost $349.99 (also a $100 discount).</p><p>The store features refurbished DualSense controllers, too, with white and black controllers for $59.99 and purple, pink, and gray camo controllers priced at $64.99. (Those prices are a $15 discount off the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/9/24239722/sonys-ps5-controllers-get-a-5-increase">newly bumped DualSense controller cost</a>.)</p><p>“Every PlayStation certified refurbished product completes a rigorous recertification process that includes full testing that meets the same functional standards as new PlayStation products,” according to Sony. “Your certified refurbished product works like new.” However, in a footnote, Sony says the refurbished products “may have minor cosmetic imperfections.” The refurbished products will also come with a one-year limited warranty.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But merch lines like the Original Stitch collaboration (RIP) and the Sitting Cuties plush line are giving everyone a chance to own some cute, affordable, official representation of their favorite Pokémon. Now, The Pokémon Company is releasing the Generation VI Sitting Cuties plushies, so if your favorite ‘mon is from the Kalos region in <em>Pokémon X </em>and <em>Y</em>, your chance to grab a plush for them has finally arrived.<br></p><p>The new <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-kalos-war-az-switch-teaser-trailer-1851290552&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-kalos-war-az-switch-teaser-trailer-1851290552">Kalos</a></span> plushies cover Pokémon #650 to #721. That’s Chespin to Volcanion. However, the latest Sitting Cuties additions include a lot more plushies, with every variation of Vivillon and Furfrou in the mix as well. Vivillon is a butterfly with wing patterns that differed depending on where the player was geographically when it evolved, while Furfrou could take on one of ten different appearances if you trimmed its hair. The Pokémon Center made plushies for all of these, on top of every other Pokémon that debuted in <em>X </em>and <em>Y</em>. Surprisingly, it didn’t go a step further and make plushies of the Mega Evolutions that were introduced in Gen VI, but the standard forms of all those Pokémon have been represented with a Sitting Cutie plush.</p><p>As the name implies, the Sitting Cuties line is meant to sit comfortably on a desk. While some Pokémon designs aren’t usually meant to sit, The Pokémon Company has found a way to make it work for most of them. Others just kinda lay there. The full line is available now on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/category/kalos-region-plush?sort=launch_date%2Bdesc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/en-gb/category/kalos-region-plush?sort=launch_date%2Bdesc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the UK Pokémon Center store</a></span>, with the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">US store</a></span> expected to have listings in the near future [<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pokemoncenter.com/category/kalos-region-plush&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pokemoncenter.com/category/kalos-region-plush" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Update: here they are</a></span>].

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/who-is-the-700-ps5-pro-for.978171/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/who-is-700-ps5-pro-for<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony announced the long-awaited PlayStation 5 Pro this week, and with it came an onslaught of discourse about one particular point: the PS5 Pro price. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ps5-pro-announced-november">Retailing for $699 this November</a>, the PlayStation 5 Pro is the most expensive console of the modern gaming age, pricing out fans who might have considered buying it.</p>
<p>So, who is the PlayStation 5 Pro for? The 60 million players who have already spent up to $500 for the base PS5 won't exactly be eager to shell out another $700 after only four years. And those who haven't bought into the PlayStation ecosystem may be hard pressed to pay the premium price for what the PS5 Pro promises.</p>
<p>I've written before about <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/who-is-audience-for-sonys-project-q-streaming-device">who the PlayStation Portal was meant for</a>, and now I'm having similar questions about this new console. Who is willing to pay this high price, and will the product's performance be worth the cost of admission?</p>

<h2>Does the Performance Boost Justify the PS5 Pro Price? </h2>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X24BzyzQQ-8&amp;t=467s&amp;ab_channel=PlayStation">PS5 Pro presentation</a>, PlayStation 5 architect Mark Cerny said that 75% of players prefer playing their games on Performance mode, prioritizing 60 FPS over 4K visuals. The PS5 Pro is supposed to bridge that gap and add in better fidelity options with advanced ray-tracing while maintaining 60 FPS. </p>
<p>Games like <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> </i>and <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/last-of-us-part-ii">The Last of Us Part 2</a> </i>look genuinely better, creating some excitement over what the PS5 Pro is capable of. Other games, like <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ratchet-clank-rift-apart">Ratchet &amp; Clank Rift Apart</a> </i>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/marvels-spider-man-2"><i>Marvel's</i> <i>Spider-Man 2</i></a>, looked less impressive.</p>
<p>During the PS5 Pro showcase, Cerny was zooming in on leaves in&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</em><i>&nbsp;</i>to show how much sharper the pixels are. Is this something the average gamer will notice when viewing from several feet away on a large TV, often while quickly zipping through the environment? </p>
<p>A console that can handle 4K/60 FPS has been something the PlayStation community has wanted for a while, but it's also something many agree that the console we got four years ago should have been able to deliver on this. Plus, even with the higher PS5 Pro price, we're missing some key elements that are sure to be missed.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ps5-pro-price.jpg?itok=lVmtzGj1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ps5-pro-price.jpg?itok=-tealOaX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>At least they're up front about the vertical stand being sold separately?&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2>PS5 Pro Shortcomings: No Disc Drive &amp; No Stand <span>&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p>As hefty as the $699 price tag is, the PS5 Pro comes in a digital-only configuration with no disc drive and no vertical stand. These accessories are priced at $80 and $30 respectively, bringing the total PS5 Pro price to roughly $810 before tax. Want an extra controller or even a <a href="https://techraptor.net/platform/playstation-vr-2">PS VR2</a> peripheral? We're looking at well over a thousand dollars. </p>
<p>This pricing is extremely reminiscent of the PlayStation 3 launching at $599 back in 2006, but even the PS3 came with a Blu-Ray player, an expensive device that had yet to become a mainstream media player. By not including a disc drive or even a stand, Sony is rolling back some of the things we used to expect as standard features in our consoles. </p>
<p>The three selling points are all internal upgrades: </p>
<ul><li>A larger GPU with 45% faster rendering than the PS5</li>
<li>Advanced Ray-Tracing</li>
<li>AI-Driven Upscaling with PlayStation Spectral Super Sampling (PSSR)</li>
</ul><p>And to be fair, there are impressive improvements, and I'm curious to see what new PS5 games will look like and how they'll run when they fully take advantage of the PS5 Pro architecture. I just don't think it justifies a $699 PS5 Pro price tag, especially considering it only feels like we just recently moved on from games being cross-gen with PS4.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>A PlayStation 5 Pro Isn't a Big Enough Jump for the Price</h2>
<p>The PS5 Pro is a great showcase of why mid-gen refreshes have diminishing returns in the modern era. While the PlayStation 4 Pro offered the jump from 1080P to 4K, the PS5 Pro improvements feel more nuanced for those seeking faster framerates and better ray-tracing. </p>
<p>There is, without a doubt, a population of gamers who celebrate these improvements, but those same players likely already have a PC that offers the performance they desire. For the average PlayStation fan who enjoys gaming on a user-friendly console in their living room, I think they're having too much fun with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/astro-bot-review-90s-platformer-done-right"><em>Astro Bot</em></a> on their existing $500 system to consider that an upgrade is needed. </p>
<p>The reality is, we're likely within four years of the next generation of video game technology. So it feels like a weird time to make a $700 investment for what doesn't feel like a commensurate return. We're really just starting to see what the base PS5 is capable of, so it would make sense that many are happy with their current console.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After all, Play Has No Limits, but bank accounts sure do. </p>

            <p>Earlier today, Nic did me a great injustice by waving aside my suggestion that he write about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shroom-and-gloom">Shroom And Gloom</a>, because "I want to read you describing mushrooms in interesting ways". Nic, I have no interesting ways to describe mushrooms right now. I used up all the mushroom lore I've ever gleaned from real-life foraging when I wrote about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/morels-2-sure-has-a-lot-of-unicorns-for-a-mushroom-collection-game">Morels 2</a>, and I spent most of that article whining about unicorns. The best I can do as regards Shroom And Gloom is to say that these Shrooms do indeed look very Gloomy, possibly because some mad human has wandered into their warren and is now stabbing and eating them.</p> <!--more-->

<p>The aforesaid mad human (that's your character, yes) does not even bother to finish murdering the fungus folk before dining out on their butchered brethren. Slay a mushroom with a fireball, and you'll render the corpse "Toasty" enough to consume, stuffing its portly, seared body into your mouth even as you slice another mushroom with a wavy dagger. If this were an actual foraging expedition you'd at least want to count the spots and gills before sinking your teeth in.</p>
<p><a href="https://teamlazerbeam.itch.io/shroom-and-gloom">Find a fleshy prototype for Shroom And Gloom on Itch.io</a>. It's certainly got atmosphere, with a soiled 3D parchment world of unpleasantly nested 2D rock and vegetation. Moving along the branching path feels like crawling down somebody's intestine. Somebody who's been eating a lot of mushrooms, and treasure chests. Gangs of pugnacious toadstools pop up at intervals, ranging from tiddly, er - <em>consults <a href="https://www.abebooks.co.uk/9780746095898/Mushrooms-Funghi-Usborne-Spotters-Guide-0746095899/plp">Usborne Spotter's Guide</a></em> - Puffballs to rampaging Stinkhorns. Is this interesting yet, Nic? When I used to write for Edge, they'd chop your commission in half for calling things "interesting". It was one of those banned Edge words, like "wowza" and "ginormous".</p>
<p>You'll massacre the mycelium using ability cards, the mushroom's traditional foe. After 20 minutes with the demo, the card-battling is notable for a couple of reasons: firstly, the absence of conventional healing skills in battle means you'll want to devour at least half of the enemies you kill, and secondly, there's a "mood" system whereby you generate cards for "repressed rage", "impatience" and other states of mind, unlocking buffs and special attacks. Yes, this is a game in which victory may be achieved by tactically driving yourself nuts. In addition to your combat deck, you've got an exploration deck of cards that include various types of lockpick and shovel. I say "lockpick" - one of the "picks" is the ability to throw up corrosive goo. Ah, if only Thief's Garrett had thought of that one.</p>
<p>"Our dream version of this game features hundreds of cards, deep metaprogression and scores of unique enemies, spread across a dense network of caves and tunnels to explore!" explain developers Team Lazerbeam, who are being funded by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/anger-foot">Anger Foot</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/terra-nil">Terra Nil</a> developers Free Lives. "This prototype offers a taste of what that experience could be.</p>
<p>"We've shot for the stars with what we tried to cram into this prototype over 3 months of development, and we're really proud of what we pulled off," the blurb continues. "That said, please note that this is a prototype. Expect rough edges and some jank. Keep in mind this is all a work in progress." I hope they make it all the way to the finish, because Shroom And Gloom is my kind of desperately grim. One of the later-game card options lets you turn mushrooms into soup. I wonder if we'll get to hear mushrooms scream. That would be interesting.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A union within Call of Duty developer Raven Software is claiming that that Activision is “discriminating against” union employees and failing to negotiate in “good faith”.</p>



<p>That’s what the complaint against the company claims in the official charges filed to the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB).</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has received a copy of the complaint via FOIA request. Within the document comes the basis of the charge, which gives more information on claims of retaliation and discipline against members.</p>



<p>“In the six months prior to the filing of this charge, and on an ongoing and continuous basic, the Employer [Activision] discriminated against bargaining unit employees on the basis of their union membership concerning several terms and conditions of employment (e.g., pay treatment, hiring, work assignment and tasking, promotions, permanent work-from-home),” the charge reads.</p>



<p>“The Employer also engaged in surface bargaining, failed to engage in good faith on any economic proposals and on other mandatory subjects of bargaining (e.g., discrimination and harassment at work), and failed to meet at reasonable times and places for bargaining.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has once again reached out to Activision and Microsoft for comment on the claims. This story will be updated should a response be received. The last comment from Microsoft was a message to Stephen Totilo <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/raven-software-union-files-complaint-against-microsoft-and-activision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in August saying</a> that it will “negotiate in good faith.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-echoes-zelda-and-assassins-creed-with-its-action-packed-open-world<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Last month I went <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-is-like-god-of-war-and-dragons-dogma-had-a-baby-gamescom-2024">hands-on with Crimson Desert</a> to try out some of its brutal boss battles. I left the demonstration impressed by its fast combat system and spectacular monster designs, but curious as to what the wider world and gameplay of Crimson Desert looks like. What happens between those epic clashes? Now, thanks to a <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/crimson-desert-exclusive-gameplay">53 minute gameplay video</a> from developer Pearl Abyss that’s available to watch here on IGN exclusively, I have a much clearer picture. If Crimson Desert’s combat is a mix of God of War and Dragon’s Dogma, then its wider gameplay is more reminiscent of modern Assassin’s Creed and other quest-driven open world adventures. </p><p>The gameplay video introduces us to Kliff, Crimson Desert’s protagonist who sports a gruff Scottish accent and a no-nonsense attitude. After a prologue establishes a bloody conflict between the Greymanes and the marauding Black Bears, Kliff’s major goal is made clear: explore the continent of Pywel in search of his surviving Greymane allies who have been scattered following the battle. Kliff also presumably wants revenge against Myurdin, the demo’s first boss fight, considering the Black Bear chief seemingly murdered him. Quite how Kliff remains alive after having his body filled with arrows and his throat slit is a mystery left for the full game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p> The bulk of this preview demonstration is set in Hernand, a medieval town populated by a fun range of fantasy races that wouldn’t look out of place in any Tolkienesque fantasy story (look out for the giants and the antlered elf-like beings among the crowds). Similarly, Kliff’s interactions around its beautifully rendered streets are very much what you’d expect of a modern open world adventure game – there’s a horse you can whistle for, NPCs to be spoken to (via cutscenes, there's no dialogue options here) and hostile regions to infiltrate. That last one is where Crimson Desert has a little fun, as the demo shows Kliff changing into Hernandian Banquet Attire in order to walk past a castle’s guards unnoticed, much like how you can wear disguises in games like Hitman and Kingdom Come: Deliverance. I hope there are plenty of opportunities to do this, and various outcomes to your trickery; it would be fun if you could use disguises to open up new conversations as well as gain entry to forbidden zones.</p><p>Inside the castle, Kliff pilfers an ‘Abyss Artifact’, which is where Crimson Desert gets a little more unusual. The device opens up a pixelated portal in a wall, and walking through it transports Kliff to a digital-like realm (reminiscent of the Animus in Assassin’s Creed) that leads to the Library of Providence. There, an alchemist called Alustin reveals that the Library is at the centre of all worlds and that there are beings who plan to bring “everything to nothingness”. While I can’t say I’m impressed by Crimson Desert’s writing in this demo – this exchange and others feel cluttered and wrapped up in themselves – it does point to a much grander, more mythical plot beyond Kliff’s hunt for his allies. That ambition of something larger is made abundantly clear when Alustin’s ally, White Crow, gives Kliff the glider-like ‘Crow Wings’ ability, which allows him to leap off the Library’s floating island and reenact Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom’s title sequence. It’s a little bold to use this motif – can Pearl Abyss really craft something that lives up to the wider meaning of that iconic visual? – but even if it falls short, the magnificent view and subsequent glide to earth is a thrill all the same. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Crimson Desert - Open world exploration and questing screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Back on the ground in Hernand, Kliff soon finds himself in a duel with a local knight. It’s another good example of Crimson Desert’s fight mechanics (more on that in our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-desert-is-like-god-of-war-and-dragons-dogma-had-a-baby-gamescom-2024">gamescom preview</a>), but it also triggers the start of the demo’s major questline. Impressed by Kliff’s combat prowess, a local peacekeeper tasks him with finding and eliminating some local bandits who fight using a red mist. Heading out in search of such villains, Kliff comes across a burning house and throws nearby vases of water to save the clergyman trapped inside. It’s not clear from the demo if such objectives organically occur around the map, Red Dead Redemption 2-style, but what is soon clear is that this blaze is the work of those aforementioned bandits. The local church says one of their men, Hubert, fled the scene in an attempt to bait the enemies away and asks Kliff to find him.  payment is another one of those Abyss Artifacts, once again suggesting the worlds-beyond-worlds are of high importance to Crimson Desert’s story. I hope this results in a decent amount of weirdness that helps set the largely typical setting apart from other fantasy games. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Pearl Abyss is making good progress in its transition from Black Desert Online’s MMORPG into single player territory.</p></div><p>Hubert is found at a bandit camp that allows the demo to show off Kliff’s stealth abilities. It’s pretty classic stuff and looks very reminiscent of silent takedowns in the Assassin’s Creed games – not particularly challenging, but an alternative option to Crimson Desert’s more publicised melee brawls. Hopefully when we go hands-on again, stealth will prove a worthwhile addition rather than a shallow tacked-on extra. </p><p>With Hubert freed, Kliff is approached by the goblin Shakatu, a merchant of the Goldleaves guild. He explains that the Goldleaves are currently under the command of the evil Split Horn, someone Kliff must now kill. In return, Shakatu offers money and his services, things Kliff believes will be helpful in finding the missing Greymanes. </p><p>Arriving at the Goldleaf camp, it quickly becomes clear how all these quests are linked. The goblin guards use red mist as part of their battle tactics, and so reveal themselves as the very same miscreants that were causing trouble for the people of Hernand. And so Split Horn’s death not only allows Shakatu to take over and help Kliff, but also fulfils the task set by the peacekeeper back in town. I hope Crimson Desert features plenty more of these overlapping goals and storylines, and forms a wider narrative that feels enjoyably interlaced. That would certainly make up for the uneven quality of the writing shown in the demo.   </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/10/crimson-desert-kliff-shakatu-1725975076438.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Kliff makes a deal with the goblin merchant Shakatu.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Split Horn (who, amusingly, looks more like a bobblehead elf than any of his goblin brothers) acts as the culminating boss fight of the demo. He’s as agile and aggressive as Crimson Desert’s speedy combat demands, wielding a sword that emits blasts of wind in vertical and horizontal patterns, forcing Kliff to dodge and block as he attempts to close the distance. Unlike the bosses featured in the gamescom demo, though, he has just one health bar and doesn’t put up quite as much of a fight. It’s over soon enough, further suggesting that the game will feature a variety of challenges big and small – add ‘small windy Joffrey’ to a list that already contains ‘mega wrestler with stag antlers’, ‘the abominable snow deer’ and ‘a literal mountain’. </p><p>This new look at Crimson Desert continues to show that Pearl Abyss is making good progress in its transition from Black Desert Online’s MMORPG into single player territory. I don’t think anything shown in this demo particularly breaks new ground – much of it is very familiar if you’ve played the likes of modern Zelda, Assassin’s Creed, or The Witcher 3 – but it nonetheless looks largely well put together. While I do hope that the Abyss Artifact storyline goes suitably off-the-wall, I’d like to see the more typical fantasy storylines find suitable hooks to ensure regular gameplay feels more varied and creative than what we’ve seen so far. With a combat system that shifts from classic sword-and-board action to slingshotting Spider-Man-style around a walking mountain, the questing and exploration side of Crimson Desert ideally also needs to aspire to that kind of diversity. But even if it doesn’t, this latest slice of gameplay certainly suggests that the bridges between epic boss battles will be solid, if not the most memorable aspect of the experience.  </p><p><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-review-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><em>Editor's Note: This review takes a fresh look at Fortnite in 2024, replacing our </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/03/27/fortnite-battle-royale-review"><em>previous review from 2018</em></a><em>. You can read more about </em><a href="https://corp.ign.com/review-practices" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>our review policies and philosophy here</em></a><em>.</em></p><p>It’s wild to think about how much of gaming culture over the last decade has been defined, at least in part, by Fortnite. This is a game that began humbly before expanding wildly into a juggernaut of an online sandbox, where somehow Aang from Avatar: The Last Airbender can crash a sports car into a Stormtrooper outpost before popping out and shooting Family Guy’s Peter Griffin with a neon assault rifle and then gliding away on a Cacodemon from Doom. But despite the absurdity of that sentence, Fortnite isn’t <em>just </em>a collection of branded cardboard cutouts scattered throughout a cartoony island: It’s managed to grow to this level because it’s also an enduringly fun battle royale shooter, and its momentum has been built on by season after season of updates that go all-out to pull you back in right when you thought you were done. </p><p>Whether you’re playing in Fortnite’s signature mode that allows you and up to 99 others to mine resources and then magically build structures like ramps and walls for cover on the fly, or the more traditional building-free battle royale mode that’s all about smooth moving, punchy shooting, and fun vehicles, its bounty of extra objectives, smattering of NPCs and named locations, and in-game missions set it a cut above other games in the genre. Each match starts even before the Battle Bus drops you from the sky, as you pick out a quest from dozens of different missions and objectives that infuse each of the roughly 15-minute rounds with extra purpose and direction. Maybe you want to take care of some daily missions to jump a few levels ahead in your battle pass, or maybe you want to find a specific NPC like Centurion, who can help you in battle by either selling you powerful weapons and healing items or squadding up with you to help stack up some eliminations and chase the number one spot. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Fortnite Gameplay Screenshots (2024)</h3></div></output><p>Regardless of where you choose to land on the island or why, Fortnite’s mission structure cleverly guides you towards engaging with its large, interestingly laid-out map by peppering locations and quests throughout the island and naturally encouraging you to discover things off the beaten path as you run, drive, or glide from objective to objective. Stumbling upon a character who can help you hide or a vault with extra gold that you can use to buy items and services from NPCs is more rewarding than simply running to find loot and staying alive the longest within an ever-shrinking safe zone.</p><p>When you land, your priorities might immediately be influenced by a mission or even a randomly selected match quest, which prompt you to do weird things like emote at a named location or eliminate an opponent with a specific type of weapon in order to earn experience points for your battle pass. Of course, the catch is that everyone else is trying to kill you as you do this, so you have to balance it with the task of gearing up with a healing item and guns. Naturally, everyone knows the best of those items will be at defined spots like The Underworld or Doomstadt… and the fact that people know this makes those landing zones riskier to explore because you’re all but certain to run across others straddling the line between brave and stupid, which leads to scrappy, no-holds-barred showdowns. But Fortnite lets you play it safe as well, so if you prefer to land somewhere less contentious you’ll still be able to find weapons and other helpful tools like shield potions off the beaten path.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Epic isn’t afraid to mix the balance up with more creative ideas.</p></div><p>Either way, few players will have a fully stocked and organized arsenal at this point, making these early moments especially tense and tough unless you beat others to a treasure chest or good weapon that tips the odds in your favor. Sometimes that weapon isn’t immediately available – I’ve landed at a hotspot only to have to slowly chip away at an opponent’s health and shields with my pickaxe before I even got the chance to loot anything plenty of times. This exchange of blows is a lot slower than the gunslinging Fortnite usually expects from you, but it’s not so much bad or boring as it is a goofy byproduct of you and your opponent looking each other dead in the eye after realizing you’re both out of options and hoping you come out on top. </p><p>Thankfully, weapons are plentiful on the island, with several types designed for different situations stashed in every chest and building. The main guns are pretty typical: Assault rifles are reliable in most skirmishes, but less useful in a close-quarters encounter than a shotgun or submachine gun would be. Alternatively, the DMR and sniper rifle outpace all of those in long-range combat. However, Epic isn’t afraid to mix the balance up with more creative ideas, and so it also includes a ton of cool one-off weapons themed after its many regular events. For example, during the annual Star Wars event for May The 4th you can wield Stormtrooper blasters, Chewbacca’s bowcaster, and even a lightsaber if you get lucky and find one randomly on the map or defeat a formidable Darth Vader NPC.</p><p>These days, a nearly non-stop rotation of different crossovers bring new types of mythic weapons and tools to the table, with several additions being made specifically for one season or event before being shelved indefinitely. Logging in on a random day could land you something as silly and mundane as Peter Griffin’s Pump Shotgun (which is just a normal shotgun that deals extra damage) or as useful as the explosive Kamehameha from Dragon Ball Z and the deadly and accurate power of Waterbending from Avatar: The Last Airbender. Even when they’re especially powerful, event items and weapons are easy to come by, meaning you’re a lot less likely to lose to another player just because they had a super-powered weapon that your normal gun couldn’t compete with – that includes this season’s Marvel-themed pickups like Doctor Doom’s Gauntlets, which let you pelt opponents with powerful blasts of energy, or last season's jet-powered Nitro Fists, which rocket you up into the air before slamming down to create a shockwave around you .</p><p>Instead, you’re more likely to lose because they’re better at building than you are. The fine art of creating structures in combat is as definitively Fortnite as it is divisive, with detractors often complaining that shooting at an opponent prompts them to explode into an instant Eiffel Tower as they turtle up and erect a sniper’s nest to shoot back from. It’s absolutely absurd, but I like that building adds a literal depth to combat that takes Fortnite’s already engaging, tense shooting mechanics and knocks the skill ceiling up a few notches as you learn to juggle the usual dance of aiming, dodging, and reloading with quickly laying down cover and managing your limited resources. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This battle royale can still be enjoyed without mastering building.</p></div><p>Epic has made it pretty easy to wrap your mind around the building controls, with quick shortcuts on both keyboard and controllers that make it simple to build a ramp to help climb a hill or set up a wall to defend yourself while you reload. It’s not mandatory, though: As an admittedly weak builder, I can confidently say that I’ve managed to eke out wins without much reliance on ensconcing myself in wood, stone, and metal, so it’s not like this battle royale can’t be enjoyed without mastering that skill, either. You can learn to take advantage of high fire-rate weapons like SMGs or the drum gun to quickly dismantle an opponent’s creation before sniping them through the holes you made, or just rush them down with a shotgun and take them out where they thought they were safe.</p><p>The main difference when you join a No Build match, which trades the ability to build for extra shields, is the flow and pace of combat. In the default mode, shootouts between equally matched players often last longer as both parties scramble to out-build, out-heal, and out-shoot each other in climactic moments that always push me to the edge of my seat before ending in either a frustrated groan or a sigh of relief. In No Build, combat is much tighter and leaves less room for missed shots as there are fewer places to hide. Since building takes extra cover out of the equation, these fights are also more often locked to the close quarters areas already on the map, and reward those who rush down their opponents rather than trying to snipe them from far away.</p><p>In either mode, plenty of chokepoints and events pop up randomly to force confrontations or provide an extra advantage for those willing to seize it. Maybe the train’s passing by where you landed – if you’re lucky, you can snag a ton of goodies from its chest before someone else does. From there you might head toward some NPCs that you can see in the distance, who will open fire at you with the kind of flailing aim that would make a Stormtrooper look like a deadeye. After clearing their camp, you could be rewarded with an early forecast of where the safe zone at the center of Fortnite’s deadly storm will head next, which is the kind of intel that can give you the jump on the other remaining players and be waiting when they rush to what they think is safety.</p><p>Other optional events, such as NPC bosses with substantially better aim, pepper the map and offer useful rewards and nominal challenge, but chasing those also makes your location known: echoing gunfire and the enemy’s health bar popping up on nearby players’ screens exposes you for others to swoop in and capitalize on your being distracted. Meanwhile, friendly NPCs offer something completely different: You can buy worthwhile items like guns, healing items, hints, and sometimes even disguises that are reminiscent of the popular Gary’s Mod game Prop Hunt which you can activate and use to camp out as a chair, barrel, or other piece of furniture you might find scattered around the island. You can also hire certain NPCs to help you out in a fight, which can make a difference in team-based modes where a shootout is more chaotic than just two people unloading their weapons at each other. All these options means there’s always something interesting to do beyond simply looting and shooting.</p><p>Moving around the map feels incredible, too. You can sprint, crouch while sprinting to go right into a slide (ripped straight out of Apex Legends), jump farther than normal, and even mantle while running. This may not sound like a lot compared to the aforementioned Titanfall spinoff’s acrobatic movement, but Fortnite’s current movement options are just enough to keep combat dynamic and challenging. You aren’t so mobile that fights become frustrating, but there are still cool opportunities for some daring escapes after a showdown gone awry. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s just a dizzying amount of things going on in every match.</p></div><p>And when running around on foot just doesn’t cut it, there are plenty of cars and motorbikes scattered around the island like ride-sharing scooters for you to find. Each produces a brain-ticklingly satisfying purr as you zoom around and rock out to in-game radio stations with a diverse library of licensed tracks from the likes of Lady Gaga, Bad Bunny, AC/DC, BLACKPINK, and more. Even if you’re not necessarily going anywhere specific, it’s hard to resist the thrill of jumping a car off a high bluff to get some air time backed by an energetic track, which last season not only enabled but encouraged thanks to its beefier and more customizable vehicles that would make George Miller Swoon.</p><p>There’s just a dizzying amount of things going on in every match, and because of that Fortnite accommodates so many different playstyles. Whether you’re vying for the top spot, jumping a sports car off a ramp with your friends in a parking lot, or checking off story missions, it rewards your time with XP for doing just about everything. Sure, some activities offer more points than others – being the last person or team standing at the end of a match will always be the most important objective – but Epic goes out of its way to let you have a blast even if you don’t place in the top 50.</p><p>Experience points help fill out levels in the battle pass, which has both a free and paid tier and unlocks various cosmetics like skins for your character, weapons, pickaxe, and glider, as well as provides some in-game currency, called V-Bucks. That battle pass and its rewards have all but set the standard for how free-to-play games turn a profit, and while it’s fun to unlock outfits that let me dress up like Kratos from God of War or Indiana Jones, I don’t like how commonplace the almost compulsive nature this monetization strategy encourages has become.</p><p>Thankfully, Fortnite doesn’t lock anything that impacts the actual gameplay of a match behind premium purchases, and even allows you to earn enough V-Bucks to purchase optional skins through grinding alone. With years of big crossovers under its belt, the store has become a modern gallery of sorts. Painstakingly created emotes that replicate moments from rich and influential works like Alien, Metal Gear Solid, Marvel, and Star Wars are immortalized next to silly bits of internet culture ranging from the Orange Justice dance to the Stonks meme. Fortnite is the only place where you can see Darth Vader throw up a Wu-Tang W and rock out to C.R.E.A.M., or taunt other players with John Cena’s iconic “You Can’t See Me” gesture as Goku. It’s by no means the museum-quality homage to its source material the way the Super Smash Bros. series is to Mario, Zelda, or Donkey Kong, but it’s an impressively curated collection of culture all the same. </p><p>The Indiana Jones content from Chapter 3, Season 3 in the Summer of 2022 is a great example of how Fortnite often makes its crossovers feel like more than just a cosmetic cash grab. Its special limited-time mission asked you to explore the ruins of an ancient temple and find four runes, then organize the same symbols to open a door to a long corridor with a ton of loot at the end and a golden figure on a pedestal… but pilfering the idol will have exactly the result you expect. It’s not just for show either: You could die from attempting that heist.</p><p>It’s impressive that such an iconic movie moment can be so seamlessly integrated into a completely unrelated game without missing a beat. Not every crossover gets a location on the map or special mission like this, but most will at least see some kind of cool inclusion like an emote and a skin or two that lovingly capture a character’s image and presence within Fortnite’s cohesive, cartoony style. For example, last season added Fallout’s iconic Brotherhood of Steel T-60 Power Armor to the mix, which worked perfectly in its Mad Max-like apocalyptic wasteland. Somehow the T-60, Darth Vader, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, and Jill Valentine all look right at home next to one another, as if they were action figures on a shelf. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s a showcase of Unreal Engine 5’s high-fidelity lighting effects. </p></div><p>With Unreal Engine 5 powering everything, it’s no surprise that they look as good as they do: waving fabrics, shiny metals, and a bold cel-shading style adorn these skins with a punch that hits the sweet spot between cartoonish and hyper-detailed. Even on the less powerful Nintendo Switch, Fortnite runs surprisingly well with a mostly steady framerate and consistent look – though that comes at the price of a really low draw distance, making anything but a small spec of movement hard to sus out from even moderately far away. Of course, on other consoles and PCs, it runs like a dream. It’s also a graphical showcase with Unreal Engine 5’s high-fidelity lighting effects on full display as the time of day changes, bathing its levels in harsh sunlight, golden evening rays, and glowing street lights. </p><p>Most of the skins you unlock in battle royale transfer over into the other games found within Fortnite’s main menu, each of which is chock-full of its own stuff to do. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-fortnite-review">Lego Fortnite</a>, for example, is a full-scale Minecraft-style co-op survival game with its own story and quests to explore and complete, while <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-festival-review">Fortnite Festival</a> harkens back to the days of Rock Band. Even if I wasn’t as interested in playing them, it’s cool that the shared battle pass and cosmetics make your efforts in one impactful to the others. </p><p>There’s also a staggering amount of stuff that other players have made within Fortnite, and opening up the infinite tunnel of user-generated content reveals even more fun to be found. Like any game with creative tools that allow you to share your work, it’s a literal mixed bag here with Epic Games’ curation efforts doing some heavy lifting to help the cream rise to the top. One of my favorite user-generated game modes serves as a firing range of sorts that lets you try out any version of each weapon available in Battle Royale with unlimited ammo. But there’s tons of other stuff, with whole worlds inspired by games like Phasmophobia that are so popular they have their own followings on Twitch.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Charlie's Favorite Multiplayer Shooters</h3><p>I've been playing multiplayer shooters for about as long as I've been playing video games. From Halo and Black Ops II to Kid Icarus: Uprising and Splatoon, I've sunk a ton of time into the genre. Here are some of my favorites!</p></div><p>Somehow, nearly all of these disparate ideas work together seamlessly, with only a few exceptions for what you can bring where depending on what mode you’re playing – for example, you can only wear the Xenomorph skin in game modes with a “T for Teen” ESRB rating or higher – but most carry over, which makes even the fun diversions from the battle royale grind feel worth your time.</p><p>That said, Fortnite’s wide range of universes don’t always collide gracefully. Watching characters who would never wield a gun – let alone kill someone – do both of those things in Fortnite is equally silly and a bit gross, because it often completely betrays the defining characteristics of their source material. No matter how funny it is to see Batman unload a clip into his foe before hitting The Griddy, it just doesn’t feel right. </p><p>By cementing itself as <em>the place</em> for titans of various mediums and industries to cross over, Fortnite has transformed into more than just a game, whether we like it or not. It’s become the modern water cooler, as both a shared social space and the kind of rare cultural monolith that helps create connections thanks to its seamless crossplay and built-in voice chat – which is so well-supported it’s even one of the very few games that supports native voice chat on the Nintendo Switch. Playing on Xbox, I can easily squad up with my roommate on his Switch in the same room and my buddy playing on his PC across the country without a hitch, which is truly impressive given how much trouble some other games can have with that sort of setup. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
