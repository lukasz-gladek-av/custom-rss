			<p>The original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/10/aaero-review/">Aaero</a> came out of nowhere, and remains, to this day, one of my favourite rhythm-action games. Merging the classic gunplay of Space Harrier and Panzer Dragoon with musical movement was an inspired creative decision, and Aaero had you riding the rails – called ribbons here – in time with a bass-heavy electronic soundtrack, using your craft to mimic the changing notes. Aaero2: Black Razor Edition sees the Mad Fellows team returning to their signature series, this time boasting a stellar soundtrack from Monstercat, new multiplayer modes, and additional music packs, promising to take players on an even wilder ride through space.</p>
<p><iframe title="Aaero2: Black Razor Edition | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WZ7g_muNvfQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Riding the ribbon is an exercise in deft left stick control. You roll from left to right, but as the music features pauses or major note changes, you’ll find yourself launching your spacecraft from point to point, trying to hang onto the ribbon and, in turn, your health. It’s far trickier than it has any business being, but, like a NASCAR driver, this is all about keeping things smooth, gently coaxing your craft around the track.</p>


<p>You’ve also got to think about shooting. The right stick controls your weaponry, and you can lock onto enemies by holding the reticule over them, increasing the number of missiles the longer you stay in one spot. If you release your missiles in time with the music, you’ll ramp up your score, and if you get it perfectly on the beat, you’ll immediately reload any empty missile slots.</p>


<p>You’ve also got an autocannon for faster-moving enemies, and the better you aim, the more points you’ll earn for each shot. When you’re chasing high scores – each track gives you a star rating and a percentage indicator – Aaero2 gives you a lot to think about. It all fits together perfectly once you’re in the flow of it, even if it feels like rubbing your stomach while patting your head at times.</p>
<p>Aaero2 wouldn’t work without a thumping soundtrack to accompany the sci-fi action, and it doesn’t disappoint, with one of the best electronic-infused line-ups since Wipeout. Collected via the Monstercat label – Beat Saber fans will definitely recognise the name – there’s something here for everyone. There’s a trio of MUZZ tracks; Salvation (ft. Bloodhounds) absolutely slaps, while Nemesis is an adrenaline ride of a track. There’s also artists like Habstrakt and Stonebank who keep your sub working overtime, while there’s plenty of light and dark thanks to Hoaprox, YUAN and Haneri collaborating on the more mellow Saviour.</p>

<p>This is a soundtrack that repeatedly had me grinning ear from ear, and when it’s combined with the sci-fi visuals flashing past, Aaero2 is capable of achieving the same kind of synaesthesia that you experience in Tetris Effect, Rez and Lumines Arise. In fact, in Aaero2, Mad Fellows have crafted the most Mizuguchi-like game I’ve found outside of his own teams, and that’s a huge achievement. Music is always going to be individual, and produce a unique response, but this feels like a Monstercat album that’s been produced just for me.</p>
<p>Aaero2 features a series of daily and weekly challenges, with each task netting you a chunk of extra experience. They might ask you to complete a track without using any missiles, or to beat every boss in one week, but they give you an extra reason to check back in for a cheeky extra track or two, and broadly add some longevity to proceedings, even for the most ardent ribbon-rider.</p>
<p>Also, each track’s star and completion percentage tickles the completionist part of your brain perfectly, and you’ll be locking in time after time, trying to perfect one more missile hit, or hold the ribbon just a fraction better. On the normal setting, Aaero2 is a little bit more forgiving on the ribbon riding than its predecessor, locking in more securely, though it doesn’t suddenly make it a breeze by any means.</p>

<p>Once you’ve completed your first run through all the tracks though, you’ll unlock Advanced, which removes the magnetic ribbon lock, gives you full ribbons and also more enemies to deal with. This is Aaero2’s true form, with a serious level of challenge, and the opportunity to hit some proper high scores. The fact that there’s Master difficulty above that only goes to show how much challenge the team at Mad Fellows has eked out of Aaero’s gameplay, but no matter what difficulty you’re playing on, it remains utterly enthralling.</p>
<p>You can share that experience with others as well. While online leaderboards remain central to the experience – I love reviewing unreleased games, as I’m currently the best in the world at a series of Aaero2’s tracks – the new multiplayer modes let you play in two-player co-op or PvP, both online or from the comfort of your own couch. It adds a new level of competition and collaboration to proceedings, and if you’ve got a similar taste in music to your friends or family, Aaero2 is an absolute blast.</p>

              <p>It looks like the wait for&nbsp;<em>Dead Island 3</em> won’t be&nbsp;<em>quite</em> as long as that between&nbsp;<em>Dead Island</em>s <em>1</em> and <em>2</em>. Dambuster Studios, the team that took over development of the second mainline entry in the sprawling zombie series, remains at the helm for the follow-up, aiming for a 2028 release.</p> <p>As detailed <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/2000827597106896907">by Timur222 on X</a>, Dambuster’s latest financial statements state that the UK-based subsidiary of Deep Silver (and thus Embracer) has moved straight on from 2024’s release of&nbsp;<em>Dead Island 2: Ultimate Edition</em> to working on the direct follow-up as its “primary focus.” Right now all developers are working on the game, while those in QA will be moving over too, once Luna and Mac versions of <em>DI2U&nbsp;</em>are out the door. The details state that “feature, character, world and story design” are all “moving at pace,” all with a view to releasing in the first half of 2028.</p>

 <p>The original&nbsp;<em>Dead Island</em> appeared in 2011, developed by Polish team Techland, and despite being a solid zombie first-person action-RPG, arrived in a mess of mistakes and controversies. Chief among them was the <a href="https://kotaku.com/this-games-special-edition-comes-with-a-statue-of-a-bik-5976075">severed torso statue of a bikini-clad woman</a> included in the game’s special edition, but <a href="https://kotaku.com/whoops-you-might-be-playing-an-unfinished-version-of-d-5837480">releasing the internal development build onto Steam</a> instead of the final game on launch didn’t really help. Still, once fixed, it was fun—nothing exceptional, but fun.</p>

 <p>Techland followed it up two years later with a standalone expansion (remember when we called those “expandalones” for a minute?),&nbsp;<em>Dead Island: Riptide</em>, but had a cooler reception given it repeated so many of the things that held the first game back from being great. There then came a crappy spin-off called&nbsp;<em>Escape Dead Island</em>, a rapidly abandoned MOBA called <em>Dead Island: Epidemic</em>, a remastering of the original, and a canned mobile spin-off that never saw a release. At the same time, Techland opted out of making&nbsp;<em>Dead Island 2</em>, instead moving on to much greater success with&nbsp;<em>Dying Light</em>, meaning Deep Silver had to find a new studio. That was German team Yager Development, best known for <em>Spec Ops: The Line</em>, with an expected 2015 release. It didn’t go well.</p>

 <p>By July 2015, Deep Silver announced they’d taken the game back off Yager and handed it to UK studio Sumo Digital (<em>Crackdown 3</em>,&nbsp;<em>Team Sonic Racing</em>), issuing annual proof-of-life statements for the project until 2019 when it was declared that it had changed developers yet again. That time it went to another UK team, Dambuster (formed from the ashes of the collapse of Crytek UK), and in 2023 it was <em>finally</em> released, some eight years later than originally intended. It was fine!</p> <p>It also sold well enough to justify continuing on, and we now know that Dambuster has been working on the third mainline entry since it shipped the remaster of the sequel. For what it’s worth, the financial report <a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09140280/filing-history">filed in the UK</a> also shows that the 194-person-strong company made a profit in 2024, and is sitting on assets of over £2 million. Dambuster is owned by Deep Silver, which is owned by Plaion, which is owned by Embracer, which is owned by Cthulhu.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-apple-watch-samsung-quietly-clears-out-the-galaxy-watch-ultra-2025-cheaper-than-black-friday-2000653577</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For those who love to stay active in the great outdoors—whether running, swimming, cycling, hiking, or really any workout you can do outside of four walls and a ceiling—the Galaxy Watch Ultra is the ultimate companion for your wrist. Designed with fitness enthusiasts in mind, it offers a rugged build and supports a wide range of activities to help you track your fitness progress. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6412/">This outdoor-ready smartwatch is currently available at a 23% discount, dropping from its original price of $650 to a more affordable $500 during this holiday season.</a></p>
<p>When we’ve written about this watch previously, it’s discount has usually come with the caveat of needing to trade-in an old watch. Not this time though. You can just save $150 without departing with any of your current tech.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6412/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Rugged Titanium Build</h2>
<p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra boasts a durable 47mm titanium face that can withstand impacts, bumps, and the rigors of outdoor activities. This tough design ensures it stands up to the elements while maintaining a sleek appearance. The titanium comes in a few color options—titanium gray, titanium white, titanium blue, and titanium silver—so you can choose one that best suits your style. The watch also offers several band choices, including a synthetic Peakform band, and a fabric-based trail band, a more robust marine band. Though, all options for this listing come exclusively with the marine band. I’m personally a big fan of the titanium gray variant as that one’s included band is a sleek orange.</p>
<p>Along with tracking your workouts, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is able to monitor your overall health. the watch tracks your sleep and daily energy levels, providing a “physical readiness” score based on factors like the quality of your sleep, heart rate, and step count.</p>
<p>The heart rate tracking is exceptionally accurate. Powered by Galaxy AI, the watch can filter out unnecessary physical movements, allowing it to deliver more precise heart rate data to help you fine-tune your workouts for better results.</p>



<p>For an added bonus, the watch gives personalized wellness tips, offering insights based on your daily activities, sleep patterns, and heart health that can help you optimize your well-being.</p>
<p>The Galaxy Watch Ultra’s battery can go for up to 60 hours on a single charge, meaning you won’t have to worry about running out of juice before your next workout. This extended battery life is particularly useful for sleep tracking. While many other smartwatches struggle to last&nbsp; a full day, night time becomes when you might want to charge it. With those, you never end up getting to utilize the sleep features. The Galaxy Watch Ultra only needs to charge every few days you can still use it to track your sleep throughout the night. The watch can even detect potential sleep apnea.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6412/">Normally priced at $650, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is now available at a significant 23% discount.</a> Save yourself $150 as you bring the price down to $500. Whether you’re a seasoned athlete or just looking for a tough and reliable fitness watch, the Galaxy Watch Ultra is a perfect choice. Makes for a great gift for the fitness freaks in your life this holiday season.</p>

<p>ARC Raider developers have confirmed that player behaviour is analysed while matchmaking. </p>



<p><span>Embark Studios’ latest&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-invented-a-whole-new-genre-and-nobody-noticed/" target="_blank">extraction adventure</a>, ARC Raiders, has been on a great run lately.</span> Not only is it one of the most popular titles of 2025, but it also won best multiplayer game of the year at The Game Awards 2025. What’s more, the title’s new update, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-cold-snap-flickering-flames-update-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cold Snap</a>, is live now. Ahead of the update, the developers gave players a hint about ARC Raiders matchmaking. </p>







<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-devs-confirm-player-behaviour-is-analysed-for-matchmaking">ARC Raiders Devs Confirm Player Behaviour is Analysed for Matchmaking</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-interview-embark-talks-behavior-based-matchmaking-map-updates-and-playing-nice-with-strangers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, ARC Raiders art director Robert Sammelin confirmed that player behaviour is factored in while matchmaking in ARC Raiders. Sammelin stated, “Without going into excruciating detail, it is quite complex. We do analyze behavior and match accordingly.” When asked if he could elaborate on this, the art director said “no” jokingly, keeping players in the dark about how it is factored in during matchmaking. </p>



<p>There was a prevailing theory in the ARC Raiders community that players with nicer behaviour would be matched with others with similar gameplay styles, while more aggressive players would be forced to play together. The developers have now confirmed that this could indeed be the case; however, we do not know what else is factored into matchmaking. </p>







<p>In other news, an ARC Raiders backpack <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-backpack-crashed-nvidia-site/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">single-handedly crashed the NVIDIA website</a>. Additionally, the developers recently asked the community for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-devs-map-design-drive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">critical feedback on the game’s map pool</a>, asking them to drive the game forward.

            <p>Dambuster Studios are planning to keep their next truckload of undead penned in for a few more years, before opening the big zombie door in early 2028. That's according to some financial docs from the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-island">Dead Island</a> developers, in which their plans for Dead Island 3 as of the end of March this year are laid bare.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The docs, spotted by a Twitterer with the handle <a href="https://x.com/bogorad222/status/2000827597106896907">@bogorad222</a>, are Dambuster's annual financial report for the fiscal year that ended on March 31st, 2025. As such, they contain many numbers, but also a section on the studio's current strategy.</p>
<p>Basically, the plan is to now go full steam ahead on Dead Island 3. All Dambuster’s developers are now working on Dead Island 3, to be joined by the studio's QA staff once <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-island-2">Dead Island 2</a>'s Luna and Mac versions are done and dusted. "Parts of the game are now in early production with feature, character, world and story design moving at pace," the report says of DA3, before whipping out that planned release window of some point in 2028's first two financial quarters.</p>
<p>Putting things into real human years, that window likely means the third zombpocalyspse will come by the end of June 2028, assuming things go to the current plan.</p>
<p>This the first concrete news we've gotten about Dead Island 3, unless you count Dambuster teasing it with <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/934700/announcements/detail/505086494235427243?snr=2___">a Steam post</a> which mentioned they're "already carving out what comes next" back in September. At any rate, you've got plenty of time to read back over our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-island-2-review">Dead Island 2 review</a>, in which Rick Lane judged that while "not worth waiting eleven years for", it's "a breezy, messy adventure that has zero nutritional value, but will fill your bloodstream with yummy, delicious sugar."</p>

              <p>Storage issues are common, but also avoidable. If you’re running out of storage on your Nintendo Switch 2 and often find yourself deleting some titles to make room for new ones, investing in an SD card can be a smart move.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6411/">Right now, Amazon is offering the 256GB Samsung P9 Express microSD card for just $33, after taking 40% off its usual $55 retail price</a>. Prime members get to enjoy free delivery, so they’re saving a few extra dollars on that front too. This is also the lowest we have seen this memory card drop to since its release, but as you’d expect, the deal is selling out fast. We suggest getting your orders in as soon as you can before the price shoots back up – which could be any moment now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6411/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Spacious Capacity With Impressive Speeds</h2>
<p>Starting with the storage; you’re getting a nice 256GB of additional storage with this card, which translates into more space for the latest releases, updates, DLC, and even screenshots. You will be able to have all the titles you like installed and ready to go; no need to choose what to delete to make room for something new every few weeks. The capacity this version gets you should be enough for casual gamers who mostly play smaller indie titles. However, if you’re looking to download a bunch of large AAA games, you might want to consider grabbing the 512GB version, which is sitting at $100 at the time of writing. This will help you avoid the same old loop where you find yourself with limited storage every few weeks.</p>
<p>As for the performance, you’re looking at sequential read speeds up to 800 MB/s, which helps load games considerably faster than the brand’s standard microSD cards. That means spending less time on loading or updating, and quicker game launches. Despite the impressive capabilities, the card maintains an ideal temperature as it works, even during intense matches. That’s thanks to its Dynamic Thermal Guards, which work tirelessly to keep the card from overheating while ensuring smooth performance.</p>



<p>Best of all, the card is made to work with Nintendo Switch 2, plus it plays nicely with a range of microSD UHS-I devices, including computers, handheld consoles, tablets, and even cameras. When using it with a camera, you can expect it to capture stunning 4K video and photos like a pro!</p>
<p>You’re also getting a 6-proof protection with a 3-year limited warranty with your purchase. It’s basically temperature, drop, magnet, water, X-ray, and wearout proof, which means you’ll enjoy consistent performance 24/7. Samsung Magician software helps you keep an eye on the health of the card and monitor performance with ease.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’re looking for an easy way of boosting the overall storage of your console while still enjoying good performance, this P9 Express microSD card can be a good addition to your setup.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6411/"> It normally goes for $55, which is already quite affordable considering all that you’re getting, but the current 40% discount makes it even more approachable.</a> And since it works with a range of devices, now is a great time to pick a couple of these for your cameras, tablet, or even laptop – without blowing your budget!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Crystal Dynamics has revealed that Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis will receive a difficulty adjustment for modern players, and players might remember the original version as extremely difficult. </p>



<p>For those unaware, The Game Awards 2025 was a great day for the original Tomb Raider fans, as Legacy of Atlantis was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-remake-legacy-of-atlantis-reveal-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced for 2026</a>. It is a complete remake of the original game, built from the ground up. Now, the developer has revealed that the remake might not be as brutal as the original title. </p>







<h2 id="h-tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-to-receive-a-difficulty-adjustment">Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis to Receive a Difficulty Adjustment</h2>



<p>During a presentation attended by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/tomb-raider/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-leads-say-its-essential-to-adjust-the-ps1-originals-difficulty-for-modern-player-tastes-but-things-that-you-expect-in-a-tomb-raider-game-are-going-to-be-there/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GamesRadar+</a>, Crystal Dynamics developer Will Kerslake was asked how they would be targeting the difficulty of Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis, given all the insta-death situations and other problems players faced in the original title. Kerslake replied, stating that “part of reimagining a game right is adjusting that game evolving for modern player tastes.”</p>



<p>However, that doesn’t mean the core Tomb Raider experience will change, as “there are puzzles in combat and traversal and death-defying action.” Also, players will also “see big rolling balls, and you know, the things that you expect in a Tomb Raider game are going to be there in spades,” added Kerslake. </p>



<p>The Anniversary edition of Tomb Raider also had a workaround for the original’s difficulty, adding quick-time events to get through the insta-kill situations. </p>







<p>In other news, Tomb Raider: Catalyst will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-catalyst-players-will-require-no-homework-before-jumping-in/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">require ‘no homework’</a> before jumping in. Additionally, the co-creator of the original game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-co-creator-prefers-new-chapters-over-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prefers new chapters over remakes</a>.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> has been going from strength to strength this year. Following its release back in April, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">game was met with widespread acclaim</a> and sales to match. In May, the developer revealed it had passed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-reaches-a-fitting-sales-milestone">a fitting milestone of 3.3m copies sold</a>. In October, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-will-receive-new-update-with-a-bit-of-whee-and-a-bit-of-whoo-as-studio-celebrates-new-sales-milestone">that figure was updated to over 5m copies worldwide across all formats</a>.</p>
<p>But, that number has since increased further, and according to <a href="https://x.com/alineaanalytics">Alinea Analytics, </a>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has sold "almost" 400k copies since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">its record-breaking Game Awards nominations</a> on 17th November. Meanwhile, the company's <a href="https://x.com/superhys/status/2000615104090341472/photo/1">head of market analysis Rhys Elliott</a> estimates Clair Obscur has "sold an extra 200k+ copies since" The Game Awards last week, where it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">scooped up the coveted Game of the Year accolade among others</a>.</p>

<p>To break that down further, Elliott said 76 percent of those sales were on Steam, with 21 percent on PS5 and three percent on Xbox. "Around 52 thousand Xbox players" have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-xbox-game-passs-biggest-third-party-success-2025">since played Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 via Game Pass</a> "for the first time" as well, Elliott added.</p>

<p>Over on <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1903340/charts/#1m">SteamDB</a>, meanwhile, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has received a notable uptake in player numbers since last week's award show, as you can see in the graph below.</p>
<p>The Sunday before this year's The Game Awards welcomed 22,759 Clair Obscur players on Steam, while the Sunday after saw 56,993 players. That's an increase of 34,234 players between those two specific days.</p>

<p>The success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has been publicly acknowledged once again by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-publicly-congratulates-clair-obscur-expedition-33-calling-the-game-of-the-year-win-a-historic-first">French President Emmanuel Macron</a>, who said its Game of the Year win was a source of "great pride for Montpellier and for France".</p>
<p>During the awards show last week, developer Sandfall Interactive announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-expansion-is-available-right-now-adding-a-photo-mode-and-vibrant-new-world">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's previously teased expansion was available for all players</a>. While of course a welcome addition for the many fans out there, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-fans-cant-get-over-just-how-difficult-the-updates-new-bosses-and-challenges-are-now">this expansion and its bosses have proven tricky for some</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4</a> fans have discovered a load of unused conversations between the game's controversial NPCs.</p>
<p>Unlike previous games where Samus is mostly isolated and alone, the latest in the series sees Samus rescuing and interacting with an ensemble of Federation soldiers. This has proven unpopular with many players, who feel it undermines its otherwise mysterious tone.</p>
<p>Now, YouTuber Bearborg has uploaded a video of all base camp interactions in the game, including unused dialogue, which were taken from the game's files (thanks <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/you-want-me-to-build-rocket-skates-fans-uncover-30-mins-of-cut-metroid-prime-4-dialogue/">VGC</a>). The video includes over 41 minutes of dialogue, of which around 34 minutes is unused.</p>

<p>As this extra dialogue was all recorded, it suggests the game originally had far more incidental conversations between its characters, which were (perhaps rightfully) paired back.</p>
<p>Cut conversations include discussions on how much robot VUE-995 can bench press, MacKenzie's lack of field experience, and Armstrong finding out about roast beasts, among many others. It's mostly more humorous dialogue that adds little to the story, which is likely why it was cut.</p>

<p>In the final version of the game, these characters are little more than broad, stereotypical sketches. Yet as Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson explained, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-chatty-companions-silent-samus-the-problem">Metroid Prime 4 suffers more from Samus's own lack of dialogue by comparison</a>.</p>
<p>"It's presentationally clear here that Samus just isn't talking," he wrote. "The feeling of awkward weirdness only grows as the game winds on. These guys begin throwing their lives on the line for this woman who offers nothing back in return. This might even work if they acknowledged their leader's silence - but they don't. Everyone just acts like this is all normal. Maybe it is, with this being Samus' in-universe reputation. Either way, it sucks."</p>
<p>Metroid Prime 4 was eagerly awaited for 18 years until its release earlier this month. Unfortunately, for many it has not lived up to expectations.</p>
<p>"Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is enjoyable enough, and has glimpses of vintage Metroid shining through, but this game could and should have been so much more," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-review">Metroid Prime 4 review</a>.</p>

            <guid>1384456</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Why do we love games? The enjoyment is more than just the bright screens and the action taking place, thought that is usually a big part of it. Another is the story and narrative of games, which can go in all sorts of directions and be told in ways that are very different to books, film, or theatre. Many of the most lauded games are celebrated not just because of gameplay, but for the tales of their characters and the narrative we experience alongside them, the ones that draw us in until we’re eagerly reading messages sent between coworkers while hacking their computers. Which brings us nicely to our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/game=of-the-year-2025">Game of the Year 2025</a> Best Narrative standouts.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/21/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-review/">Hundred Line Last Defense Academy</a> is our winner of Best Narrative, or should that be Best <em>Narratives</em>? A story of 15 students having to survive 100 days while holding back monsters, and dealing with the different relationships between the characters while they fight to survive. It is a mammoth game with players able to work towards a staggering 100 different endings. Putting together one narrative is tough enough for most games, so doing it 100 times over and tying those into every single choice you make is work that should be rewarded.</p>


<p>I’m going to quote Miguel here who summed up Hundred Line Last Defense Academy by saying, “It’s this beautifully overwhelming web of stories and paths and branching events where, like, two people can spend dozens of hours playing the game and never have the same experience, or you can just pick it up any time and discover a new story and a new ending. It’s such an insane achievement.”</p>
<h3>Dispatch – Runner Up</h3>
<p>The expectations for Dispatch were high, just from knowing that it was coming from a team that had previously worked on Tales from the Borderlands and The Wolf Among Us. Where would they take their episodic storytelling next? Perhaps to offer a fresh perspective on the superhero genre,&nbsp;while also tapping into and succeeding at creating a heartfelt and funny adventure.</p>

<p>You are Robert Robertson, previously known as the hero Mecha Man, who after losing to his nemesis is taken off hero duties and becomes a superhero dispatcher instead, swapping punches for office politics. Office politics are tough enough to deal with, but even more so in Dispatch as you work with ex-supervillains to put them on the path of good. It is also a narrative the explores the themes of identity and learning about who you are as person, while dealing with problems from small issues in the office to life threatening ones that pile on the pressure. Dispatch is a game whose narrative is going to be remembered for a long time.</p>
<h3>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 – Runner Up</h3>
<p>Death is hard enough to deal with as it is when it comes for a loved one. The confusion, the grief, the anger, the reflection, and finally the acceptance are all parts of the journey when it comes. But what if you knew when death was coming for you, and not just you but everyone the same age as you? That is the story Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, where a group of people head out to end the Paintress before she paints the number 33 and wipes out anyone of that age.</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has a strong story supported by a cast of characters that are memorable, leading to you wanting to spend time with them. Behind it all though is the worry that the Expedition, like so many others before, will fail and the Paintress will live to come after the next age the following year. Alongside that fear and worry are moments of joy and wonder, with the world of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 providing a stunning playground in which to enjoy the expansive story that has touched so many this year and will do so for years to come. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is not just a game for RPG fans, it is a game for those who love everything about stories.</p>

<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1203190/view/553509792472105640?l=english">Early access update five</a> rings in an early Christmas by initiating the minivan era of BugBear's banger basher - that's an MPV if you want to be boring or a people carrier if you're from the good old U of K. The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckfest">Wreckfest</a> family bus is dubbed the Grandstar, and it's glorious. Room for seven seats amongst the roll-cage, ample crumple zones between you and the thing you're hitting, and probably a baby seat you want to bring your toddler along.</p>
<p>Aside from the motorhome, which isn't really a daily driver, Wreckfest 2's car list so far has lacked a beefy family wagon to battle the array of muscle cars, saloons, and hatchbacks. As someone who loved the original's Warwagon, Hammerhead, and Hearse, I can assure you that's a good thing. If you're into racing cars that don't resemble bricks, first of all boooooooooooooooo. Second of all, this update's also added in a zippy couple called the Phaser.</p><p>There's a new track dubbed Moorfield, which boasts two muddy race and crash-oriented routes through a farm field that's been pre-ground into a wet and muddy pulp to show off the muddying and tyre sinkage mechanics BugBear have added to every ride. Crashing itself's had a major revamp with this update, with the devs explaining:</p>
<blockquote>In a game like ours, crashing into others should be rewarded. Yet, previously the outcome could feel a bit arbitrary as there were situations in which you were confident you were going to score a good hit on your opponent, only to receive more damage yourself. In this update, we've refactored the attacker/defender detection to make sure we correctly interpret who is the attacker and who is the defender. We've also improved the gameplay logic that determines the outcome of the crash to reward aggressive playing. The gist of the changes is that, like previously, the damage calculations now favour the car with more mass and speed (just more reliably), but when using the normal damage mode the condition of the car is also taken into account.</blockquote>
<p>Rounding things out are the likes of handy tweaks that'll make the livery editor added in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/your-wreckfest-2-ride-merely-adopted-the-rust-and-dents-mine-had-its-scuffage-moulded-by-the-new-crap-it-tool">last month's update</a> easier to use. There are new decals, and you can mirror on different sides of your car or edit them as a group with the push of a button.</p>
<p>Now, I'd better wrap this up and get to wrecking so I can deposit the youngins in good time.</p>

              <p><span>If you were to ask Sony executives about PlayStation’s 2025, they’d probably tell you it was great. According to the company, the PS5 is already its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-sales-sony-borderlands-4-patch-performance-mgs4-2000629168"><span>“most successful” console generation</span></a><span> after only five years. Thanks to all the money Sony’s made through microtransactions and subscription services like PlayStation Plus, the system the internet claims has </span><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/ps5-has-no-games"><span>“no games”</span></a><span> is eclipsing its predecessors (as long as you don’t adjust for inflation), and it presumably still has a few years left in it. But does Sony actually have anything to show for it in year five?</span></p> <p><span>While it’s beating out previous PlayStations in terms of revenue and the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-sold-over-80-million-ps5-in-five-years-2000616264"><span>hardware sales have been staggering</span></a><span>, the PlayStation 5’s lifespan has also been defined by </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-sony-biggest-flop-failure-box-office-1851676475"><span>live-service flops</span></a><span>, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547"><span>studio closures</span></a><span>, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-ii-2-remastered-ps5-ps4-remake-too-soon-1851042718"><span>time-biding remasters</span></a><span>. Throughout the PS5 era, Sony has been devouring money, but hasn’t been offering the kinds of big (and small) exclusives defined by identifiable characters, experiences, and stories that were once synonymous with the brand.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>By 2024, the PS5 seemed like a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-playstation-ps5-references-characters-1851640150"><span>cultural black hole</span></a><span> despite its success. Did 2025 get things back on the right track? Or was it just another year of Sony’s misguided pivots away from what made PlayStation more than just the box on which you play the games that don’t run well on Switch?</span></p>

 <h2><b>The hardware</b></h2> <p><span>While the PlayStation 5 is still a raging success for Sony, it, like most other video game hardware, was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-console-price-increase-sony-america-august-21-2000618873"><span>hit with a price hike</span></a><span>. This followed the Trump administration’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-pro-game-console-prices-tariffs-report-1851779765"><span>new tariffs</span></a><span> (though the device’s price was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-digital-edition-price-increase-uk-europe-tariffs-1851776054"><span>raised in other territories</span></a><span> outside of America, as well), which also caused Xbox to raise its prices and seemingly affected the Switch 2’s debut MSRP in June. Now the system will run you an extra $50, regardless of which SKU you buy. The standard edition costs $549.99, while the digital edition without a disc drive now costs as much as the disc-drive version did in 2020 at $499.99. The PlayStation 5 Pro, meanwhile, has been raised to a whopping $749.99, which is a hefty asking price for something that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-review-one-year-later-worth-it-price-4k-games-2000642988"><span>hasn’t made much of an impact</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000648497" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000648497"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000648497">© Sony</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Historically, console prices are supposed to go down as a generation goes on. Sony has already said that the PS5 is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-playstation-5-life-cycle-generation-sony-1851257227"><span>entering the “later stages of its life,</span></a><span>” and the PS6 is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-next-gen-xbox-price-specs-leak-release-date-2000635303"><span>supposedly on the way</span></a><span>. But even as the PS5 enters its twilight years, it’s more expensive than ever. The only time you probably would’ve paid more for the thing is when it was scarce and scalpers were reselling it. (A cheaper model was also </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-announces-cheaper-ps5-thats-only-for-japan-2000643085"><span>released in Japan earlier this year</span></a><span>, but it’s region-locked.)</span></p>

 <p><span>The PS5 may have gone up in price, but one of its peripherals went down and stayed there. The PlayStation VR2’s $550 price tag </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/psvr2-price-discount-cheap-hitman-playstation-ps5-1851766790"><span>nosedived to $400 in February</span></a><span> following reports that Sony had </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-vr2-headsets-production-sales-halt-sony-1851344240"><span>halted manufacturing</span></a><span> the headset as it struggled to meet its original projections. This makes it not unsurprising that Sony itself didn’t do much to support the PSVR2 in 2025. A few notable third-party projects like </span><i><span>Lumines Arise</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Hitman World of Assassination</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Alien Rogue Incursion</span></i><span> kept the VR sickos fed, but Sony didn’t do much of note with the thing in 2025.</span></p>

 <p><span>Also on the hardware side, Sony is finally making the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-portal-the-kotaku-review-1851015770"><span>PlayStation Portal</span></a><span> what it always should have been. The streaming handheld was previously a Remote Play machine that let you stream your PS5 to it, but now the device </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-portal-cloud-streaming-update-ps5-patch-2000641330"><span>can stream games</span></a><span> directly from the cloud, rather than bouncing them off another system.</span></p>

 <h2><b>The software</b></h2> <p><span>Broadly speaking, booting up a PS5 hasn’t changed much in 2025. Yeah, Sony brought back a few </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-update-new-april-24-retro-ps2-ps3-theme-sound-focus-1851777579"><span>dynamic themes</span></a><span> after previously making them a limited-time flourish, but beyond that, </span><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/support/hardware/ps5/system-software-info/"><span>scrolling through the system’s 2025 system software patch notes</span></a><span> shows a lot of small quality-of-life changes, a few accessibility updates like the addition of an audio focus option to make soft sounds come through on headphones more clearly, and more customization options for the main menu UI. There’s a lot for audiophiles to chew on, but overall, the PS5 user experience is in a pretty alright place. Don’t fix what ain’t broke.</span></p> <h2><b>The services</b></h2> <p><span>The PS5’s price wasn’t the only one Sony raised this year. The cost of PlayStation Plus, the subscription service that lets users play online, add free monthly games to their collection, and stream a huge library of older titles at higher tiers, was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-price-increase-ps-plus-canada-mexico-ps5-tariffs-1851776655"><span>also hiked in April in multiple countries</span></a><span>, and Sony is </span><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-says-it-will-continue-to-adjust-ps-plus-pricing-as-more-players-choose-higher-tiers/"><span>open to doing it again</span></a><span>. This </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-ps-plus-ps5-game-pass-price-spider-man-2-starfield-1850787462"><span>wasn’t the first time Sony’s done this in the PS5 era</span></a><span>, either. It feels like as more people are putting time into free-to-play games, Sony is looking for different ways to squeeze some juice out of them through subscriptions and microtransactions.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000645472" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000645472"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000645472">© Sucker Punch</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>The games</b></h2> <p><span>But none of the above matters if the games aren’t there. The PlayStation 5 has ingrained itself so completely into the public consciousness as the de facto video game console on your TV that Xbox won’t tell us its sales numbers anymore. As a result of its market domination, the success of any PS5 game can be considered a PS5 win by association. Huge breakthrough games like </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </span></i><span>don’t even have to be Sony games for the PS5 maker to benefit. </span><i><span>Fortnite </span></i><span>can continue to scrape in </span><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/fortnites-hold-on-revenue-and-maus-remains-in-july-2025-newzoo-charts"><span>billions in revenue</span></a><span> and if those microtransactions happen through the PlayStation Store, Sony’s getting a cut. So what is Sony actually doing with the hypothetical freedom you get from being top dog? In 2025, not a lot.</span></p>

 <p><span>Continuing a grim trend from recent years, Sony studios in 2025 were repeatedly hit by layoffs </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/days-gone-sony-bend-canceled-shooter-layoffs-1851784264"><span>after live-service projects failed to take off</span></a><span>. And yet, PlayStation higher-ups continue to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-live-service-concord-marathon-smoothly-2000616270"><span>insist that this is the way forward</span></a><span> for the company that was once defined by more than a desperate need to hook someone into dailies and microtransactions. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-bungie-marathon-destiny-2-acquisition-fiscal-2000642935"><i><span>Marathon </span></i><span>was delayed even as </span><i><span>Destiny 2 </span></i><span>is struggling</span></a><span>, so the major PlayStation pillars this year were </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-review-is-it-good-ps5-playstation-5-1851784852"><i><span>Death Stranding 2</span></i></a><span>, which will eventually go to other platforms, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-september-2025-sales-borderlands-4-final-fantasy-tactics-2000638319"><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i></a><span>, which, despite </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sucker-punch-charlie-kirk-ghost-yotei-boycott-2000646987"><span>manufactured controversy</span></a><span>, has sold millions of copies and is a GOTY season darling.</span></p> <p><span>So yeah, the PlayStation 5 has had a good year on paper, but how much of that is actually the result of Sony’s own legwork? When all is said and done, I’m sure the company will have a wonderful earnings report after the fiscal year is over, and it will have no reason to learn anything from its failed projects and fired workers.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The problem with Sony’s nearly monopolistic hold on the AAA console market this generation is that PlayStation, as a brand, has become so ubiquitous that it doesn’t need an identity anymore. Incredible games make their way to the PlayStation 5 more than any other console, whether that be because the Switch 2 can’t run them well or because developers </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cm24PAjAbBc"><span>decide that releasing on Xbox, with its smaller attachment rate, isn’t worth the risky investment</span></a><span>. So yeah, PlayStation has “won” the imagined console war, and now its internal line-up doesn’t have to stand out the way it once did. The company can just release a big AAA-ass video game every once in a while and get major awards buzz. Most of PlayStation’s output in recent years has felt influenced by prestige television, with cinematic games like </span><i><span>The Last of Us</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>God of War</span></i><span> becoming the video game equivalent of Oscar bait, lapping up praise and acclaim every year. Those games are, perhaps, the final echoes of the time when PlayStation was moving artistic mountains, but nowadays, they feel like they exist largely to prop up an assembly line of failed live-service efforts, and none of the smaller, quirkier, or more low-stakes experiences that once made PlayStation’s catalog the most diverse of all the console makers’ are anywhere to be found.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000283254" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000283254"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000283254">© HBO</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Last year </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280"><i><span>Astro Bot</span></i></a> <span>was released, a celebration of PlayStation history that was conspicuously lacking in characters and references to PlayStation 5 games. If that game had launched in 2025 instead, I don’t think that would have changed. The PS5 has been a huge financial success for Sony, so it doesn’t really have to be anything else in the eyes of those who are making the big decisions. PlayStation has always been a business, but now the people who used to come out on stage at events like E3 and pitch people on a specific, defined experience that PlayStation could offer </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-shawn-layden-live-service-sony-last-us-online-1851772581"><span>have mostly left the company</span></a><span> as it has abandoned passion projects like </span><i><span>Gravity Rush</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Dreams</span></i><span>,</span> <span>and </span><i><span>Sly Cooper </span></i><span>to try (and repeatedly fail) to enter the live-service rat race. Even the games that were once some of the brand’s strongest artistic statements </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-show-review-joel-ellie-abby-1851774661"><span>will be bled dry</span></a><span> until whatever integrity those works once had is just a distant memory.</span></p> <p><span>We’re five years into the PS5 generation, and despite it being the “most successful” console ever in Sony’s line-up, the company has remarkably little cultural cache to show for it beyond the PS5’s name becoming the video game equivalent of everyone calling a bandage a “Band-Aid.” And hey, it looks like you can iron out all those wrinkles, quirks, and charms and still make it to the top of the video game food chain. In two generations on top, PlayStation has achieved the kind of ubiquity the Sony higher-ups probably wanted, and all it cost the brand was its soul.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sonys-final-playstation-vr2-clearance-for-holidays-last-units-are-hitting-their-lowest-price-ever-2000653520</link>
            <guid>1384447</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Still looking for the right gaming-oriented gift this holiday season? While we’re start off the final weeks of December, some retailers are reinitiating Black Friday-level discounts to aid with your holiday shopping. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6410/">One of the standout deals at Amazon is for the PlayStation VR2, which is now priced at just $299, down from its usual $400.</a> This discount of $101 makes it an excellent holiday gift option.</p>
<p data-start="382" data-end="692">For many, the price of virtual reality headsets like the PlayStation VR2 can prove quite the barrier to entry. However, with the PSVR2 now at its lowest price ever, it’s an ideal time to jump in. This deal slashes the cost a full quarter of its retail price, making it a lot more tempting.</p>
<p data-start="694" data-end="1154">The PSVR2 packs some impressive features, borrowing from the PlayStation 5’s DualSense controller with its haptic feedback and adaptive triggers. It also includes finger touch detection, eye tracking, 3D audio, and headset feedback for a fully immersive experience. The headset boasts aa 110° field of view on its 4K HDR display that runs at 120fps, thanks to two OLED screens with 2000 x 2040 resolution each—four times the resolution of the original PlayStation VR.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6410/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="1156" data-end="1477">One of the standout features of the PSVR2 is the 3D audio, which enhances the feeling of being inside the game. You’ll be able to hear every whisper in your ear, pinpoint the location of enemies or allies by the sound of their footsteps or gunshots, and experience a soundscape that adapts to your movements and position.</p>
<p data-start="1479" data-end="1696">To use the PSVR2, you simply connect it to your PlayStation 5 console, making setup easy. It’s not limited to VR games either; you can also enjoy non-VR content in Cinematic Mode, adding even more value to the device.</p>


<h2 data-start="1479" data-end="1696">What to Play</h2>
<p>If you’re a fan of the Horizon series with&nbsp;<em>Horizon: Zero Dawn&nbsp;</em>and <em>Horizon: Forbidden West</em>, then you’ll want to experience the complete saga as its stands now with&nbsp;<em>Horizon: Call of the Mountain</em>—a title exclusive to PSVR2. Take on a first person perspective as you explore the stunning vistas of this world through the eyes of a new character, Ryas. Scale large cliffs with your pickaxes and take down large enemies by really drawing back a bow.</p>
<p>There are also some awesome multiplatform VR titles that have found another home on PSVR2. The rhythm game Beat Saber is the must-own titles for anyone with a virtual reality headset, and&nbsp;<em>Superhot</em> is still an unbeatable experience that uses the medium at its full capacity.</p>
<p data-start="1698" data-end="1990" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">If you’ve been waiting for the perfect time to grab a PlayStation VR2, now’s your chance. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6410/">The $299 price tag at Amazon means you’re saving $101, but keep in mind that you’ll need a PS5 to use it.</a> It’s a great deal for anyone looking to dive into the world of VR gaming this holiday season.</p>

<figure data-uuid="d9d7f196e5e75"><a title="TOTK" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d9d7f196e5e75/totk.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Monolith Soft, the acclaimed developer behind the <strong>Xenoblade Chronicles</strong> series, is also known to have collaborated with Nintendo on a number of first-party games, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>.</p>
<p>It's also worked closely with Nintendo on the Zelda series, starting with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/legend_of_zelda_skyward_sword">Skyward Sword</a> in 2011. Now, the company has released <a href="https://www.monolithsoft.co.jp/interview/dev01/collab-talk.html">a new interview</a> to celebrate its work on Zelda so far. Participants include Yasuhiro Fujita from Monolith Soft and Daiki Iwamoto from Nintendo, with the pair discussing how Monolith came to be involved with the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>The interview is only available in Japanese for the time being, but machine translation has at least been able to provide <em>some</em> idea of which subjects were up for discussion. One highlight includes how the team at Monolith felt a degree of anxiety at working on a Nintendo title with Skyward Sword, with both parties gaining more and more confidence with each successful project.</p>
<p>With Tears of the Kingdom, Monolith became involved from the early stages of development, with team members from Nintendo visiting the studio frequently to discuss ideas.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it's clear that Monolith Soft has become an integral part of Nintendo's development structure. The team will no doubt continue to produce new entries in the Xenoblade Chronicles series going forward, but it'll be interesting to see just how involved it will be in new Zelda titles, too.</p>
<p>Iwamoto-san specifically states "I would like Monolith Soft to play a central role as a strong partner in creating the Zelda series from scratch" at the end of the interview.</p>
<p>Could we possibly see a Zelda title developed solely by Monolith in the future..? Gosh, that's an exciting prospect.</p>

              <p>It still feels odd to live in a post-<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> reality. The game was ephemeral for so many years that it feels almost crass for it to have been released three months ago. It probably helps that it’s been <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/hollow-knight-silksong/critic-reviews/?platform=pc">rapturously received</a>—among <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-review-hornet-team-cherry-2000639568">more nuanced criticism</a>—and there’s now more good news: somehow, improbably, Team Cherry is well on its way to releasing a <em>free </em>expansion due in 2026. That accompanies the excellent news that those who bought the original <em>Hollow Knight</em>&nbsp;for Switch will soon be entitled to a free upgrade to a refreshed version for Switch 2.</p> <p>The enigmatically quiet Team Cherry has <a href="https://www.teamcherry.com.au/blog/holiday2025">posted an update to its hilariously infrequently updated blog</a>, detailing the news, but also making clear the small team’s delight at the success of the game’s release. Stating that <strong>over seven million people</strong> have bought the game so far (does quick math, takes off 30 percent for store tithes…that’s $98 million!), Team Cherry says “your continued enthusiasm remains a massive motivator as we work towards expanding the game even further.”</p>   <p>This leads us to the freshly announced expansion,&nbsp;<em>Sea of Sorrow</em>. There’s a teaser trailer, but don’t expect to get anything from it.</p>

  <p>Well that could have been a text message. <em>Sea of Sorrow</em> will have new areas (seemingly wetter than most), bosses and tools, in an expansion that will be completely free when it releases—Team Cherry claims—next year. But seriously? Anyone believe that? Come on. 2027 at the earliest, <em>for sure</em>. Actual information about the DLC, beyond that it has a nautical setting, will be held until “shortly before” the expansion is out, so expect more self-imposed silence from the developers, and then presumably a reply on the Discord when it slips.</p>

 <p>It’s all good, though! Of course they should take their time. It’s a passion project, no one’s entitled to it by a certain date, and it’s being given away for free. Plus they just made $100,000,000—why is any of them even acknowledging the existence of game development right now?</p>

 <p>Yet, still Team Cherry works, leading to even more generous news that there’s to be a Switch 2 refresh of the original&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>, and that too will be given to owners of the original Switch version for free! This will add improved framerates, a higher resolution, and a bunch of graphical effects that appeared in&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>. If you want a sneak peak of that updated goodness, you can jump into the beta branches on Steam or GOG, which include 21:9 support for ultrawide sickos.</p> <p>There are claims that there are even more plans for 2026, which are currently secret, but also word that Team Cherry’s games will be on sale across various stores over the holiday season. Given&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em> was already only $20, that could mean some proper bargains.</p>

              <p>It’s not every day Amazon lets you pick a highly-rated laptop for less. If you’ve been looking to upgrade your everyday office/study machine but the scary price tags have been holding you back, the retailer is making it incredibly easy to grab one without shelling out big bucks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6417/">We’re spotting plenty of solid deals across a range of models like HP, Dell, Asus, Lenovo, and more, but one of our favorite offers is the 72% discount on the HP 15.6-inch touchscreen business lapto</a>p. You’re saving a whopping $1,720 on this highly-rated model and getting some useful computer accessories for free, but the deal is only around for today. It wraps up at midnight, so it’s best to bag the drop as soon as you can. Once it’s gone, we don’t expect it to be back before New Year’s.</p>

<h2>Vibrant Visuals on the Touchscreen</h2>
<p>In a portable build, you’re getting an impressive 15.6-inch FHD IPS touchscreen that delivers brilliant, sharp visuals. You’ll enjoy vibrant colors and sharp details for all your favorite TV shows and movies, plus be able to read text better. The 178-degree wide viewing angle offers consistent visuals from all sides, while the micro-edge design offers larger screen real estate to work on. Touch support takes the experience a bit further by letting you use your fingers directly on the screen to perform a bunch of tasks. You’d be able to scroll through long documents without relying on the trackpad, swipe through images, browse, sketch, and even type. Note that the screen does not fold all the way back like a 2-in-1, so this thing won’t convert into a tablet for an only-screen experience, but the touch support still comes in handy, especially when you don’t want to bother with the mouse or the keys.</p>



<p>There’s an HD camera right above the display, which is paired with AI noise reduction. Both of these come together to make your video calls better; you will look good, and sound just as great. The battery life is another strong selling point. A single charge gets you up to 9 hours of usage, which means you can go an entire workday without plugging it in. Even better, recharging is just as quick. HP Fast Charge juices your laptop from 0 to 50% in just 45 minutes. You can plug it in during lunch break and come back to a machine that’s ready to go.</p>
<p>Power-wise, the laptop features an 8-core Intel Core i3-N305 processor. It works with 16GB of RAM to deliver the performance you need for your everyday tasks, plus some demanding projects. There’s a built-in 1TB SSD that offers plenty of space to store all your important files and documents without feeling limited, plus delivers fast boot/load times.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Pro also comes pre-installed. Other freebies include a Redragon patented wireless mouse, an external optical drive, and a screen wipe. Together, these cost around $200, but you’re getting the kit here for absolutely nothing. That said, the discount is only around for a few more hours, and the stock could sell out before the offer ends. Grab it before that happens!</p>

			<p>Almost five years after its debut on PlayStation 5, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/">Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade</a></strong> is finally hitting other consoles next month with a release on Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S, allowing more users to enjoy the first entry in the trilogy. Ahead of the new ports release, Square Enix has released a playable demo today, which also serves as yet another great showcase of what the Nintendo Switch 2 can do with dedicated optimization taking full advantage of the system's capabilities.</p>



<p>The demo allows players to experience the iconic bombing mission, accompanying Cloud Strife and Barret Wallace as they set out to destroy one of the Mako reactors powering the city of Midgar, ruled by the Shinra Electric Power Company. Any progress made in the demo on both <strong><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/FINAL-FANTASY-VII-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-2789733.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://www.xbox.com/it-IT/auth/msa?action=logIn&amp;returnUrl=%2Fit-IT%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Ffinal-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-demo%2F9NFTWDJKGSBF&amp;prompt=none">Xbox Series X|S</a></strong> can be transferred to the full game when it launches next month, and all those importing a demo save file can claim the bonus items <em>"Revival Earrings"</em> and <em>"Survival Set"</em>.</p>

<p>With so many multiplatform games targeting both PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, there's little doubt that Microsoft's consoles should be able to handle Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade well. As such, there's obviously more curiosity surrounding the Nintendo Switch 2 version, and the demo confirms that the new generation Nintendo console will deliver a more than playable experience, featuring great image quality that's almost on par with the PlayStation 5 release, judging from the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ff7-remake-switch-2-demo-just-dropped-on-the-eshop.1384288/post-148976008"><strong>first screenshots</strong></a> shared on <strong><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ff7-remake-switch-2-demo-just-dropped-on-the-eshop.1384288/post-148976341">ResetERA</a></strong> by user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/members/often-ignored-bear.51892/"><strong>Often Ignored Bear</strong></a>.</p>



<p>With such outstanding image quality on display, the community consensus on this port is unanimous. "<em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Played through it just now in handheld. This looks nearly identical to how Intergrade looks on a base PS5 in Quality Mode. The hair has some dithering at times but looks fine overall. This is an INCREDIBLE port," </em>said ResetERA forums member <strong><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ff7-remake-switch-2-demo-just-dropped-on-the-eshop.1384288/post-148978135">Neiteio</a></strong>, echoing a widespread sentiment among fans.</p>



<p>The launch of Final Fantasy VII Remake Integrade on Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S will mark the beginning of a year very likely filled with Final Fantasy VII news. According to director Naoki Hamaguchi, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/were-almost-at-the-point-when-we-can-share-more-information-about-it-will-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-be-announced-at-the-game-awards/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a name for the final entry in the trilogy will be decided before the end of the year</strong></a>, suggesting that the game's first reveal has a very high chance of happening in 2026. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In its new financial report, UK-based Dambuster Studios has reported that it is aiming to release Dead Island 3 by Q1/Q2 2028 (April – October 2028).</p>







<p><span>In the&nbsp;<a href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/09140280/filing-history/MzQ5NDAyNTM3OGFkaXF6a2N4/document?format=pdf&amp;download=0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">financial report</a>&nbsp;(thanks,&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/bogorad222" target="_blank">Timur222</a>), it says that the primary focus for Dambuster Studios is now Dead Island 3, a</span>nd all developers, who currently consist of 194 employees, will be assigned to the project once the Luna and Mac versions of Dead Island 2 are complete.</p>



<p>“Parts of the game [Dead Island 3] are now in early production with feature, character, world, and story design moving at pace,” says the report.</p>



<p>The release date suggests that the game will release for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, PC, and the next-generation of consoles, which are currently forecasted to release by the end fof 2028.</p>



<h2 id="h-dead-island-3-new-location">Dead Island 3 New Location</h2>



<p>This isn’t the first time that we’ve heard of Dead Island 3 from Dambuster Studios, though.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, the studio celebrated 14 years since the original game debuted, with the studio revealing that the second game has accumulated an impressive 20 million players.</p>



<p>The post teased that the “journey” was far from over, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-island-3-teased-dambuster-new-location/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accompanied by a photo showing a character leaving LA</a>, suggesting that there will be a new location for the third game.</p>







<p>In July,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-dead-island-2-dev-address-delay-sucked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a former Dead Island 2 developer</a>&nbsp;addressed the calamities caused by the game’s delay, which saw its development cycle pushed out to around&nbsp;a decade, including studio swaps and abandoned deadlines.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>A few months ago, developer Dambuster Studios and publisher Deep Silver practically <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-island-2-20-million-players-dead-island-3-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> the existence of Dead Island 3 as they celebrated the second installment reaching 20 million players (including those who played through subscription services and even those who <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-2025-mega-sale-live-now-dead-island-2-available-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grabbed it for free from the Epic Games Store MEGA Sale</a> earlier this year).</p>



<p>Now, though, Internet spotter extraordinarie Timur222 has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:pucmqonvvkskre2rhfmckaob/post/3ma3mavhny225?ref_src=embed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uncovered</a> from Dambuster's financial statements that the UK studio is targeting Q1 or Q2 2028 as the launch window for Dead Island 3. Here's the full quote:</p>



<p><em>Dambuster Studios is a AAA video game developer based in Nottingham which has 194 employees (as of March 2025). 93% are working in development and the remaining staff are studio management and administrative support. After the release of Dead Island 2 Ultimate Edition in October 2024, the primary focus for Dambuster Studios is now Dead Island 3. All developers are assigned to the project, and once the Luna and Mac versions of Dead Island 2 are complete, all of Dambuster's QA team will also be assigned to Dead Island 3. Parts of the game are now in early production with feature, character, world, and story design moving at pace. The current predicted release window for the project is Q1/2 2028.</em></p>



<p>Dead Island 2 launched on April 21, 2023, which means that Dead Island 3 will be out in less than five years, provided there are no delays on the schedule.</p>



<p>Dead Island 2 took a long time to be released. It was first in development by Yager, which showcased the game with a playable demo at Gamescom 2014. However, publisher Deep Silver was not satisfied with the developers' direction for the project and removed Yager from it. In March 2016, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-island-2-developed-uk-studio-sumo-digital/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that Sumo Digital would make the game. Three and a half years later, the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-acquires-gunfire-games-milestone-new-saints-row-game-in-development-while-dead-island-2-changes-studio-again/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reassigned</a> to Dambuster Studios, an internal Deep Silver studio.</p>



<p>With so many developer changes, there was widespread skepticism about the final game's quality, but Dambuster <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-island-2-cool-zombie-slaying-and-little-else/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">provided a fun experience</a> that resonated with fans, convincing Deep Silver to assign Dead Island 3 as the studio's next project.</p>

Kennedy will return as the game’s second playable protagonist. Although he has aged a bit since we last saw him, Japanese fans have been taking to social media to praise Leon’s suave, older look.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Slated for a multiplatform release on February 27, 2026, Resident Evil Requiem is the ninth mainline title in Capcom’s survival horror series. It will introduce new main character Grace Ashcroft, an FBI analyst who is investigating a series of mysterious deaths that seem to be linked to Victor Gideon, a former Umbrella Corp. researcher. While it seems that Grace’s parts of the game will play more like typical survival horror, the new trailer, below, gave fans a peek at Leon’s more action-orientated zombie-battling gameplay, complete with chainsaw. “Grace’s gameplay style is based on Resident Evil 2, whereas Leon’s is based on Resident Evil 4,” director Akifumi Nakanishi revealed in a recent interview with<a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/2512124p" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> Denfaminicogamer</u></a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Leon has always had his fans, the D.S.O agent’s middle-aged incarnation is getting much praise from Japanese speaking users on X. He’s already being affectionately called <em>ikeoji </em>(literally, “hot uncle” — a cool and attractive older guy). “Leon’s gradually becoming a hot uncle” one <a href="https://x.com/haniwa_yukkuri/status/1999433332824961140?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>user</u></a> mused. Sharing some screenshots, another user<a href="https://x.com/negisiogyutane/status/2000154859803488548?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> chimed in</u></a> with “Leon’s aging in a cool way.” Another user <a href="https://x.com/umesooooo/status/1999314797108822499?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>summed up</u></a>: “Resident Evil 9’s Leon is too hot. He’s 49 in this (as of 2026)? He’s so suave."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are also getting inspired to draw Leon’s new look. “Leon in Resi 9’s new trailer is too damn fine,” said one user, posting the following fan art. “He’s aging in such a wonderful way, while retaining his coolness. I’m really looking forward to meeting this Leon,” enthused <a href="https://x.com/rain_rain1192/status/1999346834343673964?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>another user</u></a>. “He’s turning into a hot older guy, like Keanu Reeves!” said one <a href="https://x.com/SzbSPfoK2FCnJe4/status/1999412747344499085?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commenter</u></a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">RE9新トレーラーのレオンが良すぎて。 <a href="https://t.co/PIkrWuylo1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/PIkrWuylo1</a></p>— □ (@dbox_2525) <a href="https://twitter.com/dbox_2525/status/1999474848154943767?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Other eagle-eyed trailer viewers have <a href="https://x.com/umesooooo/status/1999376630771499194?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>noticed</u></a> that Leon seems to have some kind of rash on his neck, prompting concerns that he has been infected. While many seem to be enjoying middle-aged Leon’s looks, <a href="https://x.com/NkVkGMw4Mt49044/status/1999455932095537519?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>others</u></a> are worried as to whether he should still be fighting off mutants at his age, with one person saying: “I love Leon, but they should let him rest.” In the previously mentioned Denfaminicogamer interview, Resident Evil Requiem’s director revealed that Leon has a “major secret” that will have significant implications (but he’s keeping quiet on what exactly that is).</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">コメントで教えてもらったけど<br>レオン..感染してるのかい？...<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/%E3%83%90%E3%82%A4%E3%82%AA%E3%83%8F%E3%82%B6%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89%E3%83%AC%E3%82%AF%E3%82%A4%E3%82%A8%E3%83%A0?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#バイオハザードレクイエム</a> <a href="https://t.co/6GY05WqofY" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/6GY05WqofY</a></p>— それいけジェットでやってみよう！ (@neko_sougo) <a href="https://twitter.com/neko_sougo/status/1999397917627736427?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Legendary Japanese game developer Hideki Kamiya also weighed in on Leon’s new appearance and how some of Capcom’s beloved characters are getting long in the tooth. “Uncle Leon, at the very least, I would like for you to live happily in your old age,” Kamiya commented, sharing a timelapse of Leon’s aging face. In response, another user wrote that, although they were fine with game characters getting older, they hoped that Resident Evil and Devil May Cry characters could receive the happy ending they deserve. Replying to this, Kamiya mused: “Even if Dante became happy, won’t he always be poor?”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">レオンおじさん…せめて老後は幸せに暮らして欲しい… <a href="https://t.co/EzsvnVHp54" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/EzsvnVHp54</a></p>— 神谷英樹🍀 Hideki Kamiya🍀 (@HidekiKamiya_X) <a href="https://twitter.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1999371106193703131?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem’s devs have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-developers-reveal-how-much-well-play-as-leon-and-say-the-survival-horroraction-contrast-is-like-jumping-into-a-cold-bath-after-a-hot-sauna"><u>already revealed</u></a> that switching between playing as Grace and Leon will be like “jumping into a cold bath after a hot sauna,” such is the contrast between the tense survival horror sneaking and Leon’s no-holds-barred action. According to director Akifumi Nakanishi, there will be an almost equal split between newcomer Grace and fan favorite Leon. "Although he’s a character who carries a lot on his shoulders, we took a lot of care in refining him into an 'ikeoji',” Nakanishi concluded. "The reactions to the trailer on that front have made us happy (laughs).”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.
