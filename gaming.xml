			<p>While we're still waiting on a proper update in the legal battle between Nintendo and Pocketpair regarding Nintendo suing Pocketpair over Palworld and its alleged infringement on Nintendo patents, we do have an update on some of the patents in question, thanks to <a href="https://gamesfray.com/huge-blow-for-nintendo-head-of-u-s-patent-office-takes-rare-step-to-order-reexamination-of-summon-subcharacter-and-let-it-fight-in-1-of-2-modes-patent/">Games Fray</a>, who has been reporting in-depth analysis on the case as it develops.</p>



<p>Spotted by Games Fray, the US Patent Office, specifically the director of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), John A. Squires, has initiated a re-examination of Nintendo's patent number <a href="https://archive.org/details/12403397">12,403,397</a>. You might not recognize that patent by its number, so to give you a refresh, it's the one regarding summoning characters and making them battle, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-new-patent-should-not-have-happened-says-lawyer-palworld/">the one that IP and patent lawyer Kirk Sigmon said "<em>should not have happened, full stop</em>."</a></p>



<p>The patent being re-examined, especially in this case where Squires has kicked off the re-examination himself, is "<em>rare</em>," according to Games Fray, and this re-examination could result in the patent being revoked. It's possible that the patent is upheld, but with how uncommon this step is from the USPTO, that could already be a sign of trouble for Nintendo.</p>



<p>As Games Fray speculates, it could be that the public attention this case is getting has helped move it up the priority docket, with Squires examining it more closely to initiate the re-examination in the first place, but for now, we'll have to see if the re-examination bears any fruit.</p>



<p>Regardless, the fact that the USPTO is looking even more closely at Nintendo's patents likely spells more trouble for Nintendo's case against Pocketpair. It was already trying tactics that Games Fray <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-reportedly-doing-everything-to-make-lawsuit-against-palworld-stick/">described as a "<em>hail mary</em>."</a> This case is far from over; there's still a lot that needs to play out, but more and more it is looking like Palworld maker Pocketpair will be able to come out the other side of this with a win.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> came out last week and folks have been pouring into the servers–in some cases overwhelming them. And as players immerse themselves in the PvPvE extraction shooter, it’s developing a reputation as a well-made game that poses a number of interesting and unpredictable challenges as you fight to stay alive, hoard piles of resources, and craft your way to loadout supremacy.</p> <p>There’s no way around it: <i>Arc Raiders</i> expects a serious investment of your time and a willingness to suffer some pretty humiliating and often random losses that will set you back in your efforts to accumulate good weaponry and gear.</p> <p>Having spent about 50 hours in the game myself, I’ve found it to be one of the best online shooters I’ve ever played, and I’ve also learned a thing or two about surviving out there amidst hostile robots and sinister players looking to get the better of me. My runs have mostly been solo, but much of what I’ve learned still applies to rolling out with a group.</p>

 <p>So here are 14 of the best tips I can give to those getting started in <i>Arc Raiders</i>.</p> <h2>You can trade Free Loadout Augments for Looting Augments</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641193" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641193"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641193">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This tip is a two-parter: First, don’t sleep on the <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Free_Loadout_Augment">Free Loadout</a>. When choosing to go out on a run, you can either build a loadout from the gear you’ve collected and crafted, or choose the Free loadout which always includes one main weapon, ammo for it, some bandages, a shield recharger, and any number of other utility items or grenades. It’s a handy way to get back out there without risking your good stuff.</p>

 <p>These items are free, so the only thing you really lose on a failed run with these is your time (and maybe a fragment of your sanity). But if you do manage to extract with them, hey, that’s free gear you didn’t have to craft (and you can always break it down for parts).</p>

 <p>But perhaps the most important thing about the Free Loadout Augment is <b>you can trade a Free Augment for a </b><a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Looting_Mk._1"><b>Looting Mk. 1 Augment</b></a><b> from Lance in the Traders tab.&nbsp;</b></p> <p>This has become my default approach to any run that ended in failure: Go back out with a Free Loadout, return home with it and trade it for a Loot one and either go out and get more loot <i>or</i> recycle the Looting augment I just purchased if I already have enough or have better Augments to use.</p>

 <p>Free Loadouts are an efficient way to keep the crafting supplies flowing.</p> <h2>You can roll after a fall to cancel out fall damage</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641192" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641192"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641192">© Gif: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>For a relatively realistic game, <i>Arc Raiders </i>is generous with how long you can sprint and how far you can fall before you take damage. But missing a jump or taking a fall can hurt and isn’t ideal when you’re fleeing a pursuit from an enemy player or Arc. Turns out, <b>hitting dodge right when your feet touch the ground will let you roll to cancel out the damage from falling</b>.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvp-toxic-betrayal-leaper-2000640905"><i>Arc Raiders</i>: The Sickest, Silliest, and Most Spectacular Moments From The Game So Far</a></p> <p>The timing is tricky but there is a skill in the Mobility tree that can make this easier. Also, it seems like some heights are too far to recover from–so don’t expect to leap off the tower in Spaceport and roll your way out of damage. You can, as of now anyway, manage to use <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1ompomw/has_anyone_survived_a_tower_freefall_like_this/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;embed_host_url=https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-pvp-toxic-betrayal-leaper-2000640905">an exploit to grab onto a ledge to cancel out such a fall</a>–and falls from far lesser heights.</p>

 <h2>Rubber parts are pretty important</h2> <p>In my 50 hours of playing <i>Arc Raiders</i> (mostly on solo runs), one particular crafting part has remained perpetually low in stock: <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Rubber_Parts">Rubber Parts</a>.</p> <p>I suspect part of this is due to just how often Rubber Parts are used. For example, to upgrade, build, and repair many guns and gun parts, you’ll either need both <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Metal_Parts">Metal</a> and Rubber Parts or you’ll need to <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Mechanical_Components">craft Mechanical Components</a>, which requires Metal and Rubber.</p> <p>Rubber Parts can be salvaged or recycled from a number of different sources (Scrappy will also give you some after every run). But you can also find them in Mechanical, Industrial, or Technological loot sources. You can spot ideal locations with the matching icon (a gear for Mechanical, building for Industrial, and circuit board for Technological) by looking at the map both before you go out for a run and while you’re on the map.</p>

 <p>I heartily recommend going on several runs to stock up on Rubber Parts.</p> <h2>The Practice Range is essential</h2> <p>While you’ll play through the briefest of tutorials when you first start <i>Arc Raiders</i>, in my experience, it’s not enough to get a feel for the movement of your character and the behavior of its various guns, especially as you mod them with various attachments.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000641196" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641196"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641196">© Gif: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Going out on a run with a weapon you’ve never used before isn’t wise and will likely get you killed. Enter the practice range, which lets you go into a small map (with a few secrets of its own tucked away) to practice your parkour skills and try out different guns. You can literally swap out various gun attachments in real time to get a sense of what they do. For example, I’ve learned that I greatly prefer the Muzzle Break attachment over the Compensator by trying it out in the safety of the Practice Range.</p>

 <p>There are also two achievements you can earn by going to the practice range and using four different guns, so there’s that.</p> <h2>For mouse and keyboard users: Rebind your dodge roll</h2> <p>Rolling out of the way of incoming fire from players or Arc is essential to surviving in <i>Arc Raiders</i> and, in my experience, the default binding of Left Alt for rolling isn’t ideal. This is a function that you need to be able to access quickly under pressure while maintaining your hold on WASD.</p> <p>I’ve chosen to break out my keyboard that has a split spacebar for backspace and forward space side-by-side for this reason. I mapped dodge to backspace and set left space as jump and I’m digging it so far.</p> <p>But if you have a normal keyboard, I recommend mapping sprint to caps lock (toggle, if you wish), and freeing up your shift key to roll. Mapping your dodge roll to a mouse button is also a good move. Whatever mapping you decide on, though, just make sure you can accentuate WASD while rolling without too many weird, cramp-prone finger movements. Thank me after you’ve survived getting swarmed by Hornets.</p>

 <p>Also, Embark Studios, why are there not double or triple bindings in this game? Come on!</p> <h2>The birds will give you away (as well as other noisy things)</h2> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> has phenomenal sound design–easily some of the best I’ve ever heard in a video game. But it’s not just an audio treat. You likely already know that running around, rummaging through stuff, and cracking open various caches is <b>loud</b> (you can invest in skills to make your activities quieter though). On top of that, various buildings are outfitted with security cameras and metal detectors that set off alarms. Watch out for these while also keeping your ears open for other people tripping them.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-extraction-virgil-watkins-interview-2000639879#comments">I Asked <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ Design Director If Camping Makes Me A Bad Person</a></p> <p>But also beware of <i>the birds.&nbsp;</i></p> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i>’ design director <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-extraction-virgil-watkins-interview-2000639879#comments">Virgil Watkins mentioned these feathered loudmouths</a> in our discussion about the fairness of various hiding places in the maps, and it’s clear they can easily give you away even while you’re slowly walking through forests and other natural habitats. But like all the other sound traps, you can use this to your advantage. Listen and look for flocks of birds taking spontaneous flight near you. It usually means someone is nearby.</p>

 <h2>You can ask people to follow you</h2> <p>There are two emote wheels in <i>Arc Raiders</i>; one lets you ping a variety of locations with information such as “I heard something here,” “avoid that,” or, a very useful one, “group up over there.” By default, these emotes are only heard by your squad, but you can toggle on the fly to make it heard to all Raiders.</p> <p>The “group up” emote seems to have a secret second mode. If you look down at the ground and select it, your character will say “Follow me” or “Group up on me.” This is very useful if you want to take the lead with some randos, or even those in your party.</p>

 <h2>Recycling is tricky</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641183" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641183"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641183">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> lets you break down various items in two ways: Salvaging and Recycling. Salvaging is done while you’re out in the field, while Recycling is done in your inventory when you’re out of a game. Recycling will always net you more resources than Salvaging, so unless you need to Salvage to get a specific item or you need to clear up space in your bag while out in the field, try to wait until you extract before you start breaking things down.</p> <p>However, the language used for some objects is a little vague. Take <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Toaster">Toasters</a>, for instance. You’ll find these objects scattered around the world and you can break them down into Plastic Parts and Wires if you recycle them. The description reads “Can be recycled into crafting materials.” That might make you think that the only thing a Toaster is good for is being immediately recycled.</p>

 <p>But hold your horses. Many objects with descriptions that read “Can be recycled into crafting materials” can also be used in upgrading your various workshops. Toasters, for example, are needed to upgrade your Refiner.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000641184" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641184"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641184">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I recommend tracking resources for your workshop upgrades. Once you construct a new workshop, tab over to “Level Up” and click on the tracking button. This will label any instance of the items required with an eye symbol so you’ll know it’s needed and, thus, you’ll be less likely to accidentally break it down.</p> <h2>Full bag? GTFO</h2> <p>At most, you’ll be given about 30 minutes to do your thing on a map. Sometimes you’ll spawn with less time than that. And I’ve learned in my 50 hours that time needlessly spent in the game can be seriously costly. I’ve had full bags of loot, only to get intrigued by a specific location that ends up leading to a Clusterfuck™ that gets me murdered, seeing me lose all the stuff I’d found.</p> <p>Even the most basic of parts, such as Metal Parts and those Rubber Parts I told you about, are essential to keep in stock. So while you might have a bag full of stuff that doesn’t feel valuable, it all adds up to something you’re looking to craft or sell for credits. But you can’t do any of that if you died and lost it all.</p>

 <p>A full bag, regardless of how much time is left, means it’s time to leave–and extracting can be a whole quest full of dangers and surprises in and of itself. A good loadout is built on a path made up of small victories.</p> <h2>Planning a route is essential</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641182" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641182"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641182">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I realized this essential tactic pretty late in my time with <i>Arc Raiders</i>. At one point I dropped into a map with an inconvenient loadout and was about to extract, but I realized that this was actually a great opportunity to scope out the path to an objective I had a quest for.</p> <p>So I took the opportunity to do some reconnaissance, observing the various paths I could take if I was better equipped, and what threats were likely to happen. And wouldn’t you know it, I came across one of the death-delivering Sentinel turrets along the way. I was pretty glad in that moment to not be carrying a ton of things I’d rather not lose to an unexpected threat.</p> <p>Enemy AI is rather spontaneous in this game. They don’t show up in the same place on every run and their behavior (which in some instances was <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-embark-extraction-virgil-watkins-interview-2000639879#comments">developed using machine learning</a>) is very unpredictable and disturbingly smart.</p>

 <p>So if you’ve got an important quest or have a key to a particularly good loot spot, spend a run just examining potential routes and escape plans. Grab a Free Loadout to do this so an unpredictable death isn’t as costly.</p> <h2>Dam Battlegrounds is spicy</h2> <p>This next tip might evolve over time, but in my experience, Dam Battlegrounds, which is the first map you gain access to, is more prone to bouts of PvP. I suspect part of this is because the map is home to the newest folks coming into the game and just getting their bearings and experiencing the flow of its PvPvE action.</p> <p>Other maps unlock after you’ve made enough progress doing things on Dam Battlegrounds, and that’s where a lot of folks are out trying to loot for good shit or are just questing after investing some time into the game, and thus their loadout; they’re probably less likely to risk that progress.</p> <p>So just have your radar up for shenanigans every time you head out to Dam Battlegrounds. People are antsy over there.</p>

 <h2>People are nicer than you think</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641180" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641180"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641180">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>This tip can result in your death. Hate to say it, but in a PvPvE game, unless someone is in your party, they can pose a potential risk to you. But! I’m finding that folks in <i>Arc Raiders</i> are a bit nicer than I experienced during the Server Slam, especially on maps other than Dam Battlegrounds.</p> <p>When going into a building, while I don’t do it every time, when I suspect someone’s around, I will usually use the emote wheel to shout out a “Hello” followed by a “Don’t Shoot!” I have been surprised just how often randos will reply with a “Don’t Shoot,” often followed by a holstering of their weapon.</p> <p>This kind of dynamic is part of the unique, prisoner’s-dilemma social game at work in <i>Arc Raiders</i>. Holstering a gun seems to have become a universal way to signal you’re not going to shoot someone, so return the gesture if you see someone putting their gun away.</p> <p>Or betray them. I dunno. Be a bad person. You’ll get what’s coming to you eventually if you turn evil.</p> <h2>Go nuts with gadgets</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641179" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641179"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641179">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Maybe the inner-<i>Siege</i> fanatic in me is at work here, but once I realized I can craft items to seal doors, erect barricades, and set up traps, oh, how I realized what a devastating saboteur I can be in this game.</p> <p>I’ve sealed up entire rooms while I loot, hunkered down in some buildings to hunt Arc through windows, usually while running solo, covering my ass with traps and gadgets. Some gadgets are harmless, like <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Noisemaker">the Noisemaker</a>. Others range from nonlethal, like the <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Jolt_Mine">Jolt Mine</a>, to lethal, like <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Explosive_Mine">the Explosive Mine</a>.</p> <p>At the time of this writing, with <i>Arc Raiders</i> less than a week old, I haven’t seen many people use gadgets to booby-trap areas. I’ve also surprised many a wandering Raider with a well-placed trap or two. Folks are less likely to sneak up on you if you’ve established a perimeter of fun toys for them to encounter.</p> <h2>Snitches can be your best friend (especially while running solo)</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641178" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641178"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641178">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Snitch">Snitches</a> are often a pain, as they’ll summon Arc to your location if they spot you. But they can be <i>your</i> pain to inflict on others. Lately I’ve gotten into the habit of keeping my eyes peeled for one, even if they’re at a great distance. Typically, shooting at one will draw them over to you.</p> <p>This is a great way to lose pursuant enemy Raiders. Call over a Snitch by getting its attention and it will either summon Wasps or Hornets, which will target you as well as your unfriendly Raider enemies, or just prove a helpful distraction by giving your foes another problem besides you. This can help you make a clean getaway or prove a helpful distraction that lets you fall back and help Arc kill your enemies.</p> <hr> <p>As <i>Arc Raiders</i> matures, I’m sure I’ll find more helpful things to share. For now, however, these tips should help you break down what is arguably a very complex and hardcore game. Mastery over its various systems and unpredictable gameplay is well worth the experience and the struggles of failure.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/brendan-fraser-rachel-weisz-reportedly-returning-for-a-new-mummy-movie-2000641172</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/brendan-fraser-rachel-weisz-reportedly-returning-for-a-new-mummy-movie.1343776/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Here’s some unexpected but much-appreciated news: <a href="https://kotaku.com/there-was-nearly-a-sequel-to-space-jam-about-skateboard-1831528293#:~:text=This%20fateful%20meeting,in%20%24230%20million.">Brendan Fraser</a> and Rachel Weisz are reportedly in talks to star in a new <em>Mummy</em> film from Radio Silence, the team behind<em> Ready or Not</em>, <em>Scream</em> (2022), and 2023’s<em> Scream VI.</em> And it could be a direct sequel to the second film.</p> <p>On November 4, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/new-mummy-movie-brendan-fraser-rachel-weisz-1236418031/"><em>The Hollywood Reporter</em> reported</a> that it had heard from sources that Fraser and Weisz are currently in talks with Universal to return to the franchise that started back in 1999 with the blockbuster action-adventure movie <em>The Mummy, </em>an action-oriented remake of the studio’s original 1930s horror movie. &nbsp;The outlet reports that Radio Silence is producing and directing the movie. The duo, made up of filmmakers Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett, found success with 2019’s <em>Ready Or Not</em> and helped revitalize the <em>Scream</em> franchise in 2022.&nbsp; Sean Daniel, who helped produce the OG <em>Mummy</em> movies, is also on board.</p>

 <p>Details on the new movie are still under wraps (get it?), but a source told<em> The Hollywood Reporter</em> that the yet-to-be-confirmed new <em>Mummy</em> movie isn’t a reboot, but instead a sequel that would possibly “disregard” the events of the third film, which hit theaters in 2008, moved the franchise into China, and controversially recast Weisz’s character. The outlet reports that David Coggeshall is behind the new <em>Mummy’s</em> screenplay.</p>

  <p>After 1999’s fantastic <em>Mummy</em>, Universal followed it up with two sequels. The equally fun sequel arrived in 2001 and was also a box office hit. <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/the-mummy-tomb-of-the-dragon-emperor">But the franchise stalled before returning seven years later</a> and flopping with critics, though that film still brought in over $400 million.</p> <p>In 2017, Universal rebooted<em> The Mummy</em> with Tom Cruise as part of the studio’s<em> Dark Universe</em> project. While it earned about the same as the third <em>Mummy</em> movie, it cost significantly more and was attached to a failed cinematic universe that never took off. So it makes sense that Universal, wanting to cash in on this oddly reliable franchise, is looking to bring back the two charismatic stars who launched the whole thing in 1999. Let’s just hope it all works out and we get one more fun mummy-filled adventure with Fraser and Weisz.</p>

When you add in the threat of other players who might want to kill you and take your loot, too, you really need to make sure you're prepared to fight at all times. But there's a bit more to the game than just survival, as there are also a variety of quests to complete that can provide you with resources that will help you on your journey through Speranza. Below, we've listed out every quest you can undertake in Arc Raiders.</p><h2>Arc Raiders missions list</h2><p>There are currently 63 quests in Arc Raiders, though more will be added with future updates. As of right now, you can expect to spend dozens of hours completing these quests, which task you with finding spots on the map to interact with, looting unique resources to return safely to someone in Speranza, or defeating specific enemy types.</p>

<p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive/2025/11/04/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-will-have-a-new-never-before-seen-conclusion">Game Informer</a> has spent some exclusive time at Square Enix's Shibuya, Tokyo offices, and that also involves chatting to the game's producer, Takeshi Ichikawa, who has shared some interesting news about the upcoming game — it'll have a "new conclusion".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rktgiq&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>While more interviews and tidbits will be available in the subscriber-only issue, Game Informer shared Ichikawa's cryptic comment about one of the changes coming to this big reimagination of the 2000 PlayStation RPG.</p>
<p>While Reimagined "follows the narrative of the original story", Ichikawa told the outlet that "player choices, players will get to see a new conclusion that's never been seen before" in previous versions of the game. That includes the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/dragon_quest_vii_fragments_of_the_forgotten_past">3DS remake</a> that launched in 2013 (well, 2016 in the West).</p>

<p>"...even players who have played previous versions of Dragon Quest VII, they'll still get to have this fresh narrative experience with Reimagined" Ichikawa concludes, leaving the rest to speculation. Will it be an extension of what was there before? Or something completely new? We'll have to wait and see.</p>
<p>We've been getting a few little snippets of info on the upcoming remake; Ichikawa recently teased that fans are ready for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-producer-reckons-were-ready-for-its-dark-sorrowful-story">more "dark and sorrowful" story</a>. Plus, there's some streamlining and other quality-of-life changes coming along with the lovely visual overhaul.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It has been two years since the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-invasion-pve-release-date-story-missions-1850720767"><span>first and only </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>story missions launched</span></a><span>, and I still yearn for the conclusion we won’t be getting. Blizzard has </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-22/blizzard-entertainment-makes-big-changes-as-overwatch-2-struggles"><span>reportedly canceled the campaign</span></a><span> that was once a pillar of the sequel’s pitch, which isn’t too surprising considering the apparent development struggles that the team had while </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-campaign-canceled-blizzard-1851345720"><span>getting it off the ground</span></a><span>. Despite this, </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span> has a story that has been largely in limbo for years, with most of the shooter’s external media focusing on new characters and looking as far away from the main conflict as it can. Well, Blizzard may have just wrapped it all up kind of unceremoniously, at least, as far as the titular organization’s conflict with the Omnic radicals of Null Sector is concerned.</span></p> <p><span>In an almost six-minute audio drama, Commander Vivian Chase, aka Sojourn, addresses the public. Null Sector, the Omnic resistance group that rose up in the initial campaign, has apparently retreated following a “final battle” with Overwatch in Buenos Aires. Sojourn answers a handful of questions at a press conference, name-drops some </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>characters like the shield-wielding Brigitte and the Omnic tank Orisa’s creator Efi, and says that things are chill, for now. The Overwatch organization will continue to serve the public, however, implying that some new threat may be lurking in the future. Other pieces of </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>media have hinted at more antagonistic forces beyond Null Sector and the chaos-inciting Talon organization that characters like Doomfist and Reaper belong to, so this might just be Blizzard clearing the series’ plate to focus on something new. I’ll say, though, that if this is the end of </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s Null Sector storyline and we got it in an audio drama that tells us about a sick battle that happened off-screen, that’s a real bummer.</span></p>  <p><span>The audio drama ends with a screen that says “The story continues in </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>,” likely a reference to the new Lore section that’s being added to the game in its midseason update. I’ll hold sweeping judgments until we get a better look at what Blizzard is doing to get the game’s story back on track. For now, I’ll just hope that this is a sign of more story content to come, and that Blizzard can salvage its universe as more than just a stage for crossover events.</span></p>

              <p>Before <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040"><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em></a> brought the strategy RPG classic to modern platforms, there was the <em>War of the Lions</em> remaster for the PlayStation Portable. That version had a ton of bonus features, from extra job classes and characters to additional cutscenes and even a multiplayer mode. Unfortunately, all of that bonus content was cut from the current remaster, but dedicated fans are painstakingly trying to add it back in with mods.</p> <p>That’s good news for players on PC who can take advantage of all the work that’s already been done and find fresh reasons to keep playing. The 2007 <a href="https://kotaku.com/why-everybody-loves-final-fantasy-tactics-5973196">version of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em></a>, which is also the one available on iOS and Android, added a lot. There were guest characters Balthier from <em>Final Fantasy XII</em> and Luso from <em>Final Fantasy Tactics A2: Grimoire of the Rift</em>, as well as&nbsp;Dark Knight and Onion Knight job classes that let generic recruits rival the power of named companions. There was also a wireless multiplayer mode that let players team up or compete for treasure.</p>

 <p>The multiplayer mode might require deeper tinkering to bring it to <em>The Ivalice Chronicles</em>, but there are <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasytacticstheivalicechronicles/mods/33">already mods</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasytacticstheivalicechronicles/mods/34">adding the rest</a>. In fact, fans like NexusMods user <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasytacticstheivalicechronicles/users/1594389">DanaCrysalis</a> have already gone and added other tweaks and bonus features as well, including the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasytacticstheivalicechronicles/mods/26">Red and Blue Mage</a> job classes from the <em>Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</em> spin-off. Qualify-of-life fixes, meanwhile, include a way to stop all of the monsters in your party, including Chocobos, from endlessly <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/finalfantasytacticstheivalicechronicles">filling up your roster with eggs</a>. There’s even a mod adding <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasytacticstheivalicechronicles/mods/36">extra-difficult random encounters</a> to the map.</p>

 <p>If you’re playing on console, however, there’s no way to take advantage of any of this. Why didn’t Square Enix simply restore all of this cut bonus content itself? “We did of course consider the addition of new jobs, abilities, and characters—including the jobs featured in <em>War of the Lions</em>,” director&nbsp;Kazutoyo Maehiro <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-had-to-be-brute-forc-1851784636">explained prior to launch</a>. “However, the original version of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>&nbsp;is a very complete game both from a game design and story perspective. If we were to make major changes, it would only be a loss for not only fans of the original game, but also those new to the title.”</p>

 <p>In fact, there were apparently even discussions about adding more new content early on in development. The game’s original writer and director, Yasumi Matsuno, recently wrote on X that he has thought about branching out beyond the confines of the original story, like allowing players of the <em>Ivalice Chronicles</em> version to recruit characters like Miluda and Izlude. That ended up not being the right fit for the game’s budget and scope, which among other things required essentially rebuilding the game’s lost code base from scratch. “I think that if we were to do that, we should just make a new game,” he said.</p> <p>Obviously, Square Enix should do exactly that, but for now a vibrant modding scene will have to suffice.</p>

		<p>Commandos: Origins will be getting its first major piece of DLC on November 18th, taking players to the island of Crete. The DLC is called Shadows Over Crete and it is set after the events of the German invasion of Crete in 1941. The Shadows Over Crete will add four new fully voiced missions with the Commandos teaming up with the Cretan Resistance, led by Eleni Andris.</p>
<p><iframe title="First #CommandosOrigins DLC is coming! ????" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PmSTOE14TSw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Commandos: Origins will also add a new enemy type in the form of paratroopers who can quickly descend onto battlefields and add a new threat dimension for players. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/09/commandos-origins-review/">Commandos: Origins review</a>, Adrian said, <em>“Commandos: Origins is probably very good; an interesting historical setting, charming visuals, and deep and varied strategic options. You won’t notice any of that if playing on console however, you’ll be too busy wrestling with the terrible controls to be having much fun. That, and the buggy visuals, make this one to be missed unless you’re on PC.”</em></p>
<p>Commandos: Origins’ Shadows Over Crete DLC will be available for PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, and PS5 for $14.99.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Hideo Kojima attended Lucca Comics 2025 this past weekend and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zN2yGExts_c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was featured in a special panel</a> with two actors from Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, Luca Marinelli (who played Neil Vana) and Alissa Jung (who played Lucy).  A lot of the panel focused on the experience of working on the game, including having to shoot remotely during the pandemic. However, Kojima also shared that he makes games partly with the hope of giving people the energy to live on and be happy.  </p>



<p><em>I grew up watching movies or reading books. When you're a child, you feel so dark about the world sometimes, but for me, there weren't really good role models around me, so what helped me was movies. The characters, or the dialogues, or the theme of the movie really cheered me up. I thought that gave me energy to live on. So I want to return that and that's one of the reasons I create games. If someone plays my game and, after a few years, feels like, I want to live on because I played this game and it cheered me up. That would be the happiest thing that I would feel because I've put that thought when creating the game. There's so many things in entertainment, but games are so immersive, and you play like hundreds of hours on games. So if I ask the person to spend hundreds of hours of their life and they are relieved of stress or whatever, that's fine too, but I also want to give them something through my game. Like, through Luca and Alyssa's relationship and the characters of the game, you feel something. You could use that in your real life and become happy. That's my goal. And of course, I haven't reached that point, but that's how I think when I create my games.</em></p>



<p>The sentiment isn't shocking for those who have come to know Kojima and his unique mentality throughout the years, and without a doubt, at least some of his games have definitely touched a few players.</p>



<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach launched on June 26 for PlayStation 5 to widespread critical acclaim. Given that rights of the franchise have returned to Kojima Productions, we can expect to see the game on PC and probably even on Xbox Series S and X at some point in 2026, <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-directors-cut-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just like the previous installment</a>.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Wings Of Glory monthly redeem codes for November 2025 to get free Tactical Medals, allowing players to progress through the levels of the game quickly.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you’re a fan of the legendary Tom Cruise movie Top Gun, then <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-roblox-prospecting-codes-rewards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> Wings Of Glory is going to be right up your alley. Wings Of Glory is a highly detailed combat flight simulator game that boasts over 150 aircraft, ranging from vintage classics to modern beasts. It features intense 10v10 dogfights in historical locations, allowing players to relive some of the greatest battles the world has ever seen. The fast-paced gameplay can provide hours of endless fun, with six different nations’ aircraft to choose from. Wings Of Glory has extremely realistic flight controls as well as highly customisable planes, making it the ideal game for fans of the aeronautical world. The progression system in the game allows players to get their hands on timely upgrades, but some additional rewards would go a long way, and that’s where the Wings Of Glory codes can come in handy.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The Switch 2 continues to be a sales juggernaut, as Nintendo has announced that it has sold over 10 million Switch 2 consoles in its first six months.</p><p>In its <a href="https://chrome-extension//efaidnbmnnnibpcajpcglclefindmkaj/https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251104_4e.pdf">2nd quarter fiscal year report</a>, Nintendo states 10.36 million Switch 2 units have been sold from its June 5 launch through the end of September. Although Nintendo frames this number as an overall decrease from the Switch 2’s hot start, which established it as the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/11/nintendo-switch-2-is-the-fastest-selling-console-ever-with-35-million-units-sold-in">fastest-selling home console ever</a>, it has remained a strong performer.&nbsp;</p><p>This number now means that Switch 2 is selling more than twice as fast as the original Switch did during the same launch period (4.7 million in its first six months in 2017). The Switch 2 has also outperformed the PlayStation 5's sales during its first six months (<a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/04/28/playstation-shatters-industry-sale-records-for-fy2020-over-78-million-ps5-consoles-sold">7.8 million</a>), albeit that console also suffered from supply shortages.</p>

<p>The report also reveals sales figures for the Switch 2’s marquee first-party titles, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/mario-kart-world/roam-if-you-want-to">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/breaking-through-to-something-new">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. Mario Kart World, a launch title that was also a pack-in for the $499 Switch 2 bundle, has sold 9.57 million units, with 8.1 million from the console bundle. This means nearly every Switch 2 owner grabbed a copy of the latest Mario racer. Donkey Kong Bananza, which launched on July 17, has sold 3.49 million copies. Overall software sales for Switch 2 in the first half of the fiscal year sit at 20.62 million.</p><p>With the holiday season approaching, the recent launch of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/pokemon-legends-z-a/maintaining-rank">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> (of which sales data is not yet available), and the highly anticipated release of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/09/12/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hits-nintendo-switch-2-and-switch-this-december">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> on December 4, it’s likely the Switch 2 will continue its strong momentum heading into 2026. In fact, Nintendo has modified its sales forecast for the next fiscal year; it now expects to sell 19 million Switch 2 consoles before the end of March 2026, up from its previous forecast of 15 million.&nbsp;</p><p>For more on Switch 2, you can see what remaining games will hit the console this year with our <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/29/2025-nintendo-switch-2-game-release-schedule">Switch 2 release calendar</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-owe-my-workday-to-criterion-24-7.1343692/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Most of the time when I’m working I need a little background noise. Sometimes that means music, sometimes podcasts, sometimes streamers. Most recently I’ve been working with the Criterion 24/7 channel on my second monitor, and I swear to god it’s fixing my mental health.</p><p>My husband and I are very aware of how much bullshit we let into our minds. We try not to binge television shows—after three episodes, we watch something else. For every fluffy blockbuster we watch, we make an appointment to watch something off the beaten path. We pop on an episode of <em>The Gilded Age</em> before embarking on an hours-long baseball game. It’s all about balance: If you’re going to have cotton candy, you have to eat your vegetables too.</p><p>But when I work, I often seek out the kind of slop I try to avoid in the rest of my life. For a long time my bread and butter for working was extremely long Let’s Plays, but I also keep podcasts in the rotation for a similar reason: I just like to hear the sound of human voices while I work on something. Streamers like NorthernLion and Hasan Piker have also worked their way into my routines, though there’s only so much I can take of grown men playing video games at this point in my life, as amusing as their anecdotes may be.&nbsp;</p><p>Reality television (my husband dates it, so I can only watch it in my office), podcasts and streamers genuinely do help me to get started with my work, because they help me feel like I’m not just typing alone in my office with my cat. The problem with all these sources of “content” is that they make me feel like my brain is melting after a while. So last week, on a whim, I tossed on the Criterion’s 24/7 channel, which plays movies from the Criterion Collection 24 hours a day, and I had the complete opposite effect.</p><p>I know that watching a dense, foreign language film like <em>Ceddo</em> while working on an essay or typing emails isn’t going to help me retain much of what I’ve seen. But that said, looking over to my second screen and seeing a frame that’s been arranged deliberately, with care, makes me simply feel more like an adult. I know I can’t really watch the movie with the focus it deserves, but at the very least it’s another really cool film to add to my list, and my growing collection of Blu Rays from Criterion.</p><p>Because of Criterion 24/7, which is available with a subscription to the Criterion’s streaming service, I’ve enjoyed the pleasures of Orson Welles’s<em> The Trial</em>, Pierre Creton’s experimental gay coming of age story <em>Un Prince</em>, as well as <em>In Celebration</em>, which features a very young Brian Cox. Sometimes I’m still in the mood for slop, but it’s a more balanced diet. Even if I’m not grasping every detail from these films, I still feel better off for having seen them—and am sometimes drawn into ten or fifteen minute stretches of beautifully framed shots. Since all of these movies are already in the Criterion streaming collection, I can always watch them again when I’m not working. But when I am working, they remind me that I am not sitting around bullshitting. Like these artists, I have the ability to make things with care, too.</p><p>My mom, who is a professor, used to watch Turner Classic Movies all day long while grading papers before she formed a mild addiction to home renovating shows on Bravo. Maybe I picked up this habit from her instead of inventing it wholecloth. Either way, watching images that are more than incidental, and aspire to more than just entertainment, is healing my neural pathways. It gives me no joy to admit this, but my mom had a point there.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ea-saudi-arabia-creative-control-jared-kushner-donald-trump"><h3>EA Says It Will Retain Creative Control Following Saudi Sale, But, Like, Come On</h3></a><p>Big companies have shown time and time again that they'll say whatever is necessary to get mergers approved</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-halo-white-house-trump-vance"><h3>And Also, Who Even Cares About Halo And Lord Of The Rings These Days</h3></a><p>"All of these things do have a feeling of dragging and resuscitating a corpse"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/final-fantasy-tactics-grind-jp-mandalia-plains"><h3>I Will Grind In Final Fantasy Tactics Every Single Time And You Cannot Stop Me</h3></a><p>Final Fantasy Tactics without grinding Mandalia Plains is like a day without sunshine.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/i-owe-my-workday-to-criterion-24-7]]></content:encoded>

<p>In case you missed it earlier this year, Raidou Remastered is a completely refreshed version of the 2006 PS2 action RPG <strong>Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army</strong>, which itself is part of the Devil Summoner spin-off series from the Megami Tensei series.</p>
<p>The remaster features completely overhauled visuals and compat, full voice acting, fast travel, the ability to save anywhere, and a number of other quality-of-life features.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/raidou-remastered-the-mystery-of-the-soulless-army">reviewed the Switch 2 version</a> of the game when it launched on 19th June 2025, calling it "a wonderful retread of a forgotten classic", though with some quibbles about the visuals and some simplistic gameplay elements.</p>

			<p>Every year, there are games that are, in the minds of some, criminally underrated and not given the credit they deserve, whether by the large-scale media, awards season, or public tone. For a certain subset of narrative indie game fans, last year's underrated game was 1000xResist by a new Canadian studio, Sunset Visitor.</p>



<p>It was released first on PC and Nintendo Switch and was nominated for several awards, including Outstanding Achievement in Game Director, Story, and Character at the DICE Awards, Best Debut and Best Narrative game at the GDC Awards, and Excellence in Narrative at the IGF Awards, but would only actually win a Peabody Award for Interactive and Immersive Work. I didn't play it last year, though I heard a lot about it and was keen to jump at the chance to review it <a href="https://wccftech.com/1000-x-resist-arrives-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-xbox-game-pass-november/">now that it is arriving on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S</a>.</p>



<p>I'm not going to use this review to rant about games that should or should not be recognized in award season. Something is going to get missed every year; that's just how it goes. What I will say is that I think it is absolutely criminal that 1000xResist was last year's big miss.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Knower. 1000xResist</em>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>1000xResist is by no means a perfect game, but it has to be said that what Sunset Visitor has created here is one of the best narrative experiences in video games, bar none. There's no real gameplay to speak of, and by the time you're reaching its final chapter, you might be emotionally tired and feel like you just want it to end, but its flaws do not come close to truly weighing down what is probably one of the best narrative games ever, and for my own personal rankings, perhaps the best story I've experienced in a video game.</p>



<p>I love games, but as a means of telling stories, they are not my first love. That belongs to theatre: plays, musicals, opera. Those are the artistic experiences that have given me such immensely powerful stories that affected me the most from a young age, so much so that theatre was my life, professionally and personally, before I started covering video games and writing criticism. </p>



<p>1000xResist is the closest a game has ever come to matching some of the theatrical experiences I've had, and I hold it in the same regard for its storytelling that I do Tetris for its gameplay. It's simply a must-play. You owe it to yourself to experience this game, regardless of the kinds of games you like.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Iris, also known as ALLMOTHER. 1000xResist.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>I will avoid spoilers where I can, because with the story being the core offering here, you're better off experiencing it yourself if you choose to play it. There are, however, a few contextual details that I feel are important to outline when talking about this game, so be warned that while I won't reveal anything too major, I'll discuss some key details you might not care to know about before going in, and some that you would have preferred to remain unspoiled.</p>



<p>With that said, some quick context that's not spoilery at all because it's in the basic description of the game and is all information you get early on. You play as Watcher, a clone living in a world where you and all of your clone 'Sisters' are given functions, and you live within those functions until the ALLMOTHER (sometimes called AllMo) calls you to live with her on the other side. When you start the game, the AllMo is revered as the God of this clone community, and her religious rule is carried out through you, Watcher, and five of your Sisters: Healer, Knower, Fixer, Bang Bang Fire, and Principal.</p>


<figure>

</div>
</figure>



<p>Their names are their functions, with Knower being the keeper of the archives, Fixer being the one who fixes and keeps the facility working, Healer in charge of printing new clones and keeping the medical bay, Bang Bang Fire (mostly called BB/BBF for short) charged with keeping the facility safe from Occupant attacks, and Principal running the whole operation for AllMo as her administrative figurehead. Finally, the Watcher's job is to watch, to observe.</p>



<p>Occupants are these alien creatures who are why you're in this clone society in the first place. They are alien creatures who came to Earth many years before Watcher was born, and while they didn't attack humans outright, their presence caused a plague that decimated the human population, driving remaining survivors underground and leading them to research new means of keeping humanity alive, hence the cloning. </p>



<p>The AllMo, who was a young Chinese-Canadian girl named Iris in her life before becoming the God to hundreds of clones made in her image, is the only one who is immune to the disease, so she is taken underground to be cloned, studied, all of which leads to a series of events that lead to the story you experience.</p>

</div>
</figure>



<p>To avoid spoilers for as long as possible, with that all laid out, I'll start by talking about the gameplay, or more accurately, the lack thereof. There's no real gameplay loop to speak of here. For most of your time, you are just walking/running to different NPCs, talking to them, and moving the story forward. Because large chunks of the gameplay do involve you entering what are called 'communions' with other characters, where you inhabit the memories of the AllMo/Iris and learn about her life, that space is less grounded in reality and contains sections where you fly from one point to another, but it honestly just felt like something to do that wasn't running around.</p>



<p>To be clear, I don't mind that there isn't any major gameplay loop or mechanic here. How you experience the story through dialogue trees, environmental storytelling, and cutscenes was honestly enough for me. I can appreciate that Sunset Visitor is trying to change things up with the sections that have you flying from one place to another, but they never felt properly woven into the storytelling. </p>



<p>In an otherwise very well-directed game, these sections felt directionless in their gameplay. Speaking of being directionless, the other major gameplay issue I have with 1000xResist is how easy it is to get lost in the main space you explore, the Orchard. I was constantly getting lost running around the Orchard, trying to find the next character I had to talk to. The layout of the Orchard is confusing, and the game doesn't give you a lot of help to find your way around.</p>


<figure>
<div>

<figure>
<figure><figcaption><em>Most of what you're doing in 1000xResist is walking down halls like this.</em></figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption><em>The map doesn't really help.</em></figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption><em>The flying sections felt disconnected to the rest of the game.</em></figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption><em>These areas have narrative meaning, but they're still not engaging to run around and get lost in.</em></figcaption></figure>
</figure>
<div>
				    		
				    		
					    	<p><span>2 of 9</span>
				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>Now, it's not like the Orchard was made confusing to navigate for no reason. There's narrative intention behind the design, but that doesn't mean it was fun to get lost and have the pacing of the story broken up by moments where I want to move forward but can't because I'm suddenly lost and stuck running around. I get the 'why' behind it, but it's a choice that comes with drawbacks.</p>



<p>Since that's about all there is to say about the gameplay in 1000xResist, the story is all that's left, and it's also all it needs, because Sunset Visitor wrote a beautiful, layered, complex story that I genuinely think is important to play and experience in the same way I think it's important to experience work by artists like Wajdi Mouawad and Sarah Kane. </p>



<p>Remember all that context I explained earlier? You learn all that early on in the game, but that's not how it starts. It starts with you witnessing Watcher kill Iris, the AllMo, the original from which the rest of the clones came, and you begin to work your way up that event, learning what drove Watcher to kill her 'mother.' The first half of the game is about waking up to reality, about going from someone who is observing and 'watching' to someone who is taking action, and how we can't choose comfort and convenience over our humanity. The second half presents a nuanced and complex view of what resistance looks like, why it's important to resist those who would take from you, because not resisting means not being able to even breathe freely.</p>

				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>While its core message of resisting plays out as what I feel is the core arc for the plot, you have all these incredibly powerful character arcs about a variety of difficult topics. You see a story about diaspora, the struggles that Iris and her family faced as immigrants from Hong Kong living in Canada. There's an incredibly powerful allegory for the societal damage wrought by the COVID-19 pandemic and what came after. An impactful marriage story about two people pushed to unimaginable lengths, stories about friendship, about community action, and the whole time, the game is challenging you by asking you meaningful questions, asking you to decide where you draw the line.</p>



<p>What's unforgivable along the path of resistance? What actions are necessary evils, and what crosses the line? What can we learn from tradition, and where do we need to accept change? What can you forgive, and what can only God forgive, if God is still paying attention at all? Which moments in our lives define us, and do we get to choose what they are?</p>



<p>It culminates with the 1000xResist very directly asking you what to keep and what to leave behind. It holds a mirror to the world and makes you choose, with each of its seven endings playing out in different (and sometimes not so different) ways. The multiple endings are also another reason why I love this game. While Sunset Visitor is asking you these grand questions about life and the world, it doesn't leave its own feelings in total ambiguity. The studio provides its own answers, stands its ground for what it believes, and you're left to wrestle with that and everything else presented.</p>

<p>I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that the story hits as hard as it does from more than just its incredible writing and voice acting. The striking images paired with a score that plays a huge role in making every big story beat have an impact, all work in tandem to make this game the best narrative experience I've had in a video game.</p>



<p>I also feel that I can't close this review without mentioning one last disappointment, which is I had a few more performance hiccups than I would like. Nothing too egregious, but it felt odd that on my PS5, a game that is not at all taxing on the hardware compared to the big triple-A titles of the modern era had any performance issues at all, with the frame rate dropping in some particularly important scenes.</p>



<p>1000xResist is a nuanced story that actually has something to say, that doesn't provide a clean image because life isn't clean. Life is disruptive, it's sad, it's violent, and it also holds beauty, love, happiness, and community. Living is more than suffering; it's more than just being alive, and you should resist anyone who tries to impose less than that on you, even yourself. A point hit home at every corner of the game, when you really start to think about how almost every character you meet in 1000xResist has the same face.</p>

<p>It's the kind of game, the kind of story that will always stay with me. I'll always be jealous of people who get to play it for the first time because I can never do that again. Play 1000xResist. Live for more than just being alive.</p>

				<p>1000xResist is probably the best narrative experience I have had with a video game ever. It's incredibly impactful story is nuanced, complex, layered and most importantly, it actually has something to say, while asking you to reflect and wrestle with your own core principles and how you carry yourself through the world. It's unfortunate that its minor gameplay struggles bring the experience down enough to interrupt the pacing, but 1000xResist more than over delivers with a story that stays with you long after the credits role. It is a must-play because it is a vulnerable, honest, and important work of art that everyone should experience.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-review-changes-new-map-short-2000640868"><em>Fortnite’s</em> latest season is all about</a> <em>The Simpsons,</em> the long-running animated sitcom that premiered in 1989 and is still running on Fox to this day. And one location in the new Springfield-inspired island is The Simpsons’ home, a strange, mysterious place that has no set layout and changes from episode to episode. And somehow, Epic had to recreate this cartoon logic in a static location for a video game, and the end result is, as you might expect, weird in its own way.</p> <p>I want to warn you now that the rest of this post is filled with some <a href="https://kotaku.com/homer-cubed-3d-treehouse-horror-fox-30-years-ago-1995-2000639909"><em>Simpsons</em></a> nerd nonsense. Be prepared for that. If the idea of someone seriously thinking about the layout of a cartoon home might upset you, I’d suggest you move on to something else. For everyone else, let’s go.</p>

 <p>742 Evergreen Terrace, aka the Simpsons’ home, is a place that many of you are likely familiar with and can imagine in your mind. Even if you haven’t watched the long-running animated series in many, many years, I bet the iconic Simpsons house is still rattling around up there in your grey matter. But let me ask you some questions. How many bathrooms does it contain? Where’s the door to the basement? Is there a closet in the foyer? How does the garage connect to the rest of the living space? You might think you know the answer to some or even all of these queries, but you’d be wrong because the <a href="https://x.com/Joshstrangehill/status/1255163988163215360">show’s writers and artists are always changing the house</a>.</p>

 <h2>The weird place next to the kitchen</h2> <p>For example, let’s dive into the hallway to the right of the kitchen. This is one of the least documented spots in the Simpsons’ house in the entire series. Scenes rarely happen here; the show often uses camera angles that hide most of this spot, and the layout of this area changes constantly. Sometimes there’s a door over here to the basement, but sometimes that door leads to the garage. This area is also where the <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/742_Evergreen_Terrace#Rooms:~:text=There%20is%20a%20rarely,appearance%20in%20later%20episodes.">legendary rumpus room</a> exists, though there are episodes where this room is missing entirely. So how does <em>Fortnite</em> handle this bizarre area? In it’s own really weird way!</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641155" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641155"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641155">©Epic / Disney / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Epic has decided to expand this usually empty utility space and has added a foosball table, dart board, and chair. The rumpus room is still here, but lacks a door. And oddly, there’s now a laundry room or mud room connecting the garage to this part of the house. This laundry room area is a totally new invention for <em>Fortnite</em>, and I think it’s only here because Epic stuck a bathroom down here and had some space to fill.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641164" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641164"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641164">©Epic / Disney / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Oh, and yeah, there’s a bathroom down here. Some fans have theorized there might be one here; otherwise, the Simpsons would have to go upstairs every time they need to use the toilet. But evidence of a downstairs bathroom is scarce, and when it has appeared, like under the stairs in the foyer, it rarely sticks around. So I guess shoving a bathroom down in this hallway is probably the best option. As for a basement door, nope. There’s not even a basement at all. Epic just didn’t include it.</p>

 <h2>Things are weird upstairs, too</h2> <p>Moving upstairs, things get even weirder, but that’s not entirely Epic’s fault. This section of the Simpsons’ house, where you can find the characters’ bedrooms and at least one bathroom, is a very strange place. The layout here can shift from episode to episode or even scene to scene, with Bart’s room moving around at least twice in the episode “My Sister, My Sitter.” So trying to model this area was always going to be tricky. And for the most part, I think Epic did a good job. But uh, what the heck is this area?</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641156" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641156"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641156">©Epic / Disney / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>When I first spotted this odd hallway/sitting area connected to the master bedroom, I was extremely confused. There’s a couch up here? What is going on? Even weirder, this is where Epic has decided to shove the upstairs bathroom. I guess Epic didn’t want to have this space be a bathroom, as that would mean the master bedroom would be connected to both the upstairs bathroom and the master bath. Which would be odd, but I find this whole new room and space even weirder.</p> <p>However, in a way, Epic adding two new spaces to the Simpsons’ house is perfectly on brand for this place. The Simpsons’ house is and always has been a wild mess that changes constantly to suit the needs of whatever joke or story is being told. Like the show’s timeline and reality, the house is extremely flexible, and that’s fine. This is an animated comedy. The house and everything else can move around as much as needed as long as I’m laughing. It just means that when you start to think about it or have to rebuild it in a video game as a static object, things get funky.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ahead of its November 14th, 2025, release, Activision has put out the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launch trailer. Despite <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-release-date-remains-unchanged/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors of an early release</a>, this all but confirms it’s sticking to its launch date with no early access.</p>



<p>As the next mainline entry, Black Ops 7 is putting a big emphasis on multiplayer. With a co-op campaign and 18 launch multiplayer maps, it’s honing in on what fans want. Despite returning to the futuristic settings of games past,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-not-have-jetpacks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">without jetpacks</a>, it’s still one of 2025’s biggest titles. Now, we have the launch trailer for the upcoming FPS that showcases just about everything it has to offer.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-called-the-biggest-black-ops-yet-in-new-launch-trailer">Black Ops 7 Called “The Biggest Black Ops Yet” in New Launch Trailer</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Call of Duty Black Ops 7 | PC Features Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8P1Z6CyfEjk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In the trailer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8P1Z6CyfEjk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">shown above</a>, we see a lot of Black Ops 7, from its campaign to multiplayer and zombies. It does show off all of the game’s offerings through gameplay and cinematics. There’s some new footage like the return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-standoff-meltdown-maps-season-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 2</a>‘s Menendez and campaign locales, but it’s more or less the same. Still, it does state that Black Ops 7 is the biggest Black Ops game ever, which is a bold statement.</p>



<p>It remains to be seen if it will live up to the sub-series’ pedigree, given how well-received Black Ops titles are. Some of Call of Duty’s best titles were from Black Ops, like 1 and 2. Even then, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-free-trial-battlefield-6-redsec-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>, which came out last year, was one of the more positively reviewed entries in years. As a fan of the series, I do hope Black Ops 7 lives up to the hype, even with the emphasis on multiplayer. We’ll know for sure as we head to November 14th.</p>

                <p>For the last two decades, Valve's Steam has grown into a gigantic hub for distributing PC games. It's become one of the most important marketplaces in the entire gaming industry. Now, a new poll suggests that a majority of developers believe that Steam has a monopoly on the PC gaming business. But that doesn't seem to be stopping any of the companies from using Steam.</p><p>Atomik Research has shared the findings of its survey, "The State of PC Game Distribution," through the PC distribution platform Rokky (via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/72-of-devs-believe-steam-has-a-monopoly-on-pc-games-according-to-study" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a>). The survey was conducted in May of this year with responses from 306 industry executives in the United States and the United Kingdom.</p><p>According to the results, 72% of all responding executives felt that Steam has a monopoly on the PC games market. The survey participants also acknowledged that Steam sales provide over 75% of their revenue. But only 32% of responding executives said that their companies still support physical media of some form.</p><p>The survey notes that 48% of executives' companies also distribute through the Epic Game Store and the Xbox PC Games store. A much smaller percentage, 10%, uses GOG, while only 8% use Itch.io. However, 80% of responders expect to use alternative sales channels in addition to Steam over the next five years.</p><p>In the meantime, success on Steam can provide a huge windfall, especially for the small developers behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/rv-there-yet/" data-ref-id="5000-697807">RV There Yet</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/escape-from-duckov/">Escape From Duckov</a>, and this year's indie blockbuster, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. Steam recently shared the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/50-most-played-steam-next-fest-demos-are-heavy-on-horror-and-adventure/1100-6535607/" data-ref-id="1100-6535607">50 most-played Steam Next Fest demos</a>, which featured a mixture between large studio titles and games created by smaller devs.</p>

                <p>The newest Fortnite season, which is all about The Simpsons, is putting up big numbers.

As such, you can expect all kinds of coverage about the game from our time visiting Square Enix's Shibuya, Tokyo, offices to play Reimagined for two hours and interview various leads on the development team. That coverage begins today!</p><p>While talking to Reimagined producer Takeshi Ichikawa about this remake – Square Enix's second remake following the release of the original Dragon Quest VII in 2001 (in the U.S.) and the Nintendo 3DS remake in 2016 – he spoke about some of the changes happening in the main scenario. We'll have more on that this month, but for now, I want to focus on something that might excite players already familiar with the narrative of Dragon Quest VII: a new ending.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z13aCVkZaaw"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z13aCVkZaaw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"[Reimagined] follows the narrative of the original story, but depending on some of the [...] player choices, players will get to see a new conclusion that's never been seen before in previous iterations," Ichikawa tells me. "So, even players who have played previous versions of Dragon Quest VII, they'll still get to have this fresh narrative experience with Reimagined."</p><p>Unfortunately, I couldn't glean much more from Ichikawa about this new conclusion, but Reimagined launches on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC on February 5, so we don't have to wait too long to learn more.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/digital-issue/2025/11/04/the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-digital-issue-is-now-live">check out this article</a> breaking down everything in the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2025/10/21/cover-reveal-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined issue of <em>Game Informer</em></a>, and be sure to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">subscribe here</a> if you haven't yet so you can access the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/adventure-doesnt-wait">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined cover story</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/the-history-of-dragon-quest-as-told-by-creator-yuji-horii">our deep dive into Dragon Quest history</a> with creator Yuji Horii, and so much more.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/exclusive/2025/11/04/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-will-have-a-new-never-before-seen-conclusion]]></content:encoded>

<p>This is the Raye</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Holiday season is almost upon us (this writer's local supermarket rolled out the advent calendars weeks ago), and Nintendo UK is equally keen to spread some festive cheer with its new TV ads.</p>
<p>This year's offering once again puts the record-breaking singer-songwriter star Raye front and centre, showing that even Brit-winners like to let off some steam with a few rounds of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Mario Party Jamboree</a>.</p>
<p>Much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/nintendo-uks-latest-switch-advert-shows-just-how-little-we-know-about-pop-music">last year's affair</a>, which also starred Raye, the ads focus on the family-friendly joy of a Nintendo system, as if to say, "forget the Brits, Grammys and Forbes list, only a Switch 2 can make you <em>this</em> happy". And once again, we'd be lying if we said that Raye doesn't do a good job of selling it — that's the face of someone who knows the joys of smashing a Crockoid in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>. Sure, it's cheesier than a Christmas cheese board, but nobody's after gritty realism from a holiday ad.</p>
<p>While Raye is this year's returning face, it's the <em>first</em> festive ads for the Switch 2 — hence all the GameChat and Mouse Mode. Expect to see similar shots of merry, bright faces playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> via a Switch 2 Camera for years to come...</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Eight years on from its initial announcement, the long-awaited <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> is now just a month from launch — and today, fans can watch a fresh trailer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Due to launch on December 4, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond remains mysterious, with Nintendo keeping details of its much-delayed first-person shooter largely under wraps. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Exactly how it picks up the story of the Metroid Prime trilogy, 18 years later, we have no idea. All the areas Samus will visit? Not a clue. Chozo lore? Dark Samus? Phazon? Other bounty hunters? Time will tell. (Though, as of September, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-finally-has-a-release-date-while-samus-has-a-motorbike">we know Samus somehow has a motorbike</a>.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This year, in particular, has seen Nintendo fans fret over the continued wait for more information, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-metroid-prime-4-beyond-delay-rumors-nintendo-recommits-to-2025-launch">rumors of a delay spread</a> as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-reportedly-set-for-september-as-metroid-prime-4-release-date-and-mario-40th-anniversary-speculation-mounts">the wait for a release date dragged on</a>. Glimpses of the game to date have not prompted an outpouring of excitement, either, with a fairly mixed response to the Switch 2 event demo (to be fair, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-played-metroid-prime-4-beyond-first-hands-on-preview">linear and not overly exciting section from the game's opening</a>) and brief showing in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-september-2025-live-updates-everything-announced">September's general Nintendo Direct</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fan eyebrows have been raised, too, by the apparent lack of marketing dedicated to the game. Where Kirby Air Riders has been featured in two lengthy dedicated Nintendo Directs, Metroid Prime 4 has had none.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But there is still time for the Metroid Prime 4 hype machine to kick into gear. And now, 30 days from launch, fans are celebrating today's new trailer doing just that. While there are no standout reveals in the video, it does an entertaining job of showing Samus in action, highlighting baddie Sylux, and revisiting more of the game's setting: the planet Viewros.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Metroidvania Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Trailer felt like, 'Yes, we've heard you all about the marketing. Please have this,'" wrote Metroid fan Jawmuncher on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/metroid-prime-4-beyond-survive-trailer.1343221/page-2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ResetEra</a>. "I approve. This is a trailer I could use to sell someone on the game. The last trailer I could not unless they REALLY like motorcycles."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Finally a good trailer," agreed AppleKid.

Back in September, the US Patent and Trademark Office <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-nintendos-potentially-industry-changing-new-monster-battling-patent-enforceable-we-asked-some-lawyers">granted Nintendo a new patent</a> (Patent No. 12,403,397, applied for in March 2023) covering gameplay mechanics relating to the summoning of a sub-character to battle an enemy. However, as <a href="https://gamesfray.com/huge-blow-for-nintendo-head-of-u-s-patent-office-takes-rare-step-to-order-reexamination-of-summon-subcharacter-and-let-it-fight-in-1-of-2-modes-patent/">reported by Games Fray</a>, USPTO director John A. Squires has now "personally ordered" the organisation to re-examine that patent following the discovery of prior art references in two older patents.
</p>
<p>
In his <a href="https://gamesfray.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/25-11-03-Director-Initiated-Order-for-Ex-Parte-Reexamination-397-Patent.pdf">re-examination order</a>, Squires says he has "determined that substantial new questions of patentability have arisen" in relation to certain claims in Nintendo's granted patent. These claims broadly reference controlling a player character on a field in a virtual space based on movement input; causing a sub-character to appear on the field based on input; using a sub-character to battle an enemy placed in the same location based on input; placing a sub-character into an unoccupied location and having its movements controlled automatically, plus situations where battling unfolds automatically.
</p>
<p>
However, Squires' order specifically cites two earlier patents - one filed by Konami in 2002, the other by Nintendo in 2019 - both relating to the manual and automatic control of players and sub-characters in a virtual field and in battle. "Therefore," the order continues, "a reasonable examiner would consider [the patents] to be important in deciding whether the claims are patentable, and [each] raises a substantial new question of patentability."
</p><p>
Games Fray notes Squires' order (seemingly the first such re-examination order since 2012) doesn't automatically mean Nintendo's patent will be revoked, but it does make it "highly likely" this will occur. Nintendo has two months to respond to the order, and third parties are also able to present their own challenges within that timeframe.

<p>
All this follows the Japan Patent Office's recent decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/could-palworld-triumph-over-pokemon-in-lawsuit-japans-rejection-of-nintendo-patent-might-make-things-more-interesting">reject an application filed by Nintendo in March last year</a> - attempting to patent certain capture and item-throwing mechanics - on the grounds "claimed invention(s)" already existed "in Japan or other foreign countries prior to the filing of the patent application". The rejection - which isn't final - was based on documentation provided by an unnamed third-party (believed to be Palworld developer Pocketpair) pointing to instances of similar mechanics existing prior to the filing in games such as Monster Hunter 4, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ark-survival-evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">launched its controversial lawsuit against Pocketpair last year</a> following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-reaches-25m-players-in-first-month">Palworld's wildly successful launch</a>, accusing the studio of infringing "multiple" patents. In response, Pocketpair <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-vows-to-fight-nintendo-lawsuit-on-behalf-of-fans-and-indie-developers">vowed to fight the legal action</a>, saying it wanted to ensure small studios could not be "hindered or discouraged from pursuing creative ideas".
