			<p>Sea of Stars was one of the indie darlings of the year when it launched in 2023, taking home the prize for best independent game at The Game Awards that year, and surpassing <a href="https://wccftech.com/sea-of-stars-sales-250k/">250K copies sold</a> in its first week. Shortly after its win at The Game Awards, Quebec-based developer Sabotage Studio announced that more than<a href="https://wccftech.com/classic-turn-based-rpg-sea-of-stars-surpassed-4-million-players-across-all-platforms-and-subscription-services/"> 4 million players</a> had jumped into Sea of Stars.</p>
<p>There are a lot of reasons to love Sea of Stars, and there's soon going to be another one. The release date for its upcoming free DLC, Throes of the Watchmaker, has just been announced for <strong>May 20, 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Players who own Sea of Stars across all platforms will be able to download the DLC once it launches in a few weeks' time (from time of writing) and enjoy an extra 8 hours of gameplay, with a side-adventure for the sibling solstice warriors Valere and Zale.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sea of Stars: Throes of the Watchmaker DLC | Release Date Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgFi2jXwzVI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Throes of the Watchmaker takes the two heroes on a miniature adventure to the land of Horloge, which is currently overrun by an evil carnival. By the look of the trailer, Valere and Zale will also have to contend with evil versions of themselves in their quest to cut short the carnival's sadistic fun on the innocent people of Horloge.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/12/sea-of-stars-dawn-of-equinox-devs-deep-dive-into-3-player-co-op-and-combat-2-0-live-today/">last major update</a> Sea of Stars received added three-player co-op, both locally and online, and made sweeping changes to combat that all seem to be present in Throes of the Watchmaker. The DLC will also introduce new classes for Valere and Zale, and a new playable character called Arty. Sabotage Studio also confirmed that this DLC will be playable in three-player co-op.</p>

            <p>"A beautifully made retro-inspired <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> that will instantly transport you back to the 16-bit golden years, for better or worse," was how Katherine Castle (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sea-of-stars-review">summarised</a> Sea Of Stars, a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chrono-trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>-style pixelart sojourn down memory lane from Sabotage Studios, creators of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-messenger">The Messenger</a>. I imagine it's better rather than worse for the addition of some sizeable, circus-themed free DLC, Throes Of The Watchmaker.</p>
<p>Out 20th May, the expansion adds a new playable character, Arty, together with an estimated eight hours of new areas, music, dungeons, minigames, enemies, bosses, puzzles, and playable classes for original protagonists Valere and Zale. Run your rose-tinted retinas over this trailer.</p><!--more--> <figure>

<p>Throes Of The Watchmaker is designed to be played after you've completed Sea Of Stars itself, with a "self-contained progression loop featuring completely new classes, skills and combos". If I'm interpreting that last bit correctly, what you do here won't affect your progression elsewhere in the game.</p>
<p>The setting is basically: what if somebody turned the Backrooms into a creepy clockwork carnival? Zale and Valere must master various funfair talents to prevail: Zale swaps his sword for the ability to juggle, while Valere trades her staff for a crash-course in circus tumbling. The aforesaid Arty, meanwhile, is a jaunty robo sharpshooter with hot pink fittings. He puts me a little in mind of the Casino Night Zone. Bet there's some kind of small fluffy animal inside that carapace.</p>
<p>The DLC apparently benefits from a cinematic budget equivalent to that of the main game, with a new soundtrack contributed by Eric W. Brown and original Chrono Trigger composer Yasunori Mitsuda. Even as a stranger to the base game, I like the frolicsome wackiness of it all. The DLC has a touch of Majora's Mask to it, I reckon. Here's a story blurb with more:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Throes of the Watchmaker returns to one of the most intriguing characters encountered in Sea of Stars' main adventure - the genius inventor known as the Watchmaker, architect of the Clockwork Castle and creator of Wheels, a tabletop pastime enjoyed throughout Sea of Stars' world. The DLC explores a fascinating invention by the Watchmaker, the miniature clockwork world of Horloge, a land threatened by a cursed carnival. Zale and Valere must adapt to Horloge's peculiar rules to fully realize their mastery of Sun and Moon powers, the abilities they've refined since the beginning of Sea of Stars' central journey to stop the Fleshmancer with Eclipse Magic."</p></blockquote>
<p>Again, it's out 20th May. Throes Of The Watchmaker follows the addition of local co-op in Dawn of Equinox. Did you get a chance to try that?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Once again, Sega has delayed the launch of the next Sonic the Hedgehog game. Sonic Rumble, a free-to-play mobile title, is no longer having its global debut on May 8. It's now delayed indefinitely.</p><p>"We know this news may be disappointing, and it wasn't a decision we made lightly. We at Sega share that disappointment, especially because we're making this call so close to the launch timing we had originally hoped for. However, we believe taking this extra time is the right choice for the future of Sonic Rumble," the publisher said in a <a href="https://sonicrumble.sega.com/en/news/000145/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>.</p><p>Sega also warned that while some mobile store pages might show a specific launch date for Sonic Rumble, this is only a placeholder date.</p><p>Sonic Rumble has been available for months now as part of a pre-launch testing period, and Sega said it's thankful to fans for their feedback so far.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZaVZB-QMco" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RZaVZB-QMco" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Anyone currently playing Sonic Rumble in its pre-release launch can look forward to the next update, 1.2, which adds a new "Rumble Ranking" feature and the ability to group together with friends in "Crews." Finally, the 1.2 update adds unique abilities in the form of Skills.</p><p>More details about the new features in the 1.2 update will be announced in the coming days, Sega said.</p><p>"These upcoming changes will fundamentally reshape the game, and one thing has become clear: We want to create a game that evolves and stays fun for months and years to come. To build the kind of high-quality, long-lasting Sonic game our players deserve, we need more time," Sega said.</p><p>Sonic Rumble was originally set to have its global public launch in 2024, but that didn't happen, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-rumble-now-coming-spring-2025-following-delay/1100-6529724/" data-ref-id="1100-6529724">Sega delayed the game to Spring 2025.</a></p><p>Whenever it's ready, Sonic Rumble will release on iOS and Android, as well as for PC via Steam. As for the console series, the latest release was 2024's Sonic X Shadows Generations. The next big release is Sonic Racing: Crossworlds, which launches later this year for console and PC.</p><p>Outside of games, the movie <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-gets-march-2027-release-date/1100-6528922/" data-ref-id="1100-6528922">Sonic the Hedgehog 4 is set for releases in theaters in March 2027</a>. The movie series has been a big hit, banking more than $1 billion across its first three entries so far.</p>

        <p>Won't use AI generation itself to make new skins.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> maker Epic Games has weighed in on the increasing use of AI-generated thumbnail images within the game by third-party creators for their own mini-games. 
</p>
<p>
As well as its popular battle royale modes, Fortnite is also home to thousands of user-generated Islands, hundreds of which are recommended to players at any given time from the game's main menu. 
</p>
<p>
The growing use of AI-generated imagery to advertise these Islands has sometimes left Fortnite's main screen feeling awash with AI slop - and it's something Epic Games has now been asked about. Will the developer put a stop to it? In a word, no - though don't expect Epic Games to start using AI within any of its own first-party modes.
</p>
<p>
"From our perspective, for moderation, thumbnails - like, we don't really care what tool you use to make your thumbnails," product management director Dan Walsh said in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDZYR0gEsfg">interview with Mustard Plays</a>. "All we care about is whether or not it's compliant with our rules.
</p>
<p>
"I think to some degree AI is going to become more and more difficult to detect," Walsh continued. "It's not going to stand out as a unique thing, it's just going to be another tool that people are using to create things. 
</p>
<p>
"So trying to look for that specifically is going to become increasingly difficult to the point where it's probably going to become unenforceable. We're really just focused on - 'does this asset comply with our rules, yes or no?', not 'what tool did you use to make this asset'?"
</p>
<p>
Discussing the idea of Epic Games using AI image generation for its own experiences in future, executive vice president Sax Persson emphasised the company's stance that the "best results" came from humans still. So don't expect an AI-generated Fishstick skin in the shop anytime soon.

<p>
"We've always embraced new technology, but with an ethical stance on the source, like as we generate things, it has to be understood and it has to be properly licensed," Persson said of Epic Games' potential AI use. "So to that degree, we rely on what we provide to people directly to be the best tools that we can humanly do, but the ethical guidelines are proper ownership."
</p>
<p>
The fact that people can still tell that third-party thumbnails are obviously made by AI was an example of how human-made images remained the better option, Persson continued. 
</p>
<p>
"Do we feel like we need to start making Fortnite outfits using AI models? No. We believe the approach we have taken embraces technology but puts humans in the centre of it still, because that's how you get the best results."
</p>
<p>
Back in February, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-admits-call-of-duty-includes-generative-ai">Activision admitted it had begun using AI generation within Call of Duty</a> - after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-block-ops-6-players-accuse-activision-of-using-ai-slop">the discovery by fans of in-game artwork featuring a six-fingered character</a>.

		<p>Moon Studios has released the biggest update to date for their action RPG <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/no-rest-for-the-wicked">No Rest for the Wicked</a>. Expanding on the game in Early Access, The Breach brings new areas to explore, more of the game’s narrative, new weapon archetypes and new enemies to battle.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Rest for the Wicked - The Breach | Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mpoMEYnvA5Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Breach area can be accessed by completing the Prologue and then progressing through the Campaign quests&nbsp;Sacrament, Of Rats and Raiders, Servant of God, and up to step 5 of Spoken and Unspoken.</p>
<p>For ardent players of the game, there’s also a new Hardcore Mode with permadeath enabled to up the ante even further, and there’s the introduction of the endgame Plague System. That comes alongside reworks of the Food &amp; Hunger mechanic and revamped Status Effects in combat.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s also a healthy dose of more general improvements to the game, with Moon Studios rounding up bugs to squash, making performance improvements and optimisations, quality of life updates and balance changes.</p>

<p>Here’s the cliff notes from Moon Studios.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Expanded Narrative Content – </b>Brand-new quests and an extensive amount of high quality cinematic animation as the campaign unfolds across 18 new story scenes</li>
<li><b>New Areas –</b> Adding multiple unique environments nearly doubling the world size. With two new fully handcrafted areas, Lowland Meadows and Marin Woods including a dangerous new Blight hazard to avoid. Two new settlements filled with NPCs, called Hunter’s Vale and Marin Village, and a set of dark cave environments for the player to explore.</li>
<li><b>New Gameplay Systems &amp; Replayability – </b>Introducing the endgame Plague System, a reworked Food &amp; Hunger mechanic, and revamped Status Effects, adding depth to both combat and progression.<span>&nbsp;</span></li>
<li><b>New Gear – </b>A massive expansion with over 150 weapon options, up from 100 at launch, including new Gauntlet and Wand archetypes, multiple all-new armor sets, and a complete Shield rework.</li>
<li><b>New Enemies and Bosses –</b> Major additions to the game include, multiple new campaign bosses, 9 new plague bosses, 3 updated bosses, 2 new enemy factions, 9 new critters and much more.</li>
<li><b>Hardcore Mode – </b>An entirely new game mode with permadeath enabled for high-stakes gameplay.</li>
<li><b>Major Performance Improvements –</b>We’ve heard our community loud and clear and have made great improvements in the performance which includes DLSS 4.0, memory optimizations, reduced loading times, and smoother physics.</li>
<li><b>Quality of Life Upgrades – </b>Featuring updated item previews, tooltip improvements, fast travel enhancements, and more.</li>
<li><b>Extensive Balance Changes – </b>Covering weapons, armor, enemies, systems, and core progression.</li>
<li><b>Enhanced Audio Experience – </b>All new music composed by Gareth Coker, updated audio coverage and new voiceovers.</li>
<li><b>Hundreds of Bug Fixes – </b>Covering everything from crashes to collision issues, visual polish, quest logic, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thomas Mahler at Moon Studios said: “Our team has been working non-stop since our last major update and we couldn’t be more thrilled to meet you all in Isola Sacra once more. This update is packed-full of new content, quality of life improvements and features our community has been asking for. With The Breach, we’re one step closer to delivering the type of gaming masterpiece our fans have come to expect from Moon Studios.”</p>
<p>As Moon Studios originally signed and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/19/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-review-soulslike-action-rpg/">released the game into early access last year</a> with Take-Two publishing label Private Division backing them, Take-Two’s decision to sell off Private Division left No Rest for the Wicked in a bit of limbo. Thankfully the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps">Ori</a> developer was able to buy acquire the rights and is now self-publishing the game.</p>
<p>We looked at the game with its original early access release, saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/19/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-review-soulslike-action-rpg/">our preview</a>, “No Rest For The Wicked is a beautiful dark fantasy epic, and here at the outset of it’s journey through Early Access there’s very few reasons for you not to experience its dangerous charms.”</p>
<p>No Rest for the Wicked is out now via Steam Early Access on &nbsp;PC, but can be wishlisted on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S for when a console release comes.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://x.com/seaofstarsgame/status/1917581893056303123" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, the DLC, which was revealed in January this year, will be launching across all platforms on May 20th, bringing with it around eight hours of new stuff to enjoy after the ending of&nbsp;<em>Sea of Stars</em>' main storyline.</p>

<p>Sabotage says&nbsp;<em>Throes of the Watchmaker&nbsp;</em>will be based around "a self-contained progression loop" that will offer new classes, skills, and combos for both Zale and Valere to use.</p>

<p><em>Throes of the Watchmaker&nbsp;</em>will boast a new soundtrack composed by&nbsp;<em>Sea of Stars</em>' Eric W. Brown, and it'll also see&nbsp;<em>Chrono Trigger&nbsp;</em>composer Yasunori Mitsuda return "as a guest composer".</p>

<p>In story terms, you'll be exploring the clockwork world of Horloge, a land created by the titular Watchmaker (who's also the originator of the in-game Wheels minigame in&nbsp;<em>Sea of Stars</em>' lore). Zael and Valere must adapt to Horloge's unusual rules if they're to put a stop to the "cursed carnival" that is terrorizing the land.</p>

<p>In keeping with the carnival theme, Zael and Valere will also be ditching their signature weapons; Zael will put down his sword and take up juggling, while Valere will drop her staff for a new acrobatic combat style.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Sea of Stars</em>, it's a turn-based RPG inspired by JRPG classics like&nbsp;<em>Chrono Trigger</em>. Released in 2023, the game sees Eclipse magicians Zael and Valere setting out on an epic journey to stop an evil figure known as the Fleshmancer.</p>

Ver. 20.0.0, released overnight, adds system transfers to Switch 2 as well as support for the new console’s GameShare feature and the sharing of virtual game cards. Players have quickly discovered a major caveat for that last part: when using virtual game cards, you can’t simultaneously play a game online across two separate Switches. It’s a confusing hang-up with significant consequences. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195670" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="184" data-playlist="195670,194644,196181" data-current="195670"><div><p>This Stylish Noir-Punk Side-Scroller Is Like Celeste With Guns</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195670/195670_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21167.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Here’s the full list of changes in Switch firmware <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/67891&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/67891" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">version 20.0.0 which went live on April 29</a></span>. In addition to adding virtual game cards, GameShare for Switch 2, and Switch 2 system transfers, the update also allows for save data from multiple games to be transferred simultaneously. Additionally various Nintendo character icons have been tweaked, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1917391209967821073&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1917391209967821073" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with Donkey Kong</a></span> getting revised to reflect his goofier, friendlier new<em> Donkey Kong Bananza </em>design. </p><p>GameShare was revealed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-nintendo-direct-mario-donkey-kong-1851774194&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-nintendo-direct-mario-donkey-kong-1851774194">during the Switch 2 Direct</a></span> earlier this month and allows certain games to be played simultaneously with other nearby users on separate consoles, including older Switch models, though it has to be initiated by someone with a Switch 2. The Switch 2 transfer feature also includes a nice bonus in that current users can temporarily store their data in the cloud in the event that they’re trading in their console and won’t have both available at the same time to do the transfer directly. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-digital-games-virtual-game-cards-vgc-switch-2-1851772706&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-digital-games-virtual-game-cards-vgc-switch-2-1851772706">Virtual game cards</a></span>, meanwhile, were outlined in a regular Nintendo Direct near the end of March, and essentially overhaul how games are shared within family account groups. Instead of being able to access one owner’s games across multiple devices their profile is installed on, the digital games have virtual cards that will transfer between consoles, limiting who can play at any given time. </p><p>While more straightforward and flexible than the current system in theory, Switch owners have already discovered an important shortfall. Notably, two users on two different Switches in the same household can no longer play games like<em> Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> online together. Previously, whoever owned the game digitally could register their profile on a second Switch and access it there while a user on the first Switch was playing as well. That no longer appears to be the case, with at least one user needing to be offline in order to play a game at the same time as the other. </p><p>There is a way for users to revert back to the old sharing system instead of using virtual game cards. A new option under user settings allows players to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1kb48ai/psa_for_multiswitch_owners_you_can_reenable_the/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1kb48ai/psa_for_multiswitch_owners_you_can_reenable_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">turn online license settings back on</a></span> and essentially bypass the virtual card system. But the loophole for playing an online game together now appears to have been closed even when doing that. “Now my wife and I have to buy our own licenses of each other’s games when we didn’t have to do that before, or on other consoles like PlayStation, so stupid,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1kb31a4/nintendo_switch_firmware_update_version_2000_is/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1kb31a4/nintendo_switch_firmware_update_version_2000_is/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> one frustrated user on the Switch subreddit. <br></p><p> “We think many people will enjoy the benefits of virtual game card, but it is an optional feature, and the original method can be used instead,” a Nintendo spokesperson previously told the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.crossplay.news/p/sharing-switch-games-with-family-changes&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.crossplay.news/p/sharing-switch-games-with-family-changes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">parent-focused gaming newsletter <em>Crossplay</em></a></span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-the-first-preview-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I remember vividly when I first caught wind of The Outer Worlds back in 2018 – my managing editor at the time talked about his preview of what developer Obsidian was working on; an original first-person RPG with the makings of a Fallout game. As someone who still won’t shut up about Fallout: New Vegas to this day, that was music to my ears. It turned out to be one of my favorite games of 2019, but instead of expecting it to be the next coming of Fallout, I saw it more as a new foundation for Obsidian to work within.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There were certain limitations to what the first Outer Worlds could be in terms of size and scope, and that much was clear in the several conversations I’ve had with the development team when reflecting on it. But after seeing the sequel in action for the first time and interviewing key folks at Obsidian, The Outer Worlds 2 seems like that original vision fully realized. For all the details I’ve been able to dig up about the revamped gameplay systems and worldbuilding, the overarching idea was that The Outer Worlds 2 needed to be a deeper RPG where player choice has more of an impact in nearly all aspects of the experience. And from everything I’ve gathered from our month’s-worth of exclusive coverage, this sequel looks like it’s stepping in the right direction.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Outer Worlds 2 Gameplay - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What I’ve seen thus far is based on an early build of the game, all of which has been through hands-off demos, and all the footage you’ve seen was provided by Obsidian. So while I haven’t played it yet, The Outer Worlds 2 is so far reminding me of some of the best parts of the studio’s long list of RPGs, where unconventional playstyles are viable and unpredictable choices and outcomes are intrinsic to the roleplaying aspect, asking you to roll with the punches regardless of whether or not it’s deemed “optimal,” and this manifests in several ways.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Attributes, which were stats that you invested in as you leveled up, have been set aside for a heavier focus on Skills – a total of 12 (including staples like Engineering, Explosives, Guns, Hacking, Leadership, and more) now dictate how your character functions. While this may seem like further streamlining, the goal is to make sure the points you put into various Skills have a more noticeable impact throughout the process of leveling up, as opposed to the minute effects you’d feel in the old Attributes system. Of course, I can’t speak to how this comes to fruition in a full playthrough, but there are other systems in place that feed into the idea that these mechanical decisions can affect your character in bigger ways.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>[U]nconventional playstyles are viable and unpredictable choices and outcomes are intrinsic to the roleplaying aspect.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That leads to Perks, of which there will be about 90 to choose from. There are specific Skill levels needed to gain access to certain Perks, but these are said to offer significant changes to what you can do in combat, conversations, exploration, and more. One example is a Perk that lets you aim, fire, and reload while sprinting and sliding for those who want to approach enemies with the mentality of a traditional shooter. Or the Serial Killer and Psychopath Perks that grant bonuses for those who try a much more violent playthrough. Or the Space Ranger Perk that lets you convert points in your Speech Skill into damage bonuses in battle. Dialogue branches may vary based on the Skills and Perks you have (more so than the original), or your character may pick up on things in the environment they wouldn’t be able to otherwise, so the results of your build aren't just isolated in combat scenarios. Those are just a few examples of how these systems feed into specific playstyles with the intention of rewarding you for the way in which you’re specialized. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there are Traits that stack additional permanent effects that you wouldn’t necessarily get through Perks. The catch is that if you want to take more Positive Traits, you have to also select Negative Traits, and that’s where things can get interesting. I’m actually curious about how I’d play with something like “Dumb” where I’d have to lock myself out from ever putting points into five of the 12 Skills, or “Sickly” where I’d take lower health and toxic resistance. It seems like a trade-off that could be worth it, depending on how I want to build out my character.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But if you want to lean more into unconventional mechanics, accounting for things you usually wouldn’t in other RPGs – enter the new Flaws system. Like in the original, the game is watching your behavior and then offering permanent bonuses at the cost of a permanent detractor depending on <em>how you play</em>. However, The Outer Worlds 2 goes deeper on this idea – you’re not just offered a Perk point if you take a Flaw. Flaws now have bespoke status effects and conditions that can have major ramifications for how you’ll play the game, should you take a Flaw. I only got to see two of them, but they speak to the philosophy behind them. Sungazer offers regenerative health outdoors during the day at the cost of extreme visual lens flare and reduced accuracy, and that’s activated by staring into the sun multiple times. Or if you quickly skip through dialogue choices frequently, Foot-in-Mouth offers a permanent XP bonus while forcing you to make all future dialogue choices in a 15-second window – and if that timer runs out, the game will pick for you, which <em>can </em>lead to some unintended consequences. There’s another Flaw that’ll force you to accept all future Flaws no matter what, and Obsidian <em>hinted </em>at one that will account for those who save scum, but that remains to be seen – it’s bizarre ideas like these that can shake up playthroughs. Obsidian said there are around 30 Flaws in total, and my hope is that the incentives will be worth the trade-off, and that they’re built in a way that it won’t be easy to circumvent their effects, which could diminish their impact.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All that said, it’s clear that Obsidian put a lot of thought into how to rebuild its RPG mechanics with the intention of making something that is more reactive and impactful, or at least purposeful along the progression path. And with no respec beyond the intro mission, you’ll have to build out your character with a little more care. Hands-off demos can only tell me so much, so I’m expecting everything else around The Outer Worlds 2 to bring out the best in those systems and push me to engage with them beyond the surface level.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That sounds all well and good, and the brief gameplay sequences I saw were also promising. While the first game had approachability at the forefront, The Outer Worlds 2 looks like it’s offering more variability with a web of systems that come together for something a bit more sophisticated. For example, we now have actual stealth mechanics with a better detection system, proper stealth kills, and scenarios in which this approach would make sense – and features such as damage bar read-outs tell you whether or not a stealth attack will be worth it. The N-Ray Scanner is one of the new gadgets you’ll use, and this lets you see through walls and detect cloaked enemies or key objects hidden in the environment, but it’ll expend your mana-like energy – it’s a tool that’s conducive to this playstyle, and I’m looking for how this approach can be sustained throughout. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Judging from the brief run of the N-Ray Facility, for example, I saw snippets of that in action, which leans into this particular playstyle I prefer. This level was also ripe for playing it like an immersive sim, and it gave me hints of Deus Ex or Dishonored, especially with how you navigate the level and find different paths. I know the DNA of those games will always find their way into first-person RPGs, but it’s something that wasn’t quite as present in the first Outer Worlds, and very much apparent in this sequel.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If the original was Obsidian building the framework, my hope is that this sequel is the series reaching its full potential.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">And while I’m excited for stealth options and wielding the environment to create paths forward, the punched-up gunplay and addition of gadgets shows an improvement in combat approaches across the board. The aforementioned sprint-slide-firing Perk – along with the returning Tactical Time Dilation (TTD) – looks to be a deadly combo in a firefight, but some wild unique weapons like the crank-powered sniper rifle called the Planet Killer or the advertisement-blasting Pop Gun that’ll distract enemies, widen your toolset. When all hell breaks loose, the triple-barrel shotgun will probably be an old reliable in my playthrough. And I’m sure I’ll be saving those rare shots I’ll find for this game’s version of the BFG for the toughest fights. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Outer Worlds 2 - Golden Ridge Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But with Obsidian looking to games like Destiny in terms of reworking gunplay, I think it’s a net-positive for how the game feels on a moment-to-moment basis. There’s an emphasis on better mobility, smarter enemy behavior, and varied enemy types, along with that wider, more creative arsenal. But there’s also no more level scaling, and so there’s been more consideration in how difficulty works in The Outer Worlds 2 with tiered enemies and static levels for encounters across the game, letting encounters be designed with more intent, especially with where the designers will funnel players and create friction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The more intimate details of level design excite me, and seeing interiors like the Zyranium Lab be noticeably bigger and intricate with multiple paths has me thinking about the gameplay possibilities. But its large open zones are also a key point in this sequel. I’ve said in previous coverage that bigger doesn’t always mean better, and Obsidian is aware of that. So, The Outer Worlds 2 has an emphasis on density and rewarding players who poke around its areas with more side stories and useful loot in a way that the first game didn’t. Points of interest out in the distance are built intentionally and are said to be placed for a reason and draw players to those locations and discover quests off the beaten path. This is all based on a brief walkthrough of Golden Ridge, which is the only open zone I saw, and it does seem like there’s a lot more going on at the ground level. And I hope that this design philosophy extends to the rest of The Outer Worlds 2's open regions. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Obsidian wasn’t ready to share many details on story or companions, but game director Brandon Adler hinted at a world-changing event happening early on when landing on Golden Ridge, and that being indicative of the types of narrative swings they’re going for. Creative director Leonard Boyarsky, who was one of the original Fallout developers, spoke to how the team is thinking about The Outer Worlds 2’s story. He mentioned being sharper with its humorous tone while going deeper on its commentary about how corporations, and those in power, will exert and abuse their power on those seen below them. It seems a major factor in conveying these themes will be through factions – The Protectorate, The Order of the Ascendant, and Auntie’s Choice (a merger between Auntie Cleo and Spacer’s Choice from the first game). While companions are optional, it appears they’ll be an important lens through which you navigate and understand the world. Boyarsky also emphasized the intention of making a story that can stand the test of time with its dissection of the human condition, rather than directly reflect the times in which it was made – and that’s largely been the philosophy that guided the old Fallout games, including New Vegas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, I get the impression that Obsidian is trying to avoid homogeneity in its gameplay systems, and build worlds with questlines and encounters that tease out the varied options you have this time around. You can have complex and creative systems to toy with, but ultimately, it’s a means for engaging with the captivating stories tucked within where we have a distinct role to play. If the original Outer Worlds was Obsidian building the framework, my hope is that this sequel is the series reaching its full potential. And that’s something we’ll have to see when The Outer Worlds 2 comes out later this year.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">It's often joked that MercurySteam is the "real" metroidvania studio, being the only developer to officially work on both the Castlevania and Metroid series--a point further illustrated with large displays of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/castlevania-lords-of-shadow-2/" data-ref-id="5000-143439">Castlevania: Lords of Shadow 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metroid-samus-returns/" data-ref-id="5000-465597">Metroid: Samus Returns</a> at the front of its office in San Sebastián de los Reyes, Madrid. Its new game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/blades-of-fire/" data-ref-id="5000-662141">Blades of Fire</a>, however, harkens back to an even earlier time, acting as a spiritual successor to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/blade-of-darkness-2001/" data-ref-id="5000-2882">Severance: Blade of Darkness</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Released on PC in 2001, Blade of Darkness was a Conan-inspired dark fantasy third-person action game that was the sole release from Rebel Act Studios, whose members--including studio co-founder and Blades of Fire director Enric Alvarez--would go on to start MercurySteam. While a commercial flop at the time, its combination of dark fantasy visuals with hardcore combat mechanics is now considered a precursor to the souls-like genre.</p><p dir="ltr">"In reality, Blades of Fire is kind of a return to our origin," Alvarez explains. "Nowadays, the mould of dark fantasy with difficult and precise combat has become popular, mostly thanks to From Software, so we saw our opportunity to go back to our roots, which has made me feel young again."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4484837-blades-of-fire_epic_02-scaled.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4484837" data-ratio="0.56258472661545" data-width="2213" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4484837-blades-of-fire_epic_02-scaled.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4484837"></a><figcaption>The world of Blades of Fire is surprisingly vibrant.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4484837-blades-of-fire_epic_02-scaled.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While MercurySteam is better known for the licenses it has worked on, Alvarez says that the team takes pride in doing things its own way, whether that is in developing games with its own internal engine or how it also took the Castlevania license and made it its own. "It's Konami's property, but from an emotional standpoint, we like to approach projects as if it is ours--the mythology, story, and characters in [Lords of Shadow were] fully reinvented by the studio." MercurySteam seems to have taken a similar approach to Blade of Darkness' spiritual successor--after playing the first three hours of Blades of Fire, it's clear that this isn't an action-RPG that's just repeating the souls-like formula. Instead, it forges its own path.</p><p dir="ltr">You play as Aran de Lira, who doesn't just fight but makes his own weapons. The recently crowned Queen Nerea has used dark magic to turn steel into stone, rendering all weapons useless, and only a Sacred Hammer originating from the legendary Forgers of the world--that's now in Aran's possession--is able to forge new armaments.</p><p dir="ltr">Forging weapons is an important aspect to Blades of Fire, and far more involved than the crafting systems seen in other games. "Crafting is usually about finding materials and then having it done, but this is about making decisions," says lead game designer Joan Amat. "When you're fighting enemies, you have to be tactical about it. You have to either be faster than them, or be able to block their attacks. The whole point is that you are designing weapons--you are making the key decisions that make weapons have certain properties that you desire."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4484838-blades-of-fire-announcement-02-1741275584207.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4484838" data-ratio="0.56261234272019" data-width="1669" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4484838-blades-of-fire-announcement-02-1741275584207.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4484838"></a><figcaption>Forging new weapons in Blades of Fire is an involved process.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4484838-blades-of-fire-announcement-02-1741275584207.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For instance, you can use better materials to improve a weapon's attack stats, but there are also physical stats you have to pay attention to, like the weight and speed of the weapon, which can also impact your ability to block and parry. It's also the first time I've seen in a game where a weapon's reach is explicitly displayed. That attention to physicality is something carried over from Blade of Darkness. "In that game, you could attack an enemy and your sword could [be inches away] from the neck, and you [wouldn't] hit anything because you were still too far from the enemy," says Alvarez. "[We wanted to bring back] that obsession for having a physical combat [that] is as believable as possible. You can feel the weight of your weapons, or the trepidation when you block an attack."</p><p dir="ltr">That physicality translates to Blades of Fire's weighty combat, using the four face buttons for attacking the enemy's head, left side, right side, or body respectively, with strong attacks executed by holding the button down to charge up. Stronger attacks take a little more time to pull off and leave you open, but have far more impact. One of my most satisfying tactics was charging up a polearm while just in range of an approaching enemy, then watching the camera move in as Aran's overhead swing caved in their head in one fell swoop.</p><p dir="ltr">Deciding the weapon you wield and where to attack an enemy are both important. For example, a warmonger's heavy armor means my sword just bounces off, but I have a better time when switching to a blunt polearm, which can be quickly done by holding the right trigger then using the right stick to swap to a weapon that I've added as a shortcut. You can also press the trigger to change the weapon stance, so you can thrust instead of swinging them, which becomes especially important in narrower environments where your blade can bounce off walls, also reducing their durability.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4484839-blades-of-fire-the-first-preview_bhw2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4484839" data-ratio="0.562424969988" data-width="1666" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4484839-blades-of-fire-the-first-preview_bhw2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4484839"></a><figcaption>Sometimes it's not immediately clear which spot to target on a non-humanoid enemy.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4484839-blades-of-fire-the-first-preview_bhw2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Knowing the best weapon to use is clearly indicated with a targeting system that also provides a color-coded outline to determine how vulnerable the enemy's armor is to the weapon you're wielding--green means the equipped weapon can penetrate the targeted enemy's armor, orange is neutral, and red means your weapon won't be effective. These colors can also change during an encounter or you may see a combination of colors, where the enemy's arms might be exposed but they're wearing a hard spiked helmet. Amat tells me that players can also opt to turn off the color-coding if they want to be more immersed and just observe enemy armor to figure out what weapon to use and where to attack. These color outlines however are definitely helpful against non-human enemies, like an elemental foe made entirely of water, where its weaknesses are less apparent initially.</p><p dir="ltr">The left trigger allows you to use your weapon to block or parry when timed right, though holding it down is also used to recharge your stamina gauge. Unlike most souls-likes, there are separate gauges for defense and stamina, and in some cases, very powerful attacks will still break through your defense and cause damage. I was less convinced by this mechanic, which Aran refers to as "the breath of the defender," especially as it doesn't restore your stamina more quickly, such as ki pulse in the Nioh games, but your stamina will recover extremely slowly if you don't use it.</p><p dir="ltr">That layered complexity to combat is also apparent in the forging of weapons, requiring scrolls that are only obtained after killing specific enemies wielding those weapons a set number of times. Then, after customizing the weapon's build and materials, there's also a forging minigame, which I didn't fully grasp during my hands-on, but it involves using the two analogue sticks to align a row of bars closely to the shape shown before striking with the hammer. Depending on how well you do, you can increase the star rating for your weapon, which indicates how many times it can be repaired.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4484840-blades-of-fire_forge-event_01-scaled.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4484840" data-ratio="0.56275303643725" data-width="2223" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4484840-blades-of-fire_forge-event_01-scaled.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4484840"></a><figcaption>You can dismiss your young companion, Adso, at the push of a button.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4484840-blades-of-fire_forge-event_01-scaled.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Despite having such attention to forging and customizing your weapons, and even getting to give them a unique name, there's no getting away from the inevitability that they won't last--in its own take on a Souls game's formula, you'll also drop the weapon you're wielding upon death, needing to journey back to where you died to retrieve it (though it won't disappear for good if you die again before retrieving it). "Not all weapons will mean something to you, and sometimes you're testing the waters before you go back to the forge, use better materials and make an extra effort to get better stats and stars," says Amat. "When you start treating that weapon with care and start cherishing it, that is the soul of the game."</p><p dir="ltr">While there's a deep and robust combat and weapon system, I'm also intrigued by Blades of Fire's story. From what I've seen, the game doesn't spend much time indulging in cutscenes, which can leave the relationships and goals for some of the characters feeling rushed. However, the narrative set-up is interesting. Within minutes of the beginning, you see an old friend of Aran's, Abbott Dorrin, killed in front of his eyes by the queen's soldiers, which then saddles him with the abbott's young apprentice, Adso, along with the Sacred Hammer, before Aran decides the following morning to journey to the palace to kill the queen.</p><p dir="ltr">I'm not entirely sold on Adso as a companion, even though there is an amusingly odd couple dynamic as the young cocky scholar throws casual barbs about Aran's age. Otherwise, he functions more explicitly like a walking encyclopedia who you can ask about your quest, the world, or enemies, which he makes sketches for in your journal--perhaps acknowledging how some players might find him annoying or unnecessary, you even have the option to just whisk him away to camp. It then remains to be seen whether a deeper emotional bond will develop, as with Atreus in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/god-of-war/" data-ref-id="5000-455388">God of War</a> or Ellie in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-last-of-us/" data-ref-id="5000-125470">The Last of Us</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4484841-dc6282b425ae62d0b440.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4484841" data-ratio="0.57083333333333" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4484841-dc6282b425ae62d0b440.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4484841"></a><figcaption>The motivations for certain characters are still unclear, including the queen who transforms all steel weapons into stone.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4484841-dc6282b425ae62d0b440.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Alvarez assures me that I'll be able to fully appreciate Blades of Fire's story once I have played through it but also that it's structured in a way for players to take it at their own pace: "The story in Blades of Fire doesn't pursue you; you have to pursue the story." Its stylized aesthetic, taking inspiration from '80s fantasy movies and American artist Frank Frazetta, certainly isn't lacking in vibrancy, with a bright color palette and some expressive characters that include an adorable skeleton child and a huge flying scarab that also doubles as a house--not the usual imagery you'd associate with dark fantasy. But to quote the old lady who lives in that scarab house, it's probably to MercurySteam's credit that the focus is "Less drama, more action!"</p><p dir="ltr">Blades of Fire releases on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC (via Epic Games Store) on May 22.</p>

		<p>Clifftop Games and RawFury have announced that Kathy Rain 2: Soothsayer will launch on 20th May for PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kathy Rain 2 | Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/psjR0wSmVEw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set in 1998 in the metropolitan city of Kassidy, this point and click adventure sequel sees Kathy pursuing the serial killer known as the Soothsayer. Players will lead kathy through the world, picking up on clues, grabbing evidence and eventually confronting the serial killer themselves.</p>
<p>We’re almost a decade on from the original Kathy Rain game, and five years from the Director’s Cut reimagining, and so while the game still has a retro pixel art style, it looks like there’s been a pretty big step forward in how refined that pixel art look is. There’s now modern features like dynamic lighting and surface reflections. These go hand-in-hand with hand-drawn cutscenes and portrait, while Arielle Siegel will reprise her role as Kathy alongside some other returning voice artists.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/randy-pitchford-denies-rumor-that-borderlands-4-launching-early-has-to-do-with-the-grand-theft-auto-vi-release-date/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Those eager to play Borderlands 4 were happy to learn that its launch date was <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-release-date-moved-forward/">moved up almost a week and a half</a>, from September 23rd to September 12th, but it wasn't just Borderlands fans who found this announcement interesting and exciting.</p>
<p>Players chomping at the bit to play Grand Theft Auto VI also got excited, because one potential reason for Borderlands 4 releasing earlier could be to give it more time to breathe before GTA VI arrives and absorbs all the attention in the video game industry. Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford says that's not the case, though.</p>
<p>"<em>Borderlands 4 shipping early is 100% the result of confidence in the game and development trajectory backed by actual tasks and bug find/fix rates,</em>" Pitchford began in a post on <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1917393753456664966">X</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>Our decision is literally 0% about any other product's actual or theoretical launch date</em>."</p>
<p>Pichford doesn't call out Grand Theft Auto VI, but it is almost certainly the game behind his vague "<em>any other</em> <em>product</em>" comment. Take-Two has always published the Borderlands series, but now it wholly owns the series and Gearbox. As the parent company for both Gearbox and Rockstar, Take-Two ultimately plays a huge role in planning the launch dates for the games in its portfolio.</p>
<p>It's entirely possible that Pitchford approached his bosses and told them the good news that, based on Gearbox's findings, Borderlands 4 would be ready just under a week and a half earlier than they'd already announced.</p>
<p>It's also possible that Pitchford's bosses at Take-Two asked Gearbox to do some background on whether they could release Borderlands 4 early to give it more room to breathe ahead of Grand Theft Auto VI. Or even that Pitchford proactively thought to look into the possibility of Borderlands 4 launching earlier than already announced, knowing approximately when GTA VI is due.</p>
<p>The final decision was likely still up to Pitchford and his team, and was almost certainly made for the reasons Pitchford lays out, but it's not the only truth that could exist in this scenario.</p>
<p>When Grand Theft Auto VI finally releases, it'll be one of the biggest releases in video game history. Other game studios are already looking to get out of its way, knowing that no one will be focused on anything besides GTA VI when it does release.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-ea-cuts-titanfall-game</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/respawn-layoffs-part-of-wider-ea-staff-cuts-titanfall-project-reportedly-axed.1177566/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-ea-cuts-titanfall-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday,&nbsp;<em>Titanfall&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi&nbsp;</em>developer Respawn Entertainment revealed that it would lay off a number of employees and cancel two "early-stage incubation" projects. Now, it's emerged that these layoffs were part of a wider EA staff cut wave.</p>

<p>Respawn's layoffs were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/respawn-layoffs-project-cancellations" rel="nofollow">announced yesterday</a>, but the studio didn't announce the numbers. Now, though, a Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-29/electronic-arts-lays-off-hundreds-cancels-titanfall-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a> is claiming that the Respawn layoffs ran to around 100 employees, and that they were part of a wider layoff wave that saw "between 300 and 400" EA employees lose their jobs.</p>

<p>An EA spokesperson told Bloomberg that the cuts were part of "select changes within our organization that more effectively aligns teams and allocates resources in service of driving future growth".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/titanfall-2-respawn-ea-layoffs.jpg?itok=cpZL4FSi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/titanfall-2-respawn-ea-layoffs.jpg?itok=8Cf6FUr7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>One of Respawn's canceled projects was apparently a&nbsp;<em>Titanfall&nbsp;</em>game.</figcaption></figure><p>Bloomberg goes on to say that one of Respawn's canceled projects, codenamed R7, was "an extraction shooter set in the <em>Titanfall</em> universe". The report also claims that said project wasn't anywhere near being released.</p>

<p>As Bloomberg points out, reports of EA and Respawn's layoffs come after what has been a relatively tough year for the publisher in terms of revenue. Back in January, EA admitted that big-name releases&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 25&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">had underperformed</a>, contributing to a "mid-single-digit decline" for the studio.</p>

<p>It's also a difficult time for the industry as a whole, with studios like&nbsp;<em>Veilguard&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-layoffs-veilguard-failure" rel="nofollow">BioWare</a>,&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>outfit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-end-of-2024" rel="nofollow">Rocksteady</a>, and even tech titan <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>&nbsp;letting staff go in recent months.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that some of the staff laid off from Respawn were working on the&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi&nbsp;</em>series, work on the next installment of the series apparently continues apace, although we don't know too much about the game yet.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Respawn has in store for us next (beyond&nbsp;<em>Zero Company&nbsp;</em>and the new&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi&nbsp;</em>game, of course). Stay tuned for more.</p>

			<p>Today, Funcom has shared a new Dune: Awakening trailer entirely focused on the game's extensive base-building feature, which improves upon the systems seen in Conan Exiles. Here's the transcribed overview provided by the narrating voice:</p>
<p><em>On Arrakis, exposure to the raw, unbridled elements is death. But walls alone will not save you from the maelstrom. You need power and the engineering of CHOAM to raise a protective shield against the storm. Without such protection, even the strongest walls will erode and fail in time, as will anything left in the open. Your exposed vehicle is beyond repair, but a lesson is learned.</em></p>
<p><em>You need better protection against the dangers of Arrakis. It's time to upgrade your base. Base construction and expansion can be done alone or together with others. With Celo projections, building as a group is easy. To further customize your base, you must align yourself with one of the warring Great Houses. Displaying your allegiance through their unique architecture, the Atreides welcome your aid. Swear your fealty to the Atreides and rise to greatness on Arrakis.</em></p>
<p><em>Your base serves as a reflection of both your influence and your allegiance to a faction. The safety provided by your base allows you to craft powerful new tools, technologies, and vehicles. Here we are crafting a ground car. Once each part of your vehicle is assembled, you can install modules to enhance its specialization further and customize its appearance.&nbsp; By aligning with the Atreides, you have earned the option to craft their faction-specific ground car. </em></p>
<p><em>On the horizon, another sandstorm approaches, but this time you are prepared. Your base is equipped with powerful shields for protection and a custom-built garage that will keep all your vehicles safe from the raging storm. The shields are vital, but they come with a cost. With a construction of this size, the Emperor demands taxes to keep your base running.</em></p>
<p><em>You will construct grand bases. And in Dune: Awakening, you will have the option to share them with others if you choose. All your creations can be recorded as blueprints. These can be shared with allies or even bought and sold on the Exchange. Anyone holding a blueprint can instantly</em><br>
<em>place a projection of the entire building and construct an exact copy for themselves. Dune: Awakening's building system allows for limitless creativity.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>The trailer also shows off some truly impressive bases. In the press beta test, there wasn't anywhere near enough time to build something so grand, but I still got a glimpse at the very solid building system. After <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-beta-impressions-desert-survival/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">playing several hours of the game</a>, my doubts certainly lie elsewhere.</p>
<p>If you wish to learn more about Dune: Awakening's crafting, building, and other features, Funcom held a more than two-hour-long developer live stream yesterday. The YouTube recording can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_k0389iSNIw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>
<p>Dune: Awakening launches on June 10 for PC after <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-has-been-delayed-to-june-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a slight delay</a>. A large-scale beta test will take place between May 9 and May 12, during which many players will be able to test it out before the release.</p>
