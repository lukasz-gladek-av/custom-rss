An <a href="https://www.meta.com/blog/quest/parent-approved-contacts-for-preteens/">upcoming change</a> will let parents individually approve each user their 10- to 12-year-old can call, chat with, and join VR experiences with on Quest. Previously, Meta didn’t allow kids in that age range to use chats, make calls, or invite others to games.</p><p>Last year, Meta <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/16/23763812/meta-quest-headset-lower-age-10-years-old">lowered the minimum age</a> for kids who can use its Quest headsets from 13 to 10 years old. Kids in this age range must get parental approval to create a Meta account for the headset, which their parents will have control over. Meta also doesn’t show ads to these accounts by default and will only recommend games and apps appropriate to their age.</p><p>The change comes as the federal government ramps up scrutiny of child safety on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat, and Discord. In February, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/1/24057460/senators-confront-meta-tiktok-snap-x-discord-ceos-kids-online-harm">Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg</a> appeared before the Senate during a hearing and has since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/29/24144333/meta-record-lobbying-q1-2024-us-government-big-tech">spent millions on lobbying</a> while the government mulls bills on online <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/29/24086559/kids-online-safety-act-schatz-tech-groups">child safety</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We haven't written nearly enough about Fallout London, a gargantuan <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> total conversion that takes place in a whole new map based on England's capital city - the Big Smoke and/or Great Wen, whose real-life incarnation probably harbours at least one nuke at any given moment, though I haven't asked the King about that lately. Best not speculate.</p>
<p>Anyway, Fallout London is a huge effort from modders Team Folon that was recently sabotaged when Bethesda <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bethesda-update-fallout-4-for-your-next-generation-pc">treated Fallout 4 to a next gen update</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-fallout-tv-show-gave-the-fallout-games-a-huge-player-bump-as-everyone-remembers-they-like-fallout">capitalise on the Amazon TV show's popularity</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-waiting-years-for-its-next-gen-update-fallout-4-is-already-getting-another-patch-next-week">rendering several mods incompatible and breaking a lot of stuff</a>. Team Folon have now fiddled with the workings and <a href="https://x.com/TeamFOLON/status/1809555735681913115">sent a Fallout London build to GOG for QA testing</a>, which suggests that release is imminent. The catch, however, is that you will need to downgrade your copy of Fallout 4 to play the mod, because even with Team Folon's last-minute adjustments, Fallout 4 next gen and Fallout London simply don't get on.</p><!--more-->

<p>As such, Fallout London will ship with its very own installer and downgrader.  "GOG have been amazing through all of this," project lead Dean 'Prilladog' Carter explained on the game's Discord this week, via <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-devs-confirm-need-to-downgrade-fallout-4-next-gen-version-not-stable-enough">VG247</a>. "To be honest, we've been the ones causing them the issue. What with us having things break due to the next-gen [update] and then needing the 3rd parties to update, then waiting for them to be fixed, only for the fact that at the 11th hour we've discovered that the next-gen [version of Fallout 4], even after updates, isn't stable enough and thus we are now going out on the old version - [hence] the need for a downgrader."</p>
<p>While I think the scale of the backlash to Fallout 4's "next gen" revamp was perhaps <em>slightly</em> exorbitant, as is often the case with backlashes, Fallout London seems worth the downgrade. It's said to be around the size of the main game's Commonwealth map and Far Harbor DLC combined, and spans the capital’s boroughs from Camden to Croydon, Westminster to Hackney.</p>
<p>You'll get to fight Super-Mutants or local equivalent on the Tower Bridge, and comb the Houses of Parliament for skeleton tableau, no political metaphors detected. Everyday sights and sounds will include pubs, tube stations, red phoneboxes and buses. A very British apocalypse. I've recently moved to just outside London, where there is minimal nitrogen dioxide or Cockney rhyming slang - this is as good a way as any to walk those streets again.</p>

However, much of the <em>Overwatch 2 </em>community thinks this latest update is a major overcorrection, with some calling it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/necros_ow/status/1810761112016802298&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/necros_ow/status/1810761112016802298" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the worst balance patch</a></span> the game has ever received.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195460" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="195460,196880,196049" data-current="195460"><div><p>Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20938.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h118210"><a id=""></a><strong>Is <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s season 11 patch the worst it’s ever had?</strong></h2><p>The July 9 <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/patch-notes/live/2024/07/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/patch-notes/live/2024/07/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">patch notes</a></span> have extensive comments for all 12 of the tank heroes that contextualize their individual adjustments, but each already benefits from sweeping changes to role passives. The damage role passive, which reduced incoming healing effectiveness when damage heroes were attacking an enemy, has been nerfed against tank heroes. The mechanic, which was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-9-balance-patch-passive-healing-hp-1851235801&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-9-balance-patch-passive-healing-hp-1851235801">added in season 9</a></span>, has been a consistent thorn in tanks’ sides and was a key part of why they lost some survivability. The passive will now only reduce healing by 10 percent, rather than the original 20. Had that been the extent of the changes, the tank role might be okay after this latest patch—But the individual buffs for each tank have made the role so powerful that the community fears the entire dynamic of an <em>Overwatch 2</em> match is going to shift.</p><p>Rather than go through each change individually, let’s focus on the best example of how the patch broke tanks: Mauga. The hero has been fairly dominant after his <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-mauga-season-8-patch-notes-1851029011&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-mauga-season-8-patch-notes-1851029011">shaky introduction</a></span> last year, and he’s received some of the most significant changes in the patch. His Cardiac Overdrive ability, which allows him to heal himself as long as he’s doing damage, now allows him to heal at the equivalent of his damage output during those three seconds. This means he’s capable of tanking through even the most powerful setups. Here’s an example from @KingHydron using Bastion turret form with Mercy’s damage boost and Baptiste’s Amplification Matrix, which, by all accounts should melt anything in the game almost instantly, only for Mauga to survive through it.</p><p>He can also basically ignore high-damage ultimates like Roadhog’s just by doing damage to the enemy tank while in Cardiac Overdrive.</p><p>Not every tank has changes that result in ridiculous viral videos like that one, but it’s clear that Blizzard has beefed them up across the board. Each tank is now the bulkiest version of themselves, and it feels like the natural endgame of switching to the 5v5 format of one tank, two damage, and two support heroes. On top of cutting what was once a 12-player game into a 10-player game, <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s pivot to a one-tank team composition has been divisive since the sequel launched in 2022, as it put a lot of responsibility on the solo tank to provide defense and take up space, and the healers to keep them upright. <em>Overwatch 2 </em>funnels most of its resources into its singular tank and it feels like all other roles are essentially assisting a kaiju match.</p><p>While tanks got the most attention this patch, there are a few other grievances fans have with the latest update. DPS hero Pharah, who has been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-pharah-meta-season-11-patch-notes-nerf-buff-1851572626&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-pharah-meta-season-11-patch-notes-nerf-buff-1851572626">frustrating fans in recent seasons</a></span>, got a few changes that ultimately didn’t address problems people have with the hero. One of the most reliable counters to her, Cassidy, was nerfed, which will only make her more of a prominent pick. So while the tank changes are considered an overcorrection, other issues have gone unaddressed in some of the community’s eyes.</p><h2 id="h118211"><a id=""></a><strong>The <em>Overwatch 2 </em>community is divided on how to fix the tank problem</strong></h2><p>While the negative reaction has been immediate and very loud, It’s important to note that the <em>Overwatch 2</em> community is full of contrasting opinions.

At least give it a week before saying this is the worst patch of all time.”</p><p>The conversation shows just how divided the <em>Overwatch </em>community is—. some believe giving tanks survivability will help the role, while others say Blizzard’s move to 5v5 structure is fundamentally flawed.</p><p>“The common sentiment was that tank sucked to play not that tank needed massive buffs,” Phasmamain wrote. “Tank has never been a weak role it’s just been an unfun one because you are taking the brunt of all damage and abilities and expected to take space for your team to make plays. Instead of gigabuffing tanks and causing more power creep they needed to tone down some of the things that countered tanks. Blizzard have become deathly afraid of nerfing things and it’s really hurting the game overall.”</p><p>Game director Aaron Keller posted on X, formerly Twitter <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/aaronkellerOW/status/1806793128537637183&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/aaronkellerOW/status/1806793128537637183" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on June 28</a></span> that he planned to talk about the team’s point of view on the original 6v6 format in a future Director’s Take blog or Developer Update video. Many fans have been clamoring for Blizzard to bring back a second tank since <em>Overwatch 2 </em>launched, while some believe Keller’s post suggests 6v6 might be returning. I fear that people are getting ahead of themselves. 6v6 may not have had the same problems as 5v5, but banking on a two-tank structure fixing all <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s problems is a bit myopic. Lest we forget that would no doubt bring us back to the much-maligned Double Shield Meta. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2139460/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, Once Human has achieved a significant milestone by reaching its highest concurrent player count of 123,957 (at the time of writing). Its impressive number indicates a strong initial interest in the co-op shooter, as the game has successfully surpassed the 120,000-player mark within its first day of release. The widespread attention garnered by Once Human on its launch day raises anticipation about the possibility of attracting an even more significant player base throughout its launch week.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-once-human-nbsp">What is Once Human?&nbsp;</h2>



<p>Once Human is set in a post-apocalyptic world infested by an alien creature known as Stardust, where humanity, animals, and plants have been greatly affected, as a meta-human who has somehow survived the contamination, you can harness Stardust’s power. Players have the choice to embark on this world-saving journey alone or call their friends for help. Uncovering the truth will be a challenging and lengthy process; players must survive in the wilderness, engage with some of the most dangerous monsters, customize weapons, and establish their territory.</p>

                <p>Riot Games reportedly shut down a Super Smash Bros. Melee-style game set in the League of Legends universe, codenamed Pool Party.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/riot-games-pool-party-canceled-smash-melee" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ReaderGrev</a>, a newsletter by former Launcher editor Mikhail Klimentov, Pool Party was canceled due to the reassessment of consumer interest in a Super Smash Bros. competitor. Riot executives were reportedly worried about MultiVersus, the Smash Bros. competitor that featured Warner Bros. characters and how it didn't seem as nearly as successful.</p><p>Pool Party's concept was reportedly also changed several times during development. Initially starting out as a hardcore fighting game, more casual mechanics and party-game elements were introduced later on. Due to the constant changes, some Riot employees reportedly became frustrated.</p><p>There were 70-80 developers reportedly working on Pool Party, and about half of them were offered different positions within Riot Games after its cancelation, while others were looking at other jobs internally. However, 10 employees were reportedly neither given offers nor were looking internally for new roles, and presumably either left Riot or were let go.</p><p>Riot Games has been expanding the League of Legends universe and creating spin-offs. Currently, Riot is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/league-of-legends-fighting-spin-off-project-l-now-called-2xko-launches-in-2025/1100-6521282/" data-ref-id="1100-6521282">creating 2XKO, a 2D fighter</a> in the same vein as Granblue Fantasy Versus and Dragon Ball FighterZ. It is due out sometime in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/training-the-game-designers-of-tomorrow-part-2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the first part of this series of publications devoted to training game and level designers, I discussed the importance of soft skills, essential complements to know-how. I presented two skills that are essential to me. In this second part, I present two others to you.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Soft skills 3 - Know how to explain your ideas and promote them">Soft skills 3 - Know how to explain your ideas and promote them</h2><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Salesmanship">Salesmanship</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In theory, the game designer or creative director is responsible for designing the game mechanics. He or she is supposed to propose to them and develop the design documents. The rest of the team must develop the game based on these documents.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In an ideal world, things seem simple: The game designer, like Father Moses on his mountain, “dictates” the design, and the team carefully executes it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But in the real life of a game designer, it doesn’t happen like that. He or she must constantly defend his or her proposals; these can be misunderstood or questioned at any time, including months after being presented to the team!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For what? The causes can be multiple.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As shocking as it sounds, the truth is that only some on a team read design documents correctly or pay attention during presentations. The consequences can then be multiple: A mechanism can be poorly implemented, a design error “goes under the radar” when it could have been corrected immediately, team members can develop assets on their own, or features can be incompatible with the design team's intentions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A final cause is the arrival of new members in the team during its development. Indeed, it will take a lot of time for them to familiarize themselves in depth with the project. Some have preconceived ideas or want to remake the game according to their tastes! It’s even worse when the newcomer is an executive, a project manager, for example, because they have significant decision-making powers. Re-explaining the game to them is not always enough.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To prevent these unwanted situations, here are some best practices.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Good practices">Good practices</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Introduce a new mechanism to the team orally, not by sending them a document and asking them to read it.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you simply send the description of a new mechanism through a written document, some people will postpone reading it until later; others will only understand some things or even read it! On the other hand, an oral presentation will be much more effective because you may be asked for explanations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Introduce a new game mechanic to the team in a simple way.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you present all the mechanism details, you will “drown” your interlocutors, and they risk not retaining the essentials. And if they do not understand your mechanism, they will not adhere to it. So, keep it simple!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Use as many diagrams as possible.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A drawing is always more effective than a text. Explaining your new mechanism with diagrams will take more preparation time, but it will be worth it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Justify your design choices using facts.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Your game design title doesn't guarantee that the rest of the team will trust your choices with their eyes closed. To support your point of view, support it with examples from games that are benchmarks in their field.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Don’t hesitate to spell out the basics.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many design choices are based on knowledge that only some share. For example, only some know that very long-term retention is one of the success factors of a free-to-play game. If you use such a mechanic for your game but people need to be aware of its importance, they may find your mechanic unnecessarily complex.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Prepare and maintain a document describing high-level design choices.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This document will be used when new members join the team.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Case study">Case study</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Like my previous publication, I will illustrate the importance of mastering this skill by describing a situation I witnessed or experienced. Of course, the names are fictitious to preserve the anonymity of each person.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Terry is the sole game designer in a large team working on an action-adventure game. As the game experience focuses on narrative and level design, Terry is also in charge of writing the level design of each room.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Terry writes very detailed documents for each room, describing their content and all the actions that will occur there. But that's not all: Due to the storyline, most rooms will be visited several times by players, and each time, the room's contents change. As a result, Terry must write complex design documents that describe each room at different stages.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>This represents immense work, indeed too much for one person. Terry, therefore, simply sends his level design documents to the new lead level designer who has just joined the team. After all, if he has the slightest question, she is convinced he will return to her!</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>But, the lead designer needs to gain experience.

But what does this have to do with professional success?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In short, professional success is often associated with “human” success, with the ability to create solid and authentic bonds with colleagues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why is this so important?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/10/who-is-emio-nintendo-tease-new-switch-horror-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo are either teasing a new horror game for Nintendo Switch, or taking one of the more unusual directions for a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> reveal, with the release of a creepy new teaser trailer:</p>
<p><iframe title="Emio" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Hq_NGMM2FWE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>So who, or what, is Emio? Well, per <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/07/nintendo-releases-mysterious-emio-teaser-trailer">Gematsu</a>, the trailer in Japan is titled “The Smiling Man”, while US and EU regional accounts have titled it “Emio”, though that doesn’t really answer the question.</p>
<p>The Japanese video also links to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/switch/emio/index.html">this teaser website</a>.</p>
<p>So… who wants some baseless speculation?</p>

<p>There’s obviously some jokes to be made that Nintendo could be taking a very PlayStation 2 direction for the reveal of their next console:</p>
<p><iframe title="PlayStation 2 advert: Welcome To The Third Space | 2000 | #20YearsOfPlay" width="780" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Laf9vpJMDjA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Alternatively, this is a gritty reboot of the Luigi’s Mansion series, despite the popularity of the games with their original family friendly form of spookiness.</p>
<p>But we’d put our money on something completely different. Nintendo doesn’t have the greatest history with horror games themselves, with just a few notable exceptions. It was really during the Nintendo GameCube era that the Japanese company tried to shake off the reputation as being exclusively about kids and family friendly games. During that time Nintendo published Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem by Silicon Knights (who shut down in 2014), and penned the exclusivity deal with Capcom for the GameCube exclusivity of the Resident Evil, Resident Evil Zero and Resident Evil 4.</p>
<p>All of that is to say, this is definitely <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/02/capcom-confirms-the-next-resident-evil-is-coming-from-resident-evil-7-director/">Resident Evil 9</a> and it’s a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive.</p>
<p>Or maybe not.</p>
<p>I don’t know.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/once-human-review-bomb-prompts-publisher-to-address-privacy-concerns.923784/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/once-human-review-bomb-privacy-netease-response<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Once Human</em>, a new post-apocalyptic free-to-play game, is being review-bombed by concerned players over what they perceive to be an overly invasive privacy policy, prompting a response from publisher NetEase.</p>
<p>A quick look at the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139460/Once_Human/#app_reviews_hash" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam review page</a> shows an abundance of negative reviews, many of them pointing to the game's privacy policy (although some are simply criticizing the game's mechanics and content).</p>
<p>One user <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/dShmoni/recommended/2139460/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">describes</a> what they see as the "over-collection of personal information" and "security risks", while another <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197971480044/recommended/2139460/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">says</a> they "nope[d] the hell out and exited" after reading&nbsp;<em>Once Human</em>'s terms of service.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/once-human-privacy-concerns-review-bomb-bow.jpg?itok=RrAzHdie 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/once-human-privacy-concerns-review-bomb-bow.jpg?itok=Ze-XNoMi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Post-apocalyptic survival game&nbsp;<em>Once Human&nbsp;</em>is racking up a lot of negative reviews right now.</figcaption></figure><p>In a <a href="https://www.oncehuman.game/news/update/20240710/40780_1166424.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new FAQ</a> on&nbsp;the official&nbsp;<em>Once Human&nbsp;</em>website, publisher NetEase responds to players' concerns by describing how it uses the data it collects and attempting to allay fears regarding the collection of unnecessary information.</p>
<p>NetEase says it "only collect[s] and use[s] personal data according to specific purposes". For instance, the studio says it would only "collect government-issued IDs" if local laws required it to, pointing to prize distribution, the need to identify a user's parent for consent, or if a user "wishes to correct their age information".</p>
<p>The publisher also clarifies that the "Chinese named program" running in the background of&nbsp;<em>Once Human</em>&nbsp;is a WebView Helper, which "supports WebView page rendering" within the game.</p>
<p>Lastly, NetEase says that it's not necessary to download the NetEase Launcher if you're playing <em>Once Human</em> on Steam or the Epic Store, although it is needed if you've downloaded the game through NetEase's official website.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/once-human-privacy-concerns-review-bomb-monument.jpg?itok=YVId16_v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/once-human-privacy-concerns-review-bomb-monument.jpg?itok=Rgx_3yYe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>NetEase has attempted to quell&nbsp;<em>Once Human</em>&nbsp;privacy concerns.</figcaption></figure><p>Whether or not NetEase's assurances do anything to allay users' fears about privacy remains to be seen, but it's not the only weirdness surrounding&nbsp;<em>Once Human&nbsp;</em>right now.</p>
<p>Yesterday, just before&nbsp;<em>Once Human</em>'s launch, NetEase revealed that players would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/once-human-faq-one-character">only be able to create a single character per account at launch</a>, with multi-character creation support arriving sometime in August.</p>
<p>However, after players criticized this decision, NetEase almost immediately reversed it, announcing yesterday that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2139460/view/4230650600759863513" rel="noopener" target="_blank">multi-character creation was now possible</a>.</p>
<p>I'm not entirely sure why NetEase decided to restrict character creation in the first place. In the aforementioned FAQ, the studio says this decision was made "due to technical issues", but the fact that it was so easy to reverse casts an uneasy light on the whole matter.</p>
<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Once Human</em>&nbsp;is available to play right now for free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139460/Once_Human/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and mobile devices, assuming that you can stomach its privacy policy.</p>

            <p>Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka wants to know why the hell Sonic Team haven’t made their own Sonic The Hedgehog <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> yet. He sounds positively hysterical about it, hopping mad, which you know, mate, you’ve been running the show since 2008. You’ve been working on Sonic games since <em>1994</em>. I too yearn to bound through the Star Post portal and into a world where Sonic has to min-max his trainers and do companion quests for Big The Cat. The spinning ball of spines is in your court, Iizuka-san. The people of Mobius are ready. Mario has had that genre all to himself for long enough.</p><!--more-->
<p>Iizuka made these innocent remarks during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNeWQbiawnk">a Good Vibes Gaming interview</a> at a Sonic x Shadow Generations preview event - this being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/keanu-reeves-to-play-shadow-in-the-sonic-3-movie-as-sega-announce-the-year-of-shadow">the year of Shadow</a>. They were subsequently pounced upon by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-team-head-wants-to-make-a-sonic-rpg-before-he-retires-from-sega">Eurogamer</a>’s Ed Nightingale, who notes that Sonic Team have worked on RPGs in the past, such as Phantasy Star Universe, and as such, have no excuses save boring commercial ones.</p>
<p>"Personally, I really like role-playing games," he said. "The RPG game format is a lot of fun and I've even thought to myself you know, for the past 30 years we haven't done a Sonic RPG. And I'm questioning myself. Why haven't we done a Sonic RPG in all this time? How have we gotten to 30 years with no RPGs?!" </p>
<p>"So I'd like to hopefully work on a Sonic RPG at some point before I retire from Sega,” Iizuka went on. “But you know, that's just a dream right now. There are no concrete plans at this point." Again, Mr Iizuka, I must loom sinisterly and remind you that you are the head of Sonic Team. Make those plans concrete. Yes, I know it’s more complicated than this, I know <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sega-cancel-hyenas-and-several-unannounced-games-due-to-covid-era-losses">Sega aren’t in the mood for passion projects at the moment</a>, but come now - the only extant official Sonic RPG is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_Chronicles%3A_The_Dark_Brotherhood">a third-party project for Nintendo DS</a>, which I’m not allowed to write about or Graham will break my knees.</p>
<p>I want a Sonic Team-made Sonic RPG for exactly two reasons: I think it might be great, and I think it might be awful. Sonic games have a habit of veering in either direction, especially those released after 2001, but perhaps those <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-mania">Mania</a> people fancy another bite of the apple. Either way, it’s an entertaining prospect. Gotta go fast? No Sonic, you gotta go after Tails has his turn, and also, you’re out of mana, so no spin-dash for you. It’s just as well that we have <a href="https://ethybb8-games.itch.io/sonic-rpg">Itch.io developers to fill the gap</a>.</p>

NBA Legend Vince Carter will be the cover star for the chunky NBA 2K25 Hall of Fame Edition.</p><p>Ball Over Everything is the slogan for NBA 2K25, which puts an NBA and WNBA player on the same cover for the first time ever. Tatum called his appearance on the cover "humbling" even after winning the NBA Championship with the Boston Celtics, while back-to-back WNBA champion, two-time WNBA Most Valuable Player, and six-time WNBA All-Star Wilson said her appearance is a testament to the women's league's growth.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>NBA 2K25 Covers and First Look</h3></div></output><p>"Being featured on the NBA 2K25 cover is a big moment for me and a testament to the ever-growing fandom of the WNBA," she said. "Seeing more and more WNBA athletes scanned into NBA 2K25 to best capture the style and confidence of the league has been empowering, and I can't wait for fans to experience it in-game."</p><p>NBA 2K25 promises the usual MyCAREER and MyTEAM modes on all platforms, though PS5 and Xbox Series X and S, and PC players will gain access to additional features too. This includes "a sixth era in MyNBA, a more compact and interactive City, the chance to cement their G.O.A.T. status in The W," and cross-play.</p><p>The Standard Edition of NBA 2K25 has Tatum on the cover and costs $69.99 on all platforms except Nintendo Switch, where it's available for $59.99. The WNBA Edition is a GameStop exclusive and is a repackaged version of the PS5 and Xbox Series X and S physical editions with Wilson on the cover, available for $69.99.</p><p>The All-Star Edition has both aforementioned athletes on the front, costs $99.99, and comes with 100,000 VC; MyTEAM content including 10 Player Cards (and three above 89 OVR), 3 Diamond Shoe Cards, 3 Takeover Boost, and 1 Amethyst Coach Card; and MyCAREER content including 150 Skill Boosts, 75 Gatorade Boosts, the Jayson Tatum Cover Jersey, Jayson Tatum Electric Skateboard Skin, and a 2K25 Cover Stars Design T-Shirt.</p><p>Finally, the Hall of Fame Edition has Carter on the front is available with limited availability until September 8 for $149.9 for all platforms except the Nintendo Switch. It includes everything included in the All-Star Edition plus a MyCAREER Vince Carter Cover Jersey, a Season 1 Pro Pass with four upfront Pro Pass rewards, and a 12 month subscription to the real world NBA League Pass.</p><p>NBA 2K is the only mainline basketball franchise available but has faced criticism over its intrinsic microtransactions and in recent years over its forced open world elements. NBA 2K25 appears to be addressing one of those complaints with the "more compact and interactive city" on PS5, Xbox Series, and PC.</p><p>In our 6/10 review of the last game, IGN said: "NBA 2K24 scores big with gameplay, but its microtransaction tactics feel like a costly turnover."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

The VR remake will be coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PSVR 2</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest 2 and 3</a>, and SteamVR, and there’s a new trailer delving into some of the characters and time periods you’ll run through:</p>
<p><iframe title="Wanderer: The Fragments of Fate  | Icons &amp; Eras Deep Dive" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PEeE922BMXg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>A remake of the 2022 game Wanderer – a bit odd, but Mighty Eyes clearly felt that there was more they could do with the same core – The Fragments of Fate blends together first person exploration and combat with time-travelling puzzles and possibilities, throwing you (as Asher Newman) into a quest to save the world.</p>
<p>The trailer shows how Boston in 2061 has been turned into a flooded swamp, where you’ll have to fight past bandits to reach Asher’s grandfather’s apartment with a quirky looking watch that will become your time travel AI buddy.&nbsp;Like Quantum Leap, each time jump with thrust you into another person’s body, the first jump putting you in the boots of Neil Armstrong in 1969, though with the moon landing having gone rather wrong. From there you’ll reach an ancient Mayan landscape in the 1500s.</p>
<p>Wanderer: The Fragments of Fate will sometimes have you explore the same locations in different time periods, or the same place and time as different people. Naturally, your actions will alter time and change what you see from different angles.</p>

<p>The game was announced for PSVR 2 back in February with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/23/zombie-army-vr-the-wizards-wanderer-the-fragments-of-fate-and-more-announced-for-psvr-2/">a much more action oriented trip to WW2</a>, grabbing guns out of your inventory, it shows the breadth and variety of what Wanderer: The Fragments of Fate will offer. At that point, the game was set for a 27th June release, but developer Mighty Eyes has now twice pushed the launch back, first to September, and now to 31st October 2024.</p>
<p>As a remake, Mighty Eyes has also decided to offer a 20% discount to owners of Wanderer from PlayStation VR and SteamVR.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/indie-co-op-hit-we-were-here-forever-passes-one-million-sales.923739/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/we-were-here-forever-sales<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Total Mayhem Games has announced that&nbsp;<em>We Were Here Forever&nbsp;</em>sales have reached a million since the game's launch all the way back in May 2022.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/WeWereHereGame/status/1810916968624508959" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, the developer celebrates the new milestone, pledging to "continue making awesome games for you &amp; for more Explorers to join us along the way".</p>
<p>As <a href="https://nl.linkedin.com/in/bramvanlith?trk=public_post_feed-actor-name" rel="noopener" target="_blank">noted by PR exec Bram van Lith</a>, who's worked with Total Mayhem on a number of&nbsp;<em>We Were Here&nbsp;</em>games, this marks the third game in the&nbsp;<em>We Were Here&nbsp;</em>series to cross the million mark, which is pretty impressive for a humble little series of indie co-op puzzlers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/we-were-here-forever-sales-snow.jpg?itok=vLut_iqB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/we-were-here-forever-sales-snow.jpg?itok=xXY9UERo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>We Were Here Forever&nbsp;</em>is the third game in the series to break a million sales.</figcaption></figure><p>Technically, van Lith doesn't say which other two games in the series crossed the million barrier, but it's likely that the other two are&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/we-were-here-too-review-cooperation-required">We Were Here Too</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chilly-co-op-adventure-we-were-here-together-launches-october-10th"><em>We Were Here Together</em></a>.</p>
<p>The first game in the series,&nbsp;<em>We Were Here</em>, is free, and the latest,&nbsp;<em>We Were Here Expeditions: The FriendShip</em>, was given away for free for the first month or so of its release, so the sales figures are unlikely to apply to those games (although it's not impossible).</p>
<p>As of October last year, however, the entire series had <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/the-we-were-here-franchise-gave-away" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sold a combined total of almost five million units</a>, so it's generally been a very successful run indeed for Total Mayhem. Here's hoping the next game, whatever it turns out to be, continues this hot streak.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/we-were-here-together-bar.jpg?itok=oA0f1Kow 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/we-were-here-together-bar.jpg?itok=o1YaaY9H 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>We Were Here&nbsp;</em>series is a very successful one indeed.</figcaption></figure><p><em>We Were Here Forever&nbsp;</em>is the fourth game in the&nbsp;<em>We Were Here&nbsp;</em>series, which began back in 2017 with&nbsp;<em>We Were Here</em>.</p>
<p><em>Forever&nbsp;</em>sees players teaming up to explore a castle in order to solve puzzles and hopefully escape. Puzzles are designed around co-op, and since both players have limited information, there's no split-screen co-op mode; instead, you'll use walkie-talkies to communicate with your partner remotely.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>We Were Here Forever&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1341290/We_Were_Here_Forever/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10002430/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/we-were-here-forever/9PH2TSF7M48X" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.

And later this year, there will be a handful of price increases for various tiers. Here's the exact text as it is presented on <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/manage-subscriptions/game-pass-updates-july-2024">Microsoft's website</a>.</p>



<p>The new Xbox Game Pass Standard tier for new members will be $15 a month and will not include access to Day One releases, EA Play, Game Pass for PC, and cloud gaming.</p>

<p>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, which includes access to all the bonuses now not included in the Standard tier is increasing its price from $17 a month to $20.</p>

<p>Xbox Game Pass Core, which offers online access and a much smaller library of curated games, is changing its yearly from $60 to $75. The $10 monthly price for that tier, however, will remain unchanged.</p>

<p>PC Game Pass is increasing from $10 per month to $12, but that tier will still include Day One releases.</p>

<p>All of these price changes will be reflected starting on September 12.</p>

<p>Price changes for services you already pay for are always frustrating. What do you think of the change? Do you plan on maintaining your subscription? Or is it time to cancel?</p>

			<p>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim continues to be an impressive game even over ten years since its original launch, mostly thanks to the work of modders who have improved gameplay mechanics and visuals considerably over the years.</p>
<p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalDreamsyt" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Dreams</a> shared today a new video showcasing how the fifth entry in the series by Bethesda can look in 2024 with a vast selection of mods, over 3100 mods, including the Complete RT shader by <a href="https://www.patreon.com/NiceGuy147" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NiceGuy</a>, an advanced screen space ray tracing shader that lets users add global illumination with effects like Diffuse Illumination and Specular Reflection, ambient occlusion, and glossy reflections to any game.</p>
<p><iframe title="[4K60] Skyrim Ultra Modded graphics 3100+Mods - Wunduniik Modlist with Complete Raytracing" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y1NZ1O3csXw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With Bethesda hard at work on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-officially-in-early-development-but-you-wont-hear-any-more-about-it-for-some-time/">sixth entry in the series</a>, it is unlikely we are going to see a proper The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim remake that will take advantage of modern technology to present the game's world like never before. The game, however, is already in a better spot than when it was released, as it was remastered back in 2016 with the Special Edition, which includes the base game, all of the expansions, remastered art and effects, volumetric god rays, dynamic depth of field, screen-space reflections, and more. Another version of the game, the Anniversary Edition, was launched in 2021 to celebrate the game's 10th anniversary with new content and some gameplay tweaks.</p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, Xbox 360 and Nintendo Switch.</p>

That’s next year! Having already waited well over two years, another five months feels too much.

Season 1 wrapped up with a lot of cliffhangers about the future of the severance program and the workers who are a part of it, but the season 2 teaser puts them right back in the office. With all the memory shenanigans, it’s possible season 2 could pick up with characters having no memory of the final moments of the first season. </p><p>Hopefully musician SZA is happy to know when she can watch the second season, even if it isn’t “right the fuck now” as she had begged for in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.complex.com/music/a/tracewilliamcowen/sza-ben-stiller-severance-season-two?d_id=7623969&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.complex.com/music/a/tracewilliamcowen/sza-ben-stiller-severance-season-two?d_id=7623969" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media post this May</a></span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/10/vr-pvp-shooter-frenzies-announced-for-psvr-2-meta-quest-by-ndreams/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>VR specialists at nDreams and developer Near Light have revealed Frenzies, a new virtual reality multiplayer shooter that embraces chaos and showing off in the combat arena. Frenzies is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PSVR 2</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/meta-quest-3">Meta Quest</a>.</p>
<p>A closed alpha test will kick off on 18th July on Quest – sign up via the game’s <a href="https://discord.gg/frenziesvr">Discord</a> – with more details on the game to come in the months ahead.</p>
<p><iframe title="FRENZIES ANNOUNCE TRAILER | nDREAMS | META QUEST &amp; PS VR2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Lw4S8zu9kw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Frenzies will look to build upon the rich pedigree of precision FPS gunplay found within games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/08/19/fracked-review-psvr-shooter/">Fracked</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/29/synapse-review-psvr2/">Synapse</a> by nDreams, though Frenzies is in development by their 2022 acuisition, Shooty Fruity developer Near Light.</p>
<p>What Frenzies hopes to capture is the chaotic PvP gameplay that has made games like Gorilla Tag so popular in VR. Making that happen is a ‘lucky dip’ gameplay format, so the lobbies of 12 players shift between different maps, game mode types that create and break up alliances, and swapping to and from free-for-all and team play. Fast and fluid VR movement will combine with ziplines and grabbing onto cover to hide behind. At the end of it, your performances across five rounds will determine the winner.</p>

<p>However, it’s not just about winning, because you’ll want to look good doing it. Character models are all in hooded onesies with LED displays for faces, and you’ll naturally be able to customise your look, but then there’s all the free movement and posing of VR available to you for when you want to showboat and muck around. The 1:1 motion tracking and things like finger tracking on PSVR 2’s Sense controllers will allow for more varied gestures, and the trailer shows off moments where a player is captured and then… well, it’d be much more gruesome if they weren’t stylised characters, so it’s best not to think about it too much.</p>
<p>Near Light head of studio Paul Mottram on <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/10/ps-vr2-frenzies-revealed-new-metro-awakening-gameplay-details-wanderer-the-fragments-of-fate-in-depth-look/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation Blog</a>, “Right from when we first started working on Frenzies, we wanted it to have a real sense of fun. We didn’t want to create a straight-faced, military sim and instead took our inspiration from bombastic arena shooter classics such as Quake and Unreal Tournament. We felt that by taking the essence of those games and sprinkling in a dose of unpredictability, we’d landed on something that’s easy to play, challenging to master and leaves you with a big grin on your face every time. We think that there’s something for everyone in Frenzies and even experienced VR shooter fans will have their skills tested in new ways.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nba-2k25-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2K has announced the&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K25&nbsp;</em>release date, as well as the cover stars you can expect to see on the various different editions of the game. What's more, there's some good news for PC players this year as well.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://newsroom.2k.com/news/ball-over-everything-nbar-2k25-features-nba-champion-jayson-tatum-two-time-wnba-mvp-aja-wilson-and-hall-of-fame-legend-vince-carter-as-cover-athletes" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on its official website</a>, 2K confirms that the&nbsp;release date for&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K25&nbsp;</em>is September 6th, and that you'll be able to play it across PC, PlayStation, and Xbox.</p>
<p>The game's cover stars will be Jayson Tatum, who'll be appearing on&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K25</em>'s Standard Edition cover art; A'ja Wilson, who's the cover athlete for the All-Star and WNBA Editions; and Vince Carter, who's gracing the cover of the Hall of Fame Edition.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nba-2k25-release-date-cover-athletes.jpg?itok=H3FR1mI7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nba-2k25-release-date-cover-athletes.jpg?itok=TxSWobq1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here are your three&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K25&nbsp;</em>cover athletes.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're an&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K&nbsp;</em>PC player, you'll likely be aware of the series' history of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-nba-2k24-gameplay-trailer">releasing the last-gen versions of the game</a> on PC, but that practice apparently ends with&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K25</em>.</p>
<p>According to the aforementioned announcement post, the PC version of the game will be the "New-Gen" version this year, meaning it'll be equivalent to the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions rather than the PS4 and Xbox One versions.</p>
<p>That means you can expect the vaunted ProPLAY system in the PC version this time around, as well as modes like The W, which allows you to compete in the WNBA, and The City, an open-world hub with sidequests and other distractions.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, crossplay still isn't supported between PC and current-gen consoles, it seems. 2K says crossplay "will only be available on New-Gen consoles", so it sounds like the PC version isn't included.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nba-2k25-release-date-cover-athletes-box-art.jpg?itok=XqoYkyKH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nba-2k25-release-date-cover-athletes-box-art.jpg?itok=pcVHFLgQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>NBA 2K25&nbsp;</em>will have several different box art styles to choose from.</figcaption></figure><p>2K has yet to reveal the first&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K25&nbsp;</em>gameplay footage, but we do know the game will feature "a more compact and interactive" version of the City, as well as "the franchise's most true-to-life basketball experience yet".</p>
<p><em>NBA 2K25&nbsp;</em>launches on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox on September 6th. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Presumably this created enough confidence that the game was in the clear, such that console rival Sony would be prepared to get involved, albeit through an entirely different arm of the company.</p><p>And yet, well, we can all pretend that <em>Palworld</em> isn’t unbelievably obviously copying famous Pokémon, but <em>come on</em>. Releasing merch based on these animals is <em>surely</em> going to make the Big N’s wrath more likely? Yet, merchandize they shall, the new company teaming up with Japanese store <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.aniplexusa.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.aniplexusa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Aniplex</a></span>, for as-yet-unannounced products. They will be available “later on.”</p><p>It’s going to be interesting. I genuinely don’t understand how Nintendo will be able to continue sitting on its hands should Palworld Entertainment start selling a Bristla plushie on a store shelf next to one of Pokémon’s Bellossom. Or Jormuntide alongside Gyarados. Let alone the most infamous Grizzbolt and the near-identical Electabuzz. But clearly Sony Music and Pocketpair  feel sure it’s all legally sound.</p><figure id="" data-id="7e7ea8a6a192b793d8ed0fd039949cc7" data-recommend-id="image://7e7ea8a6a192b793d8ed0fd039949cc7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A bunch of comparisons of Pals and Pokemon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A bunch of comparisons of Pals and Pokemon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Palworld Wiki / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7e7ea8a6a192b793d8ed0fd039949cc7" data-recommend-id="image://7e7ea8a6a192b793d8ed0fd039949cc7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A bunch of comparisons of Pals and Pokemon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Well, good luck to all involved.

<p>Riot Games has canceled a 2D fighting game that was similar to Super Smash Bros, according to a new report from <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/riot-games-pool-party-canceled-smash-melee" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mikhail Klimentov</a>.</p>



<p>Known internally as “Pool Party”, the game was to be set in the League of Legends universe, and was being worked on by about “70-80 employees”. The game was canceled in May.</p>



<p>“Riot Games saw an opportunity to build and support the game’s esports scene — unlike Nintendo, which is notoriously hands-off and even hostile toward the Smash competitive ecosystem,” the report reads.</p>



<p>Klimentov’s sources said that the game’s cancelation happened because of a “reassessment of consumer appetite for a Smash competitor.” He added that Riot was “spooked” by the apparent failure of MultiVersus.</p>



<p>Pool Party was originally slated to be a “hardcore fighting game” before the game’s scope was changed to include party elements and a more casual feel. The report states that the changes had “frustrated” people on the project.</p>



<p>In a statement given to Klimentov, Riot senior communication director Joe Hixson said, “We always have a number of projects in various phases of R&amp;D, and spinning projects up and down happens multiple times a year.”</p>



<p>As far as the employees working on the game, at least half were moved to other projects within the company while others were looking to be moved to other projects or had left the company.</p>



<p>The development of Pool Part had no impact on Riot’s other fighting game 2XKO, the 2v2 fighting game scheduled for release in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-a-hot-topic-as-microsoft-hikes-xbox-game-pass-prices<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is a hot topic in the wake of Microsoft announcing it will increase the price of Xbox Game Pass and introduce a new standard tier which doesn't include day one releases.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-appears-to-be-getting-another-price-hike">Microsoft announced on July 9, 2024 that it's raising the price of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate worldwide</a> and specifically from $16.99 to $19.99 a month in the U.S. Price changes go into effect for new members on July 10, 2024 and for existing members on September 12, 2024.</p><p>The more basic $10.99 Xbox Game Pass Console tier is "soon" being replaced with Xbox Game Pass Standard too — a $14.99 option which doesn't include the beloved day one release feature, "specific entries to the Game Pass Ultimate library," access to EA Play, Xbox Cloud Gaming, perks, Quests, and discounts on games in the Game Pass library.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-series-x-and-game-pass-are-about-to-get-a-little-more-expensive">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate was last increased in price in 2023</a>, from $14.99 to $16.99, meaning paying $14.99 a month for Xbox Game Pass therefore nets users significantly less than it did just one year ago, with Microsoft essentially removing day one titles, EA Play, cloud gaming, and free perks from the service in that time.</p><p>But it's the lack of day one titles on the soon standard tier which has some fans most upset, especially as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-with-xbox-game-pass">Call of Duty will finally appear as an Xbox Game Pass title with 2024's Black Ops 6</a> following <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-69-billion-activision-blizzard-buyout-imminent-after-stock-halted-and-uk-clears-deal">Microsoft's $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a>.</p><p>Microsoft has been accused of lying about the status of Black Ops 6 on Xbox Game Pass, as in May 2024 the company confirmed it as a day one title and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-insists-it-wont-lock-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-behind-a-new-game-pass-tier-at-launch">made no indication players wouldn't be able to access it on their current subscriptions</a>.</p><p>"Upon launch, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be playable on Xbox and PC for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, and Xbox Game Pass for Console members," Microsoft said at the time.</p><p>This is true, however. Microsoft said Black Ops 6 will be available on Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, and Xbox Game Pass Console. But it didn't say the first two would see a price increase worldwide or that the final, cheapest tier would be made obsolete.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate Catalog</h3><p>This is the complete list of all Xbox Game Pass games. Log in to copy games, make your own rankings, or mark what games you're playing or have completed. Sort by "Recently Added" to see the newest additions to the catalog.</p></div><p>Microsoft couldn't even guarantee games like Black Ops 6 would come to Xbox Game Pass Standard eventually. These titles "may be added to the library at a future date," it said.</p><p>So the implication at the time that Black Ops 6 would be available through the $10.99 a month subscription is no longer true unless you're subscribed to that tier already, as new customers can't sign up for it. Instead of that $10.99, the cheapest Game Pass tier through which Xbox console players can now access Black Ops 6 is the bumped up Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, at $19.99 a month.</p><p>Fans are therefore a little frustrated, with many saying they plan to cancel their Xbox Game Pass subscriptions once their current run ends.</p><p>"No no, we're not changing Game Pass, we're not doing a price increase, putting Black Ops 6 on Game Pass hasn't change Game Pass pricing," mocked <a href="https://x.com/CODWarfareForum/status/1810926357913710862" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@CODWarfareForum</a> on X/Twitter. "Two months later: Oh yeah we lied again, we're increasing Game Pass subs and we're changing the tiers."</p><p>"Xbox Game Pass prices set to increase by 25%, just in time for the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 release," said <a href="https://x.com/GNGNewsCOD/status/1810908318098981232" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@GNGNewsCOD</a>. "Xbox Game Pass's new pricing is basically the 'Call of Duty day one tax' and it's getting seriously wild how expensive subscriptions are become for both PlayStation and Xbox," added <a href="https://x.com/SynthPotato/status/1810835932406276319" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@SynthPotato</a>. "It's now official despite previous reassurances the standard version of Xbox Game Pass will not include day one titles like the next Call of Duty, Doom, or Indiana Jones," said <a href="https://x.com/oliver_drk/status/1810811331861241886" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@oliver_drk</a>.</p><p>Others said they expected the release of Black Ops 6 to bump up Game Pass prices, though they're not necessarily happy about it. "Makes too much sense... incoming COD," said SnatcherHunter on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/windows-central-xbox-game-pass-is-getting-major-changes-new-%E2%80%98standard%E2%80%99-tier-option-for-new-members-with-no-day-one-games-price-increases.923187/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ResetEra</a>. "Day one COD doesn't sound so good now," said ChEmIcAl_KeEn on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xbox/comments/1dzedib/game_pass_ultimate_price_increase_coming_might_be/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>.</p><p>"I thought this would happen in September before Call of Duty. The monthly costs are adding up," said <a href="https://x.com/Otikage/status/1810872072853213288" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Otikag</a><a href="https://x.com/Otikage/status/1810872072853213288" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">e</a> on X/Twitter. "Price increase was expected though, all those studios to cater for. I am sure the price is just gonna keep going up with more acquisitions."</p><p>Rumors around a spike have circulated since May 2024, essentially since Microsoft announced Black Ops 6 would be coming as a day one title. The price rise also comes after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">Microsoft shut down entire studios</a> including Hi-Fi Rush and Ghostwire Tokyo developer Tango Gameworks and Redfall developer Arkane Austin.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
