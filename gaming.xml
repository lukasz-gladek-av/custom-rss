			<p>Japanese developer Monolith Soft is primarily known as the developer of the Xenoblade Chronicles series, but it also contributed to several The Legend of Zelda games, including 2011's Skyward Sword (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got an HD remaster on its tenth anniversary</a>) and, more recently, to 2017's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/breath-of-the-wild-greatest-legend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Breath of the Wild</a> and its sequel, 2023's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, both of which were highly acclaimed.</p>



<p>Yesterday, Nintendo <a href="https://www.monolithsoft.co.jp/interview/dev01/collab-talk.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted an interesting dual interview</a> featuring The Legend of Zelda General Manager Daiki Iwamoto and Monolith Soft Director Yasuhiro Fujita. In the conversation, the duo looked back on this special collaboration between Nintendo EPD and Monolith and, right at the end of the article, Iwamoto expressed the desire for the latter studio to play a 'central role' in 'creating the Zelda series from scratch'.</p>



<p><em>Monolith Soft now has a system in place that allows them to handle everything from coming up with ideas in the early stages of development to incorporating them into the actual game, so we expected them to be more involved in the creative aspects than ever before. [...]</em> <em>I would like Monolith Soft to play a central role as a strong partner in creating the Zelda series from scratch. I hope that the know-how we have cultivated through our work together will further enhance the overall team strength of Monolith Soft, and we will continue to create unique series titles together.</em></p>



<p>Fans took that to mean that Monolith might, in the future, become the lead developer of its own Zelda game, though Iwamoto's statement still refers to the team as a 'strong' partner, but a partner nonetheless. Whether that comes to pass remains to be seen. It may not be long before the studio headquartered in Meguro, Tokyo, unveils its next project. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/xenoblade-chronicles-3-aionios-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched in August 2022</a>, so it's been over three years; sure, there was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release of Chronicles X's Definitive Edition</a> in March 2025, but that was mostly a remaster that is unlikely to have taken up a lot of the studio's resources. </p>

            <p>Creative Assembly have taken us a little deeper into the biomechanical contours of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-40000">Total War: Warhammer 40,000</a>’s faction design, with a new development roundtable video featuring principal creative director Ian Roxburgh, lead designer Simon Mann and product owner for battles David Petry. </p>
<p>The short version: the starting faction balance is a question of both asymmetry and calculated familiarity. The Imperial Guard are for Total War traditionalists, with a straightforward emphasis on production and attrition. The Orks are comparably numerous, but they need to keep fighting or they’ll turn on each other, and have some unique capabilities based on repourposed tech. The Space Marines are all about precise usage of very small numbers of fanatical killing machines, with less capacity to build up an economy. And the Eldar are stealthy glass cannons operating out of remote Craftworld bases, who spend a lot of time trying to avert galactic calamities rather than just wrecking the other species.</p><!--more-->

<p>None of this will especially surprise a 40K enthusiast, I think, but it feels like a sturdy selection of playstyles, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/total-war-warhammer-40000-devs-detail-future-factions-and-when-you-can-expect-official-modding-tools">other factions (including Chaos Space Marines) to follow</a> presumably via either DLC or in the form of a sequel. The devs also spoke about the game’s overall campaign view/battlemap interplay, which is split across planets and hinges on reinforcement mechanics.</p><p>Here’s the key line from Mann about dem Spesh Meringues. “There’s not lots of them, so when you’re playing as them, you’re not fielding tens of thousands of troops, you’re fielding maybe a hundred, two hundred troops, but each one of those is worth a hundred of the enemies.” He added later: “You’ve got to make sure you’re measuring your losses, because you’re not building infrastructure, right? You’re not able to build new constructions in the same way as the other factions.”</p>
<p>The Imperial Guard/Astra Militarum (delete as per your hatred of Games Workshop’s current naming conventions) are the Total Warriest of the quartet, according to Mann. “There are lots of them, they are massed forces, regiments, there is artillery, there is front lines. It’s something you’d see as a very military faction, even down to their industrial complex, where they’re building industry on planets and developing them in order to fuel the machine and fund the development of more tanks and infantry.”</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Sega</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The Orks, meanwhile, are “a massed green tide of chaos and energy that’s charging across the battlefield, armed with metal sticks and axes and whatever they can jerry-rig together, rocket launchers on sticks! But also vehicles that they’ve repurposed from imperial scrap.” Petry interjected that “there are some parallels with the Astra Militarum, in that there are loads of them, they are building up resources, but they are are much more about building up momentum, and continuing to fight. It’s krumping with the lads, you know, it’s continuing to fight, and continuing to push forward a frontline, and making sure the boys don’t get bored and start fighting each other.” So yes, Ork waaagh mechanics are in.</p><p>Finally, there are the Aeldari/Eldar (delete as per etc etc etc). “They play totally differently to anything we’ve ever done in the past, I don’t think we’ve ever done anything quite like this,” Mann said. “They aren’t a faction that is built for massed combat. It’s not big armies fighting one another. Every loss for the Aeldari doesn’t get returned – their souls are getting taken away by the Chaos gods.”</p>
<p>Rather than forming frontlines, Eldar generals will use stealth, Webway gates and other exotic technologies to achieve objectives that go beyond conquest. “Your goals may actually be just, don’t allow this awful thing to happen,” Mann said. “Stop this calamity that could be occurring to the galaxy. Everyone else is still trying to kill you while you’re trying to do that, but you know what your mission is, and what you need to achieve, and you approach it with kind of grim determination.” </p>
<p>The Eldar have access to a Craftworld, which serves as “a kind of off-map setup piece, which is actually where you’re recruiting all your units,” Mann added. They’ll set up shrines to get access to more elite units. They’re a bit like the Space Marines, conceptually, but they are all “glass cannons”. So far, so Space Elf. “Every soul lost is a soul not returned, so you have to really pick your fights,” Mann cautioned.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Sega</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The campaign is organised around galactic hotspots called “crusade theatres” in which you’ll vie for possession of several planets. Planets are broken into regions. You’ll have fleets that can ferry troops between worlds, drop reinforcements and bombard the surface. There are also space anomalies to reckon with, but Creative Assembly have yet to reveal much about the Battlefleet <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gothic">Gothic</a> aspect of TwartyK, assuming there’s any naval combat at all. Oh, and you can blow planets up, though Imperium players will need “multiple layers of authorisation” to do this. I imagine Orks are less picky.</p><p>Creative Assembly stress that reinforcements are a key mechanic in battles, partly because it strengthens the connection between these clashes and your wider strategy and fleet movements. Again, though, the feel varies by the faction. Space Marines are all about tactical insertions, able to call in drop pods that smash buildings on impact. </p>
<p>The Astra Militarum are more straightforward and attrition-based. “The Guard have less ways of interjecting directly into the battlefield,” Petry said. “They might have to throw wave after wave of their own men up the battlefield in order to arrive before the last unit that is probably now flagging, maybe running away - to replace them in time and hold that line.” The Ork are comparable, but also have teleporters, and the Aeldari can use their Webway gates for subtler battlefield choreography.</p>

<p>The devs appear comfortable with the relative prominence of shootybangs in the 40K universe, inasmuch as they still think there’s plenty of scope for old-fashioned Total War melee. “It is science fantasy,” said Petry. “So there is so much fantasy wrapped into it. And when you think about the conflicts that go on – yes, there is cover, yes, there is a lot of ranged combat going on, but there’s also loads of punching! So much punching! And loads and loads of krumping that goes on! </p><p>“You really have a lot of melee going on in these battles. Lots of forces will mass up and crash into one another. Practically every unit has some combination of a thing they can shoot you with and a thing that they can punch you with. In some cases literally – power fists, right?”</p>
<p>I think all this sounds promising enough, but again, unsurprising. I'm most sold on the Eldar, inasmuch as I've always wanted my own Craftworld, I'm keen on the prospect of having strategic objectives besides the obliteration of people with rounded ears, and I like factions that coax me away from my instinct to amass a shieldwall you can see from orbit. They also have such great hair.</p>
<p>There’s no way this would happen, given the popularity of Spice Maureens, but I’d have liked them to save the Imperium for a sequel or expansion, and taken a risk on an all-xeno line-up. This is partly because given <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-play-a-fascist-unpacking-the-hideousness-of-the-space-marine">Warhammer 40,000’s tricksy relationship with real-life fascism</a>, I think it would be constructive to decentralise the weird theocratic humans. But also, Warhammer 40,000 games <em>always</em> start with Space Marines. Perhaps if the Space Marines showed up late to the party it would alter our understanding of them in an entertaining way?</p>

<p>Use these Roblox SpongeBob Tower Defense monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Shells, Cash and much more.</p>



<p>SpongeBob Tower Defense is a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-build-to-climb-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> game where players strategically place and upgrade towers to defend against waves of enemies inspired by the SpongeBob universe. While it might seem like a simple tower defense game, players need to carefully select and position different towers, manage their resources, and upgrade their defenses to withstand increasingly challenging enemy waves. The main objective is to unlock powerful towers, enhance their abilities, and survive as many waves as possible.</p>







<p>Progression in SpongeBob Tower Defense revolves around the game’s primary currency, shells and cash, which players earn by defeating enemies and completing waves. They can be spent on purchasing new towers, upgrading existing ones, and unlocking special abilities. Players can also obtain temporary boosters that increase coin earnings or tower effectiveness for a limited time. Although all of these rewards can be earned through normal gameplay, redeeming promo codes is one of the quickest ways to get ahead, as codes often grant free currency or boosts that allow players to progress faster without excessive grinding.</p>

<p>Nothing mid(field) about this</p>

<p>Just one month after launch, Level-5 has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inazuma_eleven_victory_road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a>'s <em>monster</em> 'Galaxy &amp; LBX DLC' free update will arrive next week on <strong>21st December</strong>.</p>
<p>The studio released a beefy four-minute trailer (above) showcasing all of the good stuff that you can expect to find in the new update, but we'll do our best to run through the highlights here too.</p>
<p>Kicking off with that titular 'Galaxy &amp; LBX' content, the update adds new characters from <strong>Inazuma Eleven Galaxy</strong> and Level-5's <strong>Danball Senki</strong> (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/lbx_little_battlers_experience">Little Battlers Experience</a>) series. There's a galactic new storyline that will see you playing across various planetary stadiums, each with its own unique effects, to become the best team in the universe — hey, the series has never been afraid of going OTT.</p>
<p>Speaking of OTT, new transform abilities will let your players grow into huge beasts and unleash their skills on the pitch, which sure is... something.</p>
<p>Gameplay-wise, you can expect new Chronicle routes, a 'Re-Story' mode to continue levelling up your players after wrapping up the main adventure, bonus BB Stadium teams, a two-player 'Tag Mode', tweaks to the Commander Mode, a new 'Fabled' character rarity and more.</p>
<p>In short, it's a lot, and it adds to what was already an impressively deep base game, which we called "the franchise’s most premium experience yet" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/inazuma-eleven-victory-road-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a>. Whether adding <em>even more</em> will actually benefit the core experience remains to be seen, but at least we don't have long to wait until we can find out.</p>

<p>The countdown to the release of the Ascended Heroes Pokémon TCG set is ramping up, and more the the secret rares likely to be included in the set have been revealed in Japan.</p>



<p>Pokémon TCG’s Ascended Heroes set will be made up from two Japanese releases: the already available Mega Dream ex, and the Start Deck 100 Battle Collection, due to release on Friday, and more reveals from the latter have surfaced.</p>







<h2 id="h-japan-start-deck-100-battle-collection-secret-rares-revealed">Japan Start Deck 100 Battle Collection Secret Rares Revealed</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hunting. Image via Pokemon</figcaption></figure>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2025/12/secret-rares-from-start-deck-100-battle-collection-revealed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokebeach</a>, the secret rares available in the Japanese Start Deck 100 Battle Collection have been revealed ahead of Friday’s release, showcasing a bunch of hits that are expected to be included in the Pokémon TCG Ascended Heroes set.</p>



<p>Several of the Art Rares have already been showcased in high definition, but the reveal stream showed off a bunch of SARs to chase down, including some for Mega Meganium, Mega Feraligatr, and Mega Emboar.</p>



<p>A new Lillie’s Clefairy is also set to be introduced, following on from the SIR introduced in Journey Together earlier this year, and the chase cards could actually be easier to pull in the English set.</p>



<p>The Japanese Start Deck 100 Battle Collection contains a whopping 742 cards in the main set, the majority of which are reprints, and each deck contains one of 100 60-card theme decks, but you won’t know which deck you’ve pulled until the box is ripped open.</p>



<p>Hits of Art Rares or SARs are not guaranteed, however, so hunting down the chase cards will be tricky, although the decks do have an affordable price of around $6.</p>



<p>As is often the case with the transfer to English sets, some cards may be saved to feature as promos in specific products, and some may be held back for future releases, too.</p>

            <p>Key members of The Elder Scrolls 6 team have shared an update on the highly-anticipated game's status, and the good news is development is "progressing really well".</p>
<p>According to Bethesda's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a>, the "majority" of the studio is now working on The Elder Scrolls 6, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-announces-the-elder-scrolls-6">first announced all the way back in 2018</a>, though he noted the team "always overlap" when it comes to game development (as well as Elder Scrolls 6, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard-but-development-is-his-everyday-thing">the studio is also working on its Fallout series</a>).</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>"We're very used to overlapping development," Howard told <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/12/16/bethesda-gives-us-an-update-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development">Game Informer</a>, saying the studio has "long pre-productions on things so that we feel good about them". Howard added "it's a process", and one that everyone involved wishes went faster than it does. "But it's a process that we want to get right," the Bethesda exec said.</p>
<p>Bethesda's studio director Angela Browder added thanks to the "leaps and bounds" made in the industry and hardware since Skyrim, the "possibilities" for The Elder Scrolls 6 "are crazy".</p>
<p>"I will be honest, for me, sometimes I see things that are happening, and I go, 'Angela from Skyrim days could never have envisioned seeing this like this now', and that is a cool thing to be a part of," Browder said. "And it's a thing that I hope that when the day comes that our fans play it, that they - especially those of them who've been lifers with our brands - can really see how far it's all come."</p><p>Browder noted if you <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-reveals-the-elder-scrolls-4-obivion-remake-gameplay">compare the original Oblivion with this year's remaster</a>, "you can see how far" technology has really come. "So, to me, The Elder Scrolls 6 is this endless set of possibilities that is really, really exciting as a developer, but really, really exciting as someone who really likes to think about how far everything has come in our industry," the studio director said, before adding:</p>
<p>"It's gonna be dope. It's dope!"</p>
<p>During the same interview, design director Emil Pagliarulo said the "pressure" that the Elder Scrolls players put on Bethesda "we don't put on ourselves", though the developer understands why some get frustrated waiting for a game to come out.</p>
<p>"Games take a long time, and games get pushed all the time; GTA just got pushed again, which was the smartest thing they could do, because a game the size of these games, they take not just a long time to make, but a long time to spit and polish and iron out the bugs," Pagliarulo said. "And so, what do fans really want? Do they want a game that comes out before it should and doesn't meet their expectations? Or do they want the turkey that is in the oven for long enough to be delicious when it finally comes out of the oven, you know?"</p><p>So, to make sure The Elder Scrolls 6 comes out of the oven as a delicious turkey, Bethesda is going to take its time. How much time? Well, "as long as it needs to be to be great," Pagliarulo closed.</p>

<p>Back in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-wishes-hed-been-a-bit-more-casual-with-his-elder-scrolls-6-announcement">Howard admitted he wished he had been a little more casual with the game's announcement</a>. Additionally, in October 2023, Skyrim's lead designer Bruce Nesmith said Bethesda announced Elder Scrolls 6 when it did in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-6-revealed-so-early-due-to-pitchforks-and-torches">bid to appease any angry mobs which had their "pitchforks and torches" out</a>, desperate to know more.</p>
<p>More recently, though, many Elder Scrolls 6 fans thought they <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/did-bethesda-just-drop-an-elder-scrolls-6-2027-release-date-tease-fans-think-so">found a clue pointing to a 2027 release date in a recent trailer for the Switch 2 edition of Skyrim</a>.</p>

            <p>The Last of Us co-director Bruce Straley has described generative AI as "a snake eating its own tail", discussing how easily use of the tech can be misinterpreted.</p>

In an interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/bruce-straley-generative-ai-interview/">Polygon</a> about the studio's debut, Coven of the Chicken Foot, Straley revealed his staunch dislike of generative AI.</p>
<p>"It's a snake eating its own tail," he said. "It can't grow and think for itself, it just consumes, and it tries to mimic what it's consumed. That's the best it can do right now."</p>

<p>Generative AI has not been used in development of Coven of the Chicken Foot, Straley confirmed. However, he noted how the term AI has been used in gaming for decades, but has since become confused and conflated with the current use of generative AI.</p><p>"It's difficult to even pitch the concept of this creature, because in my world, NPCs are AI," Straley said. "AI programmers are a type of personnel you have on staff in the programming department. Now you can't say that because if somebody does have an opinion about AI, I can't now call this creature the most advanced AI companion. People are going to think we did machine learning, and LLMs, and all that. No, we did none of that. This is hard work, and a lot of problem solving, and a lot of creative thinking. Which I think makes it more charming.</p>
<p>"I like art that has chips and flaws. It's like pottery. It has imperfections because it didn't come out of the kiln right. That's the cool stuff about art."</p>
<p>Straley did admit generative AI could potentially be useful in certain instances, but he's not interested in using it.</p>
<p>"I feel like without a human being the creation, I personally have zero investment in wanting to watch a TV show made by a robot," he said. "I have zero interest in looking at art that is generated by a computer. I don't think prompting is art."</p><p>Straley's comments are timely, following those of Larian CEO Swen Vincke. In an interview with Bloomberg, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-is-using-generative-ai-confirms-ceo-but-divinity-wont-contain-anything-ai-generated">Vincke admitted to Larian using generative AI</a> as part of development. When this received backlash online, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/holy-fck-guys-were-not-pushing-hard-for-or-replacing-concept-artists-with-ai-larian-ceo-responds-to-genai-backlash">Vincke clarified that concept artists would not be replaced by AI</a>. Instead the studio uses "AI tools to explore references" and developers can "experiment with these tools to make their lives easier" if they wish to.</p>
<p>The backlash Larian received to Vincke's initial comment is testament to the strong immediate opinions the use of AI can generate.</p>
<p>Coven of the Chicken Foot was revealed at this year's The Game Awards showcase - we've got a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025">rundown of everything announced</a>.</p>

		<p>Following the release of an interview between Larian CEO Swen Vincke and Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, there’s been a hefty stink caused by the mention of Larian <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/16/larian-confirms-divinity-will-be-turn-based-use-early-access-and-how-theyre-using-ai/">using generative AI as a tool for the development of Divinity</a>. This has led to Vincke and Schreier to both issue statements and provide greater context, downplaying even further the extent to which generative AI is being used.</p>
<p>The main sticking point was the use of gen-AI to produce concept art, but Vincke has now stressed that Larian has a significant pool of concept artists, job openings for more, and that gen-AI isn’t producing concept art itself, but could create reference material that artists would previously have looked for photographic reference material for inspiration. Aside from that, from the broader Bloomberg interview transcript, it’s placeholder text and white box assets, internal powerpoint presentations, Vincke himself using it to brush up his own emails (given that English is a second language).</p>


<p>The problem really stemmed from the brevity and some framing of <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NTg5MzY2NSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NDk4NDY1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0Q4ODFLSVAzSTkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.D26Cs7X_5kH5HuJT2frcX_AMIXyuXWefzz5NK2VlXEI&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg’s original section about generative AI</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p data-component="paragraph">Under Vincke, Larian has been pushing hard on generative AI, although the CEO says the technology hasn’t led to big gains in efficiency. He says there won’t be any AI-generated content in<em>Divinity</em> — “everything is human actors; we’re writing everything ourselves” — but the creators often use AI tools to explore ideas, flesh out PowerPoint presentations, develop concept art and write placeholder text.</p>
<p data-component="paragraph">The use of generative AI has led to some pushback at Larian, “but I think at this point everyone at the company is more or less OK with the way we’re using it,” Vincke said.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Note the use of “pushing hard” and that there has been pushback in the studio.</p>
<p>On<a href="https://xcancel.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001011042642505833"> social media</a>, Vincke has now responded to the concerns that artists were being replaced:</p>

<blockquote><p>Holy fuck guys we’re not “pushing hard” for or replacing concept artists with AI.</p>
<p>We have a team of 72 artists of which 23 are concept artists and we are hiring more. The art they create is original and I’m very proud of what they do.</p>
<p>I was asked explicitly about concept art and our use of Gen AI. I answered that we use it to explore things. I didn’t say we use it to develop concept art. The artists do that. And they are indeed world class artists.</p>
<p>We use AI tools to explore references, just like we use google and art books. At the very early ideation stages we use it as a rough outline for composition which we replace with original concept art. There is no comparison.</p>
<p>I talked about how we use ML here if you would like to know more: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-embraces-machine-learning-for-tasks-that-nobody-wants-to-do/1100-6531123/">Gamespot</a></p>
<p>We’ve hired creatives for their talent, not for their ability to do what a machine suggests, but they can experiment with these tools to make their lives easier.</p></blockquote>
<p>In the Gamespot article, he describes the AI use as often being for work and jobs that “nobody wants to do”.</p>
<p>And to circle back to Bloomberg, on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3ma5dqbmgm22o">social media, Schreier</a> (who somehow didn’t expect that AI use would be controversial) said, “If I had known the two paragraphs about genAI in my article today would be so controversial, I would have expanded them a bit! Here’s a rough transcript of the relevant portion of my interview with Swen Vincke, so everyone has all the context.</p>
<p>“I am not sharing this transcript because I think it will make anyone view Larian’s stance on genAI any differently; I’m sharing it so people can see all the context and judge for themselves if they feel that Larian’s position was misrepresented by my story.”</p>
<p>Here’s the rough transcript:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>JS:</strong> Speaking of efficiency, you’ve spoken a little bit about generative AI. And I know that that’s been a point of discussion on the team, too. Do you feel like it can speed up production?</p>
<p><strong>SV:</strong> In terms of generation, like white boxing, yes, there’s things, but I’m not 100% sure if you’re actually seeing speed-ups that much. You’re trying more stuff. Having tried stuff out, I don’t actually think it accelerates things. Because there’s a lot of hype out there. I haven’t really seen: oh this is really gonna replace things. I haven’t seen that yet. I’ve seen a lot of where you initially get excited, oh, this could be cool. And then you say, ah, you know, in the end it doesn’t really do the thing. Everything is human actors; we are writing everything ourselves. There’s no generated assets that you’re gonna see in the game. We are trying to use generated assets to accelerate white-boxing. But I mean to be fair, we’re talking about basic things to help the level designers.</p>
<p><strong>JS:</strong> What about concept art?</p>
<p><strong>SV:</strong> So that’s being used by concept artists. They use it the same like they would use photos. We have like 30 concept artists at this point or something like that. So we bought a boutique concept art firm at the moment that everybody was using reducing them because they were going to AI, in our case it just went up. If there’s one thing that artists keep on asking for it’s more concept artists. But what they do is they use it for exploration.</p>
<p><strong>JS:</strong> The other thing that I’ve seen that being used for more and more is placeholders, stub dialogue.</p>
<p><strong>SV:</strong> Well, yes. So it depends on the scripter. In our case what we do is whiteboxing means that the scripts put stub text in there. Some scripters will probably use a chatGPT, some will write it themselves. It’s really up to them–</p>
<p><strong>JS:</strong> But you found that it’s not actually speeding things up. It’s just kind of allowing more experimentation.</p>
<p><strong>SV:</strong> Well, in the sense that speeds it up because your experimentation is broader. But I mean, it’s not as if their dialogues are suddenly being written faster. And on the contrary, and it’s not as if you’re seeing the scripting going faster. What’s happening is there’s just more stuff being done, but I mean if you’ve used chatGPT, it helps you organize things, gets you a faster-</p>
<p><strong>JS:</strong> Until it screws up and–</p>
<p><strong>SV:</strong> Right. You still will always have to alter it yourself. And I mean like I’m non-native English, so it’s easier for me to make my phrases without mistakes. So it helps with that.</p>
<p><strong>JS:</strong> To write your company emails.</p>
<p><strong>SV:</strong> No, no, no, no. I mean I like putting it in there to see okay, this is a clean version of my text. So what’s happening is I write with worse grammar now and then I use it to clean up my text and then I have to go over it again to clean it up again.</p>
<p><strong>JS:</strong> That seems like it would take more time.</p>
<p><strong>SV:</strong> Yes, I know. But I have the feeling like my phrases are better.</p>
<p><strong>JS:</strong> Your English is pretty good. You don’t have to worry that much.</p>
<p><strong>SV:</strong> I think experimentation, white boxing, some broader white boxing, lots and lots of applications and retargeting and cleaning and editing. These are things that just really take a lot of time. So that allows you to do more. So there’s a lot of value there in terms of the creative process itself. It helps in doing things. But I haven’t seen the acceleration. So I’m really curious to see because there’s all studios that said, of this is gonna accelerate… If you look at the state of the art of video games today, these are still in their infancy. Will they eventually manage to do that at large scale? I don’t know how much data centers they’re gonna need to be able to do it.</p>
<p><strong>JS:</strong> It doesn’t seem like it’s causing more efficiency, so why use it?</p>
<p><strong>SV:</strong> This is a tech driven industry, so you try stuff. You can’t afford not to try things because if somebody finds the golden egg and you’re not using it, you’re dead this industry.</p>
<p><strong>JS:</strong> OK, but the downside though is that it’s so poisonous, controversial to players, to artists, to creative people in a way that other tech isn’t. Maybe Photoshop used to be back in the day?</p>
<p><strong>SV:</strong> I think you would find the same argument back in the days for a lot of things, right? Anything that was has been automated has always considered – I think the part of this job is to make sure that you are competitive and state of the art. So if you don’t look at the state of the art, you will eventually regret it. That’s gonna be even worse for developers.</p></blockquote>
<p>So what do you think? Is Vincke too casual about the impact of generative AI? Is that offset by the way that it’s being used internally and that it’s supporting a company that continues to grow? There’s definitely a lot of nuance here.</p>

            <p>A second season of Dispatch is being discussed "as seriously as anything" at AdHoc Studio, and the team will sit down any day now and make a decision about it.</p>
<p>"People are mad that we haven't told them what we're doing," studio co-founder and Dispatch game director Nick Herman told me in an interview. "It's the new problem, right? It's like, are you doing it? Are you not doing it? We're days away from really sitting down and having the time - because we've had to support the game - where we're going to really sit down and lay those plans out."</p>
<p>I spoke to Herman and Pierre Shorette, the lead writer and another studio co-founder, as part of a longer interview live on Eurogamer now. But though Herman said the studio is yet to make a decision on Season 2, the ways they referenced a follow-up made it sound like a much surer thing.</p>
<p>When they talked about a cut Kpop idol-inspired character called Winter, for instance, and a love triangle he was involved in, Shorette joked that he could reinstate this for Season 2. "We should do that for Season 2," he said, before quickly adding: "<em>If </em>there is a Season 2!"</p><p>It was when I questioned them directly about a second series and how seriously the studio is talking about it, that Shorette said, "As seriously as anything." But though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dispatch-proves-episodic-gaming-is-back-with-a-capital-b-following-latest-player-milestone#:~:text=The%20episodic%20superhero%20workplace%20comedy,number%20also%20equates%20to%20sales.">Dispatch has been an obvious success, racing to 2m sales</a> and capturing a large and passionate fanbase, there are concerns internally about following it up.</p>
<blockquote><em>"You have your whole life to write your first album and then eight months to write your second"</em></blockquote>
<p>As Shorette explained: "The thing is, the tough thing is, it's like in music: you have your whole life to write your first album and then eight months to write your second. And there's a little bit of that feeling. We had <em>so</em> long with this - seven years is a lot of time. If anything, it would have been embarrassing if it was bad. I mean, you took fucking long enough! We're taking <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> amounts of time on this shit, you know - it better be good. I know we're not going to have that amount of time for Season 2 because we want to meet the demand."</p>
<p>Then Herman added: "There were <em>zero </em>expectations for Season 1 - external expectations. People just had to show up and enjoy it and not have a bunch of theories and stuff in their head. Season 2, if we do it, we know that's going to be an extra challenge."</p>
<p>"A lot of pressure," Shorette said. "It'll be about what it's not as much as what it is."</p>
<p>It might be a surprise to hear Dispatch was in development for several years but its journey was a twisting, turning one. From being a live-action television series to being dropped by a publisher half-way through, the game has had to survive some bumps. You can read all about it - and about that cut Kpop character and more - in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-of-dispatch-how-adhoc-rode-rejection-to-huge-success">a Making Of-style Dispatch interview</a> live on Eurogamer now.</p>

            <p>"As the internet likes to tell us, it’s been a while." Please keep waiting, there are some magazines over there if you need them. "It’s a process." Shouting won't increase the speed at which it happens. Do you "want the turkey that is in the oven for long enough to be delicious when it finally comes out of the oven"? Some of these are things I often have to say to my cat when the clock ticks to within an hour of feeding time. Some of them are things Todd Howard and co have said about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-6">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> in another little update that's seen them declare yet again that it is coming and add that development's going good thus far.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"It’s progressing really well," the Todd himself told <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/12/16/bethesda-gives-us-an-update-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development">Game Informer</a>, about a month on from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-but-thats-not-stopping-todd-howard-teasing-an-oblivion-remastered-style-shadow-drop">gently teasing that he might fancy shadow-dropping</a> this next mainline Elder Scroll. "The majority of the studio’s on VI, but I’ll say this: We always overlap. So, we’re very used to overlapping development. And we have long pre-productions on things so that we feel good about them. And it’s a process. We all wish it went a little bit faster – or a lot faster – but it’s a process that we want to get right."</p>
<p>I assume that part of the interview happened in the lounge/living room of house Bethesda. Then, studio design director Emil Pagliarulo burst in, wearing a chef's hat and one of those kiss the cook aprons. "It’s funny, because the time pressure that players put on us, we don’t put on ourselves," he said, grasping a tray in his oven mitts. "What do fans really want? Do they want a game that comes out before it should and doesn’t meet their expectations? Or do they want the turkey that is in the oven for long enough to be delicious when it finally comes out of the oven, you know?"</p>
<p>As the smell of basting bird filled the room, Pagliarulo also suggested that taking "as long as it needs to be to be great" is just Bethesda following the tried and tested recipe for big meal success. "Games take a long time, and games get pushed all the time," he reasoned, pointing to a page headed 'Massive open-world game drizzled in weighty expectations' in a Delia Smith cookbook. "GTA <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-everyone-gta-6-has-been-hit-with-delay-number-two">just got pushed again</a>, which was the smartest thing they could do, because a game the size of these games, they take not just a long time to make, but a long time to spit and polish and iron out the bugs."</p><p>Meanwhile, studio director Angela Browder aimed to reassure the dinner guests that the grub, whenever it arrives, will knock their socks off. "The Elder Scrolls VI is this endless set of possibilities that is really, really exciting as a developer, but really, really exciting as someone who really likes to think about how far everything has come in our industry. It’s gonna be dope. It’s dope! [laughs]."</p>
<p>So, I assume Todd then said, just keep chowing down on your slightly stale <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>-shaped appetisers for the moment, if you get a bit peckish for old scrollage. Maybe go for a walk. Download some mods. Give the folks slaving away over a hot stove some space, lest you get slapped with a kitchen towel.</p>

            <p>Bethesda's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/todd-howard">Todd Howard</a> has announced Fallout Season 3 is currently being written, just a day after season two premiered. What's more, collaborations between Fallout video games and this next entry in the popular TV show are being planned.</p>
<p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/fallout-season-3-scripts-fallout-76-game-tie-in-1236610167/">In an interview with Variety</a>, Howard revealed the current status of Fallout's next season, as well as how it will cross over with the games.</p>
<p>Howard explained: "For us on the game and TV show side, we're writing Season 3 now [...] We're having those conversations now of, what are we doing in Season 3 for the TV show and what elements can we bring into our games at that time when it comes out that don't feel forced or fake."</p>

<p>The Fallout series and games have already explored this sort of multi-media promotion, courtesy of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-76s-new-update-features-walton-goggins-as-the-ghoul-from-amazons-tv-series">Fallout 76's recent Burning Springs update</a>. Released earlier this month, Burning Springs starred Walton Goggins as The Ghoul, and featured several new bounty hunter missions for players to complete. It's free too, a nice touch to be sure.</p><p>The Fallout show has also acted as an opportunity to shoehorn Game Pass into the situation, as Amazon, Bethesda, and Samsung have partnered up to offer both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> and season one to Samsung TV owners for free via Game Pass. Head of Samsung Gaming Kevin Beatty told Variety he thought they were "extremely fortunate" to offer season one, and that he hopes they'll be able to stream season 2 in the future.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, Todd Howard confirmed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallouts-todd-howard-has-no-interest-in-becoming-bethesdas-version-of-marvel-cameo-king-stan-lee">he had no interest in taking up a Stan Lee style cameo in the Fallout show</a>, and didn't rule out the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/an-elder-scrolls-tv-series-cant-be-ruled-out-todd-howard-teases-but-remains-tight-lipped-on-the-status-of-the-wolfenstein-adaptation">possibility of an Elder Scrolls TV show in the future</a>. He was, however, tight-lipped about a Wolfenstein show.</p>

            <p>Swen Vincke, the CEO of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and Divinity developer Larain, has responded to the intense backlash the studio has received since its use of generative AI was confirmed.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-is-using-generative-ai-confirms-ceo-but-divinity-wont-contain-anything-ai-generated"> the Larian CEO stated the studio is using generative AI to explore ideas, expand on internal presentations, develop concept art, and write placeholder text</a>, with Vinke saying "everyone at the company is more or less OK" with the way the technology is being implemented. He added the studio's upcoming and newly-announced release Divinity won't contain anything which has been AI-generated.</p>
<p>Soon after Vincke's statements went live, however, he was met with backlash from fans <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/anoxicart.bsky.social/post/3ma4kiiuu5s2g">as well as former Larian developers</a>, which prompted the studio head to respond with his <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001011042642505833"> own post</a>, stating: "Holy fuck guys we're not 'pushing hard' for or replacing concept artists with AI."  </p>

<p>The Baldur's Gate 3 head added Larian has "a team of 72 artists of which 23 are concept artists and we are hiring more", with the artwork they create being original and something Vincke is "very proud" of.</p>
<p>Continuing further, Vincke said he was "asked explicitly about concept art and our use of Gen AI" during the interview with Bloomberg. "I answered that we use it to explore things. I didn't say we use it to develop concept art. The artists do that. And they are indeed world class artists," he said.</p><p>Vincke stated the studio uses "AI tools to explore references", in the same way it uses the likes of Google and art books. "At the very early ideation stages we use it as a rough outline for composition which we replace with original concept art," he said. "There is no comparison."</p>
<p>Larian hires its team of creatives for "their talent", Vincke closed, and "not for their ability to do what a machine suggests". He again reiterated the team can still "experiment with these tools to make their lives easier".</p>

<p>In a further statement shared with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-ceo-responds-to-divinity-gen-ai-backlash-we-are-neither-releasing-a-game-with-any-ai-components-nor-are-we-looking-at-trimming-down-teams-to-replace-them-with-ai">IGN</a>, Vincke again clarified that Larian is not looking to replace any of its developers with generative AI. It will also not be releasing a game which includes content made by the technology.</p>
<p>You can read Vincke's statement in full below:</p>
<blockquote><p>"We've been continuously increasing our pool of concept artists , writers and story-tellers, are actively putting together writer rooms, casting and recording performances from actors and hiring translators.</p>
<p>"Since concept art is being called out explicitly - we have 23 concept artists and have job openings for more. These artists are creating concept art day in day out for ideation and production use.</p>
<p>"Everything we do is incremental and aimed at having people spend more time creating. Any ML tool used well is additive to a creative team or individual's workflow, not a replacement for their skill or craft.</p>
<p>"We are researching and understanding the cutting edge of ML as a toolset for creatives to use and see how it can make their day-to-day lives easier, which will let us make better games. We are neither releasing a game with any AI components, nor are we looking at trimming down teams to replace them with AI.</p>
<p>"While I understand it's a subject that invokes a lot of emotion, it's something we are constantly discussing internally through the lens of making everyone's working day better, not worse."</p></blockquote>

<p>While <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/braak.bsky.social/post/3ma53v5blo222">many remain unconvinced of Vincke's response</a>, others have pointed out Larian is far from the only beloved studio to admit to using AI. The "Expedition 33 team freely admitted using AI and just won the most awards ever in The Game Awards history," <a href="https://x.com/GenePark/status/2001061930547503396">Washington Post reporter Gene Park noted on social media</a>.</p><p>AI, of course, remains a key area of discussion across the industry, and reports of AI use are continuing to make headlines. Earlier this month, publisher Running with Scissors cancelled upcoming game Postal: Bullet Paradise - a co-op "bullet-heaven" first-person shooter from developer Goonswarm Games - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/has-caused-extreme-damage-to-our-brand-and-our-company-reputation-running-with-scissors-cancels-postal-bullet-paradise-over-ai-generated-assets-two-days-after-reveal">after feedback to the reveal two days ago said much of the game appeared to have been made using generative AI</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, meanwhile, Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney said "AI will be involved in nearly all future production", so <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-boss-tim-sweeney-says-steam-ai-disclosures-make-no-sense">having Steam games disclose whether they were built with AI makes about as much sense as telling us what kind of shampoo the developers use</a>. More recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-and-elder-scrolls-boss-todd-howard-defends-ai-in-game-development-but-aims-to-protect-artistry-and-human-intention-in-his-games">Bethesda's Todd Howard shared his own thoughts on the use of AI in video games</a>, calling it a "tool" but one that can't replace human intention.</p>
<p>As for Larian, it is working on Divinity, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-announces-new-game-takes-ownership-of-desert-statue">announced at The Game Awards with a rather gruesome and unsettling trailer</a>. Vinke has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/divinity-will-be-a-turn-based-rpg-and-see-larian-unleashed-declares-ceo-swen-vincke-replacing-the-dd-system-with-one-made-for-a-video-game">since said Larian's upcoming game is the studio "unleashed"</a>, while confirming it will be a turn-based RPG.</p>

		<p>Peak has been updated to version 1.50a in what will be the final content update of 2025 for the co-op climbing game. This update makes things feel festive and wintry with the airport getting Christmas decorations and some of the biomes getting a layering of snow, except Caldera as its too hot for snow to settle there. In addition, Aggro Crab and Landfall have stated that going forward updates will fewer, though more content is planned for 2026.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/17/nacon-rig-r5-pro-hs-gaming-headset-review/</link>
            <guid>1385632</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>In recent years, the most reliable headset brand, at least for my ears, has been Nacon RIG. For years, their industrial looks have been married to high-quality gaming audio, and that’s seen them remain a firm favourite in our home. So, it’s with some surprise that the latest RIG headset, the R5 Pro HS doesn’t actually look like any of the headsets that have come before it. This much more restrained and customisable design still hosts RIG’s excellent audio, though, making this a late peripheral highlight in 2025.</p>
<p>The R5 Pro HS is a 3.5mm wired headset, meaning that it’s compatible with anything hosting a headphone socket, including PS5, Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S. It’s often nice to have the simplicity of a wired headset; you never have to remember to charge it, or place it on a dock, it’s just ready to go.</p>



<p>That simplicity extends to the R5’s controls, with an inline volume control sitting midway down the cable, itself boasting a slide control that clicks into place at full volume. It was always easy to find the control when I needed it, and I appreciated the fact that it was right there, whether hitting louder sections in a game, or needing to turn things down to hear somebody talking to me.</p>
<p>The microphone is similarly straightforward, with a flip-to-mute action that stops its output when pointing straight up. The boom arm is made of flexible metal with a rubberised coating, giving it a decent degree of movement and optimisation that sees it stay exactly where you put it. The mic itself boasts a 50 Hz–15 kHz frequency range, and it proved perfect for game chat and the odd Zoom call, though I do think I’d look for a dedicated mic if I was streaming and talking to an audience.</p>

<p>While there’s elements of the older RIG headset design language if you look really closely – you can see it in the squared-off bottoms of each earcup – Nacon have clearly decided to move towards a more modern and understated overall look. That means that the R5 Pro HS have lost some of the character of those older headsets, but you could actually wear these outside of your home without drawing any side eye. It’s clean, confident, and I like the shift in design as we head into 2026.</p>

<p>The R5’s little party trick is that it has customisable magnetic plates on the outside of each earcup, letting you add a touch of your own personality to them. It’s a decent enough idea, and one we’ve seen before with headsets like the Turtle Beach Elite Pro 2, but there, the support for different plates dried up pretty quickly.</p>
<p>Nacon don’t want that to happen. Instead, even before their own options are available, they’ve released the STL files, letting those with access to 3D printing get started making their own plates straight away. This means that players will be able to create their own, completely unique plates, and I can see it being a popular headset, simply for this level of customisation. Out of the box, you’re getting two PlayStation-branded covers, but if you want to remove them, the R5 Spear Pro not only gets even lighter and easier on your ears, it gives it a real retro vibe that I definitely enjoyed.</p>
<p>Comfort isn’t an issue, with or without the plates, and the magnetic ear cushions – which you’ll also be able to buy alternate versions of – are thick, soft and plush. I was able to wear the R5 Spear Pro for days on end, helped by the ample padding on the headband, and I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend them to anyone looking for a comfortable, easy-to-live-with headset.</p>

<p>In terms of audio, the R5 Pro HS’s 40mm graphene drivers do a fantastic job of delivering all of your gaming needs directly into your ears, in suitably detailed form. I’ve been playing a ton of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/08/skate-story-review-the-grind-of-a-lifetime/">Skate Story</a>, and it was the ideal game to test them out with. The soundtrack, composed by Blood Cultures, had plenty of menacing thump, though the bass was never overwhelming. The R5 Pro HS are more bass-heavy than the recent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/06/turtle-beach-atlas-200-gaming-headset-review/">Turtle Beach Atlas 200</a>, meaning that action games and bass-heavy music tracks have some serious weight.</p>
<p>If you’re so inclined, the R5 Pro HS are a decent option for listening to music as well. Besides mainlining the Skate Story Vol. 1 album, I’m still stuck on President’s King of Terror EP, and the aggressive guitars and electronic tones sounded great, with some decent spacing in the soundstage. They might edge towards the mid-range a bit more than some other headsets out there, but away from music, it means that dialogue and speech rings through that step clearer than elsewhere, and the wider soundstage means that you feel truly enveloped by the game worlds you’re exploring.</p>

<p>With an RRP of £69.90, the key competitor to the R5 Spear Pro this holiday season is the Turtle Beach Atlas 200, and it’s a tough battle as they’re both excellent wired headsets. The build quality of the R5 is definitely stronger, has better audio, and I much prefer the design, but the Atlas 200 probably just edges it in terms of comfort, thanks to its lighter weight. If you’re looking for customisation though, the R5 is the clear winner.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/divinity-will-address-the-weakest-part-of-previous-games-in-the-franchise/</link>
            <guid>1385629</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday's Bloomberg report about the new Divinity game <a href="https://wccftech.com/divinity-is-a-turn-based-rpg-will-be-way-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-says-larian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first made headlines for the confirmation of the combat system (turn-based)</a> and the ambition to deliver a bigger, better game than even the award-winning Baldur's Gate 3 in less time. Then, following the backlash against Larian's usage of AI for development assistance, Larian CEO Swen Vincke <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-responds-backlash-over-genai-use-divinity-baldurs-gate-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was forced to issue a clarifying statement</a>.</p>



<p>The studio's founder, owner, and game director also participated in several other interviews just before (or after) The Game Awards 2025 event and <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-announces-divinity-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game's official announcement</a> there, though. In the article <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/if-you-like-baldurs-gate-3-this-is-gonna-be-great-larian-boss-swen-vincke-reveals-what-to-expect-from-divinity-in-first-interview-since-the-game-awards-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published by IGN</a>, Vincke admitted that one of the changes (albeit one that requires a lot of work) compared to previous Divinity titles will be the greatly enhanced worldbuilding.</p>



<p><em>We learned the value of having a solid universe behind you, for sure. One of the first things we started doing was saying, 'Okay, we're gonna put a lot of effort into making this universe feel tidy.' That's also why we are just calling it Divinity, right? There's never been a game that's just Divinity first, because there were all kinds of versions with different names. So this is actually going to be Divinity, which is going to have a proper universe backing it. We're building everything as you would expect, with lots of surprises, so that we can build on top of it. We learned that from BG, because we spent a lot of time delving through all kinds of DnD books, so that's probably one of the biggest takeaways from that development process.</em></p>



<p>[...] <em>We really wanted to tidy up because the first Divinity games were made with little thought for universe-building, and it's only in Original Sin 2 that we started thinking more about it – but even then, not really 100% to what we did with Baldur's Gate 3. So now we're really thinking about it, and so that's a lot of work to make sure we get it right. Because it's the little things, right? I mean, what do people do when they go out to eat? What do they do when they go to sleep? What all of that has to be called out.</em></p>



<p>When I first <span>spoke with my colleague Francesco De Meo about what I'd like to see in the new game after the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/new-divinity-game-is-likely-that-mystery-tga-demonic-statue-announcement/" target="_blank">trademark leak</a>, I immediately told him&nbsp;</span>that Larian would have to significantly step up its game in that specific area. While the setting of Rivellon does have potential, its current incarnation cannot be compared to established fantasy worlds like The Elder Scrolls, The Witcher, or Dragon Age, let alone Baldur's Gate 3's Forgotten Realms, which is by far the most popular Dungeons &amp; Dragons setting and definitely aided BG3's enormous success.</p>



<p>It simply needs a lot more depth, texture, and lore to measure up to such intricately detailed settings. To that end, beyond just fleshing out the world a lot more in preparation for the upcoming game, Larian would do well to look into transmedia opportunities. Divinity: Original Sin got an official board game, but what the setting could really use is a few novels to make fans more attached to specific characters, events, and factions. An animated series could help, too, although that'd be a lot more expensive. As far as in-game features go, it would be nice to have a Codex-like feature that allows players to reference universe-specific terms, events, and people.</p>



<p>Overall, I am pleased that Larian correctly identified the importance of having a strong setting to build their next game upon. Based on what Vincke said, they're trying to finish Divinity quicker than Baldur's Gate 3's six-year timeframe, although that will be a tricky proposition given the size and quality ambition. Still, we'll continue to report on any major development updates. Stay tuned.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/terminator-survivors-delayed-indefinitely-no-multiplayer/</link>
            <guid>1385614</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Terminator Survivors hasn’t had the best journey into the market. In the closing days of 2025, Nacon Studio Milan has emerged on social media to share a major development update about the upcoming open-world survival game set in the iconic sci-fi universe. The game’s creative director addressed fans directly in what amounts to an open letter, but it’s <strong>not </strong>good news.</p>



<p>Marco Ponte, the leader of the game’s creative angle, thanked fans for their patience and reaffirmed the studio’s commitment to delivering an honest representation of the Terminator universe, but things are not looking encouraging.</p>



<h2 id="h-terminator-survivors-delayed-with-no-new-date-in-sight">Terminator Survivors Delayed With No New Date in Sight</h2>



<p>According to Ponte, the team at Nacon Studio Milan has made ‘significant progress’ this year across multiple areas. He referenced world design, combat systems, and narrative depth as key. The goal remains clear: to envelop players in a bleak, post-apocalyptic environment where Skynet’s machines dominate humanity.</p>



<p>Players are set to step into the role of survivors rising from the rubble, fighting Skynet’s earlier prototypes, and helping to spark the resistance we all know too well from the movie franchise.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, some of the changes Ponte references might come as a shock to those awaiting delivery of Terminator Survivors.</p>



<p>The game will now be a single-player title, with Nacon Studio Milan having stripped multiplayer mechanics clean from the title.</p>



<p>It was said that this was the result of extensive testing and discussion with fans, and the developers concluded that focusing on a single-player experience would better capture the uncompromising vision of the Terminator world. While this decision might come as a disappointment to some, Ponte suggests it’s how they can ‘deliver the most authentic gameplay possible.’</p>



<p>Additionally, the studio has decided <strong>against </strong>an early-access release, and instead, Terminator Survivors will launch as a complete, polished (hopefully) product.</p>



<p>The bad news is that the game’s release has been delayed indefinitely, and there’s no indication whatsoever of when it might surface.</p>



<p>Nacon Studio Milan has promised to arrange closed playtests under NDA as the launch window hopefully draws closer. In the recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2617340/view/624439505179377725" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on Steam</a>, Ponte invited fans to sign up to contribute to the effort.</p>

<p>Multiple revived and enhanced titles are on the way</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nitrome, the talented British indie developer currently crafting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mouse-work">Mouse Work</a> for the Switch 2, has this week announced a new series.</p>
<p>Nitrome Classics revives a range of titles from <a href="https://www.nitrome.com/">Nitrome's past</a> and is "lovingly" porting them to the Nintendo Switch and other platforms with various enhancements and updates. More platform releases could also "potentially" follow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"All of the games are not just meticulously restored but improved with higher frame rates, full screen aspect ratios and with higher quality music. Many of the games will be packaged as mini collections within a franchise and include additional content not found in the original release."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>The first game in this series is <strong>Twin Shot Deluxe</strong> (a title which began life on web browsers), and it will be released in "early" 2026. <strong>Silly Sausage</strong> and <strong>Skywire</strong> will follow this game. Here are the details about the first title on the way (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3618520/Twin_Shot_Deluxe/">via Steam</a>), and you can check out a trailer of this new Classics series above.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Angel Cats are back and better than ever before in this complete remaster.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dota-2-largo-introduced-valve/</link>
            <guid>1385602</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The wait is over—Valve has finally released Dota 2 patch 7.40, ending one of the longest gaps between updates in the game’s history. Alongside sweeping balance changes and hero reworks, Valve has added new items and even a new hero – <strong>Largo</strong>. This larger-than-life character is a whimsical frog bard (really), and he joins the game as the 127th hero to date.</p>



<p>His melee support build enables allies and disrupts enemies quite nicely, by all accounts.</p>







<h2 id="h-largo-enters-dota-2-in-patch-7-40">Largo Enters Dota 2 in Patch 7.40</h2>



<p>Largo’s kit is interesting and, as you could probably imagine, themed entirely around his existence as a <strong>frog</strong>:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Catchy Lick</strong>: A tongue pull that dispels and damages, granting Largo regeneration when cleansing effects</li>



<li><strong>Frogstomp</strong>: Summoned froglings stomp the ground, dealing damage, mini‑stunning, and slowing foes.</li>



<li><strong>Croak of Genius</strong>: Cast on allies to reduce mana costs and echo their damage over time.</li>



<li><strong>Amphibian Rhapsody</strong>: A musical ultimate where Largo strums songs—<strong>Bullbelly Blitz</strong> for spell amplification, <strong>Hotfeet Hustle</strong> for speed and resistance, and <strong>Island Elixir</strong> for healing. Successful strums build “Groovin’” stacks, boosting armor and reducing mana costs.</li>
</ul>



<p>That’s an interesting lineup.</p>



<p>Largo uses Aghanim’s upgrades to expand his toolkit. For instance, the <strong>Shard </strong>mirrors buffs onto Largo himself, while the Scepter lets him play two songs per beat and deal bonus magic damage.</p>



<p>Here’s a bit of background on Largo:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Originating from the Murkroot Forest, Largo’s people fled after the Talga‑Ruun’s invasion. His sacred music revived the dying island of Valu’Mar, cementing him as a bard of salvation. Now he travels beyond his homeland, spreading inspiration with his frogling companions and enchanted lute.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><a href="https://www.dota2.com/largo?fbclid=IwY2xjawOthfNleHRuA2FlbQIxMABicmlkETFUSlFOcDcyRThZSWdwakFjc3J0YwZhcHBfaWQQMjIyMDM5MTc4ODIwMDg5MgABHoCLalh9HGaR_y7XF4IsSNc6tm84oG3CF22la_kgxeHiSoK4AEKEMdFq6-AY_aem_Fcmjvq55wNLcmyBOQ-QsSQ&amp;brid=cC-n1vNdLPqRrTJeMQ7_dw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dota 2’s Patch 7.40</a> also reworks existing heroes like Lone Druid, Slark, and Treant Protector. It refreshes the neutral item pool and introduces terrain adjustments that will have an impact on the competitive landscape.</p>



<p>If you’re eager to scoop rewards, you can also lean on Patch 7.40 to secure riches in the Winter Treasure 2025 LTE. There are sixteen new sets across the hero lineup to secure.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’ll be using Largo in Dota 2.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Rainbow Six Mobile Releasing Worldwide on February 23, 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-mobile-releasing-february/</link>
            <guid>1385593</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The mobile esports world is about to get a considerable amount more impressive, as Ubisoft has just announced the impending release date for Rainbow Six Mobile. The long-awaited launch of the game comes more than three years after it was revealed, and it’s set to arrive on February 23, 2026.</p>



<p>It won’t be a staggered deployment, either. The game will be released globally on that day. Reportedly, the delay in producing this game comes from years of testing and preparation, so that Ubisoft can launch a game that’s as stable and ‘esports-ready’ as possible.</p>



<h2 id="h-rainbow-six-mobile-coming-soon">Rainbow Six Mobile Coming Soon</h2>



<p>In a short trailer uploaded hours ago, Ubisoft unveiled the release date for Rainbow Six Mobile, the eagerly anticipated handheld version of the company’s flagship first-person shooter.</p>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege has dominated the market for a decade, standing firm as one of the top esports games around. It’ll now expand on that notion with a handheld version.</p>



<p>In November 2024, Ubisoft held a soft launch for Rainbow Six Mobile, kick-starting a series of technical tests in specific territories to start bedding in the game. Now that the game is fleshed out with new operators and some fresh content, they’ve decided to blast off with a global launch next February.</p>



<p>If you live in Canada, France, Poland, and the LATAM regions, you can download and play Rainbow Six Mobile now, but it’ll be a bit of a test product. It has proven to be a hit in those territories, so it’s only fair that Ubisoft now pushes the game out to a much wider audience.</p>



<p>This free-to-play mobile game has been turning heads in those regions, and now it’s time to go global. Will you be playing? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fallout Season 2 Rotten Tomatoes Score Higher Than Season 1]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-2-rotten-tomatoes-score-season-1/</link>
            <guid>1385542</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The second season of Prime Video’s Fallout got its reviews today, and they are quite favorable. Even more so, the Bethesda series’ sophomore season has beaten the first season’s Rotten Tomatoes score by a good bit.</p>



<p>Despite the ‘video game adaptation curse’, Prime Video’s Fallout beat the odds seemingly out of nowhere. Based on the post-apocalyptic worlds from Bethesda, the show captured what made the games special with a delightful mix of comedy and action. Released in 2024, it became a smash hit, even earning <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-won-emmy-award/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Primetime Emmy nominations</a> like Best Drama and Best Drama Actor for Walton Goggins. It was clear a new season was in order, and, as of writing, the first episode is available to watch. Critics have already seen most of what the show has to offer and, if what Rotten Tomatoes rates is true, it outdoes the first season in a big way. </p>







<h2 id="h-fallout-season-2-certified-fresh-at-97-on-rotten-tomatoes-4-higher-than-first">Fallout Season 2 Certified Fresh at 97% on Rotten Tomatoes, 4% Higher than First</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fallout Season Two Official Trailer | Prime Video" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ECI3eCAxRGw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>On <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/fallout/s02" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, which collects all available reviews for media, Fallout Season 2 received a 97% rating. With 39 reviews, it is now Certified Fresh. While the score can change as more reviews come in, the second season outperformed the first by 4%. Fallout Season 1 scored an impressive 93% with over 133 reviews. </p>



<p>The better score does bode well for the series’ second outing. Fallout Season 2 continues the story of Lucy, The Ghoul, and Maximus as the world expands to New Vegas. Its impressive accolades and numbers for Prime Video have already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-3-possibly-filming-summer-2026-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">greenlit it for a third season</a>, which aims to film in Summer 2026. It is quite rare for a game adaptation to get another shot, much less be better than the first. Fortunately, Prime Video’s Fallout has done just that, ensuring fans will have some treats in store for the series.</p>







<p>What do you think of Fallout Season 2’s Rotten Tomatoes score? Have you watched the first episode yet? What do you think? Did you enjoy the first season?

Starting on December 18, players will be to put presents under their tree--so to speak--by clobbering creatures for loot and bringing a little hope back to Estuar.</p><p>To claim their prizes, players will have to face hordes of Treasure Goblins and earn their place on the March of the Goblins reputation board. There are multiple tiers to unlock, and players can claim their prizes between each one by visiting the Goblin Square in Kyovashad. Once players complete the final tier, they will be given a Resplendent Spark. That final tier is repeatable, and the quality of the loot dropped by enemies will increase with each tier. However, players will only have until January 6, 2026 to work their way through and claim as much treasure as they can.</p><p>Returning Grim Favors during Goblin Greedings will also give players an additional cache for Gift of the Tree. All they need to do to claim it is to select a cache, which will reveal the treasure they've been given by the Gift of the Tree.</p><p>Additionally, a handful of free holiday items will appear at the in-game store on specific dates:</p><ul><li><strong>December 18</strong>: Tackle of the First Snows (Mount Trophy)</li><li><strong>December 19</strong>: Fallow-ward (Mount Trophy)</li><li><strong>December 20</strong>: Crook of First Snow (Mount Armor)</li></ul><p>As with the rest of treasures, those items will disappear after January 6.</p><p>Outside of the game, the prequel to next year's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-announces-next-diablo-4-expansion-two-new-classes/1100-6536900/" data-ref-id="1100-6536900">Lord of Hatred expansion</a>, Diablo 4: The Lost Horadrim, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-expansion-prequel-novel-preorder-guide/1100-6536997/" data-ref-id="1100-6536997">is available for preorder now</a>.

<h3>Pikmin 4 - Version 1.1.1 (16th December 2025)</h3>
<p><strong>Fix Related to Giving Oatchi Commands</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can now give the “Go to Work” command to Oatchi in your squad right away when you keep pressing the A Button after throwing all of the Pikmin in your squad.
<ul>
<li>For tasks where there aren’t enough Pikmin, or things Oatchi is unable to do, the command will still be stopped temporarily.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixes Related to Roll Overs</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>When you start a new game with Roll Over, you can now carry over all of Oatchi’s previously learned skills.
<ul>
<li>Speak to the captain and go into the training screen after Oatchi grows and you are able to do training.</li>
<li>Note: You cannot perform Roll Over starts in the <em>Pikmin 4</em> demo.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where some treasures are not reflected in the completion of the Treasure Catalog.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixes Related to Creature Activity Levels</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>While the activity level is set to “Relaxed,” the following creatures will no longer attack unless you attack them first.
<ul>
<li>Moss</li>
<li>Waterwraith</li>
<li>Dweevils Carrying Bomb Rocks</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>While the activity level is set to “Relaxed,” creatures are less likely to inhale Pikmin or catch them with their tongues.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the Grubchucker is unable to prey on Pikmin while the activity level is set to “Fierce.”</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where some creatures would freeze in place when fed multiple Bomb Rocks while the activity level is set to “Fierce.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixes Related to Decor Pikmin</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Made it easier to “Say Cheese” when taking pictures of some Decor Pikmin.</li>
<li>Decor Pikmin are now unaffected when a creature performs an attack where they suck in Pikmin.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where there was sometimes a delay in reflecting what Decor Pikmin you have found when sending that data to the Pikmin Bloom smart device application.
<ul>
<li>Note: Decor Pikmin data cannot be sent to Pikmin Bloom from the <em>Pikmin 4</em> demo.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixes Related to Auto Target Lock</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added a setting that makes it so the cursor is not locked in place from repeatedly pressing the A Button while Auto Target Lock is set to “Off.”
<ul>
<li>Note: You can switch between “On” and “Off” by opening the Pause menu (- Button), selecting “Settings,” and going to “Tap A Repeatedly to Lock.” (This is set to “Off” by default.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Additional Button Guide</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>An explanation will now appear in screen while in “Photo Mode” when using the Field Camera indicating that you can move the camera up or down using the up and down direction buttons on the Joy-Con (L) (or the up and down buttons on the +Control Pad of the Nintendo Switch Pro Controller).</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed other issues to improve the gameplay experience.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: A patch with the same changes has also been distributed for the <em>Pikmin 4</em> demo. The demo version cannot send Decor Pikmin information to the Pikmin Bloom smart device application.</p>
<hr>
<p>This follows recent calls from fans for a Switch 2 upgrade for Pikmin 4, after an odd listing was spotted on the eShop earlier this month.</p>
<p>In some other update news, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_tennis_aces">Mario Tennis Aces</a> on the Switch has been <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/29137">updated to Version 3.1.1</a> today.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ditch-your-old-soundbar-for-good-sonos-beam-hits-record-low-one-week-before-christmas-on-amazon-2000653981</link>
            <guid>1385506</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>TV audio quality has improved dramatically over the years, but slim modern displays sacrifice speaker quality for sleek designs and leave you with tinny sound that undermines your viewing experience. Finding space for full surround sound systems proves challenging in apartments or smaller living rooms where bulky speakers and subwoofers simply don’t fit the layout.</p>
<p>Sonos has built its reputation on delivering premium audio in compact formats and the Beam (Gen 2) addresses the soundbar needs of space-conscious homes without compromising performance: This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/">Dolby Atmos soundbar currently sells for $369 on Amazon, down from its regular $499 price</a>, and marks an all-time low for one of the most respected names in home audio.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5728/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A small package with immersive audio</h2>
<p>The <strong>Dolby Atmos support makes soundscapes that are three-dimensional</strong> and puts sounds above, around, and next to you instead of just in front of you. This adds depth that regular stereo soundbars can’t match. Height channels bounce sound off your ceiling to make it sound like helicopters are flying by or rain is falling from above. This makes the scenes feel more real. The effect works best in rooms with flat ceilings that are less than 10 feet high. It can’t match dedicated ceiling speakers, but the virtual height makes the soundstage seem very big.</p>
<p>One of the most common complaints about TV audio is that voices get lost in music and sound effects and the <strong>crystal clear dialogue reproduction</strong> fixes this. Sonos designed a separate center channel processing system that focuses on vocal frequencies, so you can hear every word without having to change the volume all the time. Speech Enhancement mode makes speech even clearer when needed. This is helpful during shows with strong accents or lines that are hard to understand that would otherwise need subtitles.</p>



<p>The <strong>200-watt maximum output</strong> gives you enough volume to fill medium to large rooms without distortion. It also pushes clean sound even when the volume is high, when cheaper soundbars start to crackle. The frequency response goes down to 50.4Hz, which gives explosions and music a nice bass presence without needing a subwoofer. You’ll feel the low-end impact during action scenes and bass-heavy songs, but bass lovers might want to get Sonos’ dedicated Sub for really low frequencies that shake the room. The<strong> small size of 25.6 inches wide</strong> makes it easy to fit under most TVs without blocking screens or making entertainment centers too big.</p>
<p>The <strong>Trueplay tuning technology uses the microphone on your iPhone or iPad to figure out how sound travels in your room</strong> and then automatically changes the soundbar’s output for the best sound. The app plays test tones while you walk around the room. It measures how sound bounces off of walls, furniture, and ceilings to make a custom EQ profile. This calibration makes up for acoustic problems like putting speakers in corners or on bare walls, which would otherwise change the sound. This makes sure that the sound is always the same, no matter how the room is set up.</p>



<p>You only need two cables to set it up: The HDMI eARC cable connects to your TV for sound, and the power cable plugs into an outlet. With an HDMI connection, all of your TV’s audio sources can be sent through a single cable which means you don’t have to connect each device directly to the soundbar. The Beam knows when you turn on your TV and turns on automatically. You can also use your current TV remote to change the volume without having to program anything else.</p>
<p>Getting the Sonos Beam Gen 2 for $369 is a great deal because it’s the lowest price this model has ever been at and you’re getting high-quality audio engineering from a top company. The lowest price ever makes Sonos quality affordable for people who thought it was too expensive before, and the timing right before the holiday season makes it the perfect time to upgrade.</p>
