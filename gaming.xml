            <p>
Activision has announced a new game development studio opened in Poland named Elsewhere Entertainment.
</p>
<p>
Based in Warsaw with additional resources in the US, the studio is developing a "new narrative-based and genre-defining AAA franchise".
</p>
<p>
It's the second Activision studio in the country after the Krakow-based Infinity Ward Poland and, while this is its public unveiling, it's already been working on its first project.

<p>
That explains why a new studio announcement comes a week after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">Microsoft closed Bethesda studios Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks, and Alpha Dog Games</a>. Microsoft's subsidiaries have separate budgets and <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/activision-and-microsoft-are-opening-a-new-game-studio-in-poland-elsewhere-entertainment-with-a-totally-new-ip">Windows Central</a> reports Elsewhere has been operating for some time.
</p>
<p>
So what new project could Elsewhere be working on? There are no details yet beyond it being "narrative-based", with the studio aiming to craft a "franchise with an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games". It certainly sounds ambitious.
</p>
<p>
The studio includes "storytelling experts" from franchises like The Last of Us, The Witcher, Cyberpunk 2077, Uncharted, Far Cry and more. It is not working on a Call of Duty game.
</p>
<p>
The studio is also seeking talent to join its ranks, so presumably its first project remains a long way off.
</p>
<p>
It's certainly some positive news after last week's shock closures. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-president-responds-to-studio-closures-as-commitment-to-make-sure-that-the-business-is-healthy-for-the-long-term">Xbox president Sarah Bond responded</a> soon afterwards in an interview with Bloomberg, describing studio closures as a "commitment to make sure that the business is healthy for the long term".

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-creator-praised-good-situation-in-our-studio-and-freedom-of-risk-taking-a-month-before-closure">Hi-Fi Rush creative director John Johanas</a> had described a "good situation in our studio" just a month ahead of its closure.

  <p id="iSYIY4">We are thrilled to announce Polygon’s latest book: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Year-Ring-Susana-Polo/dp/B0CTYGTKC6/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=&amp;tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Year-Ring-Susana-Polo/dp/B0CTYGTKC6/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23920713__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026_encoding=UTF8\u0026qid=\u0026sr=\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23920713__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;_encoding&quot;:&quot;UTF8&quot;,&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;sr&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}"><em>Year of the Ring</em></a>, an in-depth exploration of Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy and the books that inspired them. <em>Year of the Ring</em> — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/year-of-the-ring">authored by Susana Polo and a variety of Polygon contributors</a> — will hit stores on Oct. 15, 2024, kicking off Polygon Pages, an ongoing publishing partnership with Insight Editions.</p>
<p id="60BZl2">Here’s how our publisher describes the book: </p>
<blockquote><p id="WNmJfp"><em>Year of the Ring</em> is a beautiful hardcover volume that chronicles the origins and incarnations of J.R.R. Tolkien’s foundational text as it has wended its way towards leaving an indelible stamp on pop culture. The book charts the history of Lord of the Rings from Tolkien’s original books up through Peter Jackson’s landmark trilogy of adaptations and the lasting cultural impact they’ve all left on mass culture. <em>Year of the Ring</em> is an absolute treasure trove for fans of the series and those of us out there who’ve found Tolkien’s fantastically imaginative world difficult to leave.</p></blockquote>
<p id="I8Eych">The book pulls from Polygon’s yearlong <a href="https://www.polygon.com/year-of-the-ring">Year of the Ring editorial package</a>, in which Polo partnered with writers, authors, and fans to revisit the iconic films in new ways. Molly Ostertag wrote about <a href="https://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings/22550950/sam-frodo-queer-romance-lord-of-the-rings-tolkien-quotes">queer readings</a> of the series. The “other” actor who played Gimli <a href="https://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings/22535564/lotr-gimli-actor-double-brett-beattie-cast-fellowship-tattoo">told his tale</a> of life on set. We even uncovered <a href="https://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings/22283921/peter-jackson-movies-lotr-alternate-versions-weinstein">Peter Jackson’s original two-movie pitch</a> for the series.</p>
<p id="Ux56bF">In the coming months, we’ll have news on additional books in the Polygon Pages series. We’re so excited to continue our history of producing awesome, beautiful, and informative books about the stuff we love!

Well, it’s the single <em>least </em>important door in the world. In fact, it’s the reverse side of the door <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-mario-games-galaxy-world-64-sunshine-kart-odyssey-1851325267&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-mario-games-galaxy-world-64-sunshine-kart-odyssey-1851325267">Mario</a></span> exits after getting the star at the end of the slide section of the level. That’s right, we’ve actually all <em>been</em> on the other side of the door and know damn well what it’s hiding—it’s just we haven’t been able to get back in.</p><p>Once you exit the door, you’re dropped right back into the main section of the level, next to the mother penguin who insists you find her kid and bring them back to her. The problem is the outside of the door doesn’t have a knob, and doesn’t allow you back through. Though I remember trying to go back through the door and failing as a kid, I didn’t realize that some folks hadn’t just <em>moved on</em> from it. Now, pannenkoek2012 has cracked this decades-long quest wide open thanks to some light platforming and knowledge of <em>Super Mario 64</em>’s coding logic.</p><p>According to their video, the biggest impediment to opening the door from the outside is the fact that the cabin walls around the entrance have collision that literally blocks the way to it. If you’ve ever tried to open the door yourself, you’ll know that Mario just kind of winds up shimmying against an invisible wall in front of the door. However, by hacking the game and removing the walls, pannenkoek2012 discovered that simply walking up to the door <em>would</em> open it, which led them to consider if it might be possible to open without hacks.<br></p><p>It turns out that by manipulating the game’s logic, you absolutely can open the door. The door’s hitbox (and this is true of every door in the game) requires that Mario be walking into the door in order to open it. Since the cabin walls’ collision barred Mario from interacting with the hitbox, it’s physically impossible to accomplish by normal means. But by manipulating the AI of the mother penguin (whose hitbox pushes Mario outwards) it’s possible to just barely clip Mario into the door enough to have him open it. Though players have found that jumping over the mother penguin into the door would send Mario free falling through the level’s geometry, someone who goes by the Discord username Alexpalix1 discovered that by turning around immediately after the free fall (which sets Mario’s condition to walking), you would miraculously be able to collide with the door’s hitbox and open it from the outside.</p><p>Naturally, pannenkoek2012 tried to apply this newfound exploit to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/awesome-games-done-quick-2024-agdq-shiba-inu-1850939684&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/awesome-games-done-quick-2024-agdq-shiba-inu-1850939684">speedrunning</a></span> and see if it was a quicker strategy than the pre-established route. Though they found that it didn’t really save time, the discovery of the tech itself could pave the way for optimizations down the road.</p><p>Even though the door leads to a room we’re all very familiar with, and contains no secrets, it’s always neat to see <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-shadow-of-the-colossus-remakes-big-new-secret-is-a-1822871508&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-shadow-of-the-colossus-remakes-big-new-secret-is-a-1822871508">communities come together</a></span> to solve mysteries like this. <em>Super Mario 64 </em>players in particular have been trying to crack that game wide open for a long while now, and seeing the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-mario-64-youtube-sm64-nintendo-secret-1up-hidden-1850214597&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-64-youtube-sm64-nintendo-secret-1up-hidden-1850214597">fruits of their labor</a></span> is always pretty incredible.

<p>In an interview with Insider Gaming in February, SCI CEO Ash Habib talked about the game’s development and its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-undisputed-boxing-development-now-focused-on-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">focus on the console release</a> after launching the career mode in beta for those on PC.</p>



<p><strong>“We’re fully focused on our console development,” </strong>Habib said at the time. <strong>“We’re going through that process right now in terms of getting us to that version one launch on consoles.</strong> <strong>Launching the game on Steam or PC platforms is a completely different ballgame when it comes to consoles, so we’re just navigating that path at the moment.”</strong></p>



<p>In addition the game’s release on Xbox Series X|S and PS5, SCI has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWCw6ZHrPPo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reworking a number of gameplay elements</a> to add to the realistic feel of the game and how the fighters move and act within the ring.</p>

                <p>Apple recently changed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apples-new-rules-mean-theres-a-game-emulator-on-the-app-store-now/1100-6522747/">App Store guidelines</a> to allow retro-gaming emulators to be downloaded on iOS, and that's led to a flood of such apps on the storefront. Now, the popular PSP emulator PPSSPP is sizzling the sales charts, as is the multi-system RetroArch.</p><p dir="ltr">RetroArch is one of the biggest names in the world of emulation, as it's essentially a front-end for dozens of emulator "cores" that support a wide variety of consoles, from the Atari on down. However, it's PPSSPP that's really garnered a lot of attention on the App Store, as it currently sits at #3 on the most-downloaded <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/charts/iphone/top-free-apps/36" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">free app charts</a>. RetroArch is sitting comfortably at #16.</p><p dir="ltr">Several emulators (such as Delta) have been available on iOS through unofficial means for years, using workarounds and "sideloaded" apps through alternatives like the AltStore. However, it's worth noting that Apple's guidelines still prevent developers from providing (pirated) copies of the games that these emulators are designed to play, and the long-term future of emulators on the App Store has yet to be determined.</p><p dir="ltr">Apple changed its rules in response to the EU's recent Digital Markets Act, which expressly prohibits the "walled garden" approach that the tech giant has applied to the App Store for decades. Though these rules were motivated by this EU-only law, the regulations apply to developers worldwide.</p>

These practices are essential to understanding the impact, legacy, and importance of the franchise and help explain why the games continue to enjoy cultural cachet rather than&nbsp; being merely historically interesting. They raise provocative questions about the intersection between forms of authorship, notions of personal and shared ownership, and the power of player communities to sustain a fantasy universe long after it has ceased to be an attractive commercial property.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While a strong sense of ownership can be a double-edged sword—inspiring players’ loyalty&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>and</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;fostering their desire for meaningful control—it is central to the long-standing success of the series. Devoted players and fans occupy a distinct role in the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;universe by documenting, extending, and analyzing the games with an incredible attention to detail. Game studies scholars Melanie Swalwell, Helen Stuckey, and Angela Ndalianis (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/sf268776w/OEBPS/xhtml/ch15.xhtml#r274">2017</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) argue that the work of game fans can be considered in a variety of ways: “It is time to recognize the impact and centrality of video game fan communities—as a collective intelligence, as a pool of individual creators of games and as interested and engaged parties in the collecting and remembering of game history” (1).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the case of the first&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, original copies of physical game media and packaging are rare, and finding functional solutions for playing the earliest releases on discontinued media formats like the 1980s floppy disk can range from challenging to impossible. The popularity of the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;series has resulted in a number of reissues and remastered versions, but remakes usually lack the physical artifacts and packaging in ways that substantially alter the original play experience. Fan preservation efforts help maintain evidence of these materials. Both preservation (including emulation projects) and documentation efforts illustrate fans’ collective sense of ownership and the cultivation and sharing of player expertise. They also make clear the centrality of community to many games, including single-player titles. If games without players are incomplete, then player communities are indispensable for maintaining and recreating those primary and supporting materials necessary for accessing what the game might have looked and felt like on its initial release. Further, as Anastasia Marie Salter (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/sf268776w/OEBPS/xhtml/ch15.xhtml#r255">2009</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) suggests, the locus of game authorship can actually change over time. Writing about classic adventure games, they note: “Authorship of these games has changed hands: it is now under the control of the fans, the former and current players” (0.1). To some degree, this is true of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Organizations like the Ultima Dragons Internet Chapter (UDIC) and websites and repositories like the Ultima Codex represent game emulation and preservation efforts that breathe life into aging franchises. Some of these initiatives are extremely long running. For example, UDIC was initially founded in 1992 on the online service Prodigy and remains active more than three decades later. The Ultima Codex positions itself as a fan network, offering a rich collection of news items and documentation&nbsp;related to everything&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, including an&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-focused podcast and a vast wiki cataloging all of the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;titles in great detail. A separate wiki hosted at Fandom.com boasts of 2,994 articles related to the series (Ultima Wiki&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/sf268776w/OEBPS/xhtml/ch15.xhtml#r297">n.d.</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">). More general repositories of video game knowledge also demonstrate the devotion of fans. The Museum of Computer Game Adventure History, launched in 2001 by Howard Feldman, currently has scans of 49 different editions of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;games. While this website is substantial, it still isn’t as exhaustive as Stephen Emond’s&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Ultimate Collector’s Edition</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;(</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/sf268776w/OEBPS/xhtml/ch15.xhtml#r139">2012</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">). This tome spans 826 pages, covering 520 different releases of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;games and cataloging a total of 955 distinct items, which is unique in its inventory of international editions of the games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a genre, RPGs across media invite player engagement in distinct ways. This sense of immersion through player-customized characters in an expansive world complete with its own culture, history, and reality has proven to have exceptional stickiness for those who continue playing and replaying the games for years or even decades. In the case of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, this long-term engagement has kept this analog tabletop title—and its many iterations across media—commercially viable for decades. Its current publishers regularly update it, and the game supports an entire microindustry. But in the case of computer games, this longer engagement represents a complicated commitment. Changes in technology can result in games quickly becoming inaccessible. For instance, publishers stop supporting servers needed for online play once a title has faded in popularity or when it becomes financially problematic. Or supplementary paratexts that complete games may be lost or damaged with the passage of time. These types of challenges are understandable at a production level. Maintaining servers and support staff can be expensive, as can the fabrication of physical goods. Even during its initial release, the metal feelies of the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;universe were borderline cost prohibitive. Decades later, these titles have become of more niche interest and, as game distribution has increasingly moved towards digital channels, reproducing the feelies would increase production and distribution costs considerably.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, these games are incomplete without their paratexts, just as they are incomplete without their players. Preservation and documentation efforts that make, at the very least, information about the games’ paratexts available serve a critical role in keeping the games playable and at least passably complete. These projects, carried out through online efforts like the Ultima Codex or the High-Resolution Ultima Map Project (HRUMP) offer a corrective to the type of digitally driven reissues that make up the bread and butter of digital game distribution businesses like Good Old Games (GOG.com). There, games are ported to modern machines and stripped of their initial, physical context—we get the game, but are typically denied the out-of-box accessories and multimodal thresholds. While many editions include digital versions of physical artifacts, these function differently than their physical counterparts. This is what the market can support, perhaps, but it is neither an accurate representation of what the game was, nor is it likely what fans would prefer under ideal circumstances.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sites like the Museum of Computer Game Adventure History carefully catalog the packaging and other paratexts of numerous games in an act of fan-driven documentation that serves as a corrective to the games’ digital decontextualization. Ironically, these otherwise orderly sites also embrace a certain unruliness when it comes to corporate control of commercial products that are formational for communities. They exist as sometimes radical remedies, providing through informal channels something the market will no longer bear. Emulation and reproduction efforts bring this tension into sharper relief. That is, while Electronic Arts&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>de jure</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;owns&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;outright, its de facto ownership is much muddier. These types of volunteer efforts are driven by connection, by love—for the games, for the community, for the medium, and for the present and past of all three. If games are only completed with player participation, older games are most completely realized in their fan-preserved incarnations, in collective memory, and in ongoing play; or, in what game historian Raiford Guins (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/sf268776w/OEBPS/xhtml/ch15.xhtml#r166">2014</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) terms, their “afterlife.”</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Here Be Ultima Dragons">Here Be Ultima Dragons</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Members of the Ultima Dragons Internet Chapter (UDIC) are at the forefront of these efforts. If someone is involved in anything&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-related, and if they’re using an online name with “Dragon” in it, they’re almost certainly a UDIC member. The fan group today boasts nearly 16,000 members on its official website roster, where members are individually listed by their Dragon name, human name, and their UDIC email address. UDIC also lists a similar number of members on its public Facebook group, where members discuss&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-related projects of their own, ask for help accessing or playing the games, and share a diversity of content ranging from RPG-related memes to science reporting, to Halloween decorating tips (“Ultima Dragons&nbsp;Page 144 →Internet Chapter Facebook”&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/sf268776w/OEBPS/xhtml/ch15.xhtml#r296">n.d.</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">). Dragons talk shop about gameplay, share obscure lore, celebrate&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-related news, make their own series-inspired projects, and meticulously document anything that may be remotely related to&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Their efforts are central to&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s afterlife. At the UDIC website, membership is open to those who “have played an&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, are willing to help others with their&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;questions, and would like to be a member of the Ultima Dragons.” Prospective members can join via email or by a short questionnaire that asks for some biographical information, which&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;titles the applicant has played and/or completed, and what their Dragon name should be (“UDIC – Ultima Dragons Internet Chapter”&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/sf268776w/OEBPS/xhtml/ch15.xhtml#r290">n.d.</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">). On the last point, the site offers this tip: “Don’t pick something that’s been in an&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">; pick something that ought to be. ‘Dragon’ will be automatically appended. You may want to check the master roster of current members before choosing a dragon name.” A last requirement is made explicit elsewhere on the site: prospective members must provide a “real name.” The transparency about membership—the membership roster is public on both the Facebook group and the UDIC website—and the visibility of real names are indicative of the age of the community (as is the site’s late-1990s design aesthetics that, once generic,&nbsp;now convey a distinctive visual style). In fact, providing a real name and having played an&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;game are the only two requirements for joining, and Fallible Dragon offers the following explanation for the name policy:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">First, where it asks for real name, you have to type in your real name. If you’re really concerned, you can use your first initial and your last name. But it has to be your real name. The whole thing. “John” alone won’t cut it. We want to see “John Doe” or “J. Doe”.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is a question of honesty and respect. You being honest with the rest of the club and respecting us, and the rest of the club respecting you in return. How can we respect you if you don’t feel we’re worthy of knowing your name? If you really don’t want to give out your real name, then you’re welcome to lurk and participate in the activities, but please don’t waste your time by filling out an application.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">(“Dragon Requirements”&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/sf268776w/OEBPS/xhtml/ch15.xhtml#r134">n.d.</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Research on the implications of real-name policies suggests that they can reduce antisocial behaviors at the aggregate level, shaping community norms and discourse (Cho, Kim, and Acquisti&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/sf268776w/OEBPS/xhtml/ch15.xhtml#r118">2012</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">). This policy is, effectively, a community management practice that shapes the UDIC, and the UDIC, as an exceptionally visible group, shapes the collective experience of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Further, the mixing of real names and dragon names interpellates community members through the types of naming practices that exist throughout the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;universe. Here, you are a person who exists in the real world and as a character all at once. The language of the name policy is reflective of the kinds of values integrated across the series. Honesty, respect, and worth may sound like a heavy burden for an internet community made up of members with names like Rainbow Dragon to bear, but this dual emphasis on personal values&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>and</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;a sense of play are central to the series and its community.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Devotees of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, like the members of UDIC, cannot help but engage with questions of values because those questions are central to the series. The players understand community behaviors and norms as a matter of values, and they directly and indirectly point towards the games as moral texts. In preserving the games and shaping a community, UDIC exhibits a central concern with integrity—of member behavior and of the game world, which is viewed as something to be preserved and supplemented with careful fidelity. This investment in the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;franchise can reflect a certain degree of reverence, but it also invites a sense of ownership. After all, many UDIC members are experts on the games, and a fundamental function of the group is to grow and to share that expertise. This use of expertise goes far beyond playing with the games as once published and extends into efforts aimed at preservation and immersion.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In many real ways,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;fans are the series’ historians and its guardians. Indeed, because the games’ original developers no longer have the intellectual property rights to the brand and lack the liberties available to fans as producers of transformative works, fans protect the series’ legacy to a greater extent than the original producers.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Authorship and Ownership">Authorship and Ownership</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fan-driven projects can raise the visibility and usability of historic games, such as those preserved through multiple arcade machine emulation (MAME). While original&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;paratexts and ephemera may be difficult to locate today, fan projects provide and expand on information that can substitute for these missing materials. They can also provide insights into the aspects of the games players find particularly compelling. For example, fan-made tourism brochures reveal a loving devotion to the games’ cultural and geographic landscapes. But more importantly, these practices demonstrate the degree to which&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;is for many players a fully-rendered world. In both drawing from and extending the series’ narrative universe, fan works participate in metalepsis, a narrative practice articulated by French literary theorist Gerard Genette (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/sf268776w/OEBPS/xhtml/ch15.xhtml#r156">1980</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, 234–236). Tisha Turk (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/sf268776w/OEBPS/xhtml/ch15.xhtml#r287">2011</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">), who studies fan videos, describes how these projects engage in metalepsis: “These fan works are both texts in their own right and supplements (in the Derridean sense) to the original source material: fan works supplement texts that are already complete, but always with the shadow meaning, the possibility, of adding&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>in order to</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;complete” (83–84).&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;fan works both assume that Sosaria and Britannia are real worlds&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>and</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;that they can supplement what is available in the official canon—a process that they first initiate through character-creation. Later, as they become well-versed in the games, players sometimes invest time in producing supplements and utilities they would find useful or those they think will make the games more accessible by expanding the series’ spaces and stories. Yes—fans document&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;but they also iterate on it. Fan works can preserve and conserve the original, world-building efforts. Furthermore, they can also correct, complicate, adapt, and expand those realms. These practices build worlds upon worlds, offering experiences that are anchored in but are nevertheless distinct from the original titles.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion: Whose Game World Is It?">Conclusion: Whose Game World Is It?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many of the expansion, documentation, and preservation efforts of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;players fall into an awkward status with regards to copyright. These projects are overwhelmingly small-scale and are noncommercial in nature. And while some creators are hit with cease-and-desist letters, most produce works that extend the broader&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;world without incurring the ire of lawyers. Writing about fan practices around adventure games, Salter notes that copyright does not always curtail fan creation because fans either ignore it or because the projects are deemed to be transformative works. In reproducing or expanding the games, fans become creators in their own right. Salter (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/sf268776w/OEBPS/xhtml/ch15.xhtml#r255">2009</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) notes:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fan creators of the classic adventure game movement can also be identified as cocreators, as they are in dialogue with the work of the original developers[…]. Fan authorship co-opts material from the existing games without requiring the game itself. A game authored by a fan stands on its own and is playable as a complete structure. It is informed by the original, and may even be an exacting remake of the original, but it is developed separately.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players, then, pursue diverse activities that preserve and document games. They also engage in metaleptical practices that extend and&nbsp;conceivably complete the games as well. Through these activities, fans claim ownership of the game world, either directly (as in reproductions or extensions of the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;franchise) or indirectly (through documentation and preservation). They build on the customization and personalization of game experiences, moving from sanctioned to unsanctioned types of engagement and remaking CRPGs and their game worlds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Like all digital and analog games, the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;series present partial gaming texts—systems that are incomplete without players and their gameplay practices. Even when these games were new, players created resources for one another. And as the games have aged, fans increasingly claim ownership and actively participate in various acts of authorship. Without fans extending the game experience,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;would largely be mothballed. Instead, their robust activities keep the games circulating in popular culture.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;titles demonstrate how vital community can be for a game series. The fan community that grew up with the series provided dependable commercial support when the games were first released. But its community has, over time, evolved to become central to others’&nbsp;experiences of the franchise. Fans like those who join UDIC play&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but—as importantly—they also&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>play with</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;it, expanding its world with works of their own, experimenting with what the narrative limits of that world might be, and mentoring others in the skills and the knowledge needed to participate in the community. Richard Garriott and Origin Systems built the first generation of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;worlds, but the series endures and maintains its landmark status because fans have stepped into the creative void as its collective of world-builders and world-preservers.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The studio is based in Warsaw, Poland, and, according to a report from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-opens-new-studio-tasked-with-creating-narrative-based-aaa-franchise"><em>IGN</em></a>, it is not working on a Call of Duty-related project.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This studio, which has been formed behind-the-scenes before today's public unveiling, arrives roughly one week after <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/07/xbox-is-shutting-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-more">Xbox closed four Bethesda studios</a>, including <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/hi-fi-rush/riff-city">Hi-Fi Rush</a> developer Tango Gameworks and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/redfall/a-life-draining-trip-to-new-england">Redfall</a> team Arkane Austin. While the company has yet to publicly address the closures directly, Xbox president Sarah Bond said in an interview that <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/10/xbox-president-addresses-bethesda-studio-closures-says-its-about-keeping-business">the closures were about keeping the business healthy in the long-term</a>. It's why news of this new studio might be surprising, given one week ago, the parent company of Activision was closing studios to cut costs.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Built from the ground up, Elsewhere Entertainment is a premier and standalone studio dedicated to establishing an environment that inspires bold and diverse ideas," a <a href="https://www.activision.com/blog/activision/2024/activision-announces-new-studio-elsewhere-entertainment-all-new-franchise-development">blog post</a> reads. "The team's underlying mission encourages everyone to explore and collaborate creatively to craft a franchise with an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games. [The] new studio has full access to Activision's resources and tools as it continues to increase production and development.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Elsewhere is opening its search for best-in-class talent from across the industry and around the world to help create a state-of-the-art and next generation gaming experience."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elsewhere is currently made up of developers with experience working on franchises like The Last of Us, Uncharted, The Witcher, Cyberpunk 2077, Destiny, Tom Clancy's The Division, and Far Cry.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="232" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Remember the rumours of 2017’s <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-horizon-zero-dawn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Horizon Zero Dawn</a></em> getting <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remaster-remake-ps5-rumor-sie-guerrilla-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a PlayStation 5 remaster</a>? No such project has been formally confirmed, but the newest <em>Horizon</em> related rumour says we’re instead getting some kind of Lego spin-off.</p> <p data-characters="549" data-current-count="549" data-injectable="true">A trademark for something called <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> was recently discovered by <a href="https://twitter.com/Kurakasis/status/1791073620069929442" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter user Kurakasis</a>, the same person who <a href="https://twitter.com/Kurakasis/status/1745225191762870283" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">uncovered the title of Microsoft’s <em>Indiana Jones</em> game</a> before its official reveal. Shortly afterwards, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-horizon-adventures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson</a> claimed to have heard from his own sources that this is referring to what was only described as “<em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> but Lego.” The only other detail Henderson added was that the game will have “realistic graphics,” which is strange for a Lego game.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>LEGO Horizon Adventures</p><p>This is the name of the project that is going to be announced at the upcoming PlayStation event</p><p>I don't know if it's a game</p></div>— Kurakasis (@Kurakasis) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kurakasis/status/1791073620069929442?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="524" data-current-count="824" data-injectable="true">As bizarre as the concept may sound, Sony and Lego did collaborate on an official Lego set based on the <em>Horizon</em> series. Plus, not too long ago, Lego entered a big partnership with Epic Games for <em>Lego Fortnite</em>, which suggests the Lego company is still looking to expand for new ways to expand into gaming. Henderson hasn’t mentioned, though, whether <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> would recreate the original <em>Forbidden West</em>‘s gameplay or be more in line with previous Lego titles like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a></em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="460" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true">Assuming such a project exists, it could potentially make an appearance at the similarly rumoured PlayStation showcase that’s supposedly happening soon. It’s been suggested one will take place before the end of May, and it’s not unreasonable to assume that’s the case. Sony held a big gaming showcase in May 2023 as well, and we are coming up to what was once E3 season; the time of year where publishers share big gaming announcements.</p>
 <p data-characters="436" data-current-count="436" data-injectable="false">Sony’s first-party output is also looking incredibly slim. Aside from live service title <em>Concord</em> (which is aiming for a 2024 launch), Sony has no other first-party exclusives on its release schedule, with the likes of Insomniac’s <em>Wolverine</em> game and Bungie’s <em>Marathon</em> reboot lacking any sort of launch window. <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> would at least be something, though probably not what most PS5 owners are asking for.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-elsewhere-entertainment<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Activision has announced a brand new studio called Elsewhere Entertainment. Based in Poland, the studio consists of industry vets who've worked on games like <i>The Last of Us</i>&nbsp;and <i>The Witcher</i>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blog.activision.com/activision/2024/activision-announces-new-studio-elsewhere-entertainment-all-new-franchise-development" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a blog post on its official website</a>, Activision says that Elsewhere, which is an internal development studio, is currently hard at work on "a new narrative-based and genre-defining AAA franchise".</p>
<p>The company also says Elsewhere's new franchise will create "an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games", potentially suggesting that multimedia projects based on said franchise could also be in the works.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/far-cry-5-activision-elsewhere.jpg?itok=ijLIhz_i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/far-cry-5-activision-elsewhere.jpg?itok=cnZ0CTxp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Elsewhere Entertainment consists of veterans from franchises like&nbsp;<em>Far Cry</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Activision, Elsewhere's staffers have worked on franchises like "<em>The Last of Us</em>,&nbsp;<em>Uncharted</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Witcher</em>,&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk</em>,&nbsp;<em>Destiny</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tom Clancy's The Division</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Far Cry</em>".</p>
<p>Since the announcement is relatively brief, it's not clear exactly which staffers Elsewhere has on board from those franchises, nor do we know how they're contributing to the studio's inaugural project.</p>
<p>However, we do know that Elsewhere will have "full access to Activision's resources" as it "continues to increase production and development", and that the studio is "opening its search for best-in-class talent".</p>
<p>Obviously, Elsewhere's debut game isn't ready to reveal yet, but we may well learn more about it in the coming months.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-last-of-us-part-i-elsewhere-activision.jpg?itok=rhQIQAWZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-last-of-us-part-i-elsewhere-activision.jpg?itok=UI1geM7w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>is just one of the all-star franchises that staffers from Activision's new studio Elsewhere have apparently been involved in.</figcaption></figure><p>Elsewhere's formation comes as Activision's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-activision-blizzard-merger-finalized">parent company</a> Microsoft finds itself under the microscope for what many consider to be its questionable recent decisions.</p>
<p>Recently, Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">shut down</a>&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>creator Arkane Austin and&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>studio Tango Gameworks, as well as two other studios, shortly before declaring that the Xbox brand <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-smaller-games-comment-hi-fi-rush">needed "smaller games"</a> to garner prestige and awards.</p>
<p>Those decisions were made following a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report">round of layoffs</a> that saw Microsoft letting go of almost 2,000 employees. There's probably a lot of number-crunching we're not seeing behind the scenes, but Activision opening a new studio in the wake of all of that seems...interesting.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what Elsewhere Entertainment comes up with for its first game. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/your-apple-tv-may-have-become-one-of-the-best-retro-gaming-devices-out-there-overnight.873003/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24158137/apple-tv-video-game-emulators-retroarch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="lDsq6f">The RetroArch video game emulation frontend was <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/retroarch/id6499539433">released on the iOS App Store</a> yesterday, alongside popular <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ppsspp-psp-emulator/id6496972903">PSP emulator PPSSPP</a> (itself a core available in RetroArch). </p>
<p id="ed09Ik">While the popular and more elegant Delta emulator emulates six Nintendo consoles for iOS at the moment, RetroArch’s somewhat unwieldy UI brings support for a wild 78 (!) emulators covering a wide range of console and computer systems. But it also brings one other notable feature: It’s the first emulator to be released for Apple’s tvOS App Store, as spotted by <a href="https://www.threads.net/@sigjudge/post/C7AYptfofLI">MacStories’ Sigmund Judge</a>. </p>
<p id="E6A5pC">And that’s all because of a historic change in policy from Apple. In March, the company released an iOS update that included concessions to comply with the European Union’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), which forced the tech giant to open its platform to alternative app marketplaces in Europe. Of course, one reason a user might travel outside of Apple’s walled garden would be to acquire a video game emulator, and Apple changed a long-standing policy to allow video game emulators a month later, in an effort to head off that eventuality.</p>

<p id="qdtXOL">Before RetroArch’s release, it was technically possible to use game emulators on Apple TV via AirPlay, effectively casting Delta to the Apple TV. But native support means no casting latency, and the ability to use an actual gamepad instead of your phone’s slippery glass screen. With RetroArch, you’ll be able to play games from classic Sega systems like the Master System, Genesis and Saturn, as well as more obscure consoles like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watara_Supervision">Watara Supervision</a>. </p>

<p id="bxJFaC">As access to video game emulators becomes simpler, and the hardware more capable of providing a high quality experience — like playing Sega Genesis games on an Apple TV for example — the emulation community, and the platforms that they are being distributed on, are creating a moment similar to that of the iPod in the early aughts. The technology existed to play MP3 files, but it wasn’t until the iPod’s release that it became truly mainstream. And once playing MP3s was easy, the question of where you got all those MP3s from in the first place changed music distribution forever, first with the iTunes Store and later streaming services like Spotify. </p>
<p id="6tum7z">You can find <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/retroarch/id6499539433">RetroArch</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688">Delta</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ppsspp-psp-emulator/id6496972903">PPSSPP</a> on the App Store today. And if you’re so inclined, let us know in the comments if you’re interested in using your Apple TV for retro games.

<p>Activision <a href="https://blog.activision.com/activision/2024/activision-announces-new-studio-elsewhere-entertainment-all-new-franchise-development" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has announced it’s opening</a> a brand new AAA studio based in Poland called Elsewhere Entertainment. This new studio will be “exclusively focused on creating a new narrative-based and genre-defining AAA franchise.”</p>



<p>“Built from the ground up, Elsewhere Entertainment is a premier and standalone studio dedicated to establishing an environment that inspires bold and diverse ideas,” Activision said. “The team’s underlying mission encourages everyone to explore and collaborate creatively to craft a franchise with an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games.”</p>

It's available to preorder at <a href="https://zdcs.link/Y0lkd" target="_blank">Best Buy</a>.</p><p>Though EA has yet to provide a gameplay trailer for College Football 25, the publisher confirmed that a "full reveal" is coming tomorrow, May 17.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-25-deluxe-edition-cover-leaked-online">previously confirmed</a> by leaks, College Football 25's Standard Edition cover features Texas quarterback Quinn Ewers, Colorado wide receiver Travis Hunter, and Michigan running back Donovan Edwards. The Deluxe Edition cover features the same three athletes at the center and players from different schools in the background, such as Georgia quarterback Carson Beck, Ohio State running back Quinshon Judkins, and Alabama quarterback Jalen Milroe.</p><div id="200704"><p>Out July 19</p><p><h3>College Football 25</h3></p><div><p>Free $5 Best Buy credit with preorder.</p></div></div><p>"Donovan, Quinn and Travis are extraordinary talents who impressed and entertained millions of college football fans on the field last season and are poised to do so again this year," EA Sports SVP and Group GM Daryl Holt commented. "We’re proud to be able to incorporate thousands of current athletes in College Football 25, and featuring this trio of playmakers and their iconic college programs on the cover is a perfect fit as we usher in a new era for EA Sports and college football. I can't wait for the world to learn more about the game tomorrow."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>College Football 25 Standard and Deluxe Edition Covers Reveal</h3></div></output><p>Before today's official reveal, news on the next college football video game has been slim. The PlayStation Store leak that occured last week revealed not only the Deluxe Edition cover, but <a href="https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6640db93966b70e6c5c909d3/EACF25/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&amp;crop=1655,932,x0,y19,safe&amp;width=1440" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a screenshot of gameplay</a> featuring players from the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team exiting the tunnel and heading onto the field. </p><p>In February, EA dropped <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-full-reveal-coming-this-may">an official teaser trailer</a> showing development concepts, such as players from the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team tapping the "Play Like a Champion Today" sign before heading into the tunnel. </p><p>Following the teaser announcement in early February, EA Sports revealed to <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/39574788/players-opting-ea-sports-college-football-25-get-600" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN</a> some <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-player-compensation-revealed">new details for College Football 25</a>. This includes confirmation that all 134 FBS football programs will be included, how much players who opt-in will be paid for using their likeness in the game, while those who do not opt-in will not be allowed to create themselves as a playable character, as well as reaffirming that Dynasty and Road to Glory game modes will return.</p><h2><strong>The long road to make the next College Football video game</strong></h2><p>EA officially announced it was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-is-returning-for-the-first-time-since-2013">making another college football game in 2021</a> when it originally planned not to use any real names or likenesses of the student-athletes. When <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/20-512_gfbh.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Supreme Court ruled</a> that student-athletes could profit from using their name, image, and likeness (NIL), EA announced it <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-ncaa-football-players-comments">would add real college football players</a> into its upcoming game. </p><p>Similar legal challenges surfaced for EA in its recent venture into college football video games. Initially canceled due to legal issues, the series encountered similar obstacles when The BrandR Group, a licensing agency for student-athletes, <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/candce/4:2023cv02994/414223/23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">filed a lawsuit against EA</a>, arguing that compensation for participating student-athletes was "significantly below market value." EA <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-still-on-track-for-summer-2024-release-following-lawsuit-settlement">eventually settled the lawsuit</a>.</p><p>College Football 25's Standard and Deluxe Editions are available to pre-order now, but EA said it is offering a third version called the EA Sports MVP Bundle, which includes one copy each of the Deluxe Editions of both College Football 25 and Madden NFL 25, both of which will move the release date up by three days for each game, allowing you to play sooner.</p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

Big problem.</h2></div><section><p>The Japan-set <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> requires an internet connection to install but not to play after, Ubisoft has confirmed.</p><p>In a post on <a href="https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1791095143799414951" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a>, the publisher confirmed Shadows will follow a recent trend for bigger games where even the disc version requires an internet connection before play is possible. Shadows doesn't require an always-online connection, but does require the internet to essentially download part of the game upon install.</p><p>"We wanted to share some early information on the upcoming launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows, following some questions we've noticed in the community," Ubisoft said, addressing concerns raised after the PlayStation Store listed Shadows as an "online play required" game.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows - Art and Concept Art</h3></div></output><p>"Assassin's Creed Shadows will not require a mandatory connection at all times. An online connection will be needed to install the game, but will you be able to play the entire journey offline, and explore Japan without any online connection." The PlayStation Store listing has been changed to say "online play optional" despite the install requirement.</p><p>Larger triple-A video games are slowly but surely transitioning to this method of distribution as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/physical-games-have-now-fallen-below-subscriptions-and-virtual-currency-on-christmas-lists">physical media becomes a smaller and smaller part of how people buy games</a>.

Now, the community’s attention has shifted onto a player who has unwittingly become the focus of an altogether more wholesome story.</p><p>The story starts with a seemingly innocuous player interaction that went viral. A Helldiver called Dremskiy joined a group only to face being kicked from it.</p><p>“Sorry… I have to kick you,” Dremskiy was told by another Helldiver who said they were playing with friends only.</p><p>“im frend,” was Dremskiy’s heartbreaking reply.</p><p>“Don’t make this more difficult…” the player said.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The interraction that can make a grown man cry <a href="https://t.co/lGhvCzoPgy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/lGhvCzoPgy</a></p>— Helldivers 2 Media (@Helldiversmedia) <a href="https://twitter.com/Helldiversmedia/status/1790037528931651889?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 13, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Like a Helldiver ragdoll butting heads with a Charger, that interaction flew off, enjoying millions of views across social media, Discord, and forums before inevitably becoming a meme. “im frend”, complete with misspelling, is now part of Helldivers lore.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/screenshot-2024-05-16-142901-1715866153884.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Helldivers subreddit.</figcaption></figure></output><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/screenshot-2024-05-16-143046-1715866254210.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Helldivers subreddit.</figcaption></figure></output><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/screenshot-2024-05-16-143141-1715866321508.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image credit: Helldivers subreddit.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead and Sony then had their say, reinforcing and promoting the meme. “For prosperity. For liberty. For democracy. For frend,” Arrowhead tweeted. “im frend 😢” the PlayStation UK X/Twitter account replied, while still failing to address the fact <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-on-steam-helldivers-2-psn">Helldivers 2 remains delisted in over 100 countries because of its PSN account policy</a>.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">im frend 😢</p>— PlayStation UK (@PlayStationUK) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayStationUK/status/1790753911592141089?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 15, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Now, Helldivers players are reporting brief interactions with Dremskiy, who seems bemused by all the attention.

Dremskiy is now streaming Helldivers 2 on <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/dremskiy_" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitch</a>. “Hello frend,” people in chat are saying as they log in to watch. While streaming, Dremskiy called the tweets from the official Helldivers account "crazy." "I didn't even find out until yesterday I was a meme," Dremskiy went on to say. "I don't know how I feel about it. I appreciate it. It made me genuinely happy." Dremskiy later confirmed they had accepted 200 friend requests yesterday and a few more today, and now Steam says the list is full.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Helldivers 2 Media (@Helldiversmedia) <a href="https://twitter.com/Helldiversmedia/status/1790763579014316215?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 15, 2024</a></blockquote> <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-playstations-fastest-selling-game-of-all-time-with-over-12-million-sold-in-12-weeks">Helldivers 2 is PlayStation’s fastest-selling video game of all time</a>, with 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks. It’s an astonishing result for Sony and Arrowhead, but Helldivers 2 has certainly had its ups and downs since the explosive launch across PC and PlayStation 5 in February.

<p>Years ago, Sony started making <a href="https://playstation.fandom.com/wiki/List_of_PlayStation_2_games_for_PlayStation_4">a select handful of "PlayStation 2 Classics"</a> available as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/11/the-ps4-can-now-emulate-playstation-2-games/">emulated downloads on the PlayStation 4</a>. Now, there are signs that certain PS2 games will be similarly available for native download on the PS5, complete with new features like "up-rendering, rewind, quick save, and custom video filters."
</p><p>The hint at Sony's coming PS2 download plans comes via a new PlayStation Network listing for the 2002 release <em>Star Wars: The Clone Wars</em>, which recently appeared <a href="https://psdeals.net/us-store/game/2774293/star-wars-the-clone-wars">on tracking site PSDeals</a> (as <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2024/05/ps2-emulated-star-wars-the-clone-wars-listed-on-playstation-store">noticed by Gematsu</a>). That site draws from unpublished data from the PSN servers, such as <a href="https://store.playstation.com/store/api/chihiro/00_09_000/container/US/en/99/UP1082-CUSA48010_00-0677672120279659/0/image?_version=00_09_000&amp;platform=chihiro&amp;bg_color=000000&amp;opacity=100&amp;w=336&amp;h=336">this thumbnail image that recently appeared on the playstation.com servers,</a>&nbsp;and lists a planned June 11 release for the emulated <em>Clone Wars</em> port.</p>
<p>So far, this is nothing out of the ordinary. But near the bottom of the boilerplate, the listing notes that "this title has been converted from the PlayStation 2 version to the PlayStation 4 <em>and PlayStation 5</em> consoles and <em>provides newly added features</em> [emphasis added]." That's a marked difference from <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1004-CUSA03507_00-SLUS212690000001">earlier "PS2 on PS4" downloadable releases</a>, which only say that they were "converted from the original PlayStation 2 version to the PS4 system."</p>
<h2>A new emulator for a new generation</h2>
<p>Previous PS2 games released as PlayStation Classics could be played on the PS5 via <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/sony-confirms-playstation-5s-ps4-back-compat-details-hints-at-game-boost/">the newer system's PS4 backward compatibility</a>, of course. And those titles already looked relatively decent on modern displays thanks to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/11/the-ps4-can-now-emulate-playstation-2-games/">near-HD upscaling</a> at solid frame rates. But new "up-rendering" designed for the 4K-capable PS5 could make these aging 3D titles look even better on high-end TVs, even if low-resolution textures originally designed for 2000s-era CRTs may still look dated. And other new features like "rewind, quick save, and custom video filters" promise nice improvements over the relatively bare-bones PS2 emulation previously available on the PS4.</p>                                            
                                                        
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lkd7Xz15bao?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p>A look at Implicit Creations' existing PS1 emulation efforts on the PS5.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Those same features (and modern additions like trophies) are also currently offered on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP9000-CUSA43452_00-SCUS943090000000">select PS1 titles</a> that have been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lkd7Xz15bao">available in native PS5 ports</a> in recent months. That's thanks to the work of <a href="https://www.implicitconversions.com/">Implicit Conversions</a>, a retro-focused porting company that has recently been <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/meet-the-company-bringing-classic-games-to-switch-ps5-and-xbox-by-mistake">working with Sony</a> to add PS1 support to its multi-platform <a href="https://www.implicitconversions.com/syrup-emulation-engine/">Syrup Emulation Engine</a>.</p>
<p>Implicit Conversions recently included the PS2 on <a href="https://www.implicitconversions.com/services/">a list of consoles supported by the Syrup Engine</a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/implicit-conversions/">said on LinkedIn</a> that it is "working with clients to bring NES, PS1, PSP, <em>and PS2 games</em> to the PS4, <em>PS5</em>, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox [emphasis added]." In a <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/03/emulation-expert-implicit-conversions-cannot-confirm-nor-deny-ps2-games-on-ps5">March interview with Time Extension</a>, the company said it "can't deny or confirm anything about PS2 [emulation on PS5]," but the very familiar wording of this leaked <em>Clone Wars</em> listing certainly suggests the same company is behind this new PS2 porting effort as well.</p>
<p>Of course, the ability to download select PS2 games to the PS5 falls well short of many players' dream of simply inserting and playing an existing PS2 disc on their newest Sony console. In 2018, though, hackers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/01/unlocked-ps4-consoles-can-now-run-copies-of-ps2-games/">opened up the PlayStation Classics emulator</a> and got it running generic PS2 games on the PS4 (<a href="https://www.psdevwiki.com/ps4/PS2_Classics_Emulator_Compatibility_List">compatibility is a bit hit or miss</a>, however). That same emulator has also proven useful in helping hackers <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/console-hacker-reveals-ps4-ps5-exploit-that-is-essentially-unpatchable/">unlock some interesting exploits on the PS5</a>. So who knows—the community may be able to hack-in wider PS5 support for PS2 game discs eventually.

                <p>Recently, Ubisoft canceled its upcoming free-to-play shooter, The Division Heartland, stating that it "redeployed resources" to other games like XDefiant and Rainbow Six Siege. Now, a developer who says he worked on an early version of Heartland says that it started off as a "low-risk" battle royale mode for The Division 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Level designer Ryan Smith said <a href="https://twitter.com/Iam_RyanSmith/status/1790944476287873419" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on X/Twitter</a> that he was part of a small team that started work on the project that would become Heartland in 2019. Smith--who is now a lead level designer on Overwatch 2--indicated that it started off as a battle royale mode for the already-successful The Division 2. However, despite a "pretty clear plan," Ubisoft and developer Red Storm apparently decided to make the mode its own game at some point. Several large shooter franchises were working on their own battle royale spin-offs at the time, such as Call of Duty: Warzone, which first released in March 2020.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Division Heartland: Cinematic Intro Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Ubisoft has canceled a number of high-profile projects in the past 12 months, reportedly including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-immortals-fenyx-rising-sequel-amid-focus-shift-to-major-franchises-report/1100-6516277/">Immortals Fenyx Rising 2</a>, as well as several unannounced games. Heartland's canning came as a surprise to some players, particularly since the game had gone through at least one closed beta and was rated by the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-heartland-might-be-releasing-very-soon/1100-6519524/">Taiwan</a> game rating board. As part of the announcement, Ubisoft indicated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland-but-the-division-3-is-still-coming/1100-6523480/">The Division 3</a> is full steam ahead, and we hope that it may make an appearance at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-year-later-ubisoft-forward-is-back-for-another-june-showcase/1100-6522364/">Ubisoft Forward</a> in June.</p>

</header>  <div>



            <p>Activision has formed a new internal studio, Elsewhere Entertainment, which is set to create a new narrative-based IP and franchise.</p>
<p>Based in Warsaw, Poland, Elsewhere Entertainment's team is composed of developers who have worked on titles such as The Last of Us, Uncharted, The Witcher, Cyberpunk, Destiny, Tom Clancy's The Division, and Far Cry.</p>
<p>The studio has full access to Activision's resources during production and development of its upcoming title.</p>
<p>Elsewhere Entertainment is the second Activision studio based in Poland. <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/infinity-ward-to-open-polish-studio">Infinity Ward expanded to Kraków in 2017</a>, led by former principal rendering engineer Michal Drobot.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/xbox-reportedly-shutting-down-four-bethesda-studios">Xbox shut down four studios known for their work on original IPs</a> including Tango Gameworks' Hi-Fi Rush and Arcane Austin's Redfall. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-cuts-1900-staffers-from-its-games-division">Microsoft laid off 1,900 people</a> which included cuts at Activision Blizzard.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/language-loot-and-localization-how-to-ready-mmorpgs-for-release-in-more-regions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As Head of Localization at Gameforge, I definitely know about the challenges involved in getting a new game ready for release. Tight deadlines, collaborating with translation and voiceover agencies, the difficulties in finding the right freelancers, budget restrictions – that’s just the name of the game (pun intended) when it comes to localization.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, one thing we usually take for granted is language: while some game localization projects we’ve been involved in here at </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gameforge.com/en-GB/">Gameforge</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> focus on translating from English or German, into another Western language (and, very soon, also Chinese), this isn’t always the case! Several of the games we are lucky enough to publish - such as AION Classic (the nostalgic server of fantasy MMORPG, AION), NosTale (anime action MMORPG), and Runes of Magic (heroic saga MMORPG) - were originally developed in Asian languages, by Asian developers. This requires a slightly different approach, and while it’s a daunting task, it’s also an immensely exciting opportunity for the company!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Here’s how things go, warts and all.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How the project starts – the first steps">How the project starts – the first steps</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The world of online game development and localization moves at lightning speed. Companies want today’s work finished yesterday at the highest level possible for the cheapest price. This being the case, my team and I are used to working under pressure and delivering fast results.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So when the challenge arrived to take on the localization for the MMORPGs originally developed in Asia, projects that entail translating massive amounts of text from the original Chinese and Korean, we said, “bring it on!”. Having first cut our teeth with Runes of Magic, we have two or three Chinese-speaking translators already onboarded in our pool, so we are no longer starting from scratch for future projects, but they do often require expanding our pool of collaborators.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To put things in perspective, localizing games can involve translating three million Chinese characters, the equivalent of translating Harry Potter three times – I don’t mean just one book, I mean the entire series! The scope of translating games can be simply enormous.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Firstly, we put the word out to a number of agencies that we were looking for Chinese translators, but it can still take around three to four weeks to find the right people. In the meantime, we can do very little other than play the game and get used to how it works even though everything is in Chinese. We also use the time to ask the developer questions and iron out the future workflow structure, such as understanding what needs to be translated first and gathering important words for the skills and quest ahead of time since these words come up again and again in the game, and so on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once we get a good team of freelancers and in-house people together, we dive into the work. The text is sent over in CSV files, which are uploaded into our CMS (content management system), and the translators work with memoQ, a tool designed to help ensure the translation is streamlined, consistent, and uniform.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Translation challenges and issues with luck">Translation challenges and issues with luck</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game developers always create according to their own vision, which means they don’t really keep in mind that localization and translation will likely happen in the future – that’s why our field always has challenges and quirks to deal with. However, since Chinese and Korean are so vastly different from German, this transformation is even more challenging than if the original game had been in English, for example.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Chinese is a pictorial language full of idioms you would never use in German, which makes translating between the languages difficult and sometimes leads to misunderstandings.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also have issues with single words at times. For example, the same Chinese character might mean bangs (hairstyle) in one context, or it might be a person’s name in another, and the difference between these two may not always be clear. At other times, we come across Chinese characters that could be translated a number of ways, so again, we have to keep an eye on the background to make sure we get the context right. We can face issues with these kinds of details throughout a project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, one of the biggest challenges we’ve faced previously, ironically, is the word luck. The Chinese language has seven different words for luck, and each is subtly different in meaning. When you’re translating into a language that only has luck, good luck or bad luck, you need some skillful translating to get it right.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We may not catch some of the translation snafus until much later in the process. For example, during the voiceover of one game, one of the actors recorded the line, “Drink! Drink! Drink!” which was a mistake in the translation. What the character really needed to say was, “Attack! Attack! Attack!” We toyed with the idea of leaving it as-is for a bit of fun, but the project manager said no, understandably.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Time for the voiceover">Time for the voiceover</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At times, translation work seems neverending, and there are definitely some bumps in the road. In one case, we realized well into the project that we needed to switch back and start translating an earlier version of the game, as MMORPGs are updated often. We could send in translations and get texts back that were still in Chinese, or new texts in Chinese we haven’t seen before. Chinese all the time, coming out of our ears.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Eventually, after all of this, we are ready to start the voiceovers. With a previous game, we originally planned to do voiceovers in German, French, and English, but since millions of Chinese characters had been transformed into 300,000 words of spoken text, Gameforge decided it would be quite costly and go beyond our intended release date, and so we decided to proceed with English only to start with.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Translations are ongoing and voiceovers sometimes have to be put on hold until the Excel sheets are ready to go. We also have to listen to the original Chinese for reference. Is this character a man or a woman? Are they the 102-year-old emperor’s daughter or a young girl? What is the emotion being conveyed by these words? These distinctions are not always obvious from the get-go, and we need to make sure they are well-documented to ensure the voiceover is a perfect fit.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If one person says something in Chinese and the other person says the same thing in English, it takes a different amount of time. In some projects, the voiceover actor has to take this into account and vary their speed accordingly, which is both challenging and costly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For AION, there is a specific studio we’ve worked with who’ve done a lot of great recording and trailers for us in the past, and we often work with them for localized voiceovers. Since the pandemic, many voice actors based in the United States have begun to work from home anyway, so luckily things haven’t slowed down because of restrictions or lockdowns during the pandemic.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Release time, ready or not">Release time, ready or not</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As the release day looms closer, the pressure is on to get things ready. We know that the publisher (both Gameforge and the publisher in the original territory) isn’t willing to wait half a year, not when it means the moans and groans and backlash of the users and media. Again, speed plays a very important role in the world of online games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If initial levels and areas are good to go, a game will be released as scheduled, and we continue polishing and improving the rest after the fact – that is, some of them still need voiceovers.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With the help of freelancers, we get to work translating, editing, and fine-tuning the text, which is no small feat. We need to go over everything in fine detail, and issues may still keep popping up, some brought to our attention by the QA team and others by users.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Months after the release, we may still be proofreading, editing, recording, or retaking voiceovers, still making things better. In the end, we’ll go through the entire text at least three times, eager to finish the project and push a quality project out to all players.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Where we stand now">Where we stand now</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of our localization projects was a truly exceptional and extraordinary challenge. For over a year and a half, several of our full-time in-house employees focused exclusively on the project, while others pitched in from time to time, and of course, we relied heavily on our greatly expanded pool of freelance editors and Chinese translators. It took place during the pandemic and we did a lot of the work in our home offices while sheltering in place. This makes me especially proud of our achievements and how, together, we were able to overcome so many different challenges.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Was it a good experience? Well, it was a challenge, and I love challenges. However, if we take on a project of this magnitude again in the future, we will prolong the test phase and find the right translators first before getting started. In the beginning, we had one agency who promised they would cover all the translating and editing, but that wasn’t possible in the end. With a project this size, there’s just too much to do.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It would also definitely help if we don’t have to start any major future projects in the middle of a global pandemic like we did for the previously mentioned project, so here’s hoping. Either way, the outcome serves as proof that we are able to complete such a tremendous quest and, together with the players, who are able to enjoy the rewards of the final product. Players, too, have become an active and welcome part of the process either through the occasional typo-catching, or constructive feedback.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/16/popular-medieval-strategy-city-builder-manor-lords-surpasses-2-million-sales-in-early<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Manor Lords, the medieval strategy city-builder and one of 2024's surprise hits, has surpassed two million copies sold. The game has only been available in PC Early Access since April 26, meaning it achieved this milestone in only three weeks.</p>

<p>Publisher Hooded Horse announced the sales account for Steam, Epic, GOG, and the Microsoft Store (where Manor Lords is also playable through PC Game Pass). The game quickly caught fire, selling 1 million copies a day after launch. Since then, Manor Lords has enjoyed a consistently high concurrent player count, peaking at 173,000 on Steam in its first weekend.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/S7MnkE_qxj8" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Manor Lords is being developed by Slavic Games and puts players in the shoes of a medieval lord tasked with building and growing a city. Players manage their city’s community, infrastructure, economy, and defense/expansion, the latter of which unfold as large-scale tactical battles. The intricate social and production systems combined with an ever-changing world (complete with seasonal and weather changes) result in an organic metropolis that players have taken to in a big way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Manor Lords joins Early Access hits this year, such as <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/02/22/what-is-palworld-the-new-pokemon-with-guns-survival-game-everyones-playing">Palworld</a> and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/hades2">Hades II</a>. The game’s 1.0 launch is currently up in the air as the game continues to change and improve based on player feedback. It’s off to a great start, though, and we’re curious to see how it evolves throughout its EA period.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="220" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">With the release of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-will-not-use-skill-based-matchmaking-in-casual-game-modes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant</a></em> gradually approaching, many players are starting to gear up for its highly anticipated launch. But you may wonder: When do <em>XDefiant</em> preloads start? Here’s everything you need to know.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-xdefiant-preload-and-launch-times" data-injectable="false">XDefiant preload and launch times</h2> <p data-characters="74" data-current-count="74" data-injectable="false">You can check out the preload and official launch times for <em>XDefiant</em> here:</p> <figure data-found-rows="4" data-current-count="534" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th>Regions</th><th>Pre-Load Times</th><th>Launch Times</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>US and Canada</td><td>May 16 at 10 a.m. PT/12 p.m. CT/1 p.m. ET</td><td>May 21 at 10 a.m. PT/ 12 p.m. CT/1 p.m. ET</td></tr><tr><td>Europe</td><td>May 16 at 6 p.m. BST/7 p.m. CEST</td><td>May 21 at 6 p.m. BST/7 p.m. CEST</td></tr><tr><td>Oceania and Asia</td><td>May 17 at 3 a.m. AET</td><td>May 22 at 3 a.m. AET</td></tr><tr><td>South America</td><td>May 16 at 2 p.m. BRT</td><td>May 21 at 2 p.m. BRT</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="247" data-current-count="247" data-injectable="false">Each region includes all platforms, such as Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. It’s also part of Ubisoft Connect, a free service hub for various games. For Steam users, check out <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/will-xdefiant-be-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our guide</a> on whether or not it will be on this platform. </p> <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="409" data-injectable="true">Fortunately, <em>XDefiant</em> is a free-to-play game, so no need to break out your wallet. There may still be in-game purchases, though, with premium Battle Pass items.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="301" data-current-count="601" data-injectable="true">If you’re one of the players who already have a previous version of the game installed, it’s crucial to check for an update. This simple step will ensure a smooth transition to <em>XDefiant’s</em> official release. It will work like other preloads, where you can only play it on launch day.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-how-many-gigabytes-is-xdefiant" data-injectable="false">How many gigabytes is XDefiant?</h2> <p data-characters="215" data-current-count="215" data-injectable="false">Thanks to the <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayXDefiant/status/1791121436674801781" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">specs announcement</a>, we know that <em>XDefiant</em> requires&nbsp;<strong>35GB of storage on PC</strong>. However, we have yet to know what the console versions will involve. We will update you as soon as we have more information.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="512" data-injectable="false">Compared to other first-person shooter file sizes, <em>XDefiant’s</em> storage space is relatively small, which should come as a relief. This means there may not be a need to clear any space. Additionally, those who downloaded <em>XDefiant</em> beforehand should only need a little space for the new update.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/diablo-4-tempering-guide/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=diablo-4-tempering-guide<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="443" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Diablo 4’s </em>‘Loot Reborn’ is now live for all players, serving as a much needed balm for eyes strained from comparing countless overly-complicated Rare items. Itemization is much simpler now, with the added bonus of being able to add new affixes, or stat bonuses, to items yourself. This system is called Tempering, and I’ll explain how it works, why you should do it as soon as possible, and what it’ll cost you. </p> <h2 id="h-why-temper" data-injectable="false">Why Temper?</h2> <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="352" data-injectable="false">Rather than yellow, or “Rare,” items dropping with four affixes that seem overly complex, Season 4 has pared back the number of affixes to just two and culled a lot of the less obviously-useful ones from the game. This means Rares, while still useful, won’t be dropping at their full potential. That’s where Tempering comes in. </p> <p data-characters="342" data-current-count="694" data-injectable="true">By using Tempering Manuals, which drop from any enemies you’ll face on any World Tier and level, you can add those missing affixes to gear. The manual isn’t used up in the process, and the reagents to add a new affix are cheap enough that you should at least consider throwing a few solid choices on your weapons while you level. </p>
 <p data-characters="271" data-current-count="271" data-injectable="false">The drawback to Tempering is that each item can only be rerolled a certain number of times. Your first Temper doesn’t cost the item any reroll chances, so it’s incentivized that you throw caution to the wind while you’re leveling for cheap, added power.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">How to Temper</h2> <p data-characters="212" data-current-count="483" data-injectable="true">To Temper an item, simply visit any Blacksmith and select the anvil icon from their shop. You’ll be prompted to select an item to Temper (A), a Tempering Manual (B), and pay the requisite material cost (C).</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="655" data-injectable="true">You’re limited on which sorts of Tempering Manuals you can select based on the type of item you’re Tempering (similar to the limitations of Legendary Aspects). For example, weapons can only use Manuals of the Offensive or Weapons categories. The Tempering Manual you choose will have a set of Augments, one of which will be selected at random:</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="740" data-injectable="true">Once you select your item and Tempering Manual, you can add a random Augment by clicking “Temper Item.” If you don’t get the Augment you want, you’ll have to try again, which costs the item one of its charges of Temper potential (found in the bottom right of an item’s tooltip). Once you’ve used up all your charges, the item is “bricked,” and stuck with whatever the last Temper granted it. </p>
 <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="257" data-injectable="false">Once a Manual “category” (like weapon manuals) is selected, you can only reroll the Temper from Manuals of that category. Manuals can also drop at differing rarities (Magic, Rare, and Legendary), which increases the stat range of their Augments.</p> <h2 id="h-tempering-costs-and-resources" data-injectable="false">Tempering costs and resources</h2> <p data-characters="104" data-current-count="361" data-injectable="false">The more powerful the item, the more a Temper will cost. You’ll need a steady supply of materials:</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="561" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Iron Chunks and Rawhide:</strong> Found from the overworld, salvage loot, or as rewards for quests and Tree of Whispers Bounties</li> <li><strong>Veiled Crystals:</strong> Salvaged from Rare items</li> <li><strong>Baleful Fragments:</strong> Salvaged from Legendary weapons</li> <li><strong>Coiling Wards:</strong> Salvaged from Legendary armor</li> <li><strong>Abstruse Sigils:</strong> Salvaged from Legendary jewelry</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="252" data-injectable="false">But fret not, as you’ll only be paying Iron Chunks, Rawhide, and Veiled Crystals well into item power 600 at World Tier 3. Just be sure you’re salvaging your excess loot and you should have plenty of house money to play the stat slots with.</p>

Epic Games has announced its Mega Sale 2024, which begins today and offers a free game each week. The offer kicks off with Dragon Age: Inquisition - Game of the Year Edition, which you can nab from the Epic Games Store now.
</p>
<p>
The offer of BioWare's brilliant RPG is well-timed, ahead of the long-awaited <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</a> finally <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-has-two-unannounced-games-to-launch-this-year-one-is-dragon-age-dreadwolf">arriving later this year</a>. Expect to see more of that very soon. 
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, the Epic Mega Sale runs from now until 13th June with tons of discounts, including a 20% saving on last year's excellent Alan Wake 2, down to £32.

<p>The official website for the game <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25" rel="noopener" target="_blank">was updated today</a>&nbsp;and now shows the release date, which is July 19th, along with a snippet of the artwork for the game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can also now <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/buy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pre-order</a>&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>on PlayStation or Xbox (no mention of a PC version, though), and doing so shows a preview of the cover art for both the standard and deluxe editions. Here's a look at the standard version:</p>

The franchise's last installment was 2013's <i>NCAA Football 14</i>, and following that game's release, EA, the CLC, and the NCAA were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-returning-in-coming-years">hit with lawsuits</a> surrounding player likenesses.</p>
<p>Essentially, players weren't being paid for their likenesses being in&nbsp;EA's games due to a rule instated by the NCAA, and a player brought a lawsuit against the companies in 2014, demanding royalties for his appearance in a game.</p>
<p>However, the NCAA ruled in 2019 that players <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ncaa-paves-way-for-video-games-once-again">could profit</a> from their likenesses, thus paving the way for college sports video games to return.&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25</em>&nbsp;is one such game, and it'll <a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTSCollege/status/1764667866006102497" rel="noopener" target="_blank">feature more than 10,000 athletes</a>, according to EA Sports.</p>
<p>Reports originally suggested that&nbsp;<em>EA Sports College Football 25&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-still-targeting-summer-2023-release">slated for a 2023 release</a> and was delayed to 2024, but EA Sports' Daryl Holt <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-college-football-delayed-to-2024">refuted those claims in an interview</a> in which he confirmed the game would launch this year.</p>
<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC 24&nbsp;</em>is set for a July 19th release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. A full reveal is coming tomorrow, so stay tuned for more.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24157717/college-football-25-release-date-ps5-xbox-series-x-ea-sports<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="7TnlD3">We finally know when we’re going back to school: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24074774/ea-sports-college-football-25-teaser-trailer"><em>EA Sports College Football 25</em></a> is scheduled to launch July 19, publisher Electronic Arts announced Thursday.</p>
<p id="JcA7PN">EA also officially released the game’s cover artwork, which had leaked online last week, confirming that <em>College Football 25</em> will feature three <em>current</em> players on the box: Texas Longhorns quarterback Quinn Ewers, Colorado Buffaloes wide receiver/defensive back Travis Hunter, and Michigan Wolverines running back Donovan Edwards.</p>
<p id="k6w5aT">This is the first time that active college athletes will grace the cover of an EA Sports game, EA said in a news release. And thanks to the new post-2021 landscape in college sports, where <a href="https://www.ncaa.org/news/2021/6/30/ncaa-adopts-interim-name-image-and-likeness-policy.aspx">athletes can be compensated for the use of their name, image, and likeness</a>, the game publisher is paying each of this year’s cover stars for the appearance. (<a href="https://www.instagram.com/dedwards___/p/C3qp5VMuXGe/">Edwards</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/quinn_ewers/p/C3qioI_ul0H/">Ewers</a>, and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/db3_tip/p/C3qtHx6rDSg/">Hunter</a> have each published sponsored Instagram posts in partnership with the official EA Sports College Football account.)</p>
<p id="SVC6kr">Developed, as before, by Madden NFL studio EA Tiburon, the game will be released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X. The lack of a Windows PC version is notable, since EA has been releasing Madden on PC since 2018. But it’s unlikely to dampen the anticipation and enthusiasm around <em>College Football 25</em> all that much, considering how long fans have been waiting for this beloved video game franchise to return.</p>

<p id="G2YlAz">It’s been more than a decade since <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/9/26/4774542/ea-sports-ncaa-football-college-2014-canceled">EA shelved the series, then known as NCAA Football</a>, amid a flurry of class-action lawsuits alleging that EA, the NCAA, and the Collegiate Licensing Company (an organization representing the schools that appeared in the game) profited from their use of collegiate athletes’ likenesses without paying them. This arrangement existed due to long-standing NCAA bylaws that characterized the players as “student-athletes” — as opposed to professionals — and forbade them from receiving any compensation for the use of their names, images, or likenesses (NIL). In separate litigation, former college athletes alleged that this practice violated antitrust law.</p>
<p id="loioSm">EA, the NCAA, and the CLC agreed in 2014 to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/7/17/8991709/ea-sports-ncaa-player-likeness-lawsuit-settlement-approved">settlements totaling $60 million</a> for the use of athlete likenesses in video games, which resulted in payouts to thousands of former players who had “appeared” in EA’s college football and college basketball games. The antitrust litigation eventually ended up at the Supreme Court, which ruled unanimously in 2021 in <a href="https://www.vox.com/2021/6/21/22543598/supreme-court-ncaa-alston-student-athletes-football-basketball-sports-antitrust"><em>NCAA v. Alston</em></a> that the NCAA’s limits on compensation for athletes were illegal, while leaving in place policies that prevent them from being paid salaries. Shortly afterward, the NCAA announced an interim NIL policy, opening the floodgates for collegiate athletes to be able to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22559909/ncaa-college-football-nil-rules-pay-players-ea-sports-video-game">sign endorsement deals with companies such as EA</a>.</p>
<p id="2UV69c">While EA’s video game franchise no longer carries the NCAA name — the publisher rebranded it to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/2/22262449/ea-sports-college-football-ncaa-players">EA Sports College Football</a> when it announced the series’ return in 2021 — it appears that <em>College Football 25</em> will include all the pomp and pageantry from college football, and the authenticity that people were accustomed to. EA said in its news release that the game will feature 134 colleges and universities from the NCAA’s Football Bowl Subdivision, meaning that players will be able to enjoy their favorite school’s uniforms, mascots, and stadiums as they did in EA’s previous games. And now that NIL deals are possible, <em>College Football 25</em>’s cover stars are among <a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTSCollege/status/1764667866006102497">more than 10,000 collegiate athletes who have agreed to appear in the game</a>. EA is giving each one a minimum fee of $600, plus a copy of the game.</p>
<p id="8nk3s6">More details on <em>College Football 25</em> will be unveiled Friday, alongside a full trailer. </p>

Why? Because it’s undeniably perfect.</p><p>A lot of people are quick to point out that this casting wouldn’t even be that out there for the movie or DeVito. 2023’s <em>Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> is full of big talent like Jack Black, Anya Taylor-Joy, and Seth Rogen. Even DeVito’s<em> It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia</em> co-star Charlie Day is in the movie as the voice of Luigi.</p><p>Animation studio Illumination also has a history of working with DeVito, first as the voice of the Lorax in 2012 and most recently as a voice in 2023’s <em>Migration</em>. But it seems like a lot of fans just want DeVito to embody the personality he brings to his <em>Always Sunny</em> character <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/always-sunny-frank-danny-devito-last-of-us-mash-up-fx-1851021540&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/always-sunny-frank-danny-devito-last-of-us-mash-up-fx-1851021540">Frank</a></span>, which does fit the vibe of Wario.</p><p>But of course the real appeal is just DeVito himself being his own type of weirdo in the best way.
