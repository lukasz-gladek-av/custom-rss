But that time’s over. Rockstar announced that it would reveal the game’s first trailer on Tuesday, December 5th, 2023, at 6AM PT / 9AM ET. Unfortunately, an early leak prompted the company to release the trailer more than half a day earlier than planned, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23988446/gta-vi-trailer-leaked-vice-city">revealing <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> will bring the series back to Vice City</a>, and it showed off a new protagonist, Lucia.</p><p>Though Rockstar Games has kept mum on what to expect from the next installment in the series, we do have a bit of an idea of what the game looks like thanks to a hacker leaking 90 videos’ worth of material. In 2022, Arion Kurtaj — a member of the Lapsus$ hacker ring — leaked the videos, and in 2023, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23842746/lapsus-member-uber-rockstar-games-hack">a London jury found him responsible for the act</a>.</p><p>There have also been unconfirmed reports of another, more recent <em>GTA VI</em> leak in the days before the trailer’s world premiere, showing off a bit of the game’s map <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-leaks-may-have-just-come-from-a-rockstar-employees-son">that allegedly came from a Rockstar employee’s kid</a>. </p></div><section id="updates-section"><ul><li role="article" id="stream-entry-b0136be1-e7eb-4dce-85eb-51270f3ed427"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158510/gta-6-release-date-fall-2025">Grand Theft Auto VI is launching in fall 2025</a></h2><p>In Take-Two’s <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir/news/take-two-interactive-software-inc-reports-results-fourth-0">Q4 2024 earnings report</a>, the company stated when gamers can expect the next entry in the <em>GTA</em> series.

That’s according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-27/gta-6-news-video-game-to-feature-playable-female-main-character">a new report from <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, which just published a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-27/gta-6-release-date-rockstar-cleans-up-image-after-employee-backlash">lengthy feature on the game’s development</a>.

According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, morale at the company has improved significantly since then, and the development of <em>GTA VI</em> is being managed in such a way so as to minimize the crunch that employees experienced during the development of previous titles. </p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/27/23280496/gta6-gta-vi-miami-female-protagonist-2024-release-date-development-crunch">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li><li role="article" id="stream-entry-7b1dc320-39f1-483c-8e76-000ecaa0e348"><div><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/4/22917783/rocstar-games-gta6-active-development-gta5-ps5-xbox-series-x-patch">Rockstar finally confirms it’s working on the next Grand Theft Auto</a></h2><div><figure><span><span></span></span><div><figcaption><em>GTA5’s Michael De Santa.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Rockstar Games</cite></p></div></figure></div><p>A new entry in the Grand Theft Auto series is in active development, <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/ak73k92o47ko75/grand-theft-auto-community-update">Rockstar Games has confirmed</a>. “We are pleased to confirm that active development for the next entry in the Grand Theft Auto series is well underway,” the company wrote in a post on its website. In the more immediate future, <em>GTAV</em> and <em>Grand Theft Auto Online</em> will release on PS5 and Xbox Series X and S on March 15th.</p><p>The popularity — and profitability — of <em>GTAV</em>’s online component has meant that there’s been an unusually long wait for a sequel. The game originally released for the PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2013, over eight years ago. In contrast, <em>GTAV</em> released a little over five years after 2008’s <em>GTAIV</em>. “With the unprecedented longevity of <em>GTAV</em>, we know many of you have been asking us about a new entry in the Grand Theft Auto series,” Rockstar Games writes. “With every new project we embark on, our goal is always to significantly move beyond what we have previously delivered.” </p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/4/22917783/rocstar-games-gta6-active-development-gta5-ps5-xbox-series-x-patch">Read Article &gt;</a></span></p></div></li></ul></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="TOqiXl"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24085152/hulu-shogun-episode-1-review-fx"><em>Shōgun</em></a><em> </em>is an early contender for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/24078257/best-tv-2024-shows-series">2024’s best TV show</a>. The series, which debuted in February, is smart, complicated, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24138469/shogun-finale-review-war-toranaga-explained-episode">tremendously well made</a>, beautifully acted, and the most watched FX series ever, according to a press release from the network. All of which makes Thursday’s announcement that the show is coming back for more season pretty unsurprising. The only question that remains is what exactly those seasons are going to be about. </p>
<p id="rnYFPP">According to FX’s announcement, the series is coming back for two additional seasons. Development on the new seasons will begin soon, with work taking place between FX and the estate of original <em>Shōgun </em>author, James Clavell. The upcoming seasons will also bring back many of the key talents behind season 1, including co-creators, showrunners, executive producers, and writers, Justin Marks and Rachel Kondo, as well as executive producer Michaela Clavell, and producer and series star Hiroyuki Sanada, who played <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24091458/shogun-episode-3-review-toranaga-actor-hiroyuki-sanada">Lord Yoshii Toranaga in season 1</a>.</p>
<p id="3bfqQz"><em>Shōgun’</em>s first season is an adaptation of James Clavell’s novel of the same name, which was originally released in 1975. The show’s first season adapts Clavell’s entire (very long) novel, which leaves the question of what exactly it will cover in its next two seasons up for debate. </p>

<p id="wF58Et">One possible option for the show could be looking to Clavell’s other work for inspiration. While <em>Shōgun </em>is unquestionably the most popular of the books, Clavell actually wrote three more novels in his Asian Saga, with <em>Shōgun </em>being the first chronologically. He also wrote <em>Tai-Pan</em>, a book about two traders venturing into Hong Kong in the 1840s after the First Opium War, <em>Gai-Jin</em>, a sequel to <em>Tai-Pan</em> set 20 years later and mostly in Japan, and <em>Noble House</em>, which is set back in Hong Kong in 1963. </p>
<p id="6QV9cD">This variety of novels could provide a solid basis for several seasons, each taking place in a distinct time and place. However, this would bring with it plenty of other problems including issues of cultural accuracy. Both <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24132460/shogun-episode-9-crimson-sky-review-mariko-why-death">Marks and Kondo have been very vocal about the accuracy of <em>Shōgun </em>being extremely important to them</a>, frequently rewriting scenes to better reflect cultural Japanese attitudes of the time. To suddenly transplant the series to an entirely new country, with an entirely new culture and different customs would be a massive undertaking, and surely change the show significantly. Although that’s not to say it couldn’t be done. </p>
<p id="s8HH7k">Perhaps even more compelling though is the presence of Sanada. With the legendary Japanese actor returning to the show, and his towering performance as Toranaga being a standout aspect of the series’ first season, it seems more likely that Marks, Kondo, and the rest of the production would opt to keep the story in Japan and create a series that’s a more direct follow up to <em>Shōgun</em>’s story. Thankfully, this period of Japanese history has no shortage of fascinating and complex topics for the show to cover. </p>

<p id="FPt0U3">While Clavell’s original novel changes the names of famous Japanese historical figures, it is closely based on the country’s real history, which means we too can look to history to see what could be next for the show. Toranaga is based on Tokugawa Ieyasu, a real Japanese daimyo and the first shōgun of the mighty Tokugawa shogunate which ruled the country from 1603 until 1868.</p>
<p id="GWaHJM">The first season ends with Toranaga on the verge of capturing Osaka Castle, a real thing Ieyasu did (although slightly earlier than 1600). So, if the timeline of Japanese history is what the show plans to follow, then the next season would likely be about the fallout of Toranaga’s decision to openly grab power. In real life, Ieyasu met with quite a bit of resistance in the form of a rival daimyo named Ishida Mitsunari who would go on to lead an army in opposition to Ieyasu, throwing Japan into a civil war. </p>
<p id="q9ysSx">We’ll stop the story there at the risk of revealing several potentially significant plot points, but needless to say a civil war would give future seasons of <em>Shōgun </em>plenty of ground for great television. </p>
<p id="PeZCV3">Of course, we won’t know for sure what exactly these upcoming seasons of <em>Shōgun </em>will be based on until FX makes an official announcement, but we know we’ll be watching no matter what.</p>

<p>I’ll be honest: I’ve yet to beat Borderlands 3. I picked it up on sale, relatively cheap, alongside much of the DLC. But it’s one of those games that will sit in my backlog, likely for another year or so, before I gain any traction. A co-op partner might help. But for now, I have my sights set on the Borderlands 4 release date. Why play an old backlog game when there’s something shiny and new on the way?!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-borderlands-4-release-date">What is the Borderlands 4 Release Date?</h2>



<p>At this time, we don’t know the official Borderlands 4 release date. In fact, the only concrete thing we know about the upcoming game is that publisher 2K Games and developer Gearbox Interactive intend to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-borderlands-4-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal the fourth mainline entry</a> during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-summer-game-fest-answered/">Summer Game Fest</a>. That’ll happen on June 7!</p>



<p>According to Randy Pitchford earlier this year, the title has spent the past few years in “active development.” Therefore, it’s likely that we’ll see a reveal and announcement trailer, perhaps a release date, and likely the pre-order details for Borderlands 4 this summer.</p>



<p>Bookmark this page because the moment we have a release date, we’ll update you!</p>

<h2 id="h-what-systems-will-borderlands-4-launch-on">What Systems Will Borderlands 4 Launch On?</h2>



<p>As the last generation of consoles—PlayStation 4 and Xbox One—continue to wind down and come to a close, we’ll see far fewer big releases launch on the old systems. As such, we fully expect Borderlands 4 to be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Anything else, however, is unlikely.</p>

<p data-characters="383" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Ever since the highly-anticipated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/grand-theft-auto-vis-trailer-perfectly-captures-my-hometowns-essence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>GTA&nbsp;6&nbsp;</em>trailer</a> debuted, fans have been waiting for another one. The first teaser left us with many questions, particularly about the two characters who were the focus of the reveal. Here’s a rundown of what we know so far about&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>&nbsp;trailer 2, including potential release dates and storyline speculations.</p> <h2 id="h-when-will-gta-6-trailer-2-release" data-injectable="false">When will GTA 6 trailer 2 release?</h2> <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="162" data-injectable="false">Right now, <em>GTA 6</em>&nbsp;trailer 2 <strong>doesn’t have an official release date</strong>. However, based on the release patterns of previous debuts, some rumors are circulating.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="true">It was believed that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/gta-publisher-take-two-is-laying-off-five-percent-of-staff-a-few-months-after-saying-it-had-no-current-plans-for-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Take-Two</a> would announce a new trailer for <em>GTA 6</em> during their May 2024 conference call. Unfortunately, no trailer was released, but we did get some insight into a more concrete release date. According to the report results, <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> will debut in the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/rockstar-narrows-window-for-grand-theft-auto-6-launch-to-fall-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fall of 2025</a>. </p>
 <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">Despite not getting a <em>GTA 6 </em>trailer 2 during the conference, we can still try to get an idea for a release from its predecessor. If we look at <em>GTA 5</em>, we can see that the two main trailers debuted a year apart. Therefore, a second trailer for <em>GTA VI</em> might not come until December 2024. It may be released at an earlier date, but given Rockstar Games’ track record, it will likely come out in the latter half of the year. </p>
 <h2 id="h-gta-6-trailer-predictions" data-injectable="false">GTA 6 trailer predictions</h2> <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="428" data-injectable="true">If we take a closer look at the first&nbsp;<em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/gta-6-could-be-the-most-important-thing-to-ever-release-analyst-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>&nbsp;</em>trailer, we can see that a second one could take us in many different directions. It could provide more insight into the two characters we’ve seen so far, Lucia and her partner (rumored to be named Jason). Given that Lucia was the primary focus of the first trailer, it’s possible that the second phase will shine the spotlight on her partner.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer 1" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QdBZY2fkU-0?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="516" data-current-count="816" data-injectable="true"><em>GTA 6&nbsp;</em>trailer 2 will likely delve deeper into the game’s narrative, which appears to draw inspiration from the infamous Bonnie and Clyde. The initial teaser showed Lucia and her partner in possession of a large sum of money, with the police hot on a suspect’s trail. If&nbsp;<em>GTA 6</em>&nbsp;follows the formula of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-open-world-games-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its predecessor</a>, heists will likely play a significant role in the storyline. We might also get a glimpse of the game’s side characters and their dynamic in the upcoming trailer.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="590" data-current-count="590" data-injectable="true">In addition to the characters and narrative, more locations are expected to be revealed, taking us back to the Miami-inspired Vice City. This setting, known for its vibrant nightlife, beautiful beaches, and mobster escapades, has been a fan favorite since its first appearance in the series. The initial snippet already gave fans a sneak peek at a ton of visuals, and it’s shaping up to be an incredibly eccentric area to explore. Leaks have suggested the&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto 6&nbsp;</em>map will be absolutely massive, giving players the free range to wreak even more havoc.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="251" data-injectable="false"><em>GTA 6’s</em>&nbsp;gameplay details remain a tantalizing mystery, so the second trailer may&nbsp;not fully&nbsp;reveal this information.&nbsp;It will likely continue with cinematics, but one can’t help but wonder about the actual gameplay.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="206" data-current-count="457" data-injectable="false">An official release date could also be possible with the next drop, as the game is currently only slated for&nbsp;a Fall 2025 window.&nbsp;Again, this is wishful thinking, but it’s not entirely impractical.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="201" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The Apex Legends Global Series might replace the Dropship with a point-of-interest (POI) draft in Split 2, and pro players can’t reach a consensus on how to feel about the new potential feature. </p> <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="346" data-injectable="false">During a scrimmage with his <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/imperialhal-leaves-tsm-marking-the-end-of-an-era-in-apex-legends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new teammates</a> Zero and Genburten, Imperialhal claimed, “ALGS has just forced us to play on a random draft POI system in a competitive lobby, probably the worst change ever made in Apex history.” The pro player added that the rest of the league was against the change, but that didn’t make an impact. </p> <p data-characters="587" data-current-count="933" data-injectable="true">In March, ALGS commissioner John Nelson first proposed the idea in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CompetitiveApex/comments/1bq7bl8/algs_split_2_drop_spot_changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">letter </a>to pro players. As things stand now, ALGS teams reach a general understanding through scrims and prior communication about where other trios land from the Dropship. However, there are some instances where teams will land at the same location, and the ALGS commissioner believes “those situations are to the detriment of both teams,” because the outcome gets decided by random factors such as who gets better loot in a short span of time. Some pro players are against the change, but other see its benefits. </p>
 <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="392" data-injectable="false">But with the draft system, one team will spawn at each of the possible 29 landing locations. According to Nelson’s leaked memo, all teams will get to select towards the front, in the middle, and at the end of the draft for the first nine days of regular seasons of matches. After that, draft order will be decided by performance, with better performing teams picking where they land first. </p> <figure data-current-count="692" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Respawn Entertainment </figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="231" data-current-count="231" data-injectable="false">ALGS pro-Gnaske <a href="https://x.com/Gnaske_Lone/status/1790893406798971007" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">argued</a> that the “new POI draft system is amazing on paper, but a massive flaw is that the POIs are so unbalanced, and because of the unbalance, it’s going to create a massive luck factor in the game.” </p> <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="529" data-injectable="true">Some POIs have more loot than others, hurting teams based on where they select in the draft. And since the order is determined by performance, this might put poorly performing teams in a hole they can’t get out of. In saying that, there are some competitive community members for the change. </p>
 <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false">“I can’t be the only person that thinks this POI draft system for comp Apex will be a good thing in the long run and the best IGL’s/Teams will still be the best. We have seen how poor zone selection can be just at this recent LAN, this makes the playing field more fair all around,” FaZe Snipedown <a href="https://x.com/Snip3down/status/1791163746313789508" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a>. </p> <p data-characters="163" data-current-count="486" data-injectable="false">ALGS Split 2 starts in June. Pro players will have the ultimate say on if the feature gets added, but the vote could be a close one based on conflicting opinions. </p>

Rockstar Games and publisher Take-Two Interactive have narrowed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>'s release window from the previously announced "2025" to "fall" of next year.
</p>
<p>
Take-Two shared the news during its Q4 2024 earnings report, saying it was "highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience".
</p>
<p>
"Our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase", it added, noting it expects to see "tremendous growth" in net bookings over the next three years.

<p>
When Rockstar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-first-trailer-released-early">unveiled its first trailer for GTA6</a> last December, it only confirmed a "2025" release window for the game. However, reports later claimed it had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-release-may-slip-to-2026-as-development-has-reportedly-fallen-behind">initially been targeting a "spring" 2025 launch</a> but that an autumn (Q3) release was looking more realistic. There were also suggestions it could slip into 2026 as a "fallback plan".
</p>
<p>
Assuming Grand Theft Auto 6 makes its newly announced "fall" 2025 release window as expected, it'll be arriving almost exactly 12 years after the launch of Grand Theft Auto 5. That game went on to sell an astonishing 200m copies, so Take-Two is undoubtedly right to be bullish about its expectations for "tremendous growth" over the next few years.
</p>
<p>
GTA 6 is set to feature dual protagonists - a Bonnie and Clyde-style couple who embark on a life of crime - and marks the return of the series' Miami-inspired Vice City.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24158506/grand-theft-auto-6-release-window-date-fall-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="0mTart"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>will be released in the fall of 2025, according to publisher Take-Two Interactive. The release window — however vague — is a narrowing of what Take-Two Interactive had previously shared <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23952805/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-leaks-release-date-trailer">when it put <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> simply within the 2025 calendar year</a>. The fall 2025 release window makes sense, placing the much-anticipated game right before the holidays.</p>
<p id="3rQZDE">“We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase,” <a href="https://taketwointeractivesoftwareinc.gcs-web.com/node/30361/html#ttwo4q24earningsrelease.htm">Take-Two Interactive said in its most recent earnings report</a>. “Looking ahead, we believe that our Company is poised to achieve new levels of success, and we expect to deliver sequential growth in Net Bookings for Fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027.”</p>
<p id="HVl2iX">Of course, there’s always the chance for a delay. Rockstar Games is infamous for delaying its games to ensure a serious level of polish; <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> was publicly <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/5/22/15677376/red-dead-redemption-2-delay-release-date">delayed</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/2/1/16959884/red-dead-redemption-2-release-date-delayed-october-2018">three times</a>, while <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/1/31/3936872/gta-5-release-date"><em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em> had a major delay in 2013</a>. Take-Two Interactive’s willingness to publicly narrow the release window as part of its fiscal report could signal confidence in Rockstar’s ability to meet that date.</p>
<p id="rUnqcv"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23952805/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-leaks-release-date-trailer"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>was officially revealed</a> on Dec. 4, a day earlier than expected <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1731813331244085531">after its reveal trailer leaked online</a>. The game is set in Vice City, Grand Theft Auto’s Miami — a location the game centered on with 2002’s <em>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City </em>and 2006 prequel <em>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories</em>. Those games were set in the 1980s, but Rockstar Games has set <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> in the modern day, centering on a Bonnie and Clyde-esque duo in Jason and Lucia, the latter of which is the series’ first playable female protagonist.</p>
<p id="dSuNLN"><em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em> is still a hit, too, with Take-Two Interactive reporting 5 million copies sold within its last financial quarter, totaling 200 million games sold since its release.</p>
<p id="UYqSzS">Take-Two Interactive also reported it expects to reach $5.55 billion to $5.65 billion in net bookings in fiscal year 2025. Ahead of the filing, in April, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/grand-theft-auto-take-two-interactive-layoffs-canceled-games-1235973835/">Take-Two Interactive laid off 5%</a> of its staff, or about 600 workers. (Despite the layoffs, Take-Two Interactive said it has expanded its staff.) It also canceled several projects — none of which were “core franchises” — but it still has 40 games in its pipeline throughout fiscal year 2027, Take-Two Interactive president Karl Slatoff said during the earnings conference call.</p>

Then, I got a notification for a post from the account, got excited, and was immediately disappointed to see the post was just a retweet of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/paramountplus/status/1791196928086098418?s=46&amp;t=ELmQU9gVKk7kgACkfTFs1Q&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/paramountplus/status/1791196928086098418?s=46&amp;t=ELmQU9gVKk7kgACkfTFs1Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paramount+ account</a></span> breaking down Easter eggs from the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/knuckles-review-paramount-plus-episodes-season-one-1851423404&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/knuckles-review-paramount-plus-episodes-season-one-1851423404"><em>Knuckles </em>show</a></span> now streaming on the service.</p><p>Several responses to the post are fans begging for the <em>Sonic 3 </em>trailer and mentioning they also fell victim to the same notification I did.

<p>The Borderlands franchise enjoys a long and, occasionally, bumpy history. Each iteration features lovable characters, cringeworthy dialogue, and frantic gunplay that keeps us coming back for more when paired with the extensive loot system. But we’re eager for a new release. When is the Borderlands 4 reveal?!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-gearbox-reveal-borderlands-4">When Will Gearbox Reveal Borderlands 4?</h2>



<p>It’s reported that publisher 2K Games and developer Gearbox Software intend to show off Borderlands 4 at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-summer-game-fest-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer Game Fest</a> on June 7. Supposedly, the upcoming first-person shooter has spent the past few years in development. In March 2021, Randy Pitchford claimed they’re working on “the big one.” Obviously, this could mean a different franchise altogether or a completely new IP, but it’s most likely Borderlands 4.</p>



<p>To think 2K Games would ignore or abandon Borderlands would be foolish. The last release, Borderlands 3, generated a staggering $1 billion in sales. It’s a cash cow at this point, no matter how much people hate Claptrap.</p>



<p>Plus, the upcoming live-action film is set to sweep theaters, which will only boost the hype for the fourth mainline entry!</p>



<h6 id="h-related-tiny-tina-s-wonderlands-2-and-borderlands-4-potentially-leaked">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-2-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands 2 (And Borderlands 4) Potentially Leaked</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-will-claptrap-star-in-borderlands-4">Will Claptrap Star in Borderlands 4?</h2>



<p>Whenever I speak to anyone about Borderlands, they have one of two opinions regarding Claptrap. They either hate the incessant chatterbox, or they love his one-liners and jokes. It’s rarely in between. As such, I’m left questioning whether Borderlands 4 will feature Claptrap.</p>



<p>Is there a clear-cut answer right now? Unfortunately, no. We know so little about Borderlands 4, though I wouldn’t be surprised if Claptrap stars in the reveal trailer in June. Even if it’s just a cameo, I doubt they’d do away with their franchise mascot so easily.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arena-breakout-devs-have-banned-2124-accounts-%E2%80%98for-ten-years%E2%80%99.873471/</guid>

<p>In a recent update regarding Arena Breakout Infinite’s anti-cheat mechanics, MoreFun Studios – a subsidiary of Tencent – revealed how much work it has already put into keeping the extraction shooter’s ecosystem safe. Despite still being in a beta phase, there are plenty of people running around with cheats in Arena Breakout Infinite – for whatever reason. </p>



<p>MoreFun insists it’s on the case and is tightening up anti-cheat measures ahead of the inevitable early access release of the game.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-random-number">Random Number</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/ArenaBreakoutPC/status/1791202969138212998" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post on Twitter</a>, MoreFun Studios revealed that it has banned <strong>exactly </strong>2124 accounts for <strong>ten years</strong> for various infringements. Here’s the full breakdown of the impact MoreFun’s anti-cheat team has had on malicious operators attempting to spoil the fun:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In the past week, our Anti-Cheat team detected and combated over 10 memory-related cheats, 2 VT cheats, and over 10 DMA cheats, and in total <strong>2124</strong> accounts have been banned for ten years.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Additionally, MoreFun confirmed that all accounts banned during the beta will ‘also be checked repeatedly’, whatever that means. Moving forward, Arena Breakout Infinite will employ a realtime banning policy, with any suspicious accounts having their data analysed – but players have been reporting false bans taking place. It hasn’t been confirmed to what extent player reports are being vetted by automated systems that might need tweaking, but that could be the core issue.</p>

<p>It has been announced that 2K Games will reveal the next iteration of its ‘biggest and most beloved’ franchise on June 7 at Summer Game Fest.</p>



<p>Presumably, the announcement will not be related to the publisher’s annual releases like WWE or NBA. Instead, it’s strongly believed that the game could be related to the Borderlands series.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Gearbox had already announced that Borderlands 4 was in “active development”, which has been in development for a number of years. In March 2021, Randy Pitchford said that they [Gearbox] is working on ‘the big one’ when it comes to the Boderlands series. This suggests that the game has been in development for at least three years now.</p>



<p>Apart from Borderlands, other franchises that fit this category could be Mafia or Bioshock.</p>



<p>As of 2023, Take-Two reported that Borderlands 3, its last mainline Borderlands title, has sold over 18 million copies and generated well over $1 billion in revenue.</p>



<p>In addition to Borderlands games, the series will also be having its own ‘cinematic universe’, which will kickstart with the Borderlands movie scheduled to release on August 9, 2024.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes.873453/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=review-lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="329" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There are two things that <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-made-me-break-out-the-pad-and-pencil-and-i-dig-it-for-that/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</a></em> brings to the table that I think make it a puzzle game worth anyone’s time. First, its stunning visuals are reminiscent of the most stylish games ever made, like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-killer7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Killer7</a></em>. Second, its puzzles grip you and will have you working, inside and out of the game, to solve them. </p> <p data-characters="436" data-current-count="436" data-injectable="true"><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>‘ story revolves around the Hotel Letztes Jahr. The protagonist arrives there after receiving an invitation, and that’s all the information you’re given. From this incredibly vague start, you must figure out why you’re here by solving contextual puzzles that allow you to explore more and more of the hotel, while an overarching story eerily seeps out of the walls to fill in the gaps. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="149" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true"><strong><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> (<a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch</a> [Reviewed], <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2008920/Lorelei_and_the_Laser_Eyes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a>)<br>Developer: Simogo<br>Publisher: Annapurna Interactive<br>Released: May 16, 2024<br>MSRP: $24.99/£19.99</strong></p>
 <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="428" data-injectable="true">I didn’t click with <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> from the start. It took me a few hours to understand what was required of me, and then, after entering a twisted maze, I suddenly got it. I say this because I don’t think this game is for everyone in the same way as I’d say <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-animal-well/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Well</a></em> is. It’s deliberately obtuse, requires a lot of input, and has clues that you could completely miss for hours at a time. </p>
 <p data-characters="180" data-current-count="180" data-injectable="false">However, if you’re looking for a puzzle game that will have you scribbling in notebooks and has a slow-burn story you won’t fully understand until the end, this is it. </p> <figure data-current-count="480" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="427" data-current-count="427" data-injectable="true">As you’ve probably worked out by now, the bulk of <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> is puzzle-solving. In fact, your very first action, opening the front gate, is a puzzle. You’re always given a clue and directed to the information you need in red. This is why the game’s visuals are so impactful, because everything else is monochrome, giving you an almost supernatural ability to pick out clues where they appear. </p>
 <p data-characters="451" data-current-count="451" data-injectable="true">It’s this style choice that I think enables <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> to be a great puzzle box game. It would be too overwhelming if the environments were richly detailed with colors. But the monochrome color scheme and quiet, almost non-existent soundtrack help you focus in and identify solutions. As someone for which colors on a page can make a book illegible, the visual style helped me grasp the game. But I still struggled at the start. </p>
 <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="337" data-injectable="false">Back to that front gate. Once you receive your clue, it’s not a simple case of using it to unlock the gate. Instead, there are puzzles within this puzzle. You’ll need to decipher the clue from a letter, use it to unlock a door, then a panel, and then, you’ll need to solve one final puzzle that opens the gate for you. </p> <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="714" data-injectable="true">This felt maddening when I was first getting to grips with the game. It’s as if you’re given a clue for one puzzle and then sent off to do another one until you forget about the first and get lost. That’s not the case, though. <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> is designed so that every story beat and revelation plays into a new sequence of puzzles within puzzles. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="748" data-injectable="true">As you approach the hotel, you’ll feel like you’ve got a handle on these early puzzles and can manage to get inside and explore. But that’s when the game really opens up, dishing out lots of information that won’t make sense until much later. If you’re paying attention, you might even see where some of the puzzles are going early on and have half a chance of getting through two or three before you get stuck again. </p>
 <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="366" data-injectable="false">Eventually, as I mentioned, everything clicks. You realize how the game frontloads information so you can refer back to it later to solve the dozens of puzzles it throws your way. A collection of images and letters gives you the basic information you need for certain codes and pathways, but you’ll often need to manipulate the information to get your answers.</p> <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="648" data-injectable="true">For example, those images might have numbers you need to add together or type out in a specific order based on environmental cues. Letters and documents provide codes, but they’re wrapped up in further history or discoverable information, like a Russian nesting doll of clues.</p>
 <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">Your notebook will come in handy because there’s information you need to reference while looking at objects in some puzzles. Some even had me looking up real-world information for solutions. It preys on your real-world knowledge in subtle ways like this, and it feels fantastic because it adds to the undertone of dread and cosmic horror that slowly rises as you open more doors and uncover more of the truth.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="734" data-injectable="true">This all sounds like a lot, and it can be, but <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> has beautifully simple controls and great systems that make solving its complex puzzles so much more enjoyable. Your protagonist has a photographic memory, so you can reference any document you’ve seen anywhere you need to. It’s simple to explain, and negates any unnecessary complications other games might throw at you to pad out their playtime. </p>
 <p data-characters="655" data-current-count="655" data-injectable="true">Aside from movement, all you can do is interact with objects or open the menu. The menu allows you to access items you’ve picked up and that photographic memory. Otherwise, you’ll be interacting with keypads, pictures, and everything else possible in the game. I can’t overstate enough how simple this is, and yet its simplicity still feels complicated because of the puzzles you’re solving and the information you’re referencing. All the gymnastics are in your head, though, because you’ve got to hold numbers, sums, images, and the hotel’s layout in your mind to the point where it becomes mentally exhausting. </p>
 <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">It feels a lot like playing an ARG or one of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-grown-up-board-games-for-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Exit</em> board games</a>. You’ve got so much information to go through and pull together for a puzzle, but <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> is more simplistic because of its wonderfully simple UI, controls, and focus on a story you’re led through by listening and watching, not by being told by a tutorial. </p> <p data-characters="367" data-current-count="721" data-injectable="true">That might seem crazy, and it feels crazy while you’re playing. But, like I said, at some point, it just clicks. You no longer see a letter and red lines. You see the start of a puzzle and the basis for solving it. You start to enjoy them and look for more information in every room. That’s when <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> decides to genre jump a little. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="613" data-injectable="true">Without spoiling these changes too much, the game is pocketed with puzzles that are almost minigames that change your perspective, the genre, and even the tone. They feel fun and free compared to the base game’s almost horror-like darkness in the hotel, and help keep up the pace when you might be flagging.</p>
 <blockquote data-current-count="438" data-injectable="true"> <p><strong>Flashing lights warning</strong>: If you’re sold on <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes,</em> then you should absolutely go and play it. I want to warn all potential players that flashlight lights begin to take over the screen at some point in the story. They’re not regular, but they are persistent, and there’s no way to turn them off in the settings. If that sounds like it could be an issue for you, it might be worth avoiding the game.</p> </blockquote>
 <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true">The twisted maze, where I fell in love with <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>, is just one great example of these minigames. You’re told to reach the middle, but it’s never quite so simple in a puzzle game like this. Even when I gave up, the game threw yet another puzzle at me linked to my actions in the maze, and that’s when I really understood the game’s flow and where I fit into its world. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="502" data-current-count="802" data-injectable="true"><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> is an intense puzzle box game that draws you in deeper the more of its mysteries you unravel. Yes, it can be frustrating, but the satisfaction you feel for completing each puzzle is heightened because it asks so much more of you as a player. The story that seems unimportant at first quickly becomes an engrossing and stylistic mystery thriller that will keep you guessing until the end, staying up for just one more hour in the hopes of seeing the next twist or big reveal. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/is-wanderer-good-in-genshin-impact-tips-for-how-to-play-wanderer/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=is-wanderer-good-in-genshin-impact-tips-for-how-to-play-wanderer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="322" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Wanderer is a decently strong character who excels in open world combat, but has struggled to make an impact on the meta. As an Anemo hypercarry, Wanderer is hampered by his lack of access to amplifying or additive reactions. As a driver, he competes with Sucrose and Heizou, both of whom are <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-4-star-dps-characters-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">4-stars</a> and easier to obtain.</p> <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false">In terms of raw strength, Wanderer is strong enough to clear the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-teams-and-strategies-for-spiral-abyss-floor-12-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spiral Abyss</a>, as long as you have the right <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/is-faruzan-good-in-genshin-impact-pros-and-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">team</a> to support him. If you just like his playstyle or character, then you’ll probably be satisfied enough with his performance. If you only care about big numbers, though, Wanderer is probably not for you.</p> <p data-characters="383" data-current-count="700" data-injectable="true">The open world is where Wanderer shines the most. His damage is reliant on his Skill, not his Burst, so he doesn’t need to have a constant source of Energy. On top of this, Wanderer can literally fly, bypassing many open world obstacles and puzzles. If you spend a lot of time traversing the vast landscapes of Teyvat, Wanderer is one of the best characters to have in your roster.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-is-wanderer-a-dps" data-injectable="false">Is Wanderer a DPS?</h2> <p data-characters="120" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"><strong>Yes, Wanderer is an on-field Anemo DPS.</strong> He deals damage by staying on field using his Skill and enhanced Normal Attacks.</p>
 <p data-characters="264" data-current-count="264" data-injectable="false">As an on-fielder, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-wanderer-scaramouche-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wanderer</a> is best suited to the <strong>hypercarry </strong>role, where he deals the majority of his team’s damage with less emphasis on reactions. In a hypercarry team, Wanderer’s teammates should focus on supporting him with buffs, healing, or shields.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="497" data-current-count="761" data-injectable="true">However, as an Anemo Catalyst user, Wanderer has the flexibility to be a <strong>driver</strong> for off-field DPS characters. His Normal Attacks can easily drive other characters’ effects that trigger with Normal Attacks, like Xingqiu’s Rain Swords or Beidou’s lightning. He can also trigger Swirl to activate the 4pc Viridescent Venerer effect. This makes Wanderer effective in Electro-Charged teams with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-fischl-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fischl</a> and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-xingqiu-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xingqiu</a>/<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-yelan-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yelan</a>. You can even experiment with other off-field DPS characters like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-xiangling-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xiangling</a>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-wanderer-s-best-combos" data-injectable="false">Wanderer’s best combos</h2> <p data-characters="141" data-current-count="441" data-injectable="true">To start Wanderer’s combo, <strong>always cast his Skill first.</strong> This lets Wanderer fly up into the air and empowers his Normal and Charged Attacks.</p>
 <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">Once your Wanderer is in the air, his overall best combo is to use <strong>two Normal Attacks followed by a Charged Attack (N2C) </strong>until the blue bar next to him runs out. Optionally, you can use his Burst when the blue bar is just about to run out to end his combo. After finishing his combo, swap to your next character to begin your rotation again.</p> <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="667" data-injectable="true">There are scenarios where you may want to use a different combo. In multi-target situations where you want Wanderer to hit in a larger AoE, you can spam Charged Attacks with no Normals in between. If you have weapon or team buffs that empower Normal Attacks but not Charged Attacks, you may choose to only spam Normal Attacks.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-are-wanderer-constellations-worth-pulling" data-injectable="false">Are Wanderer Constellations worth pulling?</h3> <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="677" data-injectable="true"><strong>No, Wanderer’s Constellations are generally not worth pulling.</strong> His Constellations increase his own damage in various ways, but his damage at C0 is usually sufficient for most scenarios. Unless you are determined to maximize Wanderer’s damage in the Spiral Abyss, Constellations are unnecessary. If you <em>do</em> decide to pull for Constellations, I recommend stopping at C1 or C2.</p>
 <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="294" data-injectable="false">Wanderer’s Constellation 1 increases his attack speed during his combo. Though most attack speed buffs in <em>Genshin Impact</em> only affect Normal Attacks, Wanderer’s C1 also speeds up his Charged Attacks. This allows for a few more attacks during Wanderer’s combo before he drops to the ground.</p> <p data-characters="438" data-current-count="732" data-injectable="true">Wanderer’s Constellation 2 buffs his Burst damage significantly when used at the end of his combo. Though Bursting is optional at C0, C2 encourages Wanderer to Burst every rotation. Having C2 does mean you will want to build some Energy Recharge, though, and forgo using 4pc Shimenawa’s Reminiscence. The actual DPS increase from this Constellation will depend on whether you need to adjust your build to account for his Energy needs.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-is-wanderer-s-weapon-worth-pulling" data-injectable="false">Is Wanderer’s weapon worth pulling?</h3> <p data-characters="231" data-current-count="531" data-injectable="true"><strong>No, I don’t recommend pulling for Wanderer’s signature weapon.</strong> His signature weapon, Tulaytullah’s Remembrance, does result in the highest damage for Wanderer. However, he has many competitive weapon options available to him.</p>
 <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false">Many of the 5-star Catalysts are useful to Wanderer, including Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds, Cashflow Supervision, and Skyward Atlas. My personal recommendation, if you have it, is <strong>Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds.</strong> Wanderer’s extended field time means he makes use of its stacking buffs, and the movement speed bonus allows him to zoom incredibly quickly through the sky.</p> <figure data-current-count="675" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="236" data-current-count="236" data-injectable="false">As for 4-star options, I recommend <strong>The Widsith.</strong> The Widsith can perform almost as well as Tulaytullah’s Remembrance, but it’s a bit inconsistent. Its buffs are random, and they only have about 50% uptime with normal rotations.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="158" data-current-count="394" data-injectable="false">If you don’t have The Widsith, try Flowing Purity. It requires a healer and doesn’t work with Bennett, but it can be crafted for free using billets.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="377" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">One of the best ways to increase your power level in <em>WoW Remix: Mists of Pandaria</em> is by slotting gems into your gear. Most gear has a slot available, though the type of slot depends on the type of gear. When swapping out gems, don’t forget to use the unique gem removal ability <strong>Extract Gem</strong> you have. If you just slot a gem ontop of another gem, it destroys the original. </p> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">Now, you might think that this requires Jewelcrafting. However, there are no Primary and Secondary professions in <em>WoW Remix</em>. All characters will will have these abilities. All players also gain access to a swirling vortex that you can use to scrap unwanted gear. This turns the items into the Bronze currency.</p> <figure data-found-rows="5" data-current-count="809" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Armor Type</strong></td><td><strong>Slot Type</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Helmet</td><td>Meta Gem – Grants powerful ability</td></tr><tr><td>Boots</td><td>Cogwheel Gem – Grants you a movement or utility ability from another class</td></tr><tr><td>Shoulder, Wrists, Gloves, Belt (Up to 3 each)</td><td>Tinker Gem – Grants passive abilities</td></tr><tr><td>Chest, Legs, Necklace, Rings, Trinkets (Up to 3 each)</td><td>Prismatic Gems – Grant stat buffs</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="179" data-injectable="false">As a special note about the Prismatic gems: when you collect 3 of a Prismatic gem, you can combine them to the next rank. <strong>Remember your Extract Gem ability when swapping gems out.</strong></p> <p data-characters="65" data-current-count="244" data-injectable="false">The gems you can get vary, and we’ve compiled a list below.</p>  <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="499" data-injectable="true">These give you powerful abilities, but you only have room for one in your armor.

<p data-characters="127" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Amid concerns around when <em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>could hit shelves, Rockstar Games reassured fans with an official release window. </p> <p data-characters="149" data-current-count="149" data-injectable="false">During a Take-Two Interactive <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/c189ec33-cb0d-44a0-8d20-2d3352836999" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investor earnings call </a>discussing future releases, Rockstar Games confirmed that <em>GTA 6</em> will launch in the <strong>fall of 2025</strong>.</p> <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="589" data-injectable="true">In December 2023, Rockstar Gave fans a first look at the upcoming title in an <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-drops-early-with-a-2025-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement trailer</a> with a 2025 release date. However, in March, Kotaku <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-development-2026-delay-rockstar-office-release-1851359831" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that the title could be delayed to 2026 as development was allegedly falling behind. Those concerns were exacerbated when Rockstar Games <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-28/-grand-theft-auto-maker-tells-staff-to-return-to-office-five-days-a-week?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcwOTE1NzEzMiwiZXhwIjoxNzA5NzYxOTMyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTOUw1VTdUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.-RX5iw3WvXNoXh3WzdLx7HQS8izbfVBETAOBRJGUrV8&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly asked employees</a> to return to the office for five days a week, signaling something might have gone wrong in the development process. </p>
 <p data-characters="168" data-current-count="168" data-injectable="false">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, who broke the story, acknowledged those concerns and <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1762959172155433256?t=1Z3asCq7v7p7H2SGu4RcwQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> “employees are not thrilled” with Rockstar’s decision. </p> <figure data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="355" data-injectable="false">Even in light of those hiccups, the recent earnings call should help extinguish any concerns about a potential delay. However, we still only have one trailer to go on for any concrete information about the title. So besides a setting and a first-look at the protagonists, we still have much to learn about <em>GTA 6 </em>before the reported Fall 2025 release date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We’ve known for a while that <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gta-vi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> is coming out sometime in 2025, but when specifically in the year it might arrive has remained an open question. Some have held out some despearate hope that an early-2025 might happen, but it seems that’s not in the cards. <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/c189ec33-cb0d-44a0-8d20-2d3352836999" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Today as part of their latest earnings report</a> Take-Two Interactive clarified that GTA VI is coming out in fall of calendar year 2025.</p>
<p><em>“As we enter Fiscal 2025 with positive momentum, we expect to deliver Net Bookings of $5.55 to $5.65 billion. Our outlook reflects a narrowing of Rockstar Games' previously established window of Calendar 2025 to Fall of Calendar 2025 for Grand Theft Auto VI. We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase. Looking ahead, we believe that our Company is poised to achieve new levels of success, and we expect to deliver sequential growth in Net Bookings for Fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027. As we deliver our pipeline, we are confident that we will drive our scale, enhance our margins, and deliver industry-leading returns for our shareholders.”</em></p>
<p>So there you have it, mark your calendars GTA fans! Of course, there are still plenty of opportunity for delays. Some analysts <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-delay-likely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already predicted a slip to late 2025</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-falling-behind-early-2025-release-target-2026-possible/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">further delays are possible</a>. That said, hopefully Rockstar has enough runway do deliver on time. In other news, Take-Two has confirmed the unstoppable <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1791200143800487952" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GTA V has reached “approximately” 200 million copies sold</a>.</p>
<p>Haven’t been keeping up with GTA VI? Rockstar hasn’t revealed a lot of info about it yet, <a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-the-first-gta-6-trailer-live-trailer-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beyond that kickass first trailer</a>, but here’s a quick official description…</p>
<p><em>“Grand Theft Auto VI continues our efforts to push the limits of what’s possible in highly immersive, story-driven open-world experiences. We’re thrilled to be able to share this new vision with players everywhere. Grand Theft Auto VI heads to the state of Leonida, home to the neon-soaked streets of Vice City and beyond in the biggest, most immersive evolution of the Grand Theft Auto series yet.”</em></p>
<p>Grant Theft Auto VI will launch on Xbox Series X/S and PS5 in late 2025. Are you counting down the days?</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24158450/never-let-go-trailer-release-date-halle-berry-crawl-director</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/halle-berry%E2%80%99s-new-survival-horror-movie-never-let-go-looks-like-a-terrifying-trip-to-the-woods.873414/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24158450/never-let-go-trailer-release-date-halle-berry-crawl-director<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="8EGTyG">The low-key king of the modern survival-horror movie, Alexandre Aja — who’s made movies like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/12/20690919/crawl-movie-review"><em>Crawl</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22432477/oxygen-review-netflix"><em>Oxygen</em></a>, and <em>The Hills Have Eyes —</em> is back with a new film staring Halle Berry. The first trailer for <em>Never Let Go</em> was released on Thursday, and the movie already looks like a terrifying addition to Aja’s impressive canon of people trying to survive the very bad things that are happening to them. </p>
<p id="jglVk7"><em>Never Let Go</em> stars Berry as a mother of two twin boys. The whole family lives in the woods, way off the grid, with Berry insisting that they have to stay safe from the evil spirits that surround their cabin. One day, however, one of the boys starts to wonder if these spirits are real and sets out to discover the truth, only to get stranded in the woods, with his mother desperately trying to save him. </p>
<p id="hVdQO7">The trailer feels like a mix of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24134076/trap-trailer-thriller-release-date-m-night-shyamalan-pop-star">M. Night Shyamalan</a>’s <em>The Village</em> and John Krasinski’s <em>A Quiet Place</em>, with all the tension that combination implies. Berry’s character leads her kids into the woods, a rope tying them all together so no one gets lost, making for a pretty haunting image, and that’s not including the strange hands that reach out to grab the characters every now and then. </p>
<p id="SjRO7S">Along with Berry, the movie will also star Anthony B. Jenkins and Percy Daggs IV as her two sons, as well as Matthew Kevin Anderson as “The Stranger” and Stephanie Lavigne, whose character is simply called “The Evil.” </p>
<p id="gB2xwj"><em>Never Let Go</em> is set to be released in theaters on Sept. 27.</p>

I’ve only played a few hours so far but the beginning of a new era for <em>Diablo IV</em> is beginning to take shape, one where climbing the loot ladder feels more methodical and meaningful thanks to permanent unlocks (aspects and affixes) and more streamlined customization (tempering and masterworking).

The economy’s less broken, gold matters more, and leveling to 100 isn’t just a mindless Nightmare Dungeon grindfest. There are still things that may need tweaking in the future. Is leveling <em>too easy</em> now? Are the gold costs for masterworking putting players in the poor house? Maybe.

<p>Do you remember Skull &amp; Bones? It’s that pirate-themed game from Ubisoft that was released on February 13 following approximately 178 delays that made it seem as though the game would never see the light of day. When it was finally released, Skull &amp; Bones failed to take the gaming world by storm, and it was revealed that the player count was struggling somewhat shortly after launch.</p>



<p>Despite that, Ubisoft has remained optimistic, and off the back of a ‘tremendous community response’, the developer has outlined the plans for the game’s impending second season.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-skull-amp-bones-staying-afloat">Skull &amp; Bones Staying Afloat</h2>



<p>There’s almost nothing memorable about Skull &amp; Bones, but there’s a dedicated community holding up the game on a shaky set of shoulders – and that’s all that matters. For that community, Ubisoft is preparing a plethora of tweaks, changes, and additions for the second season of the game.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/skull-and-bones/news-updates/4JskVoFQcIbc50OENc1JxT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post on the Ubisoft blog</a>, it was revealed that a platform-wide ‘soft reset’ will take place as season two is deployed. This will include resetting Pieces of Eight, manufactories, and territories for almost every player. This is a balancing effort but it’ll also encourage players to get back out there and start building up again.</p>



<p>Here’s what Ubisoft is bringing to Skull &amp; Bones in season two:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ship Upgrades</li>



<li>Fleet Management</li>



<li>Helm Leases</li>



<li>New PvE &amp; Solo Game Modes</li>



<li>Balancing Manufactories</li>
</ul>



<p>It was noted that there would also be a fresh boss fight, a new and terrifying sea monster to battle, a brand-new ship, and a slew of weapons, armour, and furniture. That’s plenty for players to sink their cutlasses into, but more updates will be shared regarding the second season soon.</p>

<p>Take-Two Interactive has confirmed that Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 6 will be releasing in Fall 2025. The news comes as part of <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir/news/take-two-interactive-software-inc-reports-results-fourth-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the company’s FY 2024 earnings call</a> on Thursday.</p>



<p>“Our outlook reflects a narrowing of&nbsp;Rockstar Games’&nbsp;previously established window of Calendar 2025 to Fall of Calendar 2025 for&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>,” the company said. “We are highly confident that&nbsp;Rockstar Games&nbsp;will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase.”</p>



<p>The news of the Fall 2025 release for GTA 6 confirms recent rumors and reports surrounding the game’s status. There had been rumors of a possible announced delay into 2026, but Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-gta-6-delay-isnt-what-you-think/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was told at the time</a> that the game remained “on schedule” with it’s development. Any talk of a delay outside of 2025 at the time was “pure conjecture”</p>



<p>To add to the confirmation of the release date, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-take-two-interactive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that Take-Two and Rockstar “feel highly confident that we’ll deliver [GTA 6] in fall of 2025”.</p>



<h2 id="h-early-2025-was-never-happening">Early 2025 Was Never Happening</h2>



<p>As far as the “early 2025” release date that some had suggested, there was never any possibility of the game launching then. The plan since the trailer’s first release in December was to see a launch in Fall 2025, heading towards the holiday season.</p>



<p>Fall 2025 (September-mid December) remains quite a way off. Obviously, things can change within the game’s development. However, as it stands right now, the game remains on schedule as it was in March.</p>



<p>Just like what <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-28/-grand-theft-auto-vi-delay-report-spurs-overblown-concern" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier said</a> in March,  “for now, there’s no indication that anything significant has changed.”</p>

<p>Manor Lords has well and truly taken the gaming world by storm. Before being released on April 26, Manor Lords set the record for being the most wishlisted game on Steam, finding a spot on more than 3.2 million lists worldwide. Within a single day, Manor Lords sold one million copies, and now, less than three weeks later, the game has ticked over the two million mark.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-just-the-beginning">Just The Beginning</h2>



<p>Manor Lords is a monumental success, created by a solo developer and being built over several years. It came to be backed by Hooded Horse, a publisher specialising in strategy games, and that’s where the marketing magic began. Before long, Manor Lords was shaping up as one of the most innovative and highly-anticipated titles on Steam – and eventually on other platforms.</p>



<p>It was released on Game Pass when it dropped on April 26, which boosted the game’s profile to no end. In a statement, the CEO of Hooded Horse, Tim Bender, praised the game’s success:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s been wonderful to see so many players give&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords</em>&nbsp;a try. We had some pretty optimistic expectations and even some wild hopes, but reaching two million copies on&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords</em>&nbsp;so quickly has exceeded even those.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to information released by Hooded Horse, Manor Lords boasts a conversation rate of a whopping 26 percent. That’s a solid number, and the game is still a hit – it might have slipped down the top sellers list on Steam, but it’ll be a long time before it disappears entirely, especially with the plans that are in the pipeline to continually develop the game over time.</p>



<p>Have you given Manor Lords a try yet?</p>

        <p>Rockstar's latest now set to arrive fall of 2025 as impairment charges see publisher post $3.74bn net loss</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
Take-Two today released its financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter, covering the three months ended March 31, narrowing the Grand Theft Auto 6 release window while taking a massive loss thanks largely to goodwill impairment and restructuring charges.
</p>
<h2>
The Q4 numbers
</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net revenue:</strong> $1.40 billion (down 3% year-over-year)</li>
<li><strong>Net loss:</strong> $2.9 billion (compared to a $610 million loss in the year-ago quarter)</li>
<li><strong>Total net bookings:</strong> $1.35 billion (down 3% year-over-year)</li>
</ul>
<h2>
The full-year numbers
</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net revenue:</strong> $5.35 billion (flat year-over-year)</li>
<li><strong>Net loss:</strong> $3.74 billion (compared to a $1.12 million loss in the last fiscal year)</li>
<li><strong>Total net bookings:</strong> $5.33 billion (up 1% year-over-year)</li>
</ul>
<h2>The highlights</h2>
<p>
When Take-Two reported its fiscal 2023 earnings last year, it took the unusual step of talking about numbers more than a year into the future, saying it expected $8 billion in bookings for fiscal 2025. While it never said it outright, this was largely taken to mean the much-anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 would launch in the company's fiscal 2025, which ends March 31, 2025.
</p>
<p>
Rockstar has indeed announced a 2025 release window for Grand Theft Auto 6, but Take-Two today said that has been narrowed to the fall of 2025, putting it in the publisher's fiscal 2026.
</p>
<p>
"We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase," Take-Two chairman and CEO Strauss Zelnick said in announcing the company's earnings. 
</p>
<p>
In a briefing call with <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> around the earnings, Zelnick acknowledged the increasing expectations around Grand Theft Auto 6, but declined to confirm whether those expectations are now larger than those of any other game the company has previously released.
</p>
<p>
"I couldn't be more enthusiastic than I am about Grand Theft Auto 6 and everything it can bring to consumers," Zelnick said. "I couldn't be more excited, but I'd probably stop short of establishing any expectations. As a practice, we prefer to talk about success after we've had it."
</p>
<p>
On that note, he pointed out that Grand Theft Auto 5 has now sold in about 200 million units worldwide, and engagement in Grand Theft Auto Online "is higher than we possibly could have expected."
</p>
<p>
Take-Two said Grand Theft Auto 5's audience size grew 35% for the full year, while Grand Theft Auto Online's audeince grew 23%.
</p>
<p>
Rockstar's other big game, Red Dead Redemption 2, has also now sold-in almost 64 million units worldwide.
</p>
<p>
On the 2K side of things, NBA 2K24 has sold-in 9 million copies, down from 11 million for NBA 2K23 at the same point in its lifespan.
</p>
<p>
And while it didn't give sales figures, Take-Two said that WWE 2K24 has been "a resounding success" with the highest Metacritic average for the franchise since Take-Two acquired it, and Borderlands 3 "outpaced our forecasts." 
</p>
<p>
Take-Two also said Zynga delivered "outstanding" results, with Toon Blast and Match Factory in particular performing well and Rollic passing a cumulative 3.5 billion downloads all-time.
</p>
<p>
Despite those upsides, Take-Two posted a GAAP net loss of $2.9 billion for the fourth quarter, primarily thanks to $2.18 billion in goodwill impairment charges and another $304.3 million in charges for acquisition-related intangible assets.
</p>
<p>
Further bringing down the bottom line were $93.3 million in charges because of its third cost-reduction program involving layoffs and restructuring in a little over a year.
</p>
<p>
When asked why the company needed three cost-cutting programs in such a short span of time, Zelnick gave his reasons for each.
</p>
<p>
"Anytime you acquire a company of [Zynga's] scale, you would naturally expect to have integration savings, and we certainly did," Zelnick said of the first cuts, noting that Take-Two aimed for $100 million in savings with that program and exceeded the goal.
</p>
<p>
"Thereafter, we looked around and said times are a little tougher than we thought," he continued. "That was a reflection of post-pandemic consumer behavior being a bit more cautious than perhaps we and others expected."
</p>
<p>
That led to the second $50 million cost-reduction program, another target he said the company met.
</p>
<p>
"Most recently we said we expect to reduce current and expected spending by about $165 million, which will benefit us this year and going forward. And that's simply a reflection of the fact that as an industry and a company, perhaps we became a little less disciplined."
</p>
<p>
He then reiterated the company's strategy to be the most creative, innovative and efficient company in the entertainment business, saying the programs have been an effort to "put a fine point on efficiency." 
</p>
<p>
Taking the goodwill impairment and amortization out of the equation, Take-Two reported fourth quarter EBITDA of negative $19.6 million. For the full-year, that would have been positive EBITDA of $272 million.
</p>
<p>
Amortization of acquired intangibles is likely to dampen the company's current fiscal year as well, with Take-Two forecasting a net loss in fiscal 2025 between $606 million and $674 million, thanks in large part to a $710 million amortization hit. It would be the third straight year of net losses for the publisher.
</p>
<p>
The remainder of the outlook numbers for the current fiscal year are a bit better, with revenues between $5.57 billion and $5.67 billion (up 4% to 6%) and bookings between $5.55 billion and $5.65 billion (also up 4% to 6%).
</p>
<p>
"Looking ahead, we believe that our company is poised to achieve new levels of success, and we expect to deliver sequential growth in Net Bookings for Fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027," Zelnick said. "As we deliver our pipeline, we are confident that we will drive our scale, enhance our margins, and deliver industry-leading returns for our shareholders."
