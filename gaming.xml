		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/beast-of-reincarnation/">Beast of Reincarnation</a>, the upcoming action role-playing game created by Pokémon series developers Game Freak, has been given a release date of August 4th 2026.</p>
<p>Set in the post-apocalyptic ruins of Japan in the year 4026, the game follows Emma the Sealer and her dog Koo as they battle to restore their homeland from a blight that has ravaged the land.</p>

<p>Emma is infused by the Blight in an interesting way, able to sprout vines from her hair, while Koo also has foliage growing on their back. They battle against ‘malefacts’ who also have these nature-based powers, with Emma able to defeat and then seal their essence within herself. There’s also Golems, the mechanical bodies inhabited by human minds that transferred themselves millennia ago.</p>
<p>The combat looks pretty engaging, with Emma landing blows and parrying incoming attacks, building up to be able to freeze the action and then unleash an ability from Koo. Both Emma and Koo have separate skill trees. There are different approaches you could take, like fighting exclusively from long range, using stealth, or having Koo lead in to strike first.</p>

<p>Beast of Reincarnation is coming to PS5 and Xbox Series X|S and will also be available on Xbox Game Pass from day one.</p>

			<p>During <a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yesterday's State of Play broadcast</a>, <strong>KONAMI</strong> and <strong>Annapurna Interactive</strong> have unveiled the first gameplay trailer for <strong>Silent Hill: Townfall</strong>. The spin-off psychological horror game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-announced-annapurna-no-code-observer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was announced back in 2022</a></strong>, and this is the first time we learn anything concrete about it. Meanwhile, the development team, originally known as <strong>No Code</strong> (the same ones behind <strong>Stories Untold</strong> and <strong>Observation</strong>), has rebranded to <strong>Screen Burn</strong>.</p>



<p>More information was revealed in the subsequent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPE5XdS1OBw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill Transmission</a>, where the game was described as a full-length, self-contained adventure <strong>set in cold Scotland</strong> and <span><strong>played entirely in first-person</strong>, marking</span> a significant shift from the series' usual third-person perspective.</p>



<p>Writer and director <strong>Jon McKellan</strong> said:</p>



<p><em>Our main objectives were to make a game that could feel specific to the team who made it, to bring something new to the series in terms of setting and to really think about what Silent Hill, both in concept and gameplay, could look like through a Screen Burn lens.</em></p>



<p>According to Screen Burn, <strong>the first-person perspective fundamentally reshapes how players experience Silent Hill's horror</strong>. Lead Game Designer <strong>Graeme McKellan</strong> emphasized that the limited field of view creates tension through what happens off-screen, noting that <strong>what happens off-screen is sometimes even scarier than what happens right in front of the player</strong>.</p>



<p>Combat offers familiar tools to players, such as planks of wood, pipes, and firearms, but also introduces meaningful choices between confrontation and evasion. <strong>A peeking gameplay mechanic allows the protagonist, Simon Ordell, to lean carefully around corners and over walls</strong>, assessing threats before committing to action. </p>



<p>Screen Burn's signature analog technology aesthetic manifests in the CRTV, <strong>a handheld pocket television that reimagines Silent Hill's iconic radio</strong>. Players physically bring up the device and manually tune through frequencies to discover narrative content and detect enemy positions. Graeme McKellan added:</p>



<p><em>We really wanted the player to bring it up and actually use it. The analog tech, that's kind of been my visual calling card. Most of the things we've done, even in our previous games, has been as close to real-life technology as we can get.</em></p>



<p>The developers have described the main character of Silent Hill: Townfall as a <strong>layered, uncertain, and deeply human being</strong> who returns to the island town of St. Amelia after receiving a mysterious phone call asking him to come to the island and put things to rest.</p>



<p>Jon McKellan confirmed <strong>guilt serves as a central theme</strong>, explored through different manifestations: </p>



<p><em>Guilt is a strong theme throughout Silent Hill's many stories, and I wanted to dive deeper into the various different ways that guilt can manifest. Where it comes from, what it can do to people, and how, if you can, come to accept or resolve it. </em></p>



<p>The narrative <strong>maintains Screen Burn's signature mystery-driven storytelling</strong>, with players gradually uncovering both small details and major reveals as they meet other characters whose connections to Simon prove crucial. Some mysteries resolve as the game progresses, while others will only deepen, <strong>inviting players to explore every corner of the town</strong>. </p>



<p>The inspiration for St. Amelia <strong>draws heavily from real locations along Scotland's east coast, particularly fishing villages like St Monans</strong>. The development team conducted extensive location scouting, capturing not just visuals but the atmosphere, smell, wind, and sound of these coastal settlements.</p>



<p>A key inspiration came from the so-called <strong>Haar</strong>, a dense fog that rolls in along Scotland's east coast. Jon McKellan recalled an early research trip where the fog became so thick that he and his brother lost sight of the coast and couldn't determine which direction it was. The fog is, of course, a fundamental element of mystery in the whole series, so <strong>it was a perfect fit for Silent Hill: Townfall</strong>, too.</p>



<p>Screen Burn <strong>only employs around 30 developers</strong>, but this is still going to be a full-length game, and publisher Annapurna Interactive said <strong>it's going to be one of the biggest games they've published yet</strong>.</p>

<p>Launching next week</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The lovely, heartfelt 2D adventure <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/neva">Neva</a> is getting a paid DLC expansion, and it'll cost you less than the vast majority of Starbucks' menu.</p>
<p>Launching on <strong>19th February</strong>, <strong>Neva: Prologue</strong> will set you back a mere <strong>£2.49</strong> in the UK and will reveal how the game's key protagonists, Alba and Neva, first became involved with one another.</p>
<p>The expansion will introduce three new locations along with some unique game mechanics, and developer Nomada Studio has stressed that it's intended to be played <em>after</em> the main game. It looks pretty cool though, with the trailer showcasing some creatures that look awfully similar to No-Face from <strong>Spirited Away</strong>. Hey, not a bad thing.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the official description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Follow Alba as she chases a trail of white butterflies deep into the corrupted swamps, only to discover a frightened wolf cub, lost and alone. Determined to save her, Alba must earn the young wolf's trust and guide her through the blighted wilderness. Together, they will face new enemies, endure perilous trials, and confront a monstrous force that threatens to tear them apart.</p>
<p>Designed to be experienced after completing the main game, Neva: Prologue offers a deeper challenge and rich narrative for returning players. The expansion introduces three new locations, each featuring unique gameplay mechanics, alongside new challenges, enemies, and intense boss encounters.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Meanwhile, if you've yet to experience the main game, we called Neva "a spectacular example of art in motion, delivering a thoroughly engrossing platforming experience that’ll stick in your mind long after you’ve rolled credits" in our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/neva">9/10 review</a>.</p>
<p>So yeah, we think it's well worth checking out.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-pokopia-hands-on-preview/</link>
            <guid>1435045</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokopia is less than a month away from a big release, and after a hands-on experience at Pokémon EUIC, it’s fair to say my excitement levels are reaching unprecedented levels.</p>



<p>First revealed in September’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon/" id="181" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> Presents, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/pokemon-pokopia/" id="2965" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokopia</a> is the latest spin-off game in the franchise’s 30-year history, and, while not every game under the Pokémon banner has been a hit over the years, Pokopia is showing every sign of being a huge phenomenon in the same fashion that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/pokemon-go/" id="52102" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Go</a> was.</p>







<h2 id="h-pokopia-will-attract-players-new-and-old">Pokopia Will Attract Players New And Old</h2>

</figure>



<p>During a short demo at Pokémon EUIC, one major standout from the experience was that Pokopia is going to appeal to the masses, thrilling long-term Pokémon fans who want a new way to play with their favourite characters, as well as opening doors to those who don’t have much experience with the franchise.</p>



<p>Even from the short session, it was clear there are various levels of depth with Pokopia. Those who want a simple experience hanging out with their favourite Pokémon will get exactly that, while those seeking deeper content and a more extensive list of tasks are also suited. Flicking through the menus, I was delighted to find a huge page of collectables, including fossils and relics from the human world.</p>



<p>The process of attracting new Pokémon to join you is simple. Like the classic Viva Piñata games, each Pokémon has environmental requirements, ranging from shaded grass beneath a tree to a bench next to a punching bag. Some Pokémon are harder to attract than others, with more complex requirements or a specific time of day needed, and, once they’re a part of your new home, you’ll need to make further adjustments by crafting items or making more environmental changes to increase a Pokémon’s comfort levels.</p>



<p>Again, this appeals to all players. Those who just want to hang out with Pokémon can do that and not worry too much about comfort levels, while completionists will be constantly pushing to ensure everyone is happy.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-come-to-life-in-a-new-way">Pokémon Come to Life in a New Way</h2>



<p>Another standout from the demo was how the Pokémon come to life in entirely new ways, each having its own personality, likes, and dislikes. You can give Pokémon gifts to raise their friendship level, and speaking to the Pokémon I found across the area instantly sparked memories of discovering my favourite, and least-favourite, residents in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/animal-crossing/" id="3053" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Crossing</a>.</p>



<p>The Pokémon will also interact with each other, and I couldn’t help but laugh when Bulbasaur told me that Geodude smells nice. These types of interactions with Pokémon were one of the reasons why the Mystery Dungeon games were so good, and bringing them to life on Switch 2 in this way opens the door to countless more memories being created.</p>



<p>All in all, I can’t wait to get my hands on Pokopia again, and I can already tell I’m going to sink countless hours unlocking everything and perfecting my Pokémon home.</p>

            <p>Last night, we got a flurry of PlayStation-flavoured announcements thanks to the most recent State of Play. From the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-biggest-surprise-of-the-night-a-brand-new-aaa-john-wick-game-coming-from-the-developer-of-space-marine-2">gun-fu of Jon Wick</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/open-world-ps5-game-project-windless">the hench chicken man in Project Windless</a> to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gris-developers-beautiful-neva-gets-new-prologue-and-its-coming-sooner-than-youd-think">the serene colour palette of Neva: Prologue</a>, it was a pretty stacked show.</p>
<p>But, something you may have missed, is that when the next title from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/untitled-goose-game">Untitled Goose Game</a> developer House House makes its debut later this year, it will be available on PS Plus (the Essential tier) from day one. Huzzah!</p>
<p>Big Walk, as the studio's upcoming game is called, is a cooperative multiplayer adventure all about teamwork and talking.</p>
<p>"Set out with your friends through a wide-open world full of challenges, puzzles, and discoveries. You'll need to work together to find your way around, stay in contact using an assortment of tools and toys, and figure out new ways to communicate when you suddenly find yourself speechless," reads the official blurb.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>House House</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Away from these adventures, there will still be time "to just hang out" with your friends. Hanging out can include watching the sunset, or if that sounds too serene, you could instead "steal your friend's binoculars and kick them into the ocean". I mean, sure, why not. In the words of House House, "spending time with friends is the best part of a big walk".</p>
<p>You can check out Big Walk's PS5 trailer below. On its release later this year (exact date TBC), Big Walk will also be coming to PC.</p>

		<p>Nomada Studio and Devolver Digital have announced Neva: Prologue, a DLC expansion for the gorgeous side-scrolling adventure that will be coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Switch and PC on 19th February. Oh, and it’s just £2.49.</p>
<p><iframe title="Neva: Prologue | Coming February 19" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SELjelhDqDc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>If you wondered just how it was that Alba met her wolf companion Neva in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/22/neva-review/">the 2024 game</a>, then Neva: Prologue is set to answer that. It will start as Alba follows white butterflies into a corrupted swamp, only to find a frightened wolf cub, lost and alone. Alba will have to earn the wolf’s trust, fight new enemies together and overcome monsters that are stalking them.</p>
<p>While it is a prequel story, it’s designed to be played after completing the main game. It will come with three new locations, each with new gameplay mechanics, new challenges, enemies and boss encounters. Completionists will also have five hidden challenge flowers to seek out.</p>

<p>Revealed during last night's PlayStation State of Play, Belmont's Curse has already been confirmed to be on its way to PC when it releases at some point in 2026. Konami, Evil Empire, and Motion Twin - the latter two being the Dead Cells devs - sum its premise up as follows:</p>
<blockquote>1499. Paris is engulfed as monstrous creatures suddenly emerge from the shadows. Armed with the legendary holy whip, the Vampire Killer, Trevor Belmont’s successor ventures into the burning streets and the looming castle to hunt down the beasts. Will she succeed in saving Paris from devastation…?</blockquote>
<p>Naturally, speculation's rife that this mysterious protagonist is Belmont and mage Sypha Belnades' daughter. Regardless, she'll be using the whip, a sword, and more weapons to be revealed down the line as she slices through colourfully-rendered gothic chambers, battling foes and searching for hidden secrets.</p><p>Konami have been quick to put their tease trousers on and declare in <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/castlevania/eu/en/">a post</a> on Castlevania's 40th anniversary website that Belmont's Curse is just the first step in a wider revival of the classic series. "This year marks the 40th anniversary since the original ‘Akumajō Dracula’ first saw the light of day. In this commemorative year, 'Castlevania' will be revived," the publishers declared. "This is the beginning of numerous new products around Castlevania. Look forward to the return of the magnificent 'nightmare' lurking in the darkness."</p>
<p>If you're in need of convincing why Evil Empire and Motion Twin are great candidates for Konami to have gotten involved in this big vamprevival, at least in theory, here's an excerpt from Brendy's (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-cells-review">Dead Cells review</a>:</p>
<blockquote>In short, every little fracas is a trial of quickness, luck and body memory, and it feels superb. I could talk more about the daily challenge mode, or the new "malaise" that infects you when certain enemies strike, or whether or not the game counts as a “true metroidvania” (this is an argument that boils the collective piss of team RPS and will never be resolved). But I’m happier to just recommend it on the strength of its movement alone. Blisteringly fast when it needs to be, challenging without being frustrating, and packed with sharp, fatal toys, Dead Cells doesn’t keep you on your toes, it keeps you on your toenails.</blockquote>

<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>



<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contexto</a>&nbsp;a go if you haven’t already!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-play-contexto">How To Play Contexto</h2>

<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Start off using broad terms, then narrow down once you’ve got under the 1,000 mark.</li>



<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-starting-words-for-contexto">Best Starting Words For Contexto</h2>



<p><strong>Here are some great starting words to get you going with Contexto:</strong></p>

            <p>Sony has lifted the lid on its PS Plus Premium and Extra game offerings for February.</p>
<p>Some of these games leaked ahead of schedule, but there are still more than a few surprises joining the service later this month.</p>
<p>The following games will be available for Premium and Extra PS Plus members from 17th February:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 | PS5</li>
<li>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown | PS5</li>
<li>Neva | PS5, PS4</li>
<li>Season: A Letter to the Future | PS5, PS4</li>
<li>Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin | PS4</li>
<li>Monster Hunter Stories | PS4</li>
<li>Venba | PS5</li>
<li>Echoes of the End: Enhanced Edition | PS5</li>
<li>Rugby 25 | PS5, PS4</li>
</ul>
<p>PlayStation Plus Premium members will also be able to play the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Disney Pixar Wall-E | PS5, PS4</li>
</ul>

<p>The big headliner here is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>, which reunites players with Spider-Man (of course) as well as Miles Morales and MJ. "At once a little simple and a little over-stuffed, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is still above all a game of immense charm and fluid, free-form style," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-review-1">four star review from 2023</a>.</p>
<p>I would also fully recommend Neva, which is the most recent game from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gris">Gris</a> developer Nomada Studio. It follows the story of a young woman named Alba and a magnificent wolf, with whom she forms a lifelong bond.</p>
<p>We also awarded Neva four stars on its release. "Nomada Studio follows up on the striking Gris with an effort that's poignant and precise, if maybe just a tad melodramatic," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neva-review">Eurogamer's Neva review from 2024</a>.</p>
<p>During last night's PlayStation State of Play, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gris-developers-beautiful-neva-gets-new-prologue-and-its-coming-sooner-than-youd-think">Nomada actually announced a prequel game known as Neva: Prologue</a>, which takes us back to when Alba meets her young wolf companion. So, having Neva on PS Plus is a very timely addition (it is almost like Sony and co also thought this).</p>
<p>Also, a quick shout out for Venba, a cooking game which also delves into the emotional impact of food and family. We called the game a "beautiful slice-of-life tale" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/venba-review-tasty-puzzles-and-a-recipe-book">Eurogamer's four star Venba review</a>.</p>
<p>Has anything taken your fancy from this batch of games? For more on the service, be sure to check out our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">guide to PS Plus and all the available games</a>.</p>

            <p>If you watched last night's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-everything-announced">Sony State of Play</a> and were especially hyped over Castlevania: Belmont's Curse, there's some really good news for you tucked away on <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/castlevania/eu/en/">the official Castlevania website</a>.</p>
<p>This news is that Castlevania: Belmont's Curse is just the beginning of new Castlevania "products". In a message released as part of the series' 40th anniversary, the Castlevania series production team teased what the future holds.</p>
<p>"The doors of Castlevania open once more," the statement reads. "This year marks the 40th anniversary since the original 'Akumajō Dracula' first saw the light of day. In this commemorative year, "Castlevania" will be revived."</p>
<p>Coming first is Castlevania: Belmont's Curse, as announced at the State of Play. Konami says that the development studios working on the game, Evil Empire and Motion Twin, are "brimming with talent and passion.". Konami hopes they will "deliver a new exploration-based 2D action game that captures the essence of Castlevania while bringing fresh innovation."</p><p>Now the key bit for fans hoping for a big revival of the series: "This is the beginning of numerous new products around Castlevania. Look forward to the return of the magnificent "nightmare" lurking in the darkness," reads the statement. While not explicitly saying new games (Castlevania has already had comics and TV series), you've got to assume more games will be part of this future.</p>
<p>That's all we have for now, but it's certainly an exciting development in a Konami series that has been largely absent for many years now. Whether these new games will stay classic in genre like Belmont's Curse, or if we'll see a new 3rd person action game like the Lords of Shadow series (yes please) remains a mystery. One can dream!</p>
<p>If you like the look of Belmont's Curse, it's available to wishlist now with a 2026 release date.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-february-13-978/</link>
            <guid>1435006</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s Friday… But it’s Friday the 13th! Let’s hope you’re not superstitious, otherwise you’ll be too busy watching your back today to complete this NYT Connections puzzle that I have all the answers for. If you want to smash today’s NYT Connections puzzle and get back to hiding from black cats and the likes, just scroll on down.</p>



<p>I’ve got the NYT Connections hints and solutions you need to dominate this challenge and get into the weekend with ease.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-nyt-connections">How to Play NYT Connections</h2>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-february-13">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (February 13)</h2>



<p>Here are the words from today’s NYT Connections puzzle:</p>



<ul>
<li>WAYNE</li>

<p>Here's the Castlevania 40th Anniversary message in full:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The doors of Castlevania open once more.</p>
<p>This year marks the 40th anniversary since the original ‘Akumajō Dracula’ first saw the light of day.<br>
In this commemorative year, “Castlevania” will be revived.</p>
<p>First up is this title: ‘Castlevania: Belmont's Curse’.</p>
<p>We couldn’t think in other studios to work together rather than Evil Empire and Motion Twin, studios brimming with talent and passion, to deliver a new exploration-based 2D action game that captures the essence of Castlevania while bringing fresh innovation.</p>
<p>This is the beginning of numerous new products around Castlevania.</p>
<p>Look forward to the return of the magnificent “nightmare” lurking in the darkness.</p>
<p>Castlevania series Production Team</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Apart from the new project Belmont's Curse, which the developers behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dead_cells">Dead Cells</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a> are working on, what else would you like to see from this long-running series this year? <em>Let us know in the comments.</em></p>

			<p><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards</a></strong> might have the words 'awards' in the title, but anyone who has seen <strong>Geoff Keighley's</strong> annual show knows that it's more about the announcements than the awards. The <strong>DICE Awards,</strong> however, are the absolute opposite. It's all about the awards, and it's all about the people who make the games that win those awards.</p>



<p>With the nominees and winners selected by the <strong>Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences (AIAS)</strong>, it's arguably the closest thing the video game industry has to The Oscars, if only because every winner gives thanks to "<em>the academy</em>."</p>



<p>Leading into this year's show, the expectation was that <strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> was going to be the game to run away with every big award for the night. <strong>Ghost of Yōtei</strong> and Expedition 33 came into the show <a href="https://wccftech.com/29th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-full-list-clair-obscur-ghost-of-yotei-arc-raiders-dispatch/">tied with eight nominations apiece,</a> and Expedition 33 was coming off a full sweep of all the awards it was nominated in at The Game Awards.</p>



<p>So when it began the evening by winning the <strong>Role-Playing Game of the Year</strong> category, it felt like we were in for another night of Expedition-wins-all-the-awards-33-times.</p>

<p>But then Ghost of Yōtei took home <strong>Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition</strong> and <strong>Outstanding Achievement in Character.</strong> Two awards whose equivalents went to Expedition 33 at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">The Game Awards</a> and at the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">Golden Joysticks</a></strong>. It felt like there was a chance that this would be the one awards show where Expedition 33 did not dominate the night.</p>



<p>But that's not exactly how the DICE Awards went. Expedition 33 took home <strong>five awards total</strong>, including <strong>Outstanding Achievement in Story,</strong> in <strong>Game Direction</strong>, <strong>Art Direction, </strong>and the big award of the night, <strong>Game of the Year</strong>, which extends its lead as <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-most-awarded-game-wccftech-awards-elden-ring/">the game with the most GOTY wins ever</a> by one.</p>



<p>Ghost of Yōtei came up behind it with <strong>three wins</strong>, while <strong>Blue Prince</strong> went back-to-back with its <strong>two wins</strong> of the night, taking home the awards for <strong>Outstanding Achievement in Game Design</strong> and <strong>Outstanding Achievement for an Independent Game</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</strong> was the other multi-winner of the evening, and the only one not included in the GOTY nominees. Of those nominees, <strong>Dispatch</strong> was the only game to walk away empty-handed, with <strong>ARC Raiders,</strong> the game that's easily the <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-radiers-14m-copies-sold-record-high-revenue-nexon/">best-selling title so far</a> among the GOTY nominees, bringing home the award for <strong>Online Game of the Year.</strong></p>

<p>Other highlights of the night included a particularly emotional tribute to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/vince-zampella-game-devs-share-stories-after-tragic-loss/">Vince Zampella</a></strong>, one of the modern video game industry's most influential creators, and not just because he was one of the co-creators of <strong>Call of Duty</strong>. His impact as a mentor to younger generations of developers and his ability to leave his mark on everyone who worked with him were beautifully expressed, and showed how the developers he inspired will be the greater legacy he leaves behind.</p>



<p>The other major tribute of the night went to <strong>Naughty Dog</strong> veteran <strong>Evan Wells</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/naughty-dog-co-president-evan-wells-retires/">who retired in 2023</a> after working at the studio for a quarter of a century, most of it as the studio's lead. He was inducted into the DICE Hall of Fame and was introduced by long-time colleague and the person who succeeded him, <strong>Neil Druckmann</strong>.</p>



<p>And a tribute made by everyone who got the chance to have a few moments with a microphone tonight was to their video game industry peers in the room and around the world. Nearly everyone who spoke tonight delivered some kind of solidarity message to other developers, calling for a more sustainable industry where developers are treated fairly and with respect for one another and the craft of making video games.</p>



<p>Which, for <strong>Double Fine Productions</strong> art director, <strong>Lee Petty</strong>, includes knowing that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/googles-project-genie-shows-meaningful-progress-in-content-generation-but-it-cant-replace-creative-vision-says-analyst/">GenAI</a></strong> "<em>sucks</em>" and that instead of using those tools for things like animation, "<strong><em>you should hire a f***ing animator</em></strong>," comments that were part of his bit ahead of presenting the award for Outstanding Achievement in Animation.</p>



<p>Petty wasn't the only one to make their negative feelings about GenAI clear, and considering the fact that in that room tonight were likely video game industry executives who may have just pushed new policies encouraging or even mandating employees to start using GenAI tools, it couldn't help but feel like some back-talk aimed at those execs. Even more so for Petty when you consider who <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-trying-replace-jobs-ai-agents/">Double Fine's parent company is</a>.</p>



<p>With the DICE Awards wrapped, the last major awards night that'll look back on 2025 still to come is the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gdc-awards-clair-obscur-expedition-33-dominates/">GDC Awards</a></strong>, where, you may be shocked to learn, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has a nomination in almost every single available category. We'll see if it can pull off another sweep, or if one of either Blue Prince, Ghost of Yōtei, <strong>Hollow Knight Silksong, Donkey Kong Bananza</strong>, or <strong>Split Fiction</strong> will be able to snatch one GOTY crown away from one of video game's most winningest titles in the history of the medium.</p>

<p>After multiple reports of a second collection, Konami has today officially confirmed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2">Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2</a> is on its way to the Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>27th August 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Like the original volume, this will also be getting a physical release. Konami has outlined exactly what you can expect from this "physical version", and unsurprisingly, it's a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/every-nintendo-switch-2-game-key-card-release">Game-Key Card release</a> on the Switch 2. Meanwhile, on the original Switch, it appears you'll also be required to download part of the collection.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ulnsqr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

    <p><span>A deeper look at IO Interactive's original take on the origin of James Bond.</span>
      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > IO Interactive [171 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> has released the story trailer and new screenshots for <em><a title="Games > 007 First Light [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/007-first-light">007 First Light</a></em>. <span id="more-1026404"></span></p><p>“With <em>007 First Light</em>, we set out to reimagine the origin of James Bond, exploring the formative moments that shape him into the agent players know, but not yet the legend he will become,” said IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak in a press release. “This is a version of Bond who is still inexperienced and finding his footing in the world of espionage, yet already defined by the instincts, intelligence, and resolve that set him apart. Players will recognize the unmistakable qualities that make him Bond from the very beginning.”</p><p>Here are the latest details:</p><blockquote><p>Revealed during today’s Sony PlayStation State of Play, the story trailer sets the stage for a global intrigue, as Bond is recruited into MI6 and enters the world of espionage, full of hidden agendas and unseen threats. The trailer offers early glimpses of Bond’s exploits in Iceland, showcasing his decisive judgment, nerve, and resourcefulness that draw the attention of MI6, propelling him into the grueling training of the newly revived 00 programme. Still inexperienced and sometimes reckless, Bond (portrayed by Patrick Gibson) will have to confront his instincts with the structure and discipline of his new world, where initiative is not always rewarded, and obedience is often the expectation.</p><p>As he enters the world of espionage, Bond discovers an unexpected advocate in M (portrayed by Priyanga Burford), who recognizes his potential as an agent able to take control of desperate situations and complete his objectives, following his own judgment. John Greenway (portrayed by Lennie James), a former 00 agent and the programme’s training instructor, stands in contrast to Bond. A disciplined, by-the-book operative, Greenway’s strict philosophy quickly clashes with Bond’s instinctive and improvisational approach in the field. </p><p>Despite their differences, Bond and Greenway are forced to work together as the resurgence of 009, a former British operative now turned rogue, becomes the newly revived 00 programme’s first true test in the field. From the quiet Carpathian Mountains to the dangerous black market of Aleph, Bond’s pursuit takes him across the globe, leading him to the unpredictable Bawma (portrayed by Lenny Kravitz) and more. Bond will also have to contend with mysterious characters, such as Charlotte Roth (portrayed by Noemie Nakai), and determine where their loyalties lie before choosing who to trust.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

</section></header><section>

<p>During PlayStation's 'State of Play' broadcast earlier on, Capcom officially revealed the <a href="https://youtu.be/fXVy4mALHLY">fourth major (and terrifying) trailer</a> for its highly anticipated release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>.</p>
<p>It showcases scenes featuring both series legend Leon S. Kennedy and the FBI analyst Grace Ashcroft as well as the game's third-person and first-person modes. Towards the end of this latest trailer, there is a scene that should bring back plenty of nostalgic (and horrifying) memories. A certain character is also teased, but we won't spoil any surprises!</p>
<p>Once again, this game is out later this month for the Switch 2 on <strong>27th February 2026.</strong> In some other news, Capcom also <a href="https://youtu.be/LE57Fy2XxLA">showed off a new trailer</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a> today.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/fatal-frame-2-remake-makes-a-camera-the-scariest-weapon-in-gaming-ign-preview</link>
            <guid>1434892</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake<em> </em>doesn't open with a jump scare; it opens in a trance. As Mio, you watch helplessly as a crimson butterfly lures your twin sister, Mayu, into a fog-covered forest. There, the Lost Village swallows her whole. For over twenty-two years, this scene has haunted fans, myself included. Seeing the village emerge from the mist, modern lighting draping every rooftop and tree branch in dense volumetric fog, I knew immediately: this isn't a low-budget remaster. The dread in Fatal Frame 2 stems not only from the individually named wraiths stalking you through its haunted Japanese village – a place trapped in a festival of death – but also from the way Mayu grips your hand, dragging you toward dangers you're unprepared for. After roughly four hours with the first four chapters on PC, this remake already has its hooks in me — not only is it a faithful yet modernized take on what many consider the scariest game ever, its added visual fidelity makes the core mechanic of looking directly at what's trying to kill you that much harder to endure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fatal Frame 2's central mechanic remains one of the cleverest in survival horror. Your primary weapon is the Camera Obscura — a modified camera that damages wraiths by photographing them. That's it. No shotguns, no grenades stashed in a locker. You point a camera at something terrifying, and you take its picture. The series has been doing this since 2001, and it's still unlike anything else in the genre.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Camera Obscura uses focal points: crosshairs that identify a wraith's weak spots. Aligning more of these points when you take a photo increases the damage dealt. You can upgrade these focal points with prayer beads found throughout the environment, making each shot more lethal and rewarding exploration in classic survival horror style. But your camera can also deliver special shots that require willpower, and the effect varies depending on the equipped filter. While auto-focus helps you lock onto targets, manual focus rewards precision with more serious damage. And, despite Fatal Frame 2's penalties for proximity, keeping the viewfinder pulled back and standing dangerously close to a spirit was often the better strategy for dealing more damage and taking control of a fight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, willpower is a limited and valuable resource. If you get too close, a wraith will drain your willpower, leaving you vulnerable to a leering attack that flashes your screen and momentarily steals control, or allows the wraith to strike you more easily than it would at range.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Film types serve as your ammunition and create their own layer of resource tension. The basic Type-07 film is infinite but reloads slowly and hits weakly, while stronger film like the Type-61 deals significantly more damage but caps at eight shots and must be scavenged, as you can't buy more when you run out. Interchangeable filters add further complexity: the Standard Filter stuns enemies, the Paraceptual Filter blinds them at range and can eventually be upgraded to see through walls, and the Exposure Filter can unlock secret items and areas by reconstructing certain scenes with the Phantom Exposé mode. Each filter has its own upgrade path covering range, reload speed, and special shot duration, and since special shots cost willpower, you're also incentivized to invest your limited prayer beads into upgrading willpower recovery at the expense of raw damage. There's a lot of strategy here for players who want to dig into Fatal Frame 2’s intricate system.</p><p>There's a lot of strategy here for players who want to dig into Fatal Frame 2’s intricate system.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This excellent combat loop revolves around timing. You enter camera mode by holding the left trigger, frame the wraith with the right thumbstick, and slam the right trigger to activate the shutter. But your shots will typically be weaker unless you wait for it to telegraph an attack — you'll hear the wraith moaning while the screen flashes red — and then you hit the shutter for a Fatal Frame shot, which staggers the spirit and deals massive damage. Nail one while a wraith is already vulnerable and you trigger Fatal Time, a window for rapid-fire photos that automatically burns through your basic Type-07 film. The whole system punishes impatience and rewards the nerve to stand still while something horrible lunges at you, but it is slow. Deliberately so. Film reload times are long, enemies take a while to go down, and the rhythm of shooting, exiting camera mode, backpedaling, and re-entering is methodical by design — kinda like jousting, but with a camera instead of a lance. When the atmosphere is doing its job, which it usually is, the deliberateness feels meditative. Whether it stays that way across a full campaign is one of the bigger questions this preview can't yet answer.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Through the Viewfinder</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Three difficulty modes are available: Story, Normal, and Hard (Battle). Each is meaningfully tuned, with harder settings increasing wraith damage while rewarding more Photo Points for skilled shots. Those points feed into an item shop where you can purchase healing items and equippable stat-boosting charms, creating a risk-reward scale that shifts rather than simply punishing the player. I played most of the preview on Normal before switching to Story after Chapter Three. Even in Story, enemies hit hard enough to maintain tension — meaning these difficulty modes preserve the horror rather than trivialize it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of customizing the experience, I previewed Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake on a machine equipped with a Ryzen 3900X, RTX 4070 Ti, and 32GB of RAM at 3440x1440p ultrawide with max settings. In typical PC gamer fashion, my first adventure was the options menu itself, which deserves mention for its satisfying granularity. You can adjust vibration intensity separately for damage feedback, item searching, and even how hard Mio’s heart races during cutscenes. You can fine-tune camera behavior down to obstacle avoidance and rotation inertia; customize your graphical settings with precision; and even change the Camera Obscura's viewfinder style between a classic and modern look. If you can imagine a setting, this remake probably has it. It also ships with both English and Japanese audio, which is a welcome touch for a series with such deep roots in Japanese horror.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">PC players expecting an unlocked frame rate should note that it is capped at 60fps. Considering the attention to detail in areas like viewfinder styles and vibration settings, Fatal Frame 2's lack of broader accessibility features stands out. It already offers a deep UI and subtitle scaling, customizable text colors, named character labels, and text backgrounds — a solid foundation. However, the absence of screen reading or colorblind modes is particularly striking for a game built around photographing ghosts, where visual feedback like crosshair lock-ons, screen flashes, and color inversions drive the core loop. Screen reader support for the extensive menus, item descriptions, and collectible documents seems a natural extension of the text customization already in place. Games like The Last of Us Part 2 have shown that colorblind accessibility can be addressed through audiovisual indicators that don't rely on color alone, an approach that could work here without undermining the atmosphere.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Spirited Away</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Fatal Frame 2’s engrossing story centers on twin sisters Mio and Mayu, who stumble into Minakami Village — a place that vanished from a mountainside on the night of a failed ritual. The village was built over a gate to the underworld called the Hellish Abyss, and its residents performed a gruesome twin sacrifice to keep it sealed. When the ritual failed, the village was consumed by mist, and now it's full of restless spirits who want to reenact the whole thing using you.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The story setup hooked me immediately. Every room feels handcrafted to maximize unease — items clattering off shelves in adjacent hallways, rain pattering against rooftops while ghosts stalk corridors, the distant wail of a wraith telling you exactly where it is and exactly why you shouldn't be there. The sound design is relentless. Everything is precisely mixed, which makes the jump scares land harder because the baseline atmosphere is already ratcheted tight. Reach out to pick up an item, and a wraith may grab your hand instead, draining your willpower until you frantically mash the A button to shake it off. It's a small touch, but it means even looting feels dangerous.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each ghost has a name and backstory you can piece together through collectible documents and a spirit list that catalogs every encounter: the drowned woman on the bridge, the woman sealed in a box, the spirit in the Osaka house still searching for her lost boyfriend Masumi. It goes deep into the lore as well: by digging into the richly detailed village for scraps of lost journals and other items left behind, I uncovered that Masumi was a folklorist's assistant who vanished while surveying a forest slated for a dam, only for his girlfriend Miyako to follow him into the mist and meet the same fate.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">She's the spirit I fought in the Osaka house, and I loved playing through an entire 30-minute side quest dedicated to demystifying her background. Throughout the campaign, you photograph the former residents’ spectral remnants and slowly build a picture of the tragedy that consumed Minakami Village, giving Fatal Frame 2 a level of world-building that rewards curiosity without requiring it and gives every encounter a layer of melancholy underneath the fear.</p><p>Outside of combat, Fatal Frame 2 plays like a classic Resident Evil game, and that's a specific comparison.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The preview build also featured the Kusabi, a massive, unkillable entity that patrols certain areas. When it shows up, you can't fight it; you hide. It drains your willpower on contact, forces your screen into black and white, and disables the Camera Obscura entirely. One extended sequence in the Kurosawa mansion strips you of your flashlight while the Kusabi hunts you through dark hallways, and it's the most effective horror set piece in the preview. It's the kind of sequence that makes you realize how much the Camera Obscura normally functions as a security blanket.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">What in the Junji Ito?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of combat, Fatal Frame 2 plays like a classic Resident Evil game, and that's a specific comparison. Players navigate interconnected rooms, find keys, solve puzzles to unlock new areas, and occasionally discover that previously safe rooms now contain threats. Save points can be blocked by enemies. The structure creates a loop of dread, relief, and fresh dread that survival horror fans will immediately recognize.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/12/07-focus-point-1770924212486.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Puzzles are straightforward — one has you arranging dolls on a temple altar based on clues from a photograph — but they're woven into the environmental storytelling in ways that keep them from feeling like arbitrary roadblocks. Hidden collectibles include pairs of twin dolls that unlock items at the Photo Point exchange shop when photographed together. The previously mentioned Phantom Exposé system lets you recreate old photographs found in the environment to reveal hidden items. You match the framing of an old photo to uncover something that had vanished, giving genuine reason to revisit earlier areas with fresh eyes and a charged filter.</p><span data-cy="faceoff-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, your flashlight helps spot items but makes it easier for enemies to detect you, adding a stealth element that feeds directly into the tension. Some areas are better to sneak through if you can’t afford to fight a wraith head-on, and running away from a fight to the nearest save point is usually an option. It’s great that you heal automatically at save points, and while holding Mayu's hand also regenerates health, she was separated from Mio for two full chapters during the preview, leaving me reliant on rare healing items and careful play. Equippable charms provide small stat boosts — the Moonstone extends your dodge window, while Mayu’s Charm increases health recovery when holding hands. They're small build decisions that add texture without overcomplicating things.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/12/04-spirit-sae-kurosawa-02-1770924238762.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Fatal Frame 2 Remake’s controls feel deliberately stiff — you dodge on A, crouch on B, and open your inventory on X. There’s also some inertia when entering and exiting the Camera Obscura’s viewfinder with the left trigger. This layout makes sense after a while, but during the first two chapters, I often fumbled for the right input with a wraith bearing down on me. Depending on your tolerance, that's either a control issue or a horror feature.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Point and Shoot</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">It took roughly four hours to clear the first four chapters, partly due to combat difficulty and partly because the world rewards exploration, with plenty of nooks and crannies to dip into while scavenging for critical items and uncovering the elaborate depth of Minakami Village itself. The graphics and UI translate well to ultrawide, and fans will find the rebuilt classic scenes rich with detail. But some questions do remain about how well the rest of the campaign fares. The 60fps cap is an annoying albeit forgivable ceiling; the deliberate combat pacing could grow tiresome over a full campaign. It’s also too early to tell how faithfully the remake handles the original's multiple endings, although Fatal Frame 2's history and the deft handling of its campaign so far suggests greater narrative complexity ahead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Camera Obscura system remains unique in survival horror, the atmosphere is thick enough to feel physical, and the storytelling rewards the slow, careful attention this genre demands. If you loved the original, this is shaping up to be a worthy reintroduction. If you've never played Fatal Frame, this is the place to start — the entries are largely standalone, and this one was already considered the best back in 2003. Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake launches for PC, PS5, Switch 2, and Xbox Series on March 12, 2026.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/fatal-frame-2-remake-makes-a-camera-the-scariest-weapon-in-gaming-ign-preview]]></content:encoded>

<p>Rayman is officially back!</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Following rumours and a recent rating, we've now got an official announcement! Ubisoft's Rayman is back and he'll be returning in <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rayman_30th_anniversary_edition">Rayman: 30th Anniversary Edition</a></strong>.</p>
<p>This title has been confirmed for the original Switch and multiple other platforms, and the most exciting part is it's out this week on <strong>13th February 2026</strong><strong>!</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to the help of Digital Eclipse, it comes packed five versions of the 1995 classic. This covers the PlayStation, Atari Jaguar, MS-DOS, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance versions. Along with this, there's a "never-before-playable SNES prototype.</p>
<p>And if that wasn't enough, there'll also be 120 additional levels from bonus level packs, a reimagined soundtrack composed by Christophe Héral and enhanced gameplay features (including a 60-second rewind, infinite lives and invincibility).</p>
<p>Last but not least is an exclusive interactive documentary featuring "over 50 minutes of new interviews with the original developers". It also includes never-before-seen concept art, early sketches and design documents showcasing the "origins and evolution" of Rayman.</p>
