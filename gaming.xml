            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/christmas-holiday-pogues<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last night, my sister called me to ask what we did for Christmas as kids. We both had recollections of trees and presents when we were very little, but then our memories petered out. This was fine with us, but she lives in a world now that takes Christmas very seriously, and it seems like she always feels a bit out of step with the energy and traditions of her friends.&nbsp;</p><p>I don’t have many traditions myself these days. As I’ve mentioned before, I used to spend a lot of my holidays working as a dog walker, and in later years I’ve mostly happily spent them by myself. I’ve never felt the social pressure my sister does to make the holiday special, especially since she has kids. But I’m fascinated by people who have strong opinions on the holiday and how it should be spent, who can have a “good” or “bad” holiday based on whether they live up to some standards I’ve never been obligated to. What I’ve always liked best about this time of year is the sense of timelessness I move through as someone without the demands of family or tradition, swimming through these weeks when everyone is distracted and so no one wants or expects anything of me, where I can follow my own moods and make or cancel plans and everyone just chalks my inconsistency up to the chaos of the holidays.&nbsp;</p><p>For a while, that unobserved space was just an excuse to get <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-to-play-games-sober-1839509936" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">drunk</a>; I’ve spent more Christmases than I’d care to admit perched on a solitary bar stool. At the time I thought this was a romantic subversion of the idea that being alone at a bar on Christmas is a sad-sack sign of rock bottom; now that I’m sober I can see that it was in fact kinda sad, even if it didn’t feel sad at the time. So now I do other stuff with my time: I’ll often cook something ambitious. Sometimes I’ll watch every Christmas episode of <a href="https://aftermath.site/bobs-burgers-has-some-nice-snow" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Bob’s Burgers</em></a> (a good tradition that you should also take up) while eating that food. This year I’m seeing some friends before going to visit my family.</p><p>There’s a lot of pressure to be happy on Christmas, or a certain different weight to any sadness you might feel compared to all the other days of the year. But I think there can also be something lovely about an off-kilter Christmas, a gently sad or maybe introspective or unremarkable one, or maybe one where you just have your normal feelings but they feel abnormal when compared to what you’re “supposed” to feel. What I was trying to capture with those drunk holidays, and what I now actually get to capture with my sober ones, is the reminder that there is no one way to live, no groove that everyone wears through life. I love how the day can be all bright lights and matching sweaters for some people, and for others it can be Chinese food and a movie, and for others it can be just a normal day, and for people like me it can be a day to think about how my days are spent and if I want to keep spending them that way.&nbsp;</p><p>Which brings me to the actual inspiration for this blog, which is to tell you about my friend <a href="https://www.anxietyshark.ca/and-the-bells-are-ringing-out-for-christmas-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Niko Stratis’ blog</a>, whom I dared on Bluesky to rank how all the covers of The Pogues’ “Fairytale of New York” try to avoid singing some of the slurs in the 1987 song that aren’t appropriate today. Niko writes,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>[“Fairytale of New York” is] a song of contrasts; this band as a collective gathering of rough hewn troubadours of heartache and drink, Shane MacGowan sees and sings to the dark corners of the barroom that many would rather avert their gaze [to] and this is an important piece in the puzzle that builds the tremendous vision of beauty that is “Fairytale of New York”. These two people at the centre, Irish Immigrants in a jail cell who once felt so much hope and promise now embittered by time and circumstance.&nbsp;</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Pogues -  Fairytale Of New York (Official Video)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j9jbdgZidu8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>“Fairytale of New York” has become a kind of de facto Christmas classic, but it’s not one that you’d have soft-edged memories of singing around the piano. Niko dug through all the weird “haggard”s and “blagger”s and “maggot”s that replace the song’s most jarring slur, and while they gave me a <a href="https://www.thescottishsun.co.uk/news/3575851/viral-taggart-fairytale-new-york-suggestion-pc/amp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laugh</a> they also made me think about the the combination of beauty and pain that make the song so affecting, and make it feel so right for the complicated feelings of this season. It’s a beautiful song, but also a song full of mean, sad characters who wallow in their meanness and sadness before reaching for something different and gentle, something they ultimately fall short of but are still, by virtue of being (fictional) humans, entitled to want. In one way, rewriting the words is an effort to make the song live up to expectations that it so intentionally bucks, to turn it from a Pogues song into something you can play on the radio as part of the soundtrack to an idealized “perfect” holiday. In another way, by recognizing that Hozier and Ed Sheeran and an a capella choir shouldn’t say a slur, it’s a kind of growth that maybe unintentionally captures the clumsiness of growth. These ill-fitting rhymes are imperfect new traditions, messy improvements that fit right in with the song and its story and this whole time of year.</p><p>I hope I never have another drunk Christmas, but I’m always aware that I can’t say that for sure. Those bar stool holidays were a way of shining up my everyday drinking, and I can see in them now a yearning for a different feeling that I eventually found. This year has been far from perfect for me, and it’s hard to have hope that next year will be better. But a weird day, like a weird lyric, can be OK. If your holiday isn’t what you want it to be, I hope you can find a way to follow the call in that desire. But if it just isn’t what everyone is telling you it “should” be, I hope you can instead honor what it is. You can have a weird one this year, an ill-fitting rhyme or an out-of-step day, and a different one next year, or maybe just the same one that you feel differently about. You can try out new words. You can write another verse. &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/siltterhead-is-good-actually"><h3>Wait A Second, Slitterhead Rules</h3></a><p>Slitterhead is a beautiful PS3 game dropped through a time portal, and one of the most original games of the year.</p></div><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sandisk-logo-rebrand"><h3>Congratulations To Sandisk On A Rebranding That Rules</h3></a><p>More brands should look like they sell Laserdisc players</p></div></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We spoke to them at length the day before the release about everything Sonic: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-the-hedgehog-film-writers-reveal-the-big-the-cat-cameo-that-almost-was">Big the Cat</a>, their inspirations, whether or not Chaos are real... you know, the important questions. And we <em>also</em> learned about their dream video game adaptations, which include A Boy and His Blob, Golden Axe, and... The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to IGN, Casey and Miller reminded us that they're signed on to write a script for an upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dwayne-johnson-executive-produce-it-takes-two-movie">It Takes Two film adaptation produced by Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson</a>, and also hinted that they were working on some other unannounced adaptations they couldn't talk about.

"Golden Axe was another good Genesis multiplayer game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Miller throws in A Boy and His Blob, and Casey responds with "the 7-Up game about the dot having a platforming adventure." He's referring to Cool Spot, a 1993 platformer starring the red dot from the 7-Up logo. But Miller concludes with a far more exciting suggestion: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think another easy one I think we can answer because the movie's already happening and we're already not doing it would be a Zelda," he says. "I remember always when we played Wind Waker, we were always like, man, I mean, it would probably be weird if they made a Zelda movie to start with Wind Waker versus the more classic Hyrule. But we both loved Wind Waker and it's so cinematic. Yeah. So after they make this Zelda movie, I guess we're putting it out there in the world, maybe we can do a Wind Waker spin-off."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We don't know much about Nintendo and Sony's partnership on a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/the-legend-of-zelda-movie-live-action">The Legend of Zelda movie</a>.

			<p>Roleplaying games are having a great year after year lately. 2023 <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2023-incredible-tales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was absolutely stellar</a>, but 2024 is another year that will go into the genre's history books, not only because of the huge amount of RPGs released but for their quality as well. As such, this year, more than any other, it's really difficult to just pick five games over all the others, as the vast majority of roleplaying games released this year brought something interesting to the table, whether it was a new take on a classic formula, a faithfully remade classic or a new evolution of an established series.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a></em></p>
<h2>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-end-of-yakuza/">9.2</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Like-a-Dragon-Infinite-Wealth.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The release of Yakuza: Like a Dragon was a watershed moment for the franchise created by Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio, doing away with some of the series' trademark features to join the roleplaying games genre. The features and mechanics introduced in the seventh main entry in the series blossomed in Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth, as the turn-based combat system and the class systems are better than ever, and they not only manage to make Ichiban Kasuga and Kazuma Kiryu's adventure all the more compelling and memorable but also the proper passing of the torch from the old protagonist to the new the game was conceived to be. Here's what Kai Tatsumoto had to say about the game in his review:</p>
<p><em>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth serves as the real bridge between the Yakuza and Like a Dragon series into one cohesive experience. It’s the perfect sendoff for Kiryu and a passing of the torch to the plucky Ichiban Kasuga. In a lot of ways, Infinite Wealth builds upon the past with callbacks that series fans could appreciate. It’s a Japanese RPG experience that could only best be described as Ryu ga Gotoku Studio’s Metal Gear Solid 4 moment.</em></p>
<h2>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">10</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Following Final Fantasy VII Remake, which reimagined a fairly linear portion of the original game, there was some skepticism surrounding the second part of the Remake project, as attempting to replicate the huge scale of the Planet while also making it interesting was no easy feat. The development team, however, proved up to the task, delivering with Final Fantasy VII Rebirth an amazing game featuring huge open-world environments sporting a wealth of activities that spice up the experience and provide a distinct identity to each of the game's regions, an improved combat system leaning more into the action genre, and an incredible recreation of some of the game's well-known sequences with some twists that will be leaving fans speculating until the release of the third and final entry in the series. Here's what Kai Tatsumoto had to say in his review:</p>
<p><em>If there’s one word to describe&nbsp;<a href="https://ffvii.square-enix-games.com/en-us/games/rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, it would be ambitious. Tetsuya Nomura, Kazushige Nojima, and the rest of Creative Business Unit I at Square-Enix have turned what is merely the remainder of Final Fantasy VII’s Disc One upon leaving Midgar into a 100-hour-long epic. Moments of distracted exploration throughout the massive wide-open environments are often bookended with more linear story segments that balance comedy and somber moments. Players will feel more intimately engrossed with the story of those chosen by the planet and routinely have their fond memories of playing the original tickled with delight. Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is an absolute must-play for fans of the series.</em></p>
<h2>Dragon's Dogma 2 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/">8</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/dragons-dogma-2-capcom-showcase-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 promised to actually realize Hideaki Itsuno's concept for the original game, an RPG set in a believable living world where player actions, both big and small, would have consequences, and in plenty of ways, it did, only not in the scope that fans expected. As such, the game is"only" an enhanced version of the original featuring great visuals, a beautiful open world filled with optional secrets, an engaging combat system that better realizes the combination of character-action and Monster Hunter series mechanics, and some very interesting systems, including the devastating Dragonsplague mechanics, that is only a few small steps away from being the proper sequel that everyone was expecting it to be. Even so, it's very much worth being added in our top roleplaying games of 2024 list. Here's what Alessio Palumbo had to say about the game in his review:</p>
<p><em>This review may read quite negatively, but it's only because of the lofty expectations that surrounded Dragon's Dogma 2. The original game was an amazing foundation to build upon, and yet CAPCOM seemed content with keeping the same strengths without improving much on the weaknesses. Twelve years later, though, the effect cannot be the same. Still, make no mistake: Dragon's Dogma 2 is a highly enjoyable fantasy action/adventure with RPG elements that will provide you with about 40 hours of pure fun. Its peerless sense of exploration, meaty combat system, and stunning visuals will motivate you throughout the entire playthrough. Just don't expect to find a fantasy world simulator or, indeed, a narrative worth remembering.</em></p>
<h2>Dragon Age: The Veilguard (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/">9</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/dragon-age-the-veilguard-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>No matter different personal opinions, it is undeniable that in the past few years, BioWare ruinously fell from grace, going from releasing some all-time classics like Baldur's Gate, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, and the original Mass Effect trilogy to launching games like the average Mass Effect Andromeda and the failed live service game Anthem. As such, the studio had a lot to prove with Dragon Age: The Veilguard, and prove it they did, going back to their roots, doing away with ill-fated open-world and live service pretensions to present a tighter mission-based experience featuring an excellent combat system and impressive customization depth that should please the vast majority of the modern RPG audience. Here's what Alessio Palumbo had to say in his review:</p>
<p><em>With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has largely returned to its roots, casting aside the temptations of open world and/or live service games. Instead, Veilguard is a great mission-based RPGs with a memorable story that will leave Dragon Age fans enthralled by the revelations, an awesome combat system that perfectly blends action and tactics, and lots of loot and secrets to uncover through its 80-hour playthrough.</em></p>
<h2>Metaphor: ReFantazio (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metaphor-refantazio-persona-non-grata/">9</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Metaphor-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Metaphor: ReFantazio caught the attention of roleplaying games fans since its announcement as Project Re: Fantasy back in 2016, but the long development team made more than a few fear that the combination of mechanics lifted from the Persona series and a fantasy setting wouldn't be working as well as most expected.</p>
<p>Thankfully, that was not the case, as Metaphor: ReFantazio is the first proper step forward for the formula introduced in the original Persona 3, rejuvenating it considerably while offering an engaging story and a compelling class system that gives players a lot of customization options. A dragging final part of the game is the only flaw of an experience that will hopefully blossom into a full-fledged franchise. Here's what Kai Tatsumoto had to say about the game in his review:</p>
<p><em>Those who harbor an innate distaste for the social systems and time limits of modern Persona titles will find no solace here, but those who are willing to embrace what very well could be the sixth Persona title in all but name alone will experience one of the most stylish Japanese roleplaying games of 2024.</em></p>

But one category in which Metaphor particularly stood out was its music. The soundtrack, produced by Shoji Meguro – the long-time music director of the <em>Persona</em> series, is one of the outstanding achievements in video game music this year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/18/24299700/flute-guy-japanese-monk-chant-guy-musical-nirvana">particularly its battle theme</a> which became a viral hit. In an interview with <em>The Verge</em>, Meguro talked about his work on the <em>Metaphor</em> soundtrack including what went into what is perhaps the coolest piece of video game battle music ever made.&nbsp;</p><p>Meguro, known for his work <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/23/15387602/persona-5-soundtrack-music">producing the pop-y, jazzy vibes of the <em>Persona</em> soundtracks</a>, acknowledged that <em>Metaphor</em>’s heavy orchestral / choral sound is not something <em>Persona</em> fans would expect from him and definitely outside his own wheelhouse. He said in order to effectively change gears from <em>Persona</em> to <em>Metaphor</em>, he had to relearn classical music theory.</p><p>“But that’s what makes creating this score so exciting,” he said. “When I was first told about <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>, I was told it would be an epic, high-fantasy RPG. And immediately I heard the sound of great orchestras playing and thought this might be an opportunity to write songs I’ve never really written before, which excited me greatly.”</p><p>In developing the music for <em>Metaphor</em>, Meguro said that he wanted to evoke a classical, fantasy experience but feature a unique twist that he said fans have come to expect from Atlus games. That twist became what Meguro called a “spiritual musical style” that defines the soundtrack, particularly the battle music.</p><p><small>As it was nominated for Game of the Year, <em>Metaphor</em>’s music made an appearance during this year’s Game Awards.</small></p><p>If you’ve spent any amount of time on gaming social media this year, you’ve probably seen tons of posts talking about <em>Metaphor</em>’s battle music. For a battle theme it goes extremely <em>hard, </em>with one version starting off with an orchestra-backed choir singing with the kind of gusto you’d expect for a meeting with Sephiroth, not something that plays during every minor encounter in the game. Then, somehow, the song goes even harder with the addition of a Japanese monk chanting in a rapid-fire cadence that could go toe-to-toe with Eminem. To further elevate the songs, the chants were written in an original language inspired by Esperanto, a language that was invented in 1887 and designed to be used as an internationally universal secondary language.&nbsp;</p><p>But finding the right voice for the job wasn’t easy. “I was looking for a specific type of voice that could sustain a fast rhythm while reading Esperanto-inspired scripture,” Meguro said.&nbsp;</p><p>His search led him to YouTube, where scrolling through performances was how he found a monk named Keisuke Honryo performing in Nam Jazz Experiment, a musical group that combines jazz with the recitation of traditional Buddhist sutras. “It was so great, I immediately made [Honryo] an offer and luckily he accepted and was happy to be a part of this game.”</p><div><figcaption>Your fairy sidekick in Metaphor is also your DJ throughout the game.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Atlus</cite></p></div><p>But there’s a reason why <em>Metaphor</em>’s battle music is so arresting and it’s not just because of the musical stylings of a Japanese monk chanting in an invented language inspired by another invented language. Meguro had to reframe his thinking in developing the soundtrack, leading to the creation of something truly unique that changes how players perceive the game.</p><p>“I’ve always considered game scores to be similar to UI elements, constructs that exist solely to service the player,” Meguro said. “Although the score has to capture the atmosphere of the story for the user, it’s worth reminding ourselves that this music is not actually playing directly within the world the characters are in.”</p><p>Meguro explained that in conversations with the game’s director Katsura Hashino, the two discussed ways to connect what players are hearing to what the characters are hearing as well.</p><p>He said the thought experiment allowed them to “approach the music composition through a different lens.” The idea wound up implemented in the game itself. In <em>Metaphor’</em>s opening hours, the player’s sidekick casts a spell that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/opinion/465517/metaphor-refantazio-music-gallica-spell-in-your-head">allows them to hear music</a> as they roam about the world and, inevitably, get into fights.</p><p>That moment dramatically changes the context of all of <em>Metaphor’</em>s music, especially its battle themes. Taking those songs from fun bits of ambience for solely players and turning them into something the characters experience too, explains why the songs go hard as they do. Every fight for us is one more event on the way to the credits, for the characters it’s <em>life or death</em> and it makes sense that the music they hear as they fight for their lives, reflects that gravity.&nbsp;</p><p>Meguro used <em>Metaphor</em>’s music to bring the players further into the game and he’s delighted by how well his work has been received. The two battle songs, called “<a href="https://youtu.be/v9foF43GJkk?si=jHsnbSSVCH2L8pt0">Warriors in Arms</a>” and “<a href="https://youtu.be/SjIJfwaFSAE?si=-64NgypXU_jMa_ZP">Warriors in Valor</a>” instantly resonated with players, <a href="https://x.com/TheBlackViking3/status/1842293436268916867">inspiring memes</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/kkGi_1ogQsQ?si=pYxaDS3qinSun-DW">even animated shorts</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>“That brings me so much joy that fans are responding enthusiastically to the music of <em>Metaphor</em>,” Meguro said. “It’s an honor to get that kind of reaction.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-worst-reviewed-games-of-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Although 2024 was a quieter year for big releases, it still had some fantastic games. But, at the other end of the spectrum, it had its fair share of stinkers too. Of course, reviews are and always have been objective critiques and whatever you might think of a game is your own opinion. You might have even played and enjoyed some of the games on this list – we all have guilty pleasures, right? But honestly, there were some really bad games released in 2024 that we definitely recommend you avoid…</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Five - Mediocre</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/30/until-dawn-1717108744207.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking at IGN’s official review scale, fives are considered ‘Mediocre’ games – the “kind of bland, unremarkable games we’ve mostly forgotten about a day after we finish playing.” They’re far from the worst games on the list and aren’t even necessarily “bad” (that’s 4s and lower), but you’re going to have to work hard to get any real fun out of them..</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the most populous score on this list, you’ll find a variety of different games. There are games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/slitterhead-review">Slitterhead</a>, an absurd action-horror game from a team of ex-Silent Hill veterans where humans must fend off parasitic monsters. Sounds fun but unfortunately it’s just dull. Similarly, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/terminator-dark-fate-defiance-review">Terminator: Dark Fate - Defiance </a>takes the war against Skynet (great!) and turns it into a mediocre RTS (not so great).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was also a string of bland strategy games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/millennia-review">Millennia</a>, which our reviewer called “Civilization at home” after the McDonald’s at home meme; <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sins-of-a-solar-empire-2-review">Sins of a Solar Empire 2</a>, which is a lacklustre sequel to the 2008 4x game in space; and<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/homeworld-vast-reaches-vr-review"> Homeworld: Vast Reaches.</a> Not to be confused with Homeworld 3, Vast Reaches is instead a strategy game built for VR, but feels more like a tech demo than a full game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There were also several disappointments that received a 5. Games many of us were eagerly looking forward to only to be let down by the final product. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-review">The First Descendant</a> is a gorgeous-looking live-service shooter that unfortunately is more looks than substance, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/until-dawn-2024-review">Until Dawn remake</a> barely justified its existence over the excellent choose-your-own-adventure horror game original. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Supermassive Games didn’t have better luck on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-casting-of-frank-stone-review">The Casting of Frank Stone</a>, a Dead by Daylight spinoff based around one of the killers from the popular online horror game. The sub-six-hour horror adventure is hardly scary and adds nothing to the lore of Dead by Daylight according to our reviewer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The viral hit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bodycam-early-access-review">Bodycam </a>– which captivated audiences thanks to a trailer featuring super-realistic graphics that looked like footage from a police bodycam – was also more sizzle than steak as the actual game was nothing close to what we saw in the trailer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps most noteworthy is Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League, which was also one of the first 5s IGN handed out this year. We waited almost a decade for a new game from Batman Arkham developers Rocksteady, and sadly the wait was not worth it. Many were already bummed to hear Rocksteady was not developing a new Batman game but rather a Suicide Squad game, but that could have had potential given how fun and zany those characters are. It could have been Rocksteady’s chance to spread its wings and move away from the grimdark Arkham-verse and go for a more colorful route. But ultimately what we got was kind of a letdown, let’s be honest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Forgoing the single-player goodness of the Batman games, Rocksteady ventured into the world of live-service with a squad-based looter-shooter in which players and friends team up as members of the Suicide Squad like Harley Quinn, Deadshot, Captain Boomerang, and King Shark. Unfortunately there just wasn’t enough of anything to makeSuicide Squad satisfying. The beloved combat from the Arkham games was completely absent, swapping crunchy melee for running-flying-shooting gameplay that felt okay, nothing more. Even looter-shooter fans would find the missions in Suicide Squad repetitive and bland. A forgettable experience from the decorated developers at Rocksteady.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another big miss was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-and-luigi-brothership-review">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a>. The newest entry into the Mario &amp; Luigi series developed specifically for the Nintendo Switch “misunderstands what made the Mario &amp; Luigi series great,” according to IGN’s reviewer. The first original Mario RPG to be released this year alongside remakes of Super Mario RPG and Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door, Brothership has none of their charm and plenty of drawbacks such as the “ridiculously chatty dialogue, overbearing hand-holding, and boring, runtime padding fetch quests.” Bummer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rounding out the rest of the 5s is Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown, whose original spearheaded the concept of online MMO racing games, but this sequel completely ignores any single-player content in favor of an annoying online-only strategy. There’s also a new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/spongebob-squarepants-the-patrick-star-game-review">SpongeBob Squarepants: The Patrick Star Game,</a> which tries to revive the classic mascot platformer to middling effect, while Unknown 9: Awakening was a "routine action adventure game that probably wouldn’t blow me away even if it was well executed,” according to our review. And let’s not forget <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kong-survivor-instinct-review">Kong: Survivor Instinct</a>, a weird Metroidvania-style game in which you play as a human trying to survive in a city that Kong is destroying</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One game that was a personal disappointment was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutants-unleashed-review">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed</a>, a new game based on the animated film, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. Given the quality of past TMNT games and the quality of the animated film this is based on, the resulting game was unfortunately far short of either.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Four - Bad</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">With the 5s out of the way, let’s make our way to the genuinely bad games. Literally, our review scale qualifies games that receive a 4 as “bad.” There are only three that received this distinction this year so let’s spend our time going through each of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/broken-roads-review">Broken Roads</a> was the first game in 2024 to receive a 4. This turn-based RPG set in post-apocalyptic Australia tried to deliver a more serious RPG experience complete with an ambitious morality system where players decide who lives and who dies. Rather than choosing one of the usual moral alignments like lawful good or neutral evil, Broken Roads gives players a full questionnaire that determines your beliefs in highly specific ways. But the problem is, outside of the questionnaire the system hardly matters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Per our review, “There are very few conversations involving a moral choice in the first place, and you’re locked out of pretty much all other conversations once you’ve started down a given alignment path, leaving no opportunities to try something drastically different later.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As interesting as a highly specific morality system is, what good is it if the game doesn’t put it to any use? Even worse, the more you play the faster you realize that Broken Roads is mostly filled with a bunch of fetch quests interrupted by exhausting dialogue. No thanks.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another game that received a 4 is<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/endless-ocean-luminous-review"> Endless Ocean Luminous, </a>a remake of the original Endless Ocean first released on the Nintendo Wii. It’s a scuba diving adventure game in which each mission involves diving into a procedurally generated area of the ocean, to catalogue its various sea creatures and landmarks. Unfortunately, all of this becomes repetitive and, frankly, boring real fast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The procedurally generated maps begin to look strikingly similar to each other almost immediately, and without a huge variety of missions or objectives, you’re effectively going from one part of the ocean to the next, cataloguing creatures until you hit your goal and move on to the next map. Then you repeat for hours. Our reviewer played about 26 hours of the game and were still not close to beating it – maybe that’s why it’s called Endless Ocean – and the kicker is that it was dull for most of that time..</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The final game to receive a 4 was one you no doubt saw trailers for. I’m talking about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/funko-fusion-review">Funko Fusion</a>, an adventure game where you travel through some of pop culture’s biggest movies and TV shows, the twist being you’re playing as the Funko Pops from those various worlds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Funko Fusion is best compared to  the LEGO games, which are simple but enjoyable 3D platformers based on popular bricks. But Funkos don’t have the same charm as LEGO and Funko Fusion is nowhere near as good as even some of the worst LEGO games. The story is all but meaningless, the mission design is repetitive, and you can’t overlook the game-breaking bugs that will stop your progress in its place.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Three - Awful</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The good news is that IGN did not award any 2s or 1s this year. Actually, we haven’t given a game a 1 since 2009, but that’s neither here nor there. The bad news is there are three games we gave a 3 to, which in our scale means they’re “Awful.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/atomic-heart-trapped-in-limbo-review">Atomic Heart’s Trapped in Limbo </a>DLC. It’s the second of Atomic Heart’s two DLCs and takes place after the events of the main game, and is plagued by two godawful gameplay mechanics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first requires players to slide for really long stretches of time, avoiding obstacles and jumping when required. Our reviewer described this particular segment “like playing Tony Hawk with a broken ollie button, and the half-pipe is mined.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next, the DLC introduced first-person platform segments but unfortunately Atomic Heart just wasn’t designed for precise, first-person jumping, making them a painful slog right up until the end, which doesn’t take long to get to considering how short this DLC is. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Do you remember there was a new South Park game this year? Me neither, but it’s probably for the best. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/south-park-snow-day-review">South Park: Snow Day </a>is the third South Park game in a series that comprises Obsidian’s excellent South Park: The Stick of Truth, and the equally good South Park: The Fractured but Whole, both of which were fun RPGs based on the popular cartoon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Snow Day ditches the RPG genre and is instead a 3D hack-and-slash, which wouldn’t be so much of an issue if it weren’t for how awkward and clumsy the controls are. Worse still, Snow Day also ditches the one thing the animated series is loved for: the humor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Per our review, South Park: Snow Day features “appallingly flat writing [that] makes an already bad game not even worth pushing through for a few laughs.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our final 3 of the year was handed out to<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/empire-of-the-ants-single-player-campaign-review"> Empire of the Ants’ single-player campaign</a>. A real-time strategy game where players control a colony of ants, this 12-hour adventure is unfortunately a far cry from its potential.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the trailer showcased hyper-realistic ants moving in real-time, it’s obvious a lot more time was spent on how it looks rather than how it feels to play. With a difficulty curve that goes from easy to impossible in the blink of an eye, the campaign is an exercise in pain tolerance as one moment you’re mind-numbingly bored fighting easy enemies, before suddenly finding yourself defending your nest against a seemingly impossible wave of enemy ants. And without the ability to save mid-mission, failure means you’re starting from the beginning. No thanks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there you have it –those are the worst reviewed games of the year according. Be sure to check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-reviewed-games-of-2024-look-back">Best Reviewed Games list here</a> as a palette cleanser, and let us know if you played any of the games on this list and how you feel about them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-games-coming-in-2025-best-new-games/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>After an epic 2024, it’s already time to look ahead to the biggest games coming out in 2025 across all the major platforms: PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC—and it’s good news, many amazing-looking titles are looking to bankrupt us all.</p>



<p>I would argue 2024 didn’t reach the sky-high heights of 2023’s barnstorming 12 months. However, this isn’t to say it was a bad year by any means. RPGs have smashed it with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/biggest-games-coming-in-2025-best-new-games/ReFantazio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/astro-bot-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Astro Bot</a> brought a new lease of life to 3D platformers, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-has-generated-approximately-4-4-million-on-mobile/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Balatro</a>—an underdog indie title—justifiably achieved Game of the Year recognition.</p>



<p>There’s been plenty to enjoy in 2024, but now, we look ahead to the next year. 2025’s biggest projected games are seriously seismic, and my bank account is already worried. Providing we don’t get any delays, here is our projected list of the nine best new games releasing in 2025 across PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>



<h2 id="h-9-best-new-games-releasing-in-2025">9 Best New Games Releasing in 2025</h2>



<p>You can never tell what the gaming industry has up its sleeve. For now, this is our list of top titles expected to come out in 2025, but expect to be blindsided by shadow drops and shock announcements during Summer Game Fest, Gamescom, and the Tokyo Game Show, amongst others.</p>



<h2 id="h-grand-theft-auto-6">Grand Theft Auto 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Expect GTA 6 to mirror real life more than ever. Credit to Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Let’s be honest, if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-gta-6-coming-out-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> does release in 2025, it’s game over for everyone else. Every subsequent launch for about a month  (and beyond) has to contend with millions of players getting stuck into GTA 6. It’s probably already got Game of the Year in the bag, and it’s the<strong> biggest video game ever</strong>. </p>



<p>Rockstar’s track record is about as good as any, and while we’ve seen very little of GTA 6—we don’t need to—what we have seen looks like the meatiest and most engaging GTA project to date. Fingers crossed GTA 6 comes out in 2025, and if it does, we’re already in for one of the best gaming years in recent memory.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Rumored for 2025.</p>







<figure><figcaption>SNAAAAAKE. Credit to Konami</figcaption></figure>



<p>The initial Metal Gear Solid Delta Snake trailers show Konami is faithfully recreating the original story and fleshing it out with refined gameplay mechanics. The lifelike graphics are what we come to expect from a Konami production, and the fact a new generation gets to experience the thrill of where the series chronologically began, gives me a beaming smile on my face.</p>



<p>Metal Gear Solid is one of my two favorite franchises ever (God of War being the other) and I’m not making it up when I say <strong>MGS3 is my pick of the bunch</strong>. The fact it’s the first one to get the fully-fledged, next-gen remake treatment warms my soul more than any fire-roasted Kenyan Mangrove Crab could. Welcome back, Big Boss.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Rumored for 2025.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Z-A has big shoes to fill. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>In Pokémon Legends: Z-A, we’re in Lumiose City—set in the Kalos region. Again, not much is known about what the new adventure entails. It is another isolated journey in a fixed location, and the debut trailer suggests the game world might be slightly more crowded compared to the quieter nature of Arceus.</p>



<p>Pokémon Legends Arceus deviated from what is considered the norm for a Pokémon game. Its large, open-world design is still relatively new, it moves away from the familiar locales of cities, gyms, and the hustle and bustle of an active Pokémon title, and it features the game-changing attribute of having wild Mon attacking you! Between the flexible catching mechanics, epic Raid-style boss battles, and unique story, Legends Arceus was a bold and beautiful new direction for the franchise. </p>



<p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Rumored for 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Can Ubisoft finally get it right? Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>2024 was not a good year for Ubisoft</strong>, and its stock might metaphorically and literally might be as low as it’s ever been. Skull &amp; Bones’ hellish development cycle costing hundreds of millions of dollars flopped, Star Wars Outlaws is more low-level rookie than it is heroic wookie, and XDefiant—Ubisoft’s much-hyped Call of Duty killer—is already <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-xdefiant-shutting-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutting down</a> in 2025. Several other Ubisoft games have been canceled, the company is facing countless layoffs, and the public perception of the once-legendary studio isn’t great.</p>



<p>No pressure on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-assassins-creed-red-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> then. The cut-and-dried Ubisoft open-world formula is a big concern heading into the latest AC game. Players are tired of the same routine, collect-a-thons with barebones stories, and a lack of innovation. Shadows can write these wrongs, its 16th-century Japanese setting intrigues, and gameplay footage shows you can be a true assassin once again. Ubisoft needs a big win here, and it could be a true Valentine’s love story if Assassin’s Creed Shadows captures the hearts and minds of its fan base on launch day.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Feb. 14, 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t toy with our emotions, Nintendo. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond didn’t have the “Beyond” name for a while, nor did it have any identity, or fill fans with confidence it would ever see the light of day. Metroid Prime 4 was announced at E3 2017 and went through development hell after having its progress restarted. Finally, the June 18, 2024, Nintendo Direct showed us the first-ever gameplay footage of Prime 4.</p>



<p>Two minutes of Morph Ball mayhem, Space Pirate scallywags, and Samus being Samus later, and Metroid Prime fans everywhere are crying—me included. <strong>I fail to see a universe where Metroid Prime 4: Beyond isn’t a GOTY contender</strong>, and even if it’s not, everyone is primed and ready for what’s coming—and Beyond.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Rumored for 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-judas">Judas</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Years in the making. Credit to Ghost Story Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Oh, Ken Levine, where have you been in my life for the last 11 years? The Bioshock trilogy is as consistent as three games get, and Judas is the natural successor to Levine’s masterful trifecta of first-person shooters. <strong>Judas’ core mechanics are akin to System Shock and Bioshock</strong>, and short of having the word “shock” somewhere in the game title, I’m pleased to say the shooter appears to share a lot in common with those who painfully paved the way through Rapture and Columbia.</p>



<p>Your left hand is used for magical powers and elemental enchantments, whereas your right hand is mainly used to fire weapons. I expect another deeply woven story with an assortment of narrative strands taking us in every direction, allowing us to dictate our ending. The enemies manage to look equal parts cutesy, terrifying, and horrifying, and Judas’ biomes are sure to give Levine’s previous work a run for its money.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Rumored for March 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-call-of-duty-2025">Call of Duty 2025</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’ve got another job to do. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>CoD titles leaking years in advance is a common occurrence. We already know the 2025 edition of Activision’s multi-billion shooter bonanza is a “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">semi-futuristic Black Ops 2 sequel.</a>” It’s under the codename of “Saturn,” and <strong>Call of Duty 2025 is set well in the future</strong>. It remains to be seen if your boots remain on the ground—I hope so—but what is going to be seen is an assortment of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-2024-black-ops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops map remakes</a>.</p>



<p>BLOPS campaigns are always a blast, so it should be fun to see where the franchise goes next. Call of Duty 2025 should have no connection to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>, and we expect more leaks to come out of thin air like a ramp-propelled RC-XD. Stay tuned for further developments throughout 2025.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Rumored for October / November 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-donkey-kong-country-returns-hd">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A beloved classic is back. Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Oddly, we haven’t had an original Donkey Kong game in a while, but Donkey Kong Country Returns HD should suffice. In the same way, 2018’s Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze was a port of the OG 2014 release, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD is a sprucing up of 2010’s Donkey Kong Country Returns—first debuting on the Nintendo Wii.</p>



<p>You know what to expect with Donkey Kong Country Returns HD, and even if you’ve played it before, it might be worth swinging into the jungle one more time—you’d be bananas if you didn’t, so stop monkeying around.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Jan. 16, 2025.</p>

<p>It can be argued that 2018’s Monster Hunter: World catapulted the long-running series into the marquee: Finally achieving worldwide superstardom. A metaphorical sleeping beast is now very much awake. The attention Monster Hunter: Wilds has gotten already—thanks to exposure from PlayStation Showcases and similar presentations—shows Capcom’s monster-maiming franchise is escalating at a monstrous (pun intended) rate.</p>



<p><strong>Monster Hunter: Wilds incorporates more naturalism and realism</strong>, it’s catering to fans both old and new, and features a slew of new monsters waiting to be slain or saved. The first open beta alone attracted half a million players on Steam, and you can tell Capcom is chomping at the bit to make Wilds larger than life.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: </strong>Feb. 28, 2025.</p>

The reasons for his arrival in this era and how he can move on to the afterlife are unclear, so Kotaro begins wandering the streets of Yoshiwara in search of clues to solve the “mystery.”</p><p>Eventually, he stumbles upon the murder of a courtesan and takes on the role of a “detective” to solve the case.

		<p>Who needs other people, eh? Sure they’re good for companionship, love and affection – and I suppose for a more effective Helldivers squad – but really, why not replace all that with a good old single player game? One that you can play on your own, whenever you like, and which won’t rely on anything other than your investment in it. OK, maybe I’m being flippant, but single player remains the bedrock of gaming, and after a number of years in the live service wilderness, they’re firmly at the forefront once more. 2024 has been a brilliant year for solo experiences, but one ran, bounced and boinged just that little bit harder than everyone else.</p>

<p>To call <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/05/astro-bot-review/">Astro Bot</a> a love letter to gaming is to diminish its own creativity. Still, it is a missive filled with warmth and joy, not just for the PlayStation family and its beloved characters, but to the bountiful platforming abandon that’s normally a portly plumber’s remit. Just like Nintendo’s finest, Astro Bot is a repeated shot of delight that you will continue to down until you can’t possibly take any more, before finding room for just a little more.</p>
<p>Astro and his pals’ PS5-shaped spaceship is wrecked by some no-good aliens, leaving them strewn and stranded throughout the universe. Fortunately, our plucky hero sets out to rescue them within moments, leading to hour upon hour of platforming perfection.</p>
<p>Where <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/08/astros-playroom-review-the-first-game-you-should-play-on-playstation-5/">Astro’s Playroom</a> was a proof of concept to show off the PS5’s different abilities, Astro Bot takes that creativity and turns the dial way up, delivering you to tropical locales, sandy deserts and freezing tundras, where you fend off all manner of cute but deadly foes while encountering a new gameplay mechanic around every turn. It’s perky, cute and practically perfect in every way, and while you can share in its joy with other players, this is a classic singleplayer affair, making it a deserving winner of this year’s award.</p>

<h2>Metaphor: ReFantazio – Runner-up</h2>
<p>Atlus is renowned for the likes of Persona. When fourteen of the creative minds behind Persona left P-Studio to set up Studio Zero, it was obvious that whatever they made would be liquid gold. The first game they released is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/07/metaphor-refantazio-review/">Metaphor ReFantazio</a>.</p>
<p>While Studio Zero is tasked with developing original IP and content unrelated to Persona, it’s fair to call their work Persona-like. Not only are there systems and mechanics that carry over, from the progression of time to the friendship simulator, and even the basics of combat, but there are some tremendous Easter Eggs that even the least eagle-eyed fans will spot.</p>
<p>Gameplay boils down to two things: a dungeon-crawling turn-based action RPG and a time management sim. The interplay between the two is very well built, offering huge flexibility in how you play the game. If you’re looking for a game you can easily sink 150 hours into, without getting bored of gameplay, you won’t go far wrong with Metaphor!</p>
<p><em>–&nbsp;Nic B</em></p>
<h2>Balatro – Runner-up</h2>
<p>Solitaire is basically&nbsp;<em>the</em> single player card game, and Balatro takes a healthy dose of influence from Solitaire in with its blend of Poker hands and an overarching roguelike structure. There’s no story here (outside of a slightly snarky Joker card commenting on your failure), just a pure, unadulterated tumble down a rabbit hole of Poker hands, modifiers and ever-growing scores to overcome.</p>

But this year, in 2024, we had to expand the list to 15. And we cut stuff from this list! What a bad, horrible year, huh? Anyway, here’s some of the worst, most awful, or just plain annoying gaming-related news from the past 12 months. Hopefully 2025 is better.</p></div></div><div><p>When the more powerful <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-price-graphics-opinions-1851648372/slides/4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-price-graphics-opinions-1851648372/slides/4">PlayStation 5 Pro</a></span> was announced in September, it sparked a lot of controversy. Its $700 price point, and the reality of how much (or little) it would actually improve games, were the two big points of contenti0n. Still, if it did make most games look and run better, Sony would be able to mostly come away victorious. </p><p>Alas, that’s not been the case. While a lot of games do look better, there have also been games, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-pssr-update-silent-hill-2-remake-dragon-age-1851701776&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-pssr-update-silent-hill-2-remake-dragon-age-1851701776"><em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Alan Wake II, </em>and<em> Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</em></a></span>, that looked <em>worse </em>after receiving fancy PS5 Pro patches. Some of this has been fixed already, but it does seem like devs are still figuring out how to use the Pro’s upscaling tech, and that’s leading to some of these issues. Hopefully, in a few months, we won’t see games looking worse on PS5 Pro. That doesn’t change that all of this has soured any potential excitement around the prospect of the Pro, and probably damaged the console’s already shaky public image forever.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d3693d1c920f21ff99baae6fac843949" data-recommend-id="image://d3693d1c920f21ff99baae6fac843949" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="787" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d3693d1c920f21ff99baae6fac843949" data-recommend-id="image://d3693d1c920f21ff99baae6fac843949" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="787" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Generally, when something feels too good to be true, it’s because it isn’t going to last for much longer. That was very much the feeling around Microsoft’s Xbox Game Pass, which made the launch of the Xbox Series X/S feel like such a great deal.  There was this extraordinary library, including day-one releases of Microsoft-published titles, to delve into for just ten bucks a month.</p><p>Over the years since, the prices have climbed, albeit at the same time as massive international financial issues were occurring following the covid pandemic. In 2023, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-game-pass-price-increase-ps5-microsoft-1850561048&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-game-pass-price-increase-ps5-microsoft-1850561048" target="_blank">Game Pass for console went up to $11</a></span>, while the Ultimate version that also got you access to PC games  went up two dollars to $16.99. Which still felt like a pretty decent deal, and despite talk of the increase coinciding with Microsoft’s outrageous purchase of Activision Blizzard for $69 billion, was actually a slightly below-inflation rise.</p><p>But then came 2024. I<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866">n July, it was revealed that Game Pass Ultimate</a></span> was going up from $17 to $20, a whopping 18 percent increase, and now massively above inflation. But worse—far worse—Microsoft simultaneously killed off the more affordable $11 console-only tier. It was replaced with a new tier called Game Pass Standard, which would no longer include day-one game releases, and was priced at $15! Yup, an almost 50-percent price increase for a <em>far</em> worse version.</p><p>What this meant, really, is that the price of Game Pass—for anyone who was using it as a means to access the full library and play the day-one Microsoft games—went from $11 to $20 a month. And this time, with the $69 billion Activision Blizzard deal having somehow gone through, it <em>really did</em> feel like it was a factor.</p><p>In 2024, Game Pass went from one of life’s great deals to one to somewhat resent, now a whopping $240 a year, with no discounted annual pricing. Which royally sucks. - John Walker</p></div></div><div><p>At the end of 2023, Rockstar Games ended a decade of waiting and released the first trailer for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-vi-gta6-first-trailer-gameplay-footage-details-leak-1851005265&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-vi-gta6-first-trailer-gameplay-footage-details-leak-1851005265"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em></a></span>. It quickly racked up millions of views and was pulled apart by every <em>GTA </em>YouTuber and outlet for as many details as possible. Now, it’s a year later and uh...well, Rockstar is radio silent on <em>GTA 6. </em></p><p>Since December 2023, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-first-trailer-2-a-year-later-1851714995&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-first-trailer-2-a-year-later-1851714995">Rockstar has not released a single screenshot or teaser about its big 2025 <em>GTA </em>sequel. Nothing</a></span>! Fans held out hope that a new trailer would arrive at The Game Awards, but that was always unlikely as Rockstar rarely attends shows like that to show off its upcoming games. </p><p>So, we enter 2025 with no new trailer. Now the question for 2025 is: When does <em>GTA 6</em>'s trailer arrive, and will Rockstar’s big sequel make it out this year or get delayed like nearly every other one of its past games?</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d4a0fac0a9e67f652df5c57f05e0d93e" data-recommend-id="image://d4a0fac0a9e67f652df5c57f05e0d93e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1294" data-height="728" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image shows Homer running away from a giant finger.

It’s now become the absolute norm that if you’re willing to fork out tens of dollars more for a game, you can be among the people to play it three days before everyone else. For…kudos? Playground fame? YouTube hits? It’s such a revoltingly cynical exploitation of FOMO. </p><p>Pre-orders have gone from offering a cheaper price in return for the risk of buying something that might not be worth getting, to a way to pay <em>far more</em> for something that might not be worth getting, for the reward of getting to find that out a few days early.

Over 14,600 people who make video games lost their jobs in the past 12 months. Things have become so bad that Geoff Keighley, the king of saying how good a year it’s been for video games even if it hasn’t been, had to acknowledge them on stage at The Game Awards.</p><p>The truth is, every year is a good year for video games themselves, but as corporate greed and poor business decisions become more and more prevalent every year, the people who make the  games we celebrate have suffered. As more institutional knowledge is lost to senseless job cuts, the games are going to suffer, too. It doesn’t have to be this way, but so long as corporate greed takes precedence over talent, this is the result. - Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b97193a43c7c70c85c49111cc6ebf00c" data-recommend-id="image://b97193a43c7c70c85c49111cc6ebf00c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A promo image of Borderlands.

			<p>The European gaming market didn't have a great year for sales. GamesIndustry's Christopher Dring revealed this tidbit during the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/2024-in-review-gi-microcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GI Microcast show</a>, confirming that sales of new games went down by 29% compared to last year, as registered by GSD data.</p>
<p>2023 was always going to be a tough comparison. Last year saw the release of games like Baldur's Gate 3, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Resident Evil 4, Street Fighter 6, Super Mario Bros. Wonder, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, Hogwarts Legacy, Starfield, Diablo IV, Mortal Kombat 1, Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, and Final Fantasy XVI, just to name a few. 2024 just didn't have the same sheer triple-A power when it came to its schedule. Dring admitted as much in the podcast while also singling out two games that underperformed: Star Wars Outlaws and Dragon Age: The Veilguard.</p>
<p><em>Sales of new games in 2024 versus new games in 2023, and let's remember 2023 was a big year for new games, were down 29%, almost a third, year-on-year. Next year's the return of big blockbuster new games, even from February when you've got that sort of triple threat of Assassin's Creed Shadows and Avowed (I know Av</em><em>owed isn't that big) and Monster Hunter Wilds all in the same window. And there's all the games that were announced during The Game Awards, there's <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an Elden Ring coming out</a>, and there's a Grand Theft Auto, which obviously is the big thing. </em></p>
<p><em>There's a new Nintendo console, and there's gonna be loads and loads and loads of games next year, but I'm alarmed by this data because, despite the fact that there weren't a lot of major titles, the big Star Wars game of the year only got to number 45 in a year where there wasn't a lot of games coming out. </em><em>In terms of the traditional big blockbuster Christmas games, you had Call of Duty, which did well, and you had Dragon Age, which did not. That is disappointing, though, that position. T</em><em>hat was it. Dragon Age&nbsp;had the market to itself and it couldn't find an audience, and that really is scary as we move into the following year.</em></p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> ranked #14 and #19, respectively, when it comes to the new games European chart. But switching to the full chart that also includes games released in previous years, they drop to #45 and #68. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon's Dogma 2</a> is similar in that it ranked in the ninth place among new games but only #34 overall. The same goes for <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, which was the twelfth best-selling new game of 2024 but only ranked #43 in the global chart.</p>
<p>Only five new games performed at least decently this year in Europe: Dragon Ball: Sparking! ZERO (#13), <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</a> (#12), <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/helldivers-2-not-enough-patriotism/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Helldivers 2</a> (#6), and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raining-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> (#3). Unsurprisingly, EA Sports FC 25 dominated European sales in 2024.</p>

The stuff that keeps us going. That makes a terrible, horrible year a bit more manageable.

Digital Rights Management was throttling video games, making official, paid-for games work far worse than pirated versions, and it was a whole, grisly mess.

<p>A prominent Marvel Rivals leaker has revealed some details about loot boxes that were seemingly removed from the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/marvel-rivals-datamine-leak-loot-box-scrapped/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Gamer</a>, RivalsLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1871169815278195163" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) has provided information about Marvel Rivals’ cancelled loot boxes, such as the rarities, animations, icons and more. The loot boxes would’ve been divided across four tiers: Gray, Blue, Purple, Yellow, and Red. Grey would’ve been the least rare, providing potentially a recolour of the skin, and Red would be the rarest of the lot, where all the premium cosmetics can be found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>To acquire these loot boxes, players would have to “convert Lattice and Units into Crystallization (main currency) and Marscoin (blue currency), which can then be used to pull for skins.” Besides a new skin, these boxes might’ve also included rewards like emotes, player cards, sprays and more. Moreover, the files revealed that the loot box system is time-bound and potentially connected to a special limited-time event.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, RivalsLeaks has clarified that they could be wrong about Marvel Rivals loot boxes, as they are only going by the information they can dig up from the files. In the same thread, the original poster also <a href="https://x.com/RivalsLeaks/status/1871178424016105934" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stated</a> that they had been told that the loot boxes “might be crapped, but who knows, maybe one day they might get added?”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Marvel Rivals celebrated reaching <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-celebrates-20-million-players-with-a-free-reward/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">20 million players with a free reward</a>. Also, here’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-free-skins-in-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to get free skins</a> in the game.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/24/game-of-the-year-2024-best-multiplayer-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/game-of-the-year-2024-%E2%80%93-best-multiplayer-game.1068570/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/24/game-of-the-year-2024-best-multiplayer-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>If 2024 has shown us anything, it’s that the multiplayer live service boom is well and truly over. Despite being objectively fun to play and super polished, games such as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/as-expected-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-support-will-end-with-season-4/">Suicide Squad</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/04/ubisoft-is-shutting-down-xdefiant-now-delisted-after-just-half-a-year/">XDefiant</a>, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/concord-review-a-fun-frenetic-hero-shooter/">Concord</a> failed to make a splash – the latter being dead on arrival in one of the biggest gaming flops ever. It casts a grim shadow over the wider multiplayer genre, proving that there’s really only room for a handful of majorly successful online games at one time.</p>
<p>That’s not to say there weren’t any great multiplayer games in 2024, though. While legions of gamers are still glued to Fortnite, Warzone, Counter-Strike, and League of Legends, there have been some hot new contenders, one of them arriving at the start of the year…</p>

<p>Playing big, bombastic shooters with friends is always more fun, but <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/14/helldivers-2-review/">Helldivers 2</a> is the kind of game to remind you that these can also be silly and just funny as well. It takes the satire and violence of Paul Verhoeven’s Starship Troopers, and adds in a bit of player-led workplace comedy. Sure, it’s fun to call in a huge orbital barrage or minefield on a bug’s nest, but it’s <em>funny</em> to do that five seconds after your team has just rushed in and “forget” to call it out in time.</p>
<p>Arrowhead has always made fun and silly co-op games where the fire is always friendly, and explosions are always excessive, but the jump from the top-down action of the original to a third person view with more realistic graphics just managed to capture the attention of gamers at large. Add to that an engaging meta layer to the game, actively engaging with the community through highs and lows of balance and gameplay changes, and the recent reveal of a new enemy faction, and this is easily the best multiplayer game of the year.</p>

<p><em>– Stefan L</em></p>
<h2>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 – Runner-up</h2>
<p>Through the last generation, it’s felt as though couldn’t so much as blink without a new Warhammer 40,000 game being announced, resulting in a never-ending slew of PC and mobile titles. With 40K having witnessed a huge spike in popularity over the past few years, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/04/space-marine-2-review-warhammer-40k/">Space Marine 2</a> arrived at the perfect time, with Boltgun and Chainsword in-hand.</p>
<p>What made the sequel such a strong offering was its pairing of a solid campaign with a whole suite of multiplayer options, allowing friends to play through the story together, duke it out in PvP, or run a gauntlet of missions designed for co-op play. There’s a lot of shared DNA with Saber Interactive’s brilliant World War Z video game, enhanced with dynamic melee combat and a heavily expanded arsenal of weaponry plucked from the 41st millennium.</p>
<h2>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 – Runner-up</h2>
<p>Last year’s Call of Duty wasn’t the flawless end to Infinity Ward’s Modern Warfare trilogy fans had hoped for: it was by no means poor but felt more like a DLC expansion as opposed to a full-blown sequel. Going into 2025, it seemed as though the next Call of Duty would be even further entrenched in a lack of innovation and growing player fatigue. We were wrong to doubt Treyarch.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review/">Black Ops 6</a> is the full package: the best CoD campaign in many years, rewardingly layered Zombies co-op, and punchy, tactical online play. On paper it’s a subtle change yet the inclusion of “omnidirectional” player movement adds a silky smoothness that elevates each part of Treyarch’s trifecta. It’s hard to imagine this feature being dropped in future instalments.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/after-switch-2-design-leaks-nintendo-keen-to-announce-console-as-soon-as-possible-analyst</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/after-switch-2-design-leaks-nintendo-keen-to-announce-console-as-soon-as-possible-analyst.1068522/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/after-switch-2-design-leaks-nintendo-keen-to-announce-console-as-soon-as-possible-analyst<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Nintendo will have been watching the recent stream of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> design leaks and is likely now keen to unveil its under-wraps new console as soon as possible, an analyst has said.
</p>
<p>
We've had a fair idea what Switch 2 will look like for a while - at least since a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-the-switch-2-hardware-leak-is-almost-certainly-real-so-what-have-we-learned">prototype console shell and internal components surfaced online in late September</a>. But recent weeks have seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/latest-switch-2-leaks-appear-legitimate-according-to-new-report">further images posted</a>, this time by accessory companies <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-cases-screen-protectors-already-for-sale-via-chinese-sellers">now taking orders for Switch 2 add-ons</a>, which show <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-accessory-maker-pulls-trailer-showing-blurry-mockup-of-nintendos-next-console-design">close estimations for Nintendo's next console</a> in greater detail.
</p>
<p>
In other words, it's now widely expected that Switch 2 will simply look like a slightly larger Switch 1, now with magnetic Joy-Con attachments and an additional button below Home on the right Joy-Con.
</p>
<p>
So, when will Nintendo finally unveil Switch 2? In early November, industry analyst Serkan Toto, CEO of Japanese game industry consultancy Kantan Games, told Eurogamer that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-now-very-unlikely-before-2025-analyst-says">the company had now run out of time to reveal its Switch successor in 2024</a>.
</p><p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">Nintendo has set itself a deadline of 31st March 2025</a> to show off its Switch successor, but, considering the leaks, and the falling sales of Switch 1, Toto suggested to Eurogamer today that the company was unlikely to wait that long. 
</p>
<p>
"Nintendo will not have much time in January, so a potential announcement early in the month could make sense," Toto said. "You can bet that Nintendo is aware of all the leaks and not happy about them, even if some of them will turn out to be made up. 
</p>
<p>
"It is actually getting so bad with those leaks that they might cause Nintendo to release information earlier than planned."
</p>
<p>
Switch 2 is widely expected to arrive later in 2025, and while Nintendo is yet to offer any suggestion of timing, we don't have too long now to wait and find out.
</p>
<p>
When Switch 2 does arrive, fans expect next year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-gets-gorgeous-first-gameplay-trailer-and-its-out-next-year">long-awaited blockbuster Metroid Prime 4</a> to launch on Nintendo's new hardware. Nintendo has also confirmed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">Switch 2 will be backwards compatible</a>.
