            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Hades 2 officially launched in early access this past September 25, 2025, and over the weekend, Supergiant Games' latest title and its first-ever sequel reached a new milestone: the <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1145350/charts/">concurrent player count on Steam reached 112,947 players</a>, which is more than double the max concurrent player count that its predecessor, Hades, ever reached.</p>



<p>Hades only ever reached a <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1145360/charts/">max concurrent player count of 54,240 players</a>, a number that Hades 2 had already dwarfed when it shadow-dropped in early access last year, but as of its v1.0 launch, it has now more than doubled.</p>



<p>It's an incredibly strong start for the game, which had already reportedly sold more than 2 million copies in its early access period, and is set to be even bigger than Hades, which was already the biggest game Supergiant Games had ever released.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hades II has already sold 2M+ in early access (<a href="https://twitter.com/alineaanalytics?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@alineaanalytics</a>  estimates). </p><p>Since its early-access launch in May 2024, it's made almost $55M. But the floodgates will open when it hits 1.0 TOMORROW. </p><p>I've finished Silksong (Groal the Greatüñï) so can't wait to sink my teeth in. <a href="https://t.co/RlY8nKblI2">pic.twitter.com/RlY8nKblI2</a></p></div>‚Äî Rhys Elliott (@superhys) <a href="https://twitter.com/superhys/status/1970880327263633704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Hades 2 has also surpassed other stellar 2025 titles like Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Blue Prince, and Hollow Knight: Silksong to become the <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/metascore/?page=1">highest-rated new release in 2025 on Metacritic with a 94</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/">In Wccftech's review of Hades 2</a> (which contributed to its high Metacritic score as we gave it a 10/10), we called it "<em>a stunning follow-up to an already incredible game. It does everything its predecessor did right, and then expands on it in meaningful ways that add depth to the gameplay, narrative, and visual experience (which was already deep in the original Hades). It's a shining example of how a sequel can take everything right about what came before, turn it all up to 11, and even go a bit further</em>."  </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Is there a word that describes the feeling of ‚ÄúI want something to be just a <em>bit</em> better because it‚Äôs already <em>so good</em> it only needs one last kick in the pants‚Äù?</p><p>Because that‚Äôs how I feel about the $60 Lego Nintendo Game Boy. It‚Äôs better than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21578775/lego-nintendo-game-boy-fan-model-nick-lever-masters">the fan-made Lego Game Boy</a> that I asked Nintendo to make. It‚Äôs even better than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/712786/here-is-legos-official-nintendo-game-boy-with-lenticular-display">I hoped when Lego officially revealed the set</a>. This isn‚Äôt just a statue that looks like my original 1989 Game Boy; it‚Äôs a joy to build and feels fantastic in the hands. You can press every button, spin every dial, roll the D-pad, and throw a satisfyingly snappy power switch.</p><p>Though it doesn‚Äôt light up one bit, its lenticular moving images were enough to momentarily surprise friends and family into asking: ‚ÄúDoes it actually play games?‚Äù The set even has a few hidden Easter eggs.</p><p>And yet, I can‚Äôt help wanting more.</p><p>Let‚Äôs do something different for this review: Let‚Äôs make it a show and tell. If you‚Äôre a video person, start by tapping on my Instagram embed above, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/nv-t6m4uNlk">or TikTok</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/nv-t6m4uNlk">or YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/verge/videos/lego-game-boy-vs-real-game-boy/1249944793488210/">or Facebook</a>, or perhaps <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/seanhollister.bsky.social/post/3lzr5x2okyc2q">my Bluesky</a>. If you prefer photos and words, scroll down and I‚Äôll tell you all about it!</p><p>Here it is, the photograph I‚Äôve wanted to stage for months: the Lego Nintendo Game Boy next to the pristine 1989 original you might have seen <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/4/21/18508022/game-boy-nintendo-games-accessories-anniversary-photo-essay">in many a <em>Verge </em>photo before</a>. It was my wife‚Äôs childhood Game Boy, though I had one just like it ‚Äî and Lego designer Carl Merriam absolutely nails the size, shape, and look. It does overcompensate slightly with the Off-On switch and headphone jack labels that are gray instead of molded, three of the four corners of the gray screen bezel are square instead of slightly rounded, and the A and B buttons seem almost pink rather than purple.</p><p>It‚Äôs also clearly made of a mosaic of Lego tiles rather than a single smooth surface, but that‚Äôs part of the charm: it‚Äôs a wonder to realize the Game Boy can be re-created 1:1 out of Lego bricks!</p><p>Here, I have both displaying the exact same cutscene from <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link‚Äôs Awakening</em>. If you‚Äôve never played the original, you may not realize <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vwjewLrq8GM&amp;list=RDvwjewLrq8GM&amp;start_radio=1">just how specific a moment this is</a> ‚Äî a bittersweet, heartstring-tugging scene you can only watch once per playthrough, so I had to save my game before a certain quest to get this photo.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Lenticular tech is still rad.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The Lego Game Boy comes with three of these little <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenticular_printing">lenticular panels</a> to make it look like the screen‚Äôs turned on and give it a sense of motion. If you tilt the handheld up and down, you can watch Mario jump, see the Nintendo logo fall, or watch the waves and seagulls fly above the <em>Link‚Äôs Awakening</em> beach.</p><p>But the one thing I don‚Äôt understand is printing on a <em>gray</em> background rather than a <em>green </em>one, so the Lego Game Boy‚Äôs screen doesn‚Äôt look green like the original‚Äôs. It feels like a bizarre miss to me.</p><p>A closer look at gray versus green:</p><div><p><figcaption><em>I threw in an Easter egg of my own.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>It‚Äôs not the only nit I could pick with the Lego Game Boy‚Äôs screen, which is recessed quite a bit more than the original, which in turn makes it even harder to light up than the original (and, like the original, you need an external light source to do that since it didn‚Äôt have a light of its own!).</p><p>But I don‚Äôt blame Lego for that ‚Äî it‚Äôs because Lego‚Äôs using a regular Lego window frame and windowpane for the screen instead of creating new custom parts, which make it feel more authentically Lego. I just wish Lego would start protecting its big windowpanes better so they don‚Äôt come scratched right out of the box.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>You need a lot of light to see the ‚Äúscreen‚Äù well.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Comparing the Lego Game Boy to the original from every angle, you can see lots of places where there are slight gaps between the tiles, sure. But you can also see that almost every complex curve and label is represented, and while it weighs a few ounces less than the original, it‚Äôs almost the exact same size.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Image slider: volume and contrast wheels, external connector port (though there‚Äôs no port underneath Lego‚Äôs cover) and the AC adapter jack. No AC adapter label on the Lego version.</em></figcaption></p></div><div id=":R1abcmab96:"><p><figcaption><em>That power switch may seem placed too high, but it‚Äôs worth it for the satisfying snap of its Technic peg action.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>You shouldn‚Äôt take that for granted, because it‚Äôs not easy even for skilled Lego creators to build a dense real-life object to scale with moving parts. As an example, see how much thicker and blockier <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21578775/lego-nintendo-game-boy-fan-model-nick-lever-masters"><em>Lego Masters Australia</em> finalist Nick Lever‚Äôs creation</a> is below?</p><div id=":R1ebcmab96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>From left to right: Lego‚Äôs Game Boy, Nintendo‚Äôs Game Boy, and my attempt at Nick Lever‚Äôs fan creation.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>I still love the Mario hat buttons, though.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><div><p><figcaption><em>BTW, both of the Lego Game Boys can technically squeeze in a real cart, but it stretches the build uncomfortably.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>But <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/23991049/lego-ideas-polaroid-onestep-behind-the-scenes-price">as the Lego Group showed and told me in 2023</a>, the thing that truly separates a great official Lego set from a fan creation is the incredible amount of thought that goes into making the set playable and fun to <em>build</em>, not just fun once you‚Äôre through.</p><p>You can get a better sense in my video, but after a certain point the whole set is built out of modular parts. You create a set of springy face buttons that slide into place, a D-pad that drops in, a screen that needs attaching. It contributes to the illusion you‚Äôre building electronics instead of just piling bricks together. And there are details you‚Äôll only appreciate if you‚Äôve seen inside ‚Äî like how the springy Start and Select buttons are actually Lego car tires.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The rubber nub brick under the D-pad makes for a surprisingly good action.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Or how the springy ‚Äúmembrane‚Äù under the D-pad and A and B buttons are colored similarly to their real-life counterparts, even though you‚Äôll never see them once it‚Äôs closed:</p><div id=":R1sbcmab96:"><p><figcaption><em>One rubber band makes both buttons springy.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Or how there‚Äôs a brick-built ‚Äúspeaker‚Äù underneath the Lego speaker grille, complete with yellow ‚Äúwires,‚Äù at the lower right-corner of the build:</p><p>Or how Lego‚Äôs <em>Link‚Äôs Awakening </em>cartridge even features a ‚Äúbattery backup‚Äù for its save games, like the original, while the <em>Mario</em> cartridge appropriately does not.</p><div id=":R26bcmab96:"><div><p><figcaption><em>Not a perfect apples-to-apples comparison, since my real cart is the Player‚Äôs Choice reprint from 1996.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>The Lego cart can technically fit in an original Game Boy cartridge case if you remove the top tile.</em></figcaption></p></div></div><p>It all takes such passion and attention to detail that I have to wonder: why stop short of doing everything you can when you‚Äôve already come this far?</p><p>Here‚Äôs the back of the Lego Game Boy, and the real Game Boy, showing off one final Easter egg: the ‚Äúserial number‚Äù that‚Äôs actually the date the original Game Boy first came out on April 21st, 1989. That part‚Äôs great. But it also contains two completely blank spots where the original Game Boy had an info panel with model numbers and regulatory markings, and the US version had a service sticker.</p><p>At $60 ‚Äî <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/786483/how-to-find-lego-game-boy-costco-sams-club-on-sale-early">I got mine early for $50 at Costco</a> ‚Äî I can understand why the Lego Nintendo Game Boy doesn‚Äôt have light or sound or actually play games just yet. (Fans will make it do <em>all </em>those things before long.) But the top panel is already a printed piece, and the set already comes with a small sticker sheet.</p><p>Just like my real copy of <em>Link‚Äôs Awakening</em> fixes <a href="https://zelda.fandom.com/wiki/Glitches_in_Link%27s_Awakening">bugs that Nintendo originally accidentally shipped</a>, might I suggest Lego ship future copies of the Game Boy with greener screens and a few more lines of text?</p><p><em>Photography by Sean Hollister / The Verge</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/787849/lego-nintendo-game-boy-review]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/just-cause">Just Cause</a> developers Avalanche Studios are cutting staff and closing their Liverpool, UK-based studio following Microsoft's cancellation of co-op smuggling game Contraband.
</p>
<p>Avalanche <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/just-cause-developers-announce-open-world-smuggling-game-contraband">announced Contraband back in June 2021</a> in the form of a trailer replete with lockboxes, scribbly heist maps and Steely Dan music. There followed several years of almost complete silence, broken by news that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/over-100-staff-at-just-cause-developers-avalanche-have-unionised">over 500 Swedish staff had formed a union</a> in April 2024 - part of a wave of games industry labour activism in the face of widespread, "post-Covid" job-chopping.
</p>
<p>The positivity was not to last. In June 2024, Avalanche <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/just-cause-creators-avalanche-lay-off-50-people-and-close-their-montreal-and-new-york-studios">laid off 50 people and closed their New York and Montreal studios</a> to ensure "a stable and sustainable future for the company". Then, in August, Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-halted-development-on-just-cause-devs-70s-co-op-smuggler-contraband">called time on Contraband</a>, shortly after laying off a bunch of Xbox developers and cancelling such games as Rare's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-mysterious-nature-sim-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-mass-layoffs-according-to-reports">Everwild</a> and The Initiative's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">reboot of Perfect Dark</a>.</p>
<p>Back then, Avalanche commented that "active development has now stopped while we evaluate the project's future". There's been some disagreement between Microsoft and reporters over whether the game is fully dead, or merely "on hold". I imagine it'll be on hold for a while, if they aren't any developers to work on it.
</p><p>Avalanche's <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/studio-update">statement</a> about this week's reductions alludes to "current challenges to our business and the industry", but doesn't mention Contraband. The company propose to close their Liverpool studio, with a collective consultation process as required by UK law. "The changes will also impact our other studio locations in Malm≈ë and Stockholm," the statement continues, "where we will reduce our workforce and restructure the teams to address our games' needs."
</p>
<p>Best of luck to everybody affected.</p>

            <p>Insert joke about London calling here, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a> developers Team FOLON have just released the first of the mod's planned three DLC packs. This one's called Rabbit and Pork and brings with it 30 new quests, plus a laundry list of that includes a bunch of NPCs, extra gear, and stability fixes.</p>
<p>As we <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-londons-first-dlc-will-require-a-brand-new-save-team-folon-confirm-but-it-sounds-like-other-future-add-ons-wont">covered the other day</a>, to dive into the DLC and have the least chance of running into any bugs that could be lurking, you'll want to start a fresh run through post-apoclayptic Blighty.</p>

<p>"This major update doesn't just add new content, it reshapes parts of the game based on your feedback and fixes thousands of issues identified since launch," Team FOLON wrote in the DLC's Discord announcement. "We've poured a huge amount of effort into making this the most polished and complete experience possible."</p><p>Rabbit and Pork brings 30 new quests and minigames to the mod, along with 80 new characters for which 8000+ lines of chat have been recorded, I assume at least a third of those being in Cockney accents. Taking a quick gander at the release trailer, among the things which've stuck out to me are a mission involving a plane named after Fallout: London's protagonist, the wayfarer, and a visit to the Jack the Ripper museum.</p>
<p>As you explore, 30 new weapons and armours can be found, along with a new animal follower and a home to move into. 70 fresh random encounters and "new content for early faction introductions" round out the additions, while Team FOLON say the number of bug fixes and stability improvements number in the thousands.</p>
<p>"We‚Äôre also unveiling a <a href="https://www.overwolf.com/app/teamfolonlimited-folon_launcher">brand-new custom launcher</a> designed alongside the Overwolf team to simplify the installation process for those who wish to use it," they add. "This one-click solution will alleviate the hassle of traditional mod installations and get players into the game faster and more reliably than ever akin to the GOG one-click installer."</p>
<p>In addition, the modders have rolled a number of key <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> mods that help make the game a bit less likely to crash into this release, so the High FPS Fix, X-Cell and Buffout 4 no longer have to be grabbed seperately. Team FOLON recommend you uninstall them if you've already downloaded and installed them individually, to avoid duplication.</p><p>To round out the news, the modders have also <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/teamfolon/team-folon-collectors-edition">launched a Kickstarter</a> for a Collector's Edition of Fallout: London. Something to consider backing if you fancy it in between mouthfuls of rabbit and pork. If you bounced off of Fallout: London the first time around due to its launch bugs, here's the <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-review">review I wrote of it</a> for my old home.</p>

<p>Nuketown was first introduced in 2010's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops/" data-ref-id="5000-43355">Black Ops</a>. Iconic for its incredibly tight shooting lanes and those two opposing two-story houses, it's one of those maps that speeds up what can already be a really fast game. It appeared in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-mobile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-501123">Call of Duty: Mobile</a> but hadn't been seen until it was remastered in Black Ops 6.

It arrives on Switch in just a few weeks on <strong>9th October</strong>, but before we get to see the finished product for ourselves, the studios have made a surprise reveal about the original fantasy IP: an animated series is in the works.</p>
<p>The series is set to be developed by animation studio Supamonks, and will set out to "build upon Absolum's lore and narrative, expanding its universe beyond the game," the press release reads.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067lhunjt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>
</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>Details for the series' release are pretty slim at the moment (to be fair, the game's not even out yet), but we do know that Supamonks has been involved in Absolum's development right from the start and, with Dotemu collaborating, we're sure it'll provide a fitting expansion of the game's world. At the very least, it's bound to look pretty.</p>
<p>Every Absolum trailer we've seen so far has shown promise, with a neat art style, fun-looking gameplay loop, and plenty of combat variety. We'll have to wait and see what the full release brings, but this could be one to watch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Techland has <a href="https://x.com/DyingLightGame/status/1972959300436865280" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a major hotfix patch for Dying Light: The Beast, updating the game to version 1.2.3. The update improves a performance issue related to stuttering when NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation (or Multi Frame Generation), which I <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-shows-an-aging-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted in my technical analysis of the game</a> as very annoying during gameplay. </p>



<p>The other highlight is that the Polish studio has recognized the absolutely overpowered grabbing ability of zombie Biters and balanced it so that it is less frustrating. That's also something I noticed right away when playing and indeed, the PC community <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-five-pc-mods-to-improve-your-dying-light-the-beast-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had already provided fixes through mods</a>. Even though this is now fixed in the base Dying Light: The Beast, other mods are still worth downloading.</p>



<p>Here's the full changelog for Dying Light: The Beast 1.2.3:</p>



<p><strong><em>Stability &amp; Performance</em></strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Fixed various crashes to improve overall game stability.</em></li>



<li><em>Resolved an issue where sharpening was not applied correctly while using DLSS.</em></li>



<li><em>Addressed occasional stuttering when playing with Frame Generation enabled.</em></li>



<li><em>Fixed graphical glitches when using HDR on PlayStation 5.</em></li>
</ul>



<p><strong><em>Gameplay Improvements</em></strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Grabbing Biters is now less frustrating and feels more fair.</em></li>



<li><em>Fixed an issue where patrolling routes of Screamers in Dark Zones were broken.</em></li>
</ul>



<p><strong><em>Quests &amp; Progression</em></strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Tutorial:</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed a critical issue where, if a player received a modded weapon from someone who had already completed the tutorial, the game attempted to apply the mod a second time, thus blocking the progress.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><em>The Mine (Co-op):</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed an issue where destructible doors could remain indestructible for one player, blocking quest progression.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><em>Safe Spots:</em>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed a bug where breakable doors and windows respawned after reloading, trapping players inside.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><em>Mental Asylum Safe Spot: Fixed an issue where reloading the save could leave the entrance blocked by an unintended obstacle, preventing players from entering.</em></li>



<li><em>Fixed an issue where music could loop infinitely after reloading certain quests.</em></li>
</ul>



<p><strong><em>UI &amp; Consoles</em></strong></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Fixed the missing ‚ÄúJoin the Community‚Äù button on consoles.</em></li>
</ul>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-beta-cheaters-cod-blops-black-ops-7-ban-secure-boot-ricochet-2000630268</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-devs-%E2%80%98want%E2%80%99-people-to-cheat-during-the-black-ops-7-beta.1312687/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In a few days, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-bad-bf6-battlefield-6-hype-trailer-2000618912"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em></a> beta launches on console and PC. This will be the first time players get a chance to go hands-on with the upcoming FPS. It will also be the first chance hackers and cheaters get to possibly screw up the game. And Activision not only expects that to happen, but <em>wants</em> it to happen.</p> <p>On September 29<a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-ricochet-anti-cheat-update">,</a> <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-ricochet-anti-cheat-update">Activision and the team behind <em>Call of Duty‚Äô</em>s anti-cheat tech posted a lengthy blog</a> about what they are doing to stop cheaters from ruining the game. As previously announced, this time around, <em>Call of Duty</em> players on PC will have to have Secure Boot activated on their rig to <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blackops7/beta">play <em>Black Ops 7</em> and the upcoming beta</a>. For most players, this shouldn‚Äôt be much of an issue as newer PCs running Windows 11 are likely to already have Secure Boot activated. But for other players planning to run the game on older PCs or rigs that don‚Äôt support Secure Boot, this could be a problem.</p>

 <p>We saw similar issues with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/battlefield-6-requires-secure-boot-to-run-and-its-coming-to-more-games-soon-including-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-heres-what-it-is-why-linux-gamers-are-mad-about-it-and-how-to-enable-it/"><em>Battlefield 6</em> and its open beta</a>, which also required Secure Boot. The idea is that this extra level of security can help stop some PC cheat tools, but some players have complained that it can be a pain to turn on Secure Boot if you aren‚Äôt experienced with messing around with your PC‚Äôs BIOS settings. Others claim it doesn‚Äôt do much to stop hackers and cheaters, and point to the fact that <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-cheating-cheaters-hacks-ea-dice-secureboot-pc-2000616686"><em>BF6</em>‚Äòs beta reportedly had cheaters in it almost immediately.</a>&nbsp; Regardless, Secure Boot is needed to play <em>Black Ops 7</em> and the beta.&nbsp; And if cheaters do try to play the <em>BLOPS7</em> beta despite Secure Boot, Activision and its anti-cheat team, Team Ricochet, are waiting for them and ready to ban them forever.</p>

 <p>‚ÄúCheaters will try to test the limits during the Beta. That‚Äôs exactly what we want because #TeamRICOCHET is here, watching, learning, and removing them as they appear,‚Äù explained the team in the previously mentioned blog post. ‚ÄúAny account permanently banned for cheating during the Beta will be banned across all<em> Call of Duty </em>titles, from<em> Call of Duty: Modern Warfare</em> to future releases.‚Äù</p>

 <p>The studio further explained that all of its anti-cheat tech, which includes machine learning tools and more, will also help make Activision‚Äôs free-to-play battle royale <em>Call of Duty Warzone</em> safer from cheaters, adding: ‚ÄúEverything we‚Äôre building for <em>Black Ops 7</em> will also protect <em>Call of Duty: Warzone.‚Äù</em></p>

 <p>I still expect cheaters will break through Activision‚Äôs defenses and cause problems in <em>BLOPS7</em>‚Äòs beta and the full game, which launches in November on consoles and PC. But it sounds like the folks building the game‚Äôs anti-cheat tools are not just ready for a fight, but actively encouraging it.</p> <p>The <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> beta launches on all platforms on October 2 via early access. It then opens up to everyone on October 5 and ends on October 8.</p>

		<p>The UK branch of Just Cause developer <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/avalanche-studios/">Avalanche Studios</a> is to close just a few weeks after the news that<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/07/avalanche-studios-contraband-is-no-longer-in-development-for-microsoft/">&nbsp;Contraband,</a> a game they were creating as an Xbox exclusive for Microsoft, is no longer in active development.</p>
<p>‚ÄúIn light of current challenges to our business and the industry, we have thoroughly reviewed how to best ensure Avalanche Studios Group‚Äôs long-term success,‚Äù reads a statement posted on the <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/studio-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avalanche Studios website.</a></p>


<p>‚ÄúThis review has led us to the difficult conclusion that we must make changes to our staffing and locations. As a result, we are proposing to close our Liverpool studio, and to initiate a collective consultation process, as required by UK law. This will impact all Avalanchers in Liverpool. The changes will also impact our other studio locations in Malm√∂ and Stockholm, where we will reduce our workforce and restructure the teams to address our games‚Äô needs.‚Äù</p>
<p>‚ÄúOur immediate focus is to offer full support to all Avalanchers during this challenging time. Despite these changes, we remain deeply committed to providing amazing games to our passionate player communities.‚Äù</p>
<p>Avalanche Liverpool was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/06/03/avalanche-studios-liverpool-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set up in 2020 </a>and had around 50 staff. Liverpool is the latest Avalanche studio to close, their <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/04/avalanche-lay-off-fifty-staff-close-two-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New York and Montreal studios were shut down in June 2024</a> with the loss of another fifty staff.</p>

<p>Avalanche has not had much luck with Microsoft, having previously worked on dinosaur shooter Second Extinction. That was revealed in 2020 and did make it into early access on both PC and Xbox, but was eventually cancelled in 2023. Avalanche‚Äôs website lists Contraband as the sole upcoming title, it‚Äôs not been officially cancelled but the listing does still link back to a Microsoft page that no longer exists.</p>
<p>Hopefully, Avalanche have another unannounced big project waiting in the wings.&nbsp; It had six projects in development in 2018 but those have either been released, such as Just Cause 4, or cancelled.</p>

<figure data-uuid="1b41258f2a384"><a title="Seiken Densetsu 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1b41258f2a384/seiken-densetsu-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>Who doesn‚Äôt love a job or class system in an RPG? From endlessly levelling jobs and sub-classing skills in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/final_fantasy_v">Final Fantasy V</a> to building the perfect teams and pairings in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/octopath_traveler">Octopath Traveler</a>, classes bring a level of customisation and character that feels pretty unique to the genre.</p>
<p>But while most games allow for a God-like amount of tinkering and levelling, there‚Äôs something to be said for the more restrictive class systems. Those that set your characters in a base class and allow them to change according to a class tree, branching down different paths that change the style and impact of that character.</p><div><figure data-videoid="23DYpTkUosk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/23DYpTkUosk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/23DYpTkUosk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/23DYpTkUosk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f63epvnohr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<p>It‚Äôs for this reason that I love <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/seiken_densetsu_3">Seiken Densetsu 3</a>‚Äôs class system. It‚Äôs deceptively simple, relying more on team composition, adaptability, and filling in gaps rather than chopping and changing as you go. Once you choose a character‚Äôs Light or Dark job path, that‚Äôs it; you have to commit. And, even 30 years after it debuted, it's still absolutely delightful.</p>
<figure data-uuid="b7c7b8a2f6270"><a title="Seiken Densetsu 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b7c7b8a2f6270/seiken-densetsu-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It‚Äôs a big shift from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/final_fantasy_adventure">Final Fantasy Adventure</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/secret_of_mana">Secret of Mana</a>, two relatively simple action RPGs that borrowed from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/legend_of_zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a>, which then evolved into a party-based multiplayer RPG. Secret of Mana will always be one of the most influential games in my life, but its sequel ‚Äì now known as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/trials_of_mana">Trials of Mana</a> ‚Äì is <em>so</em> much better because of just how replayable it is. The first time I beat it, I immediately started playing it again, because I really wanted to build a perfect, all-destroying team.</p>
<p>And, honestly, you can‚Äôt go wrong with most combinations. A lot of the magic comes from being able to choose your whole party at the start of the game ‚Äì who you choose as your lead character will determine certain story scenes and end-game dungeons, but other than that, it‚Äôs completely down to you.</p>
<p>So I went totally on vibes: Riesz was a must and my first lead, armed with a spear for decent damage; next was Kevin, a monk-like character and the best beast boy; rounding out the trio was Hawkeye, a roguish thief with charm for days. On paper, maybe not the most balanced group, as there‚Äôs no dedicated spell caster or healer (initially), but by the end it‚Äôs an absolutely monstrous trio with huge amounts of damage.</p>

<p>What makes Trials of Mana‚Äôs class system work so well is that it gives you an adequate amount of time with every stage. For the first 18 levels, you‚Äôll spend a lot of time getting used to each character‚Äôs base moveset, which for me was mostly attack, attack, <em>attack</em>. None of my characters had any spells, buffs, or debuffs, so I just had to rely on perfectly-charged special attacks or careful use of healing items.</p>
<p>It‚Äôs a lesson in learning the strengths and weaknesses of each character early on, without the bells and whistles their class upgrades bring. Or, in my case, I guess I learned that all three characters could hit hard ‚Äì especially Kevin. I‚Äôm comfortable with Secret of Mana‚Äôs systems (even the awful spell-queueing system which I exploited to level up magic), so it was an adjustment period to get used to the improved timing.</p>
<p>Level 18 is where the fun <em>really</em> starts, so examining a mana stone, I could finally pick whether I would send my characters down a Light or a Dark class path. Whichever one I picked, it would lock me out of <em>half</em> of that character‚Äôs classes. Plus, both sides for each character bring about different changes to their classes, narrowing down on niches that make all six playable characters unique.</p>

<p>Riesz, when she starts travelling down her job path, <em>isn‚Äôt</em> just a damage dealer. Her Light side gives her access to party buffs, while her Dark path focuses on debuffs. Class up again at 38, and her stat-buffs/debuffs either get stronger <em>or</em> are able to target multiple allies or enemies.</p>
<p>Choosing to go down the Light path with Valkyrie, the cogs are turning in my head. With Riesz as the buffer, the damage needs to come from the boys. I stuck with the Light path for Kevin, giving him a heal and a strength buff that worked during the day. Naturally, then, Kevin had to go Dark, but not <em>full</em> dark, allowing him to multicast ninjutsu spells.</p>
<p>That trio filled all of the gaps I had. Starlancer (Riesz‚Äôs Light-Dark Class) allows her to buff the entire team but also gives her a highly damaging summon, for a much-needed clinch moment during encounters, in that it wipes every single enemy off the screen. Kevin became <em>the</em> damage-dealer, tanky and able to keep the pressure on up close. Hawkeye, meanwhile, used spells to exploit elemental weaknesses (useful for those eight Benevodon bosses) while also adding to the damage Kevin dealt.</p>
<figure data-uuid="4f83d8f10e9f4"><a title="Seiken Densetsu 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4f83d8f10e9f4/seiken-densetsu-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It was a surefire combo that turned out to be extremely fun to play with; what could‚Äôve ended up as a disaster completely worked in my favour, giving me the variety I needed to win. I honestly just picked those three characters because they had the best designs. So, what if I went with a completely different theme?</p>
<p>My second playthrough started mere days after my first, and I went all-girls: Charlotte, Angela, and Riesz. No main physical attackers, simply a straight trio of supporters and magicians. I loved my first playthrough, but this Mana Girls party and their mix of classes cemented the game as one of my all-time favourite SNES RPGs.</p>
<p>The conundrum here was, how the heck am I going to deal a lot of damage? I had magic and healing covered, and I knew I‚Äôd be able to buff with Riesz, who I went Light Light with for Vanadis for single-target buffs and her extremely powerful single-target tech instead. But by this point, I‚Äôd become obsessed with researching classes online, from looking at the beautiful character designs and artwork and deciding which ones looked best to completing the perfect party and making the pieces fit together.</p>
<figure data-uuid="5689559125421"><a title="Seiken Densetsu 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5689559125421/seiken-densetsu-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Charlotte didn‚Äôt need a damage buff for the most part, since I already knew Angela would be where the big numbers would come from. Instead, Charlotte would go from the adorable little kid to a Necromancer with the ability to debuff an enemy (read: a boss). Then Angela‚Äôs pure-Light class, Grand Diviner, was all damage all day, with Double Spell and whatever the most effective element for that particular fight.</p>
<p>I beat the final boss in under a minute. Trials of Mana isn‚Äôt exactly a hard game, but don‚Äôt take that moment away from me; I knew how to craft the perfect party and exploit all of their strengths and sharpen them. No real physical damage except for a charged attack that takes a while to build up? No worries, let me spam spells and buffs over and over again.</p>
<figure data-uuid="bf91599b224b1"><a title="Seiken Densetsu 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bf91599b224b1/seiken-densetsu-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>These are the best kind of conundrums to solve in any job/class-based RPG ‚Äì what works with what? What doesn‚Äôt? When <em>should</em> you use this skill, this class? It doesn‚Äôt matter how simple or complex it is; you simply need to think or experiment. In Trials of Mana‚Äôs case, well, you have to stick with it ‚Äì your decisions are final, and in a way, that‚Äôs also part of the fun.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs no way to change easily like in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/final_fantasy_tactics_the_ivalice_chronicles">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_3">Xenoblade Chronicles 3</a>. You have to live with your choices and plough your way through regardless. Did you forget to employ elemental weaknesses between Duran, Hawkeye, and Riesz? Well, just keep the pressure on. No healing? Better build up money and stock up on healing items. If you happen to put together a crappy team, the challenge and the joy come from how to make it work.</p>
<figure data-uuid="503d5453a6104"><a title="Seiken Densetsu 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/503d5453a6104/seiken-densetsu-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It‚Äôs not a complicated game, and it never needed to be. There are optimal and less optimal compositions, sure, but is the ability to create a weird mix of jobs and classes not a huge part of the attraction? Why do you think <a href="https://www.fourjobfiesta.com/">Final Fantasy V‚Äôs Four Job Fiesta</a> has prevailed for so long? Sure, that game is amazing <em>because</em> of how good and flexible its class system is, but restrictions and challenges make it even better.</p>
<p>So, while Trials of Mana might not be as deep as other class-based RPGs, for its time, it‚Äôs exceptionally moreish and beautifully simple, allowing you to dip your toes into party composition and planning. It‚Äôs like a real D&amp;D game ‚Äì a Bard, a Warlock, and a Thief might not sound like the <em>ideal</em> party, but it‚Äôs probably a real good time. Just like running a bunch of mages.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Battlefield Studios (DICE, Criterion, Ripple Effect, and Motive) announced that Battlefield 6 Season 1 will begin on October 28 and feature free new content for all players.</p>



<p>The first season kicks off with Rogue Ops, which includes a new map called Blackwell Fields, a new 4v4 mode called Strikepoint, and new weapons. The second phase, California Resistance, begins on November 18 and includes a map located in Southern California called Eastwood, as well as a Sabotage mode designed for 8v8 combat. The final phase of Season 1, Winter Offensive, begins on December 9 and includes a seasonal map update to Empire State and a themed event.</p>



<p>Blackwell Fields' map includes support for all combat sizes, land, and air vehicles. The backstory is that, right after the end of the single player campaign of Battlefield 6, double agents from the antagonist faction Pax Armata launch a series of attacks on NATO targets, starting at a recently recommissioned American air base in the California badlands. The new Strikepoint mode is an intense, small-team tactical mode in which a squad fights another squad over multiple rounds to capture a key objective. Each round, players have only one life.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Phase one's additions also include:</p>



<ul>
<li>APC Traverser Mark 2 - A land vehicle that suits four players: one driver, one roof gunner, and two side gunners. </li>



<li>SOR-300C - A low rate of fire carbine rifle chambered in the higher damage .300 Blackout ammunition compared to the platform‚Äôs 5.56 version.</li>



<li>Mini Fix - A lightweight, bolt-action sniper rifle</li>



<li>GGH-22 - A high-capacity and fire rate sidearm</li>



<li>Rail Cover &amp; LPVO - Attachments for rifles and LMGs</li>
</ul>



<p>The Eastwood map will support all Battlefield 6 combat sizes, land vehicles, and helicopters. The setting is described as a sleepy, affluent suburb connected to a golf course. In Sabotage mode, players must destroy as many sites as possible before time runs out. Each team has one offensive and one defensive round; ultimately, the team that successfully detonates the most sites wins the match.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Phase 2 will introduce the Battle Pickups feature to the game. These are high-tech, powerful weapons that are limited in ammo and availability throughout a given map. Players will have to scour the maps to find where they're located if they want to exploit the advantage they bring. Other additions include:</p>



<ul>
<li>DB-12 - A dual-barrel pump-action shotgun</li>



<li>M327 Trait - High-damage (but low rate of fire) sidearm with eight rounds. This revolver is powerful in close quarters but has a significant damage drop-off compared to its .44 Magnum comrade.</li>



<li>Troy Angled - This grip attachment offers an alternative for underbarrel choices</li>
</ul>



<p>Lastly, in the final phase of Battlefield 6 Season 1, Winter Offensive, players will see a seasonal visual update to the Empire State map, where temperatures are now freezing. To go with that theme, there's also a limited-time Ice Lock event centered around a mechanic called Freeze (though this will only be active in specific experiences). Finally, a new melee tool, the Ice Climbing Axe, will be introduced to the shooter game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you plan to play Battlefield 6 on PC, you can now <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-releases-battlefield-6-geforce-game-ready-driver/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">get the NVIDIA GeForce Game Ready driver optimized for the game</a>.</p>

			<p>Fallout: London is an incredibly expansive mod for Fallout 4 that takes Bethesda's post-nuclear apocalypse across the pond to the United Kingdom, completely overhauling the game for what's essentially an entirely new Fallout 4 experience.

<p>Rabbit &amp; Pork adds a bevy of new content for players to dig through, including more than 8,000 new lines of dialogue from 80 new fully-voiced NPCs, 30 new quests, weapons, armours, and mini-games, including a new Blackjack minigame. 70 new random encounters, a new companion and a new home, and along with the new content, the update brings about 1,400 bug fixes.</p>



<p>Even beyond the content and bug fixes, today's news update adds another quality-of-life update that players might appreciate even more: a <a href="https://www.overwolf.com/app/teamfolonlimited-folon_launcher">new custom launcher for Fallout: London powered by Overwolf</a>, which Team FOLON describes as "<em>a one-click solution to install and update the mod seamlessly.</em>"</p>

<p>The update will allow you to see other players' ghosts, including "speedrunners, community members, and the dev team", according to The Game Bakers. This way, you can look out for techniques other players are using to give them the edge, or just bask in the sense of distant camaraderie.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Cairn&nbsp;</em>is, it's the next game from The Game Bakers, the French studio responsible for boss rush bullet hell game&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/furi" rel="nofollow">Furi</a>&nbsp;</em>and co-op RPG&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/haven" rel="nofollow"><em>Haven</em></a>.</p>

<p>Your goal is to climb the imposing Mount Kami, managing resources like pitons, food, and other necessities as you ascend. You'll need to plan your route carefully if you want to make it to the summit.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Cairn&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1588550/Cairn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/cairn/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> early next year.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/summer-eternal">Summer Eternal</a>, one of the infinite number of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> spiritual successor studios that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sure-why-not-third-group-of-former-disco-elysium-devs-announce-revolutionary-new-rpg-studio">cropped up last year</a>, have been mostly quiet on whatever it is they've been cooking up since forming. They announced their existence with an evocative political manifesto, and today they revealed what's next. No, it's not a video game, but something a lot more physical, tangible, and interestingly old fashioned: a book.
</p>
<p>
Quite simply titled <a href="https://summereternal.com/anthology">Summer Eternal Anthology</a>, it's actually volume one of that planned anthology, which does run on the assumption that they manage to release another one. A press release from Summer Eternal describes it as "part cultural journal, part expedition log, part development diary," and, most unusually of all, "part physical game announcement."
</p>

With the internet being the de facto place you announce a videogame these days, Summer Eternal are certainly doing something different here, more akin to magazine exclusives from days of yore. It's a bold move, and one they're hoping will support them financially, for this book is both an announcement teaser and a source of income in itself. There'll apparently be info on gameplay systems, the game's world, and how it all looks. Oh, and the game has a codename too, "Red Rooster."
</p><p>
Aside from that, you'll also find a few non-fiction essays, interviews, political thinkpieces related to the games industry, and a recap of what Summer Eternal have gone through to establish a worker-owned co-op. You'll have to wait a while for it though, as it's planned for spring 2026 earliest, summer 2026 latest.
</p>
<p>
In case you need a bit of a refresher on Summer Eternal as a studio compared to the other teams that boast of having former Disco devs on the books, this is the one co-founded by Argo Tuulik and Dora Klind≈æiƒá, both former writers at ZA/UM. You may remember that Tuulik and Klind≈æiƒá have had some legal back-and-forth with Riaz Moola, founder and owner of Longdue, a different supposed Disco successor.
</p>
<p>
Moola alleges that the pair violated a non-compete clause after they were previously employed by him, whereas Tuulik and Klind≈æiƒá claim that this particular clause covered a separate industry. People Make Games <a href="https://youtu.be/lZEAs6M1wts?si=enfye4e3OBsazepP">explored some of this particular legal battle</a> in a follow-up to their <a href="https://youtu.be/JGIGA8taN-M?si=HafzykdWTFtfRgmb">original Disco Elysium/ ZA/UM documentary from 2023</a>, if you want a bit more depth.

Is a slot machine still a slot machine when you surround it with gunky visual metaphors for indentured servitude? Is a slot machine still a slot machine when you balance all the medulla-massaging twinkles and jingles against some gloating indications that the apparatus means you harm - drawerfuls of pink, polygonal flesh; shivery text that seems to crawl away from your eyes; a first-person camera that appears to be constantly hyperventilating; a trapdoor right beneath your feet? 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Is a slot machine still a slot machine when you add <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314790/CloverPit/">the Steam page disclaimer</a> that "CloverPit is a rogue-lite horror game, and not a slot machine simulator. Our slot machine is designed to be broken and ultimately overcome, and will never ask you for real money!" Is a slot machine still a slot machine when it's a "sinister tale of addiction and escape" that also dangles the more-ish prospect of replay with different seeds or modifiers? Is a slot machine nothing more than a slot machine when it challenges you to "push your score to new heights in Endless Mode"?
</p>
<p>
Based on 20 minutes with CloverPit, I think the answer to all these questions is "no". I don't think CloverPit is a slot machine, even though it aims to be Endless, and I don't want to get it bluntly recategorised as an 18-rated experience or even removed from stores, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-junking-balatros-18-rating-pegi-will-develop-a-more-granular-rating-system-for-gambling-themes">as was the case with Balatro last year</a>. Still, I'm starting to find these ironic/satirical gambling simulators a bit, well, <em>too</em> cynical, in that I think we are perhaps trying to have our cynicism and eat it, just a smidge.
</p>
<p>
CloverPit released late last week, and there's still a demo on Steam. The basics of the game are that you're both gambling to pay off an ever-increasing debt, and slowly levelling up and optimising a slot machine by spending tokens - increasing the odds of certain symbols appearing, or how much they score, that kind of thing.</p>

<p>Fail to keep up with your debts, and whoops, there goes the trapdoor. The play environment has some fun widgets: you can remind yourself of the modifiers in play by conversing with a horrible toy phone on wheels. I'm quite interested in how they've found the balance between enticing and unpleasant in the design of those chunkily retro, blood-spattered visual props.
</p><p>
There are a lot of roguelikes with nudge-wink casino themes, from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/luck-be-a-landlord">Luck be a Landlord</a> through the wonderful <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/buckshot-roulette">Buckshot Roulette</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dungeons-and-degenerate-gamblers">Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers</a> and various gamble-nots on Itch.io that haven't quite broken through the crust. At a glance, many have the same rough punchline: living under capitalism is a gaudy grind for a fleeting pittance beset by chronic indignity and unfairness, so why not laugh at your own helplessness. Why not revel in it?</p>
<p>Perhaps you can defeat the system from inside, but even if you can't, there's some catharsis to derive from seeing the system for what it is. Also, yanking the wrist of a one-arm bandit is Fun - even "addictive", in the words of one of CloverPit's professional reviews, but you know, addictive with a knowing smirk. Addictive in an above-it-all way.
</p>
<p>
I guess what I myself am nudging and winking towards is a proper longform accounting of comically gambling-adjacent roguelikes that queries them for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dire-comedy-bloodsport-king-of-meat-should-have-been-called-king-of-meme">signs of more obvious hypocrisy</a>, and perhaps chucks in some analysis of the inherently gamblery nature of the roguelite at large - a genre predicated upon but not reducible to randomisation and repetition. You'd have to weave in some thoughts about habit-forming elements in non-roguelite games - lootboxes, level-up noises, that kind of stuff. You'd have to talk about learned helplessness and defeatism as they are potentially manifest in entertainment works.</p>
<p>Ugh, now that I've smooshed together an outline, I don't want to write this, not least because I think I had much the same ideas five years ago, and either didn't follow through or wrote them up and forgot. I am spinning my wheels. Anyway, you might want to try CloverPit's demo, or watch a streamer try their luck. It's been doing well on the Steamvine - partly, I suspect, because it's solid reaction-video fare. Horror games tend to be a good fit for streamers. Still, I think I'm going to go back to playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, for the minute.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-tips-guide-ivalice-remaster-jobs-2000630228</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/12-tips-to-know-before-playing-final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles.1312633/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I‚Äôve played <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> twice in the past couple of months. The first runthrough was of the original on PlayStation. The second <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040">was the excellent <em>Ivalice Chronicles</em> remaster,</a> out today. Despite having grinded through the classic strategy RPG back in the day, I still learned a thing or two from revisiting it again all these years later. Here‚Äôs a bunch of friendly reminders, PSAs, and helpful tips, whether you‚Äôre playing <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> for the first time or coming back to it after decades away.</p> <h2>Keep every character a Squire until they learn JP Up</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630276" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630276"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630276">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>Rule number one of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> is ‚ÄúABJPU‚Äù: always be JP-ing up. JP stands for Job Points and these are what you use to unlock skills across the game‚Äôs sprawling job system. As you rank up each job, you‚Äôll collect more points per action you take, but the JP Up skill will double that, letting you progress your characters twice as fast. The skill is on the third page of the Squire skill list under the passive section. Hold off on swapping your fresh recruits to chemists, knights, or other starting classes until you have this one unlocked.</p>

 <h2>Unlock Focus if you really want to streamline grinding</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630277" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630277"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630277">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>Characters earn XP and Job Points for successful actions. This means doing damage, healing, or buffing/debuffing something. The fastest way to level up characters is to stock up on potions, leave one enemy in a battle alive, and have everyone keep taking turns while staying healed. Accumulate is a Squire skill that raises your attack. It never misses. And you use it on yourself so you don‚Äôt have to move or worry about being in range.</p>

 <p>The quickest way to grind in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> is to have everyone learn the skill (it costs 300 points) and stand around using it at the end of a random encounter. Because you can use it as a character‚Äôs second skill, it‚Äôs helpful no matter what job they are trying to level up, making it a sound strategy over the course of the entire game.</p>

 <h2>Always have a least one character with the Item skill equipped</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630275" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630275"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630275">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>The ability to use Phoenix Down items is one of the most useful skills in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>. That‚Äôs because when characters die, they only have three turns before they turn into crystals. Once that happens, they‚Äôre dead for the whole game unless you reset. If Ramza dies this way, the game is over. Even the best-laid plans can go sideways, and there‚Äôs nothing worse than having a character die early on in a fight and realizing you have no way to bring them back. Make sure at least one character has the Item skill equipped and Phoenix Down unlocked (it‚Äôs only 90 JP points) no matter what job they are. I usually have at least two or three.</p>

 <h2>Job Point spillover is your friend</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630278" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630278"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630278">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> is full of math that never gets overtly explained. One of the most important calculations is called JP spillover. Every time a character earns Job Points, the rest of your characters in battle get 20 percent of those points to that same job. Even if they don‚Äôt have the job unlocked yet, the points will still accrue in the background, showing up once it‚Äôs available.</p>

 <p>This has two important uses. The first is you can have people double-up on jobs and unlock specific skills much faster. The other is that you can earn a small amount of points that let characters unlock one or two lower-level skills without them ever having actually spent time ranking up in that job. If you have a Chemist in your party earn 2,000 points, that will be enough for everyone else to learn Auto-Potion, one of the most useful counterattack skills in the game.</p>

 <h2>Drag battles out when you can so human enemies turn into crystals</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630283" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630283"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630283">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>When humans fall in battle, they can turn into treasure chests or crystals. The treasure chests aren‚Äôt that useful, but the crystals contain all of the Job skills those soldiers had when they died. This is a really efficient way to unlock skills without spending any points, especially for lower-level stuff on jobs that character isn‚Äôt currently using. For example, your Chemist, Knight, or Archer might grab a crystal from a White Mage and learn a bunch of useful secondary skills like Cure, Raise, and Protect without ever grinding as a White Mage. There‚Äôs just one caveat: they need to have the job unlocked to be able to earn the skills from it this way.</p> <h2>Stats grow differently depending on the job you have when you level up</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630287" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630287"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630287">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>Here‚Äôs some more arcane math the game doesn‚Äôt tell you about. Jobs have different base stats, so if you go from being a Knight to a Thief, even if you don‚Äôt change anything else, that character will have less health but be faster. Well, these stats also change in the background as you level up (with XP) in particular jobs. Players have spent decades trying to get the rough math right <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/197339-final-fantasy-tactics/57636648">in charts like these</a>, but there are some key things even casual players should be aware of.</p> <ul> <li>Monks, Knights, and Lancers have the highest health growth multiplier.</li> <li>Monks and Ninjas have the highest attack growth multiplier.</li> <li>Ninjas, Thieves, and Monks have the highest Speed Multiplier.</li> <li>Wizards and Time Mages have the highest magic attack growth multiplier.</li> <li>Priests, Wizards, Time Mages, and Summoners have the highest magic point growth multiplier.</li> </ul> <p>Mimes, the hardest job to unlock in the game, have the highest all around stat growth potential, while Bards have the worst for male characters and Chemists have the worst for Female characters.</p>

 <h2>Ramza kicks ass as a Monk</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630288" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630288"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630288">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>Thematically, it feels like the main character should be wearing armor and tanking hits out in front. It‚Äôs also bad if he dies, so survivability also seems like a priority. But Monks, even though they wear light armor and less of it, can be exceptionally strong, and Ramza, because of his underlying stats, is one of the strongest. In addition to hitting for lots of damage and maintaining good speed, he‚Äôll also unlock all of the Martial Arts skills which include ranged attacks, health and MP healing, status ailment removal, and a revive. Best of all, these skills cost no MP and happen instantly.</p> <h2>Pay attention to Bravery and Faith</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630289" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630289"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630289">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>More numbers! Each character in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> has a Zodiac sign and two numbers near their name. The first is Bravery and it measures their ability to deal and take physical damage. The second is Faith and it‚Äôs involved in calculating the effectiveness of magic spells, both used and received. A high Faith character, for example, will have a higher likelihood of spells working and dealing more damage, but will also be more susceptible to them in return. Take note of these stats in the Recruiter‚Äôs office when you‚Äôre looking for new party members and when you‚Äôre deciding on their job trajectories.</p>

 <p>If someone‚Äôs pursuing magic, they‚Äôll do best with a Faith stat over 60 (I like to aim for 70). Same for Bravery when it comes to physical fighters. Bravery also effects the likelihood of counterattacks activating. This is extra important for things like Auto-Potion. A low Bravery character won‚Äôt react to being hit with their counterattack skills as much.</p> <h2>You can out-level for story battles but not random encounters</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630280" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630280"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630280">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>If you‚Äôre stuck on a story battle like, say, the Dorter Slums or Lionel Castle Gate, you can keep grinding until your characters get powerful enough to overwhelm the enemy with sheer force. Random encounters, however, will always raise enemy levels to around where Ramza‚Äôs is, which is worth knowing before you try to go into a fight and grind with characters who are all learning new jobs they haven‚Äôt unlocked skills for yet.</p> <h2>Don‚Äôt rush into fights!</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630281" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630281"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630281">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>This is a lesson <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> tries to teach you itself in Ramza‚Äôs very first battle out of the academy when Delita warns him about taking things slow. Any time I have ever lost a battle, it is because I got way too aggressive way too early. This will leave your fastest, farthest-moving characters isolated and easy targets to be picked off while also spreading you out across the field too much.</p>

 <p>If you‚Äôre facing mostly Archers and Knights, turtle up and take advantage of healing and support spells that hit multiple allies at once. If you‚Äôre facing enemy spell casters, separate your party just enough to not have multiple people targeted at once while still being close enough together to burst down one enemy at a time.</p> <h2>Always buy the best armor you can afford</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630282" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630282"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630282">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>Every couple of battles, new gear will become available at the Outfitter‚Äôs office. Armor doesn‚Äôt increase defense in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>. Instead, it raises health and magic point totals. Lighter armor will be a more balanced mix, while heavy armor prioritizes HP. It‚Äôs okay to switch things up to suit your character‚Äôs skills. A Knight that also casts White Magic will want to wear mage robes instead of a full suit of armor to get more magic points.</p> <p>In the old days, traveling back to town could mean getting stuck in a random encounter, but the remaster gives you the option to flee any battle on the map, so there‚Äôs no downside to constantly tracking back for supplies and better armor. Unless you‚Äôre playing on easy,<em> Final Fantasy Tactics</em> will require you to grind for cash and levels every so many story battles. Staying on top of the latest gear available will help even the odds.</p> <h2>Don‚Äôt under estimate the power of Move +1</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000630292" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630292"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630292">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>One is the loneliest number. In a game full of big numbers, it can look especially unimpressive. But the maps in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> aren‚Äôt very big, and being able to move one extra square in any direction can pay off in big ways. Combine an early pair of Battle Boots with the Squire‚Äôs +1 movement ability and all of a sudden you have a 50-percent move bonus. Especially for characters who aren‚Äôt ranged, this can be the difference between contributing something meaningful to the fight during their turn and just constantly getting outmaneuvered until they die.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I‚Äôm surprised it took </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>nearly a decade to have a proper skin creation contest, but Chinese artists are currently </span><a href="https://ow.blizzard.cn/trsj2025/#/"><span>competing for the chance to have a costume concept appear</span></a><span> in the hero shooter. Pushing aside with all our might the fact that it sucks that this is a China-exclusive deal when </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-story-missions-comic-zenyatta-ramattra-2000628236"><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i></a><span> is played all around the world, it‚Äôs an exciting prospect, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-wuyang-juno-venture-sprays-ai-generated-2000626941"><span>thankfully, the competition has a hard ban on AI art</span></a><span>. The team at Blizzard will get the final say in what ends up in the game, but fan voting has a chance to tip the scales. The theme of the contest is ‚ÄúWhat if the Omnic Crisis never happened?‚Äù which, for those who aren‚Äôt versed in the lore, means that all of these soldiers and agents would have likely gone on to live normal lives without payload pushing and point capturing. Some of these skins are pretty great, others are going viral on social media for‚Ä¶other reasons. Let‚Äôs look at some of the standouts.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000630267" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630267"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630267">¬© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The designs currently leading in fan voting are a set of three skins, one each for Cassidy, Kiriko, and Ramattra. Kiriko is dressed as a donut store employee, and even her fox spirit, which she casts out when she uses her ultimate, is carrying a pastry in its mouth. Cassidy hasn‚Äôt fallen too far from his roots, as he‚Äôs still depicted as a criminal, but as a fugitive on the run and dressed in prison orange. Ramattra is probably my favorite of the three, however; as the radical Omnic no longer has a war to wage, he has become a housekeeper. Making his staff a broom is a fun touch.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000630266" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630266"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630266">¬© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The current second-place skin is one for the water-wielding hero Wuyang that sees him dressed as a firefighter. In retrospect, this concept is such an obvious fit for him I‚Äôm surprised Blizzard hadn‚Äôt made one itself. Though I‚Äôm not sure if the tank top would pass a regulations check.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000630265" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630265"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630265">¬© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>While some of these skins don‚Äôt really seem on-theme and just look like artists wanted to put their favorite character in a pretty dress (valid), my favorites are the ones that truly imagine where these characters might have ended up if they‚Äôd been born in a peaceful world. Zenyatta as a traffic police officer throwing tickets instead of his signature orbs is inspired.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000630264" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000630264"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000630264">¬© Blizzard Entertainment</figcaption></figure> <p><span>However, one submission circulating in the community has been gaining traction particularly rapidly on social media and, by extension, in the competition. The Chew Time-Huskyrat skin for Junkrat has crossed my desk a few times over the past couple of days, and it‚Äôs pretty imaginative, to say the least. At a glance, it‚Äôs actually a pretty fun skin that has the explosive hero putting away his bombs for bones and chew toys and looking like a fairly standard mascot character. If you look more closely, though, you see it‚Äôs also meant to be a reference to pup play and furry culture, and he‚Äôs wearing a diaper, which has plenty of implications you can google if you‚Äôre curious. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a chance in hell that Blizzard puts this one in the game, even if it somehow skyrocketed to the top of the leaderboard, but it has entered the top 10, and fans are losing it as it climbs the ranks.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Cancel that Chinese skin vote right fucking now why does the Junkrat furry diaper fetish skin have so many votes</p> <p>‚Äî jamieüéê (@VentureFootJob) <a href="https://twitter.com/VentureFootJob/status/1971794747078726003?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">the concept of junkrat being a diaper furry if the omnic crisis never happened <a href="https://t.co/WpHSF7AiNr">pic.twitter.com/WpHSF7AiNr</a></p> <p>‚Äî matt üóØ (@6luelights) <a href="https://twitter.com/6luelights/status/1971902800667050158?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">being a junkrat fan after the diaperfur skin surfaced <a href="https://t.co/58Qlt1PqPy">https://t.co/58Qlt1PqPy</a></p> <p>‚Äî fRankie üêÄüí¨ #TRANSMASCJUNKRATüíôüíóü§çüíóüíô (@vishkar_junkrat) <a href="https://twitter.com/vishkar_junkrat/status/1971984646000071042?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">STOP SAYING ID LIKE THE JUNKRAT FAN ART I DO NOT. üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠ <a href="https://t.co/AA1pzPlvhG">https://t.co/AA1pzPlvhG</a></p> <p>‚Äî Aspen (@aspenisoffline) <a href="https://twitter.com/aspenisoffline/status/1972332121793700011?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">IS JUNKRAT WEARING A DIAPER üò¶ <a href="https://t.co/R2t1Fsj4Jw">pic.twitter.com/R2t1Fsj4Jw</a></p> <p>‚Äî Rowanüå±Lifeweaver CEO üå∑ (@adoringniran) <a href="https://twitter.com/adoringniran/status/1971836185359405251?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">"‚Ä¶and then, in 2025, overwatch finally hosted a fan design contest."<br>‚Å∞"how fabulous! did anyone submit anything good?"<br>‚Å∞"someone drew furry junkrat‚Ä¶ in a diaper‚Ä¶"<br>‚Å∞"oh darling, that is simply dreadful!"<br>‚Å∞"i know, rarity. i know‚Ä¶" <a href="https://t.co/QRRGbrzHJQ">pic.twitter.com/QRRGbrzHJQ</a></p> <p>‚Äî ùò±ùò∫ùò≥ùò¢ ‡ªíÍí± (@pyraVT) <a href="https://twitter.com/pyraVT/status/1972252773866725666?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 28, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>E</span><span>ight winners will be chosen, including one first-place entry, two second-place winners, and two third-place contestants, and a popularity award will be granted to the top three highest-voted designs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We‚Äôre still about a week out from Prime Day ‚Äî Amazon‚Äôs big sales week ahead of Black Friday in which you can save tons on tech, home goods, and more. Even though the deals event isn‚Äôt here yet, some stuff has already begun to see some major discounts. If you‚Äôre hoping to save some cash on some new stuff for your PC or laptop, you can. Take this docking station for example. Anker has a USB hub that‚Äôs normally priced at $270. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/">Right now, Amazon has it marked down by 37%. That saves you a cool $100, bringing the price to just $170 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Stay Organized and Versatile</h2>
<p>This docking station from Anker can bring all of your devices together in one place. No mess on your desktop. This hub will allow you to connect to multiple displays, transfer data quickly, or even charge all your devices easily from one place.</p>
<p>The anker hub employs a number of different ports to manage your different needs. along the front, you‚Äôll find four USB-C ports, two of which are capable of up to 100W max output and the other two capable of transfer speeds of up to 10Gb/s. You‚Äôll also find two USB-A ports, one designed for charging at 12W max and the other for data transfer. When all charging ports are being used, you‚Äôll have a total output of 160W.</p>
<p>The front smart screen display will show you information about the charging output to your plugged-in devices. An audio jack is also on the front beneath that to connect to headphones.</p>



<p>When we turn the Anker docking station around, we find three more USB-A data ports, capable of up to 480Mb/s. Two HDMI 2.0 ports are there so you can connect to multiple displays at once, allowing for up to 4K resolution. You have an Ethernet port capable of up to 1Gb/s. And then we have a USB-C upstream port.</p>
<p>With a ton of electronic devices plugged into the hub, you may be worried about overheating. Well the hub employs ActiveShield temperature monitoring to check temperature levels three million times a day. The airflow system efficiently works to keep the unit cool while it‚Äôs on. In the event it does overheat despite that, the smart display can warn you with overheat alerts.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4389/">For a limited time, Amazon has the Anker USB-C docking station on sale for a huge $100 discount</a>. The price is down from $270 to just $170 right now.</p>

After attending both shows and watching fans try the game for themselves, Nakanishi said he had spotted the difference in how most opted to play in each location, and suggested it was due to how audiences had played other games while growing up.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I think those kinds of differences are significant," Nakanishi said, describing the popularity of shooters in the west, as opposed to console RPGs in Japan. However, this was now changing, he continued, citing the popularity of both Minecraft and Apex Legends among younger Japanese gamers today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After originating in third-person, the Resident Evil series switched to first-person gameplay for Resident Evil 7. But recent years have also seen the launch of various re-releases of previous third-person classics, such as 2023's celebrated Resident Evil 4 Remake. Requiem will be the first title to hand players full control over which perspective their prefer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After playing the Resident Evil Requiem demo myself at Gamescom, there's definitely something to be said for its first-person perspective, which is presented as the demo's default. In first-person, it's harder to tell how close behind you the game's unsettling new monster might be, something that ramps up the horror elements. That said, the view does give you a narrower field of vision for finding hidden objects and clues, which sometimes proved a little frustrating. In reality, it seems likely that most players will likely try a bit of both.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Resident Evil: Requiem - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Public demos for Resident Evil Requiem are important, Nakanishi told IGN at Tokyo Game Show, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-devs-say-they-cant-tell-if-the-games-actually-scary-anymore">Capcom's development team has now made so many games in the series they are unable to tell what is truly scary or not</a>.

            <p>The first batch of seasonal <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> post-release content will arrive 28th October, a few weeks after the game's 10th October launch, EA has announced. It'll bring new modes, new maps, new weapons, and more. And it'll be free.</p>
<p>"All gameplay-impacting features will be free or earnable as part of our commitment to fair play and access for all players," a press release says. <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-season-1-roadmap-preview">And a blog on the game's website</a> has "free post launch content" emblazoned across a promotional image.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6 Season 1 will unfold in three phases. The first phase will arrive on 28th October and be known as Rogue Ops, and it'll introduce a new four-versus-four mode called Strikepoint, in which you'll only get one life per round; a new map called Blackwell Fields, which looks like an oil-field but is apparently a recommissioned American air base; three new weapons, a new APC, and some new weapon attachments.</p>

<p>The second phase, dubbed California Resistance, will land on 18th November, and bring a new eight-versus-eight mode called Sabotage, in which you have one round each on offence and defence, to see how many sites you can blow up; and a new Southern California map called Eastwood, which is a sleepy affluent suburb turned warzone; two new weapons and more.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The third and final phase will drop on 9th December and bring a winter-themed and limited time Ice Lock event based around a mechanic called Freeze, appropriately enough; and a seasonal update to the Empire State map.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Michael '<a href="https://www.nintendo-insider.com/pachter-nintendos-a-bad-company-with-iwata-a-poor-ceo/">Nintendo is a bad company</a>' Pachter, also known as Michael '<a href="https://www.playstationlifestyle.net/2022/03/10/michael-pachter-on-ps5-vs-xbox-series-x/">PlayStation is doomed</a>' Pachter, and sometimes known as Michael Pachter, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2021-01-24/this-netflix-analyst-has-cost-investors-a-2-000-return">the analyst who cost investors a 2,000% return when he advised them to sell their Netflix stock</a>, is back to an old stomping ground with a new claim that "<em>Sony is blowing it in the games business,</em>" because he predicts that games will move to cloud-based experiences connected to your TVs.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CktSxc9_4uk&amp;t=706s">Yahoo Finance</a> discussion (spotted on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/michael-pachter-sony-is-a-terrible-company-they-are-blowing-it-in-the-games-business-games-are-moving-to-connected-tv-via-the-cloud.1312330/">ResetEra</a>) about <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-55-billion-deal-might-bring-massive-layoffs-ai-pivot-20-billion-debt/">EA going private through its $55 billion sale</a> and where people should place their stock market bets in the videogame industry, when asked if people should be buying Sony stock, Pachter immediately responded, "<em>No, Sony for sure not, Sony is a terrible company, and they actually are blowing it in the games business.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Look, games are moving to connected TV,</em>" he continues. "<em>So, think about all the participants that are going to deliver games the way we get movies via Netflix, and forget the subscription model. Just think about iOS becoming on your TV. So free-to-play games on your TV, who's going to deliver that? Cloud providers, AI, anybody whose investing in making that happen is where you want to be.</em>"</p>



<p>Pachter continued to comment that if people looking to invest in the videogame industry want to invest in any current publishers, they should look towards <a href="https://www.playtika.com/">PlayTika, a mobile game company</a> that Pachter owns 500,000 shares of. Pachter added that it is currently trading at "<em>about a four and a half multiple</em>" and that if it were to get an EA-level multiple, he would make "<em>several million dollars</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Electronic Arts: Breaking down the $55 billion deal that takes the company private" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CktSxc9_4uk?start=706&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>This isn't the first time Pachter has bet on <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-losing-to-sony-is-a-wrong-gamers-perception-says-pachter-they-want-to-win-business-not-console/">cloud and non-console-based experiences</a> in videogames being the future. He also previously claimed that Microsoft adding <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-to-reach-100-million-when-activision-games-are-added-says-pachter/">Activision titles to Xbox Game Pass would bring the service 100 million subscribers</a>, and claimed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-will-get-to-200-million-subs-in-10-years-bets-michael-pachter-exclusivity-model-is-wrong/">in the next decade, Game Pass will have 200 million subscribers</a>.</p>



<p>At this point, Pachter has made a career out of these kinds of wild claims and <a href="https://www.tipranks.com/experts/analysts/michael-pachter">has been wrong more often than he's been right</a>. It's worth wondering when we can start considering Pachter just an old man shouting at clouds. Or, more accurately, about clouds.</p>



<p>Just days ago, Sony Interactive Entertainment chief executive officer Hideaki Nishino called the PS5 Sony's "<em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-says-ps5-is-the-most-successful-playstation-generation-ever-making-136-billion-in-sales-so-far">most successful generation to date</a></em>," with $136 billion in sales generated.</p>
