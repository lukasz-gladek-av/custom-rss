			<p>Today, Blades of Fire publisher 505 Games announced a rather unusual offer. They'll be giving away free digital copies of the game (presumably handing out redeemable codes) at London Comic-Con in three weeks, on Friday, May 23. There's a pretty big caveat, though: you have to be celebrating your Steel Wedding (11-year) anniversary on May 22. That means you only get a free copy if you were married on May 22, 2014, and can bring a wedding certificate (or copy/photo) attesting to this.</p>
<p>The seemingly arbitrary date is obviously a reference to <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-is-a-new-action-adventure-from-mercurysteam-out-on-may-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the game's launch date</a>, set for May 22, 2025 on PC (only <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/blades-of-fire-f8178f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the Epic Games Store</a>, at least for now), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. The game will be priced at $59.99, although there's a 10% pre-order discount available now on PC and Xbox. PlayStation users can also get the same discount, but only if they have an active PlayStation Plus subscription. As a side note, if you want to play on PC but don't have a good enough hardware (the system requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-detailed-requirements-upscaled-4k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are fairly demanding</a>), the game will be playable via cloud <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-to-get-doom-the-dark-ages-blades-of-fire-and-more-in-may/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">through NVIDIA GeForce NOW</a>.</p>
<p>Blades of Fire had a relatively short marketing period, having been revealed only in late February. However, MercurySteam has shared many details on the action/adventure game since. The title is set in a fantasy world where the evil queen Nerea has magically turned everyone's steel into stone, making it impossible to challenge her rule. However, protagonist Aran de Lira receives a unique hammer that isn't affected by the curse and sets out on a journey to take her down.</p>
<p>Forging weapons is, therefore, <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-will-focus-strictly-on-weapons-and-your-skills-instead-of-magic-and-rpg-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a big part of the game</a>. Not only are there seven weapon families and 30 Forge Scrolls, but even the choice of materials will greatly influence the crafted weapon, leading to many different combinations. It will be up to the player to choose the right tool for the job, too, as weapons can have wildly different efficiencies depending on the enemy's armor. With over 50 enemy types, players will have to keep track of each one's strengths and weaknesses. The combat system also lets players attack specific body parts.</p>
<p>MercurySteam also <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-is-a-narrative-driven-game-where-you-decide-how-much-you-want-to-know/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that Blades of Fire is narrative-driven. At the same time, players will decide how much they want to know about the story. One way to do that is by engaging in dialogue with Aran's companion, the young scholar Adso de Zelk, who is something of a human encyclopedia.</p>
<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/blades-of-fire-gdc-2025-hands-on-preview-a-pleasant-surprise/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">going hands-on with the game at GDC 2025</a>, Kai Tatsumoto was quite interested in the final game:</p>
<p><em>MercurySteam’s strange AA blacksmithing adventure wasn’t on my radar before going to GDC after missing the initial preview event, but after going hands-on for an hour or so, I was pleasantly surprised with their latest unique IP. It’s just unique enough with the strong emphasis on forging and reforging that gives this action adventure a hook that I haven’t seen done before to this extent. The actual story itself could be a standard fantasy slop, and I’d still be on board for crafting a massive warhammer and just playing out my barbarian fantasies.</em></p>
<p>By the way, a new Blades of Fire trailer will go live later today during Future Game Show's Gamescom LATAM edition. We'll update this story once it is available.</p>

            <p>
The Photo Of God is not an especially brilliant game, but it is a game I keep thinking about. It's a spooky, throwaway interactive epistle from the evidently self-deprecating Serious Daniel, in which you play a photographer standing on a rooftop in a flooded city, under a low, funereal sun. The photographer decides he is going to snap a picture of God. To do this, he must first take pictures of birds that form a breadcrumb trail around the rooftop and through an abandoned building, lit by blazing oil drums. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
It's not clear whether the abandoned building is the same one you start on. There appear to be several floors but, perhaps due to the fade-outs when you enter the stairs, it feels more like you're repeatedly traversing one hallway, with objects shuffling around behind your back. It makes sense that a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror game</a> about the joy and hubris of photographing a deity would complicate the notion of ascending or descending, that it would feel innately purgatorial. For every photograph you take, the photographer rambles to himself a little about beauty and divinity.
</p>
<p>
The birds, meanwhile, spawn one after the other, each cycling the same animation of cocking its head and pecking at the lurid, featureless environment. They appear indifferent to your presence until you snap a photo, using right-click to aim through the lens. Then, there's another fade-to-black and the sound of flapping wings and when the blackness lifts, the bird has vanished. You could call the inability to watch it fly away evidence of limited technical expertise or resources, but again, these crude ruptures feel appropriate. Cameras cut the world to pieces, whereas godhood is (going by the Judeo-Christian concepts I grew up with) continuous, all-pervading. Even when not seeking deliberately to visualise the deity, snapping a photograph is chopping God's body apart.
</p>
<p>
The game lasts a handful of minutes. You will probably guess at the rough nature of conclusion. If you can't, there's a picture of it right there on <a href="https://danieloschepkov.itch.io/the-photo-of-god">the Itch.io page</a>. The Photo Of God is no extended philosophical treatise, but a whimsical modelling of feelings of cosmic dread and presumption that are already perfectly encapsulated by the title alone. There may be a lot more to it or not much at all - I leave that for you to determine. It's free to download.</p>
<p>I keep thinking about the game because you could take the concept and apply it to any vaguely agnostic game with camera mechanics, and it'd be transformative. Imagine if, say, Ubisoft updated callous Clancy fest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-wildlands">Ghost Recon: Wildlands</a> with a bonus Steam achievement labelled "take a photo of God", with no guidance about what is meant here by God, no actual unlock parameters, and no other changes to the game. Just throw that one out there for the completionists to anguish over, while they're synching headshots. 
</p>
<p>
I'm not religious, as you may guess, but I would spend many enchanted hours in such a game attempting to conceive and envisage godhood through drone feeds, sniper scopes, and the game's own Photo Mode. I would also enjoy reading threads of other people striving to do likewise, according to their own modellings of divinity. We don't need to wait for that Steam achievement. We can start the ball rolling here.

The initial hype has peaked, and bloated prices are falling fast. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn’t just the usual post-release cooldown, it's a mix of wider stock availability and Pokébro investors moving on, making it far more affordable to pick up cards individually rather than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-may-1-2025">gambling on overpriced sealed boxes</a> (no matter how appealing that is!). Here's why buying singles could be the smart move for collectors in the US right now.</p><p id="tldr-japanese-single-cards"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="TL;DR: Japanese Single Cards">TL;DR: Single Card Prices Are Crashing</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just look at the current value of Japanese booster boxes for The Glory of Team Rocket set, more than double the shelf price right now. We haven't seen overpricing like this since 151, but I think we're looking at the light at the end of the tunnel for stock <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-surging-sparks-booster-bundle-shining-fates-amazon-restock-latest">shortages of Pokémon TCG</a> worldwide. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take Team Rocket's <a href="https://zdcs.link/aD3m5W?object_uuid=b4ff9038-5a7d-4043-9ed2-88ac3ddd5bb4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Mewtwo ex SIR for example</a>; sold listing were at the $500 mark starting 20th April, which has nose dived down to around $370.77 over the past couple of days. A strong start when it comes to market correction. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there's <a href="https://zdcs.link/QGGlk8?object_uuid=b4ff9038-5a7d-4043-9ed2-88ac3ddd5bb4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Team Rocket's Moltres ex SIR</a>, going from a few sales at around $250 to $163. Granted, it's not a dramatic drop, but that's a $87 drop in the space of a week or so. Not bad. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-april-30-2025">These price drops</a> happening sooner shows us that more scalpers are leaving our hobby, which means <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-deals-for-april-25-2025">artificial bloating on release is down.</a></p><p id="most-affordable"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Most Affordable">Most Affordable Team Rocket Cards</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not all about the ridiculously expensive chase cards however, with Glory of Team Rocket's Super Rare ex and Hyper Rare ex variants looking stunning. These cards are usually over looked in each set, which is great for trainers like me and you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, we can see that it's not just us thinking this with certain cards like <a href="https://zdcs.link/98LwDL?object_uuid=b4ff9038-5a7d-4043-9ed2-88ac3ddd5bb4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Team Rocket's Mewtwo Super Rare ex</a>, which has climbed in value by $6 and change since release to $38.75. Following Journey Together's artstyle of the full color Pokémon with an outline of their trainer in the background, these cards are worth snapping up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe it's just a Mewtwo thing? <a href="https://zdcs.link/zEjZ0y?object_uuid=b4ff9038-5a7d-4043-9ed2-88ac3ddd5bb4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Team Rocket's Nidoking Super Rare ex</a> is performing as expected, dropping from $26 with some stability at $12.94. it's an iconic card for generation one fans and watchers of the first season of the Pokémon anime, not to mention it looks more menacing than Brock with a frying pan. This is one of those cards to buy now and watch it climb down the road, the same goes for Moltres and Crowbat.</p><p id="best-trainer-cards"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Trainer Cards">Best Team Rocket Trainer Cards</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-game-sale-switch-2-woot">peak nostalgia here from generation one</a> and two here, specifically Giovanni and Ariana. The former being the don of Team Rocket who players take down in Kanto, and Ariana serving as the second interim boss of Team Rocket in Johto. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's not much data on <a href="https://zdcs.link/aoXZqA?object_uuid=b4ff9038-5a7d-4043-9ed2-88ac3ddd5bb4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Giovanni 129/098 right now</a>, but it features Team Rocket's leadership alongside the boss himself. It's likely to hold it's value at around the $17 mark, so if it comes up cheaper, grab it. A rule of thumb with this set; if it's Giovanni or Mewtwo, expect to pay out of your nose for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aN4vWV?object_uuid=b4ff9038-5a7d-4043-9ed2-88ac3ddd5bb4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Team Rocket's Ariana 128/098</a> is a stunning artwork variant of the standard trainer art, sporting prices between $17 and $18 and rightly so. Again, the set hasn't been out long enough to judge the value of this card properly, but any listing for under $18 is a good deal right now.</p><p id="best-art-rares"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Best Art Rares">Best Team Rocket Art Rares</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the best artwork in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/youll-save-more-buying-single-paldean-fates-pokmon-cards">Scarlet and Violet era</a> belongs to illustration rares and art rares. They're cheap and look amazing, easily some of the most slept on cards in the TCG. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-pokemon-tcg">If you're looking for your collection to span binders</a>, grow in value and look good whilst doing it? This is the way forward for you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Coming in higher than most right now is Team Rocket's Meowth 109/098, sitting at around $19.25 at the time of writing. That's a fall of nearly $20 from the launch of The Glory of Team Rocket, which is to be expected so close to launch. But the link to this Pokémon and Team Rocket is iconic to say the least (Where the hell is Jesse and James in this set?). It looks like this card is still crashing, so anything below the $20 mark is an awesome deal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For some reason, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmXrE3?object_uuid=b4ff9038-5a7d-4043-9ed2-88ac3ddd5bb4&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Blaziken 101/098</a> is crashing card right now. This artwork is incredible, showing off exactly why this generation three starter Pokémon is a fan favorite. These are usually all traits that go into a Pokémon card having a nice climb, which tells me this is a card to snap up rigt now. It's even playable thanks to it's Infernal Legs attacks, dealing 120 damage to your opponents active Pokémon and another 120 damage to a benched Pokémon. This card could literally snag a trainer two prize cards in one move, which is another reason why it should be worth more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you really want to open boosters of The Glory of Team Rocket despite the price tags and five card count of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-japanese-pokmon-tcg">Japanese packs</a>, go for it. But there's some serious bargains to be had on single cards. Just to note, pricing mentioned in this article are correct at the time of writing. Also, stock may go in and out due to TCG Player being a live secondary marketplace. But that's what makes it fun, right? If you missed the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/score-60-off-a-sams-club-membership-today-only-and-secure-sold-out-pokemon-tcg-sets-at-a-discount">Charizard Sam's club deal</a>, this it might be worth checking back in to see if it's still available.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Pokémon TCG Deals</h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

But their latest breakthrough is perhaps the greatest yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tom, aka <a href="https://ko-fi.com/warhammerworkshop" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warhammer Workshop</a>, the modder behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/massive-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-mod-adds-lore-accurate-classes-a-weapon-previously-locked-to-campaign-and-even-new-operations"><u>Space Marine 2’s excellent Astartes Overhaul</u></a>, signaled the release of 12-player co-op this week and it looks fantastic. Gameplay footage shows multiple players taking on a Tyranid Trygon Prime in a battle reminiscent of an MMO boss fight.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is not something players thought possible, given vanilla Space Marine 2 supports up to three-player co-op only. But the modding team has not only broken through that barrier to hit 12-player co-op — with the support of developer Saber Interactive itself — but has a grand ambition to turn Space Marine 2 into something even better.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Honestly, I’m just kind of in awe of Saber’s support for the modding community,” Tom told IGN. “None of us expected 12-player PvE sessions to be possible this soon — but somehow, here we are. Thanks to their generosity and trust, this huge leap forward is finally here, and it completely changes what we can do.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth pointing out that the mod available right now is just a test — a test that works well, but a test nonetheless. 12-player co-op makes a mockery of Space Marine 2's PvE balance, which you'd expect given there are nine more players taking on the Tyranids and the Thousand Sons than Saber designed the encounters for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But with 12-player now unlocked, modders are building add-ons to make the most of it. Tom told IGN the team is working on modes such as prop hunt, PvP inside operations, “massive” horde mode updates for when the official horde mode finally launches, and, perhaps most exciting of all, raid-style missions “with bosses that hit like trucks, take proper teamwork to bring down, as well as some other completely new mechanics.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Space Marine 2 modding has grown into a significant community, with some 20,000 tinkerers in the main Discord server.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As both a modder and a player, it’s hard not to be excited,” Tom continued. “Huge credit as always to the Saber team for not just making all this possible, but continuing to drop amazing content of their own too, without any of the usual predatory battle-pass nonsense we take for granted in modern titles.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/01/sm2-1746137803550.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Could this 12-player Space Marine 2 mod give us an idea of what to expect from Space Marine 3?</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s an exciting time for Space Marine 2 generally, with the aforementioned horde mode coming soon, a new class in the works, and of course more Operations maps and weapons. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-patch-8-detailed-horde-mode-mechanics-and-map-revealed">Saber recently detailed Patch 8</a>, confirmed some horde mode mechanics, and revealed the map it’s set on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-announced-development-officially-begins-at-saber-interactive"><u>Space Marine 3 is officially in development, too,</u></a> which is no surprise given just how well Space Marine 2 has done. And I'm left wondering whether this 12-player co-op mod might give us an indication of what to expect from the sequel. When Space Marine 3 was announced, we were told to expect "large-scale battles that are even more spectacular." That sounds a lot like upping the co-op player count limit to me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Until we find out, modders will be around to keep things fresh and interesting, and this latest effort is a perfect example of just that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

		<p>Already one of the most celebrated RPGs of recent years, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/sea-of-stars">Sea of Stars</a> is set to get a big new DLC adventure for free next month. Sea of Stars: Throes of the Watchmaker will arrive on 20th May as a free upgrade across all platforms – PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sea of Stars: Throes of the Watchmaker DLC | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tgFi2jXwzVI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Throes of the Watchmaker expands on the inventor known as the Watchmaker that you meet through the main adventure of Sea of Stars. Architect of the Clockwork Castle and the creator of the tabletop game Wheels within this world, he’s now gone and created a miniature clockwork world known as Horloge, which is being threatened by a cursed carnival. So you have to go and get all Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and miniaturise Zale and Valere to delve into this world and put an end to this evil plight.</p>
<p>Through the expansion, Zale and Valere will have a self-contained progression built around completely new classes, skills and combos. Zale will become a skilful juggler, while Valere transforms into an acrobat, fighting alongside new playable party member, the last-wielding sharpshooter Artificer.</p>
<p>As well as having new areas, puzzles and enemies, Sabotage has been able to lavish Throes of the Watchmaker with a cinematics budget equivalent to the main game, so expect some super pretty cutscenes!</p>

<p>Not only that, but the soundtrack will also feature more original songs by guest composer Yasunori Mitsuda (Chrono Trigger), working alongside lead composer Eric W. Brown.</p>
<p>One of the best indie games of 2023, we had plenty of praise for the homage to classic JRPGs. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/31/sea-of-stars-review-a-love-letter-to-jrpgs-of-the-past/">Sea of Stars review</a>, Nic said, “Sea of Stars has clearly been made by people with a deep and abiding love of JRPGs. That level of passion is hard to mimic, and the result is a heavily playable game with morish visuals, a cracking story and deeply considered level design. However, while it is very good, it isn’t quite perfect. Combat needed to be deeper (or at least escapable) and while the dynamism was a great touch, it wasn’t enough to carry it all the way through to the end.”</p>
<p>The game has been well supported over the past year and a half with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/30/sea-of-stars-free-dawn-of-equinox-update-adds-local-co-op-and-more/">major updates</a> that have overhauled combat, revamped the prologue and added local co-op play.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/valves-invite-only-deadlock-has-an-even-more-exclusive-top-secret-hush-hush-build<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Everyone's now heard of Deadlock, the in-development MOBA from Half-Life maker Valve. Maybe you're even playing it, as part of the game's still-invite-only alpha playtest.
</p>
<p>
But are you playing the top-secret even more invite-only version? Probably not. (Although if you are, feel free to get in touch.)
</p>
<p>
The existence of an even more elusive version of Deadlock was spilled publicly last night when a top Deadlock streamer appeared to load up the wrong version of the game, beaming Valve's more-exclusive version to the world. 
</p>
<p>
This version of Deadlock includes a much larger character roster, as well as updated designs for some of the game's current heroes. New faces include the bellhop-styled Doorman, bespectacled Bookworm, and gothic Vampirebat, among many others. 
</p>
<p>
The streamer in question quickly shut down the game and deleted its archived version - but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1kclj5p/streamer_accidentally_leaks_hero_roster_of_a_more/">not before the internet inevitably took screenshots</a>.
</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="316"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1kclj5p/streamer_accidentally_leaks_hero_roster_of_a_more/">Streamer accidentally leaks hero roster of a more "secret" private Deadlock pre-alpha playtest build</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/atahutahatena/">u/atahutahatena</a> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>
Deathlock has been in early playtesting now for over a year, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/images-leak-of-valves-next-game-and-its-an-overwatch-style-hero-shooter">leaks happening pretty much ever since</a>. Valve attempted to keep the game a secret for as long as possible, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-finally-admits-deadlock-exists">ultimately dropped its confidentiality requirement last August</a>, when a Steam page for the game finally appeared. 
</p>
<p>
Since then, though, Valve has simply kept working on Deadlock (and seemingly multiple versions) in the background, keeping the game invite-only. When will it publicly launch? There's still no word.
</p>
<p>
Matt Cox previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deadlocks-biggest-update-yet-marks-a-threshold-moment-nows-the-time-to-grab-yourself-an-invite">checked out Deathlock for Eurogamer</a> back in February this year, and noted how a recent update felt "like a huge leap towards Deadlock's full release, but there's still plenty of time to go, as Valve makes a great game even greater".

            <p>The surprise release of Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered hasn't impacted the sales of French JRPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, its publisher has said.</p>
<p>Sandfall Interactive's game was released last week from publisher Kepler and with support from Xbox, but some feared any success would be overshadowed by the Oblivion release that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">leaked ahead of time</a>.</p>
<p>However, Kepler's senior portfolio director Matt Handrahan has drawn a distinction between the two games, adding "proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all".</p>

<p>"We always knew that Expedition 33 had a very specific identity," Handrahan told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/expedition-33-publisher-elder-scrolls">The Game Business</a>. "When I was in the press, I saw the Western-style RPG and the Japanese-style RPG as having quite different appeals and audiences. I knew plenty of people that would play an Elder Scrolls game that wouldn't necessarily play Final Fantasy and vice versa.</p>
<p>"Also, by the time that we rolled around, we had momentum of our own and we felt pretty confident that we could stand beside it. I think there were other aspects, like the price point we were at and the inclusion in Game Pass… so we knew we would have a lot of interest around the game. We were confident in that. And it went as well as it possibly could have done in our eyes. And, actually, proximity to Oblivion didn't seem to harm us at all. In many ways, I think it just drew attention to quality RPGs that week and everybody was thinking and talking about the genre."</p>
<p>According to data from Ampere, there's a 35 percent crossover between the two RPGs. On Xbox in particular - the number one platform for both games - 55 percent of Clair Obscur players also played Oblivion. Both games were available on Xbox Game Pass at launch.</p>
<p>This crossover percentage drops to 22 percent for Steam players, and 16 percent on PS5. However, average playtime on Xbox has been lower - likely due to players dipping in on Game Pass.</p>

</figure>
<p>Handrahan revealed Kepler didn't sign Clair Obscur straight away, but could see the potential of its battle system.</p>
<p>"My CEO, Alexis Garavaryan, had the most contact with them at [an early stage]," said Handrahan. "He saw the potential in it, but thought there were still some parts that needed a little bit more work. So Sandfall went away, did that work, came back, and on the second time of seeing it, our response was extremely, extremely quick."</p>
<p>When another publisher started looking at the game, Kepler had already snapped it up. "We were straight on top of it," said Handrahan. "If you find a game you like, if you find a game that excites you, you really have to act quickly. There's a lot of good games, but the really remarkable stuff comes along relatively rarely."</p>
<p>He also spoke to the game's promotion during Xbox's Summer Showcase alongside the likes of AAA first party games Gears of War and Fable. "It helped us to kind of claim this AA territory in a much more confident way," said Handrahan. "Because it's a vague space that exists somewhere between small games and extremely big games, and there's a lot of ground that that covers."</p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 hit 500,000 sales in just one day, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-hits-500k-sales-in-one-day">quickly rose to a million copies in three days</a>.</p>
<p>"Outstanding artwork and glorious combat bring Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's bold, painterly world to life," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review">Eurogamer's Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Earlier this week, Moon Studios released the big Breach update for its game No Rest for the Wicked. In early access since May 2024, the action role-playing game received a lot of new content, starting with brand-new quests and new high-quality cinematic animation delivered through 18 new story scenes. The world size has almost doubled thanks to the addition of two new areas, Lowland Meadows and Marin Woods, which also include a dangerous new Blight hazard that players must beware of. There are also two new settlements, Hunter's Vale and Marin Village, and several dark caves to explore.</p>
<p>The Breach update has introduced a new endgame Plague System as well, while the Food and Hunger mechanic has been reworked and Status Effects have been overhauled. Of course, a game like this one is heavily focused on loot. No Rest for the Wicked now offers over 150 weapon options, an increase of 50 compared to launch. This includes new Gauntlet and Wand types. There are also multiple new armor sets and a rework for the Shield. Throughout the campaign, players will encounter several new boss fights (and 3 updated ones), 9 new Plague bosses, 2 new enemy factions, and 9 new critters. Those who really seek a challenge when playing the game can now activate the Hardcore mode, which enables permadeath.</p>
<p>The audio was improved with new music by Gareth Coker and new voice-overs. Moon Studios also touts extensive balance changes, quality-of-life improvements (updated item previews, tooltips), and noticeable performance improvements, including NVIDIA DLSS 4 support, memory usage optimizations, quicker load times, and improved physics. Lastly, the patch features 'hundreds of bug fixes'.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this update hasn't been well-received by No Rest for the Wicked players. Recent user reviews on Steam are 'Mostly Negative' due to a very low 36% score. Hopefully, the developers can get to the bottom of the community's feedback. As noted <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-early-access-hands-on-extreme-potential/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our hands-on report from May 2024</a>, the game's core does have a lot of potential.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Austrian developer is now fully on its own, <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-gets-new-major-update-moon-studios-purchases-publishing-rights-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">having purchased the license back from publisher Private Division</a>.</p>

                <p>After a fairly short spring season, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> is trying something new with battle royale: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-fortnites-star-wars-season-galactic-battle/2900-6518/" data-ref-id="2900-6518">a shortened, five-week season that's all about Star Wars</a>. Unfortunately for us, there's just one little thing getting in the way of us diving into all the new stuff: Fortnite servers are down for maintenance while Epic deploys the new season update. Below, you'll find a rundown on when Fortnite servers should be back online.</p><p>Despite the short length, Season 2 has been pretty eventful, introducing the amazing new Kneecapper and Rocket Drill items, and also adding Sabrina Carpenter as the latest Festival headliner just a few weeks ago. But now Season 2 is done, and the Kneecapper is a thing of the past--but you still can't play just yet. There are many fun activities you can try while you wait, like going outside or sleeping, but that's not what we're here to talk about right now. Let's go ahead and cut to the chase.</p><h2>Fortnite's Star Wars Season start time</h2><p>When Fortnite goes offline to deploy a patch, it usually takes about three or four hours, but a new season launch is much more of a thing than your average update is. For a new season, Fortnite typically goes offline for four hours at minimum, and often longer. Sometimes <em>much </em>longer--Fortnite was offline for 18 hours ahead of the start of Chapter 5 Season 2 last year. If all goes well, you can expect Fortnite to come back online, at the earliest, around 3 AM PT/6 AM ET.</p><p>When Fortnite's servers do return to action, the Star Wars takeover will begin immediately in both battle royale and Lego Fortnite. There will be a new battle pass full of Star Wars skins, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-may-the-4th-brings-star-wars-pass-for-lego-fortnite-and-new-skins-instruments-cars/2900-5337/" data-ref-id="2900-5337">new Lego Pass full of Star Wars</a> builds and a Captain Phasma skin, and very likely some new stuff in the shop as well. For those who don't observe May the 4th, other Epic-made modes like Reload and OG will continue doing their own thing, without any injections of Star Wars content aside from skins that other players are wearing.</p><p>Epic started the hype train much earlier than it normally does for a new season of Fortnite, revealing the Galactic Battle season two weeks ahead of launch at Star Wars Celebration in Japan. Epic typically doesn't reveal a new season until the week of launch.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-keeps-its-fans-in-the-loop-with-overwatch-2-stadium-summer-roadmap<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard Entertainment has unveiled its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/overwatch-2"><u>Overwatch 2</u></a> Stadium roadmap for 2025, teasing some of the heroes and features it plans to add in Season 17, Season 18, Season 19, and beyond.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team behind the pioneering hero shooter dived into the details of its new mode’s past, present, and future with <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24198087/directors-take-past-present-and-future-of-stadium" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a Director’s Take blog post</a> from game director Aaron Keller. It comes with a surprise summer roadmap now that the mode has been available for a little longer than a week, while also clarifying how the mode got its start and how it’s performed so far.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Stadium Gets 7 New Heroes This Summer</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Stadium rollout will press forward when new Damage hero Freja joins its limited roster with a mid-season patch for Season 16, but it’s Season 17 in June that will really kick things up a notch. Junkrat, Sigma, and Zenyatta will be added to the strategic multiplayer mode’s list of playable heroes at this time, bringing along the Esperança Push map and Samoa Control map with them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard will also use this time to further flesh out how Stadium works by adding in things like Unranked Crossplay, new all-star rewards, custom games, additional example builds, and an option to save and share builds. It’s unclear if all heroes and features will arrive at the start of Season 17 or if they will be released throughout the season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Season 18 sends in Overwatch’s gorilla icon, Winston, as a playable character, with Sojourn and Brigitte set to join, too. Route 66 and London maps will also join the pool at this time, as will a Payload Race game mode, which comes with two new maps, a Stadium trials feature, and, finally, the freedom to Endorse your teammates.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Blizzard’s transparency regarding Stadium’s development comes with the assurance that “multiple new heroes,” both from Overwatch 2’s existing roster and characters that have yet to be revealed, will be added to the mode every season. For Season 19 and beyond, a new China map is on the way, with a Draft Mode feature, consumables, item system tweaks, and more also in the works.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/01/ow2-2025-stadium-roadmap-1920x1080-sa04-1746118213808.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Overwatch 2 Stadium summer 2025 roadmap. Image courtesy of Blizzard Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><h2 data-cy="title2">How has Stadium Performed so Far?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Overwatch 2 team also shared Stadium stats that reveal how players have decided to spend their time with Blizzard’s new mode. It’s currently “eclipsing” Quick Play and Competitive, making it Overwatch 2’s most played mode with 2.3 million matches played across 7.8 million hours during launch week alone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It secures the lengthy game mode’s stats at more than double what was seen with Overwatch Classic’s launch week. Other interesting stats crown Lucio as both the hero with the highest win rate and the lowest pick rate, while players have managed to spend 900 billion Stadium Cash when choosing 206 million items for their builds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keller’s Director’s Take touches on a few important details related to the development of Stadium, too. One important note saw the game director confirming the mode has been in development before Overwatch 2 launched. Though the team has touched on this timeline in the past, his comment should help squash prevailing fan theories that Stadium was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-dev-blizzard-welcomes-marvel-rivals-competition-says-its-never-faced-another-game-so-similar-to-the-one-weve-created"><u>born out of Blizzard’s desire to compete with Marvel Rivals</u></a>, which launched December 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keller says Blizzard will keep up the communication going forward, promising to release more insight into Stadium next week with an additional Director’s take. Meanwhile, he also confirms that, while Stadium has entered the discussion as a massively popular addition to Overwatch 2, Blizzard remains committed to maintaining other core experiences such as standard Quick Play and Competitive options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Before signing off, I'd like to reiterate the team’s commitment to the Core modes of Overwatch," Keller clarified. "We’re still pouring as much time, energy and passion into these as we always have. Stadium isn't competing for those resources: it’s giving us more opportunities to deliver Overwatch in a new, exciting way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We can't wait for you to see what's coming there, especially Season 18. It's going to be a banger! Have fun with Stadium and, as always, let’s make a great game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overwatch 2 brought Stadium to players when Season 16 launched last week. It’s part of Blizzard’s ongoing initiative to reinvigorate its player base, which began with an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-reveals-radical-overhaul-of-overwatch-2-including-return-of-loot-boxes-perks-and-third-person-mode"><u>all-encompassing Spotlight presentation</u></a> in February.

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> has surpassed 2 million players, Ubisoft said in a brief announcement. The news comes roughly 15 months after The Lost Crown's release in January 2024, and Ubisoft appears to be teasing a bright future for the series. </p><p dir="ltr">"Well over 2M players by now," Ubisoft said on the Prince of Persia's official X account." You’ve revived the legend. The Prince is back, and believe us--he's just warming up."</p><p dir="ltr">What Ubisoft has in store for The Prince of Persia is anyone's guess, though. The company disbanded The Lost Crown's development team in October 2024 on account of lower-than-forecasted sales, though those who worked on the game were shuffled around to different parts of Ubisoft and not laid off. It's worth noting that 2 million players isn't the same as 2 million sales. The Lost Crown was available on Ubisoft+, Ubisoft's subscription service, and has also been part of the PS Plus Extra and Premium. </p><p dir="ltr">The Lost Crown released to widespread praise from critics, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review-crowning-achievement/1900-6418167/">GameSpot's Steve Watts</a>, who called it "so confident and impeccably crafted that this should simply be the identity of Prince of Persia for the foreseeable future." Ubisoft reportedly rejected Ideas for a Lost Crown sequel prior to breaking up the development team, though the company never confirmed whether that was true.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time/">The Prince of Persia: Sands of Time</a> remake remains in development, apparently on track for release sometime in 2026. Ubisoft first announced the project in 2020, though it was delayed several times, including an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-delayed-indefinitely/1100-6487180/">"indefinite delay" in 2021</a>, and restarted development completely in 2023. It re-entered full production in June 2024, though Ubisoft has said nothing about the project since.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-team-says-stadium-mode-is-very-popular-outlines-future-roadmap/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Blizzard <a href="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/1918062881930711315" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> an updated Overwatch 2 roadmap when it comes to the new Stadium Mode. According to the studio, this is currently the most played game mode by far, eclipsing Competitive and Quick Play modes. There were 2.3 million matches played across 7.8 million hours of Stadium during the mode's launch week, and that's apparently more than twice as much as the previous most popular game mode's launch week (when OW Classic was added to Overwatch 2). In the mode's first week, 900 billion in Stadium cash were collectively earned, and 206 million items were chosen by players during rounds. Ironically, the most successful and yet also the least popular hero was Lucio.</p>
<p>Given the strong interest expressed by fans, Blizzard also took a step back to reveal its development history. Stadium was initially set up as an eight-team tournament that should have been as varied as possible. Each round, players would choose from random upgrades to use in PvP Team Deathmatch or PvE against the AI, losing health if they lost the round. However, it was challenging to develop a coherent strategy or build to counter opponents when decisions were made at random. Now, Blizzard still wants there to be variety from match to match, but it is no longer the top priority. The goal has shifted towards delivering a balanced and competitive mode, while at the same time allowing players to create epic builds through strategic decisions based on the performance and hero combinations of everyone in the match.</p>
<p>Stadium mode will have its builds and Hero balance tweaked in an upcoming mid-season balance patch after Blizzard has collected all the data and feedback. When it comes to new content, the latest hero (Freya) will also be the next to be available in the mode when the midseason patch goes live in Overwatch 2. That's just the beginning, as Blizzard wants to release new heroes on a regular basis to Stadium. Season 17, slated to debut next month, will introduce Sigma, Junkrat, and Zenyatta, in addition to the new maps of Esperanca and Samoa, Custom Games, the ability to save and share builds, and crossplay. It's important to note that this is still a Competitive game mode, which means PC and console players will be in separate groups. However, the developers are looking into coming up with an Unranked mode which could bring everyone together without harming the competitive scene.</p>
<p>Season 18 will land in August, adding Winston, Sojourn, and Brigitte as new Stadium heroes. Players will also find two new maps (New Route 66 and London), the new game mode Payload race, new All-Star Rewards, and the Stadium Trials feature. From Season 19 onward, Overwatch 2 will get a New China map, new heroes with every season, Draft Mode, new consumables, and item upgrades. With Payload race, Blizzard is also adding a new mechanic called Quests, where players will select a random quest that will provide rewards when completed.</p>
<p>Just a couple of months ago, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-adds-in-match-perks-the-biggest-gameplay-innovation-since-overwatch-launched-in-2016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">experimented</a> with adding in-game perks. It seems like they're finally willing to shake up the game's core after a <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzards-steam-debut-stumbles-hard-as-overwatch-2-becomes-worst-reviewed-title/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highly underwhelming launch</a>.</p>

I don't like sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating and it gets everywhere. So I can only imagine how absolutely, overwhelmingly irritating it could be on a planet like Arrakis, where a sandstorm could quite easily kill you. Or, I suppose I don't have to imagine, as that's something you can actually experience in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a>. This is a video we're talking about here though, meaning there are fixes for problems like these. Namely, base building, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/funcom">Funcom</a> showed off in a new video of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> game yesterday.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
When you start out, your base probably won't be all that fancy or useful. If you've got nowhere to store your bike, it'll likely be wrecked by the time the storm's died down. Over time you can build up bigger and stronger bases, which you can do so either by yourself or with friends (or enemies, if you swing that way). You can then align yourself with one of the two main houses, Atreides or Harkonnen, allowing you to build unique structures depending on who you picked.

<p>
On top of that, you can build and craft your own vehicles. I generally loathe when games let me do this as they can often be a bit too complicated, but judging from the trailer it almost looks like putting bits of Lego together, so I'm down to clown. If you've built your base up enough, you can put up shields so it doesn't get damaged, but you'll literally be taxed for this. At least you'll have a garage to store your cool car.
</p>
<p>
Any of your creations and bases can be turned into blueprints that you can share with or even sell to other players. Once they have the blueprint, they can just make the thing instantly. I'm assuming you'll still need some resources to do this, but it looks cool! Kind of reminds me of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's Autobuild feature, albeit a bit more social.
</p>
<p>
As a reminder, if you looked at your calendar today and thought "gee whizz, May's the month I get to play Dune: Awakening", think again, as last month the game caught a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/may-is-no-longer-the-month-of-spice-as-dune-awakening-catches-a-three-week-long-delay">three week delay</a>. That means you'll be complaining about all that sand on June 10th. At least it'll be better sand than it would have been in May!

The roadmap includes information about heroes being added to the Stadium roster, new maps and modes within Stadium, and some stats from players' time with the mode already.</p><p dir="ltr">The newest damage hero Freja will be added to Stadium's limited roster as part of the midseason update for the current season, which Blizzard said is expected to launch on May 20. That will be followed by Season 17 in June, which will see the addition of Sigma, Junkrat, and Zenyatta to the roster. The Stadium roster started with only 17 heroes, as the new mode feature items and powers that you can use to make a build in the mode. These require additional balancing, so Blizzard is slowly adding the full Overwatch roster to the mode. That update will also include two more maps, Esperanca and Samoa, along with the ability to save custom builds and share them. Season 17 will also include cross-play, which hasn't been available in the mode since console and PC players don't share competitive lobbies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4486083-ow2stadiumupdate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486083" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4486083-ow2stadiumupdate.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4486083"></a><figcaption>Freja will be the next hero to join the Stadium roster.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4486083-ow2stadiumupdate.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Season 18 kicks off in August with Winston, Sojourn, and Brigitte joining the roster, along with a new game mode, Payload Race. Payload Race will come with two Payload maps, Route 66 and London, although Blizzard didn't share any details on how the mode will differ from regular payload matches. The roadmap stops at Season 19, simply stating that more maps and heroes will continue to be added to the mode, along with new items.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard also shared that Stadium is currently the most popular mode in Overwatch 2, "eclipsing" Quick Play and Competitive, the two main modes. The mode saw 2.3 million matches played in 7.8 million hours, which is more than twice the amount Overwatch Classic saw when it launched, the previous most popular new mode. Blizzard also shared that Lucio is both the hero with the highest win percentage and the lowest pick rate.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fantasy-ttrpg-defy-gods-brings-duplicitous-deities-to-kickstarter<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new fantasy TTRPG campaign, <em>Defy The Gods</em>, created by Chris Sellers, has hit Kickstarter. Players can play as characters vying for power and romance and create the cast of gods conspiring against them.</p>

<h2>The <em>Defy The Gods</em> TTRPG Campaign</h2>

<p>According to the campaign page, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/hecticelectron/defy-the-gods/description" rel="nofollow"><em>Defy The Gods</em></a>&nbsp; is a sword and sorcery Powered By The Apocalypse TTRPG packed with passionate romance, cursed power, and bold adventure. Its inspirations include <em>Conan</em>, <em>Clash of the Titans</em>, and <em>Princess Mononoke</em>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/defy-the-gods-animal-artwork.jpg?itok=F8qMNEw1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/defy-the-gods-animal-artwork.jpg?itok=mkZztUuA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game is set in a fantasy version of ancient Mesopotamia, one you build at the table. its ancient cities, its pantheon of gods, its untamed wilds, its fate in the Underworld, all are made at the table.</p>

<p>In addition, Defy The Gods, is a game about queer love. It is a game of universal visceral attraction. A game where players can win anyone's romantic interest. Alternatively, you can use that attraction to your benefit, using that attraction to distract or thwart them. In this sense, it is similar to another story of queer love, <em>Thirsty Sword Lesbians</em>.</p>

<p>This queer theming is key to the intended experience of <em>Defy The Gods</em>. This world's pantheon of Gods hates you, and the rulers of the City wish to push your character to the margins. As impressive as your characters are, they will struggle against the forces conspiring against you. Simply living a free life in this context is defiance.</p>

In between adventures, players take on the role of World Forces. These can be City officials or even the gods themselves. In these scenes, players can get the Game Master's imagination rolling with where they want the story to go in these scenes.</p>

However, it also made some people worried that a long-in-development fan mod which also aims to recreate the aging RPG would face legal issues or be overshadowed when it arrives later this year. That doesn’t seem to be the case as Bethesda themselves seem very excited for the project. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196646" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="137" data-playlist="196646,196903,196742" data-current="196646"><div><p>Dragon’s Dogma 2’s New Class Is A Twirling Death Machine</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196646/196646_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22202.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>On May 1, Bethesda published a new developer spotlight video focused on art and development lead Dan Lee.

		<p>The Age of Bhaarat has been revealed by Tara Gaming Ltd, an Indian gaming studio that is aiming to bring Indian tales to the AAA gaming space. It is a studio comprised of some heavy hitters including Nouredine Abboud, the Founder who has previously worked on Ghost Recon, author of the Shiva Trilogy &amp; Ram Chandra series Amish Tripathi, Studio Manager Siddarth Singh, and legendary Bollywood actor Amitabh Bachchan.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Age of Bhaarat: Announcement trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ec0IJ6Z0vgo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Age of Bhaarat takes us to Ancient India and it is a world filled with legends, myths, and monsters. What we know is that players take on the role of a Forest Guardian of Anandpur and they must defend Bhaarat, which is another name for India, from the invasion of the Rakshasa demons. Players will have access to traditional Indian weapons, artifacts, a grapple hook to navigate, and the mystical powers that are imbued within the forest. The landscapes of The Age of Bhaarat are taken from Indian epic tales, with these places open to exploration to learn more about Indian mythology. The game will feature choices for players to make which could tip the scales that will either save the world from the demon invasion, or doom it. You will be able to explore Bhaarat alone or party up and fight together in co-op. Going by the trailer it currently seems limited to two player co-op, but we do not know if that is the final number.</p>
<p>There is currently no release date for The Age of Bhaarat and it is only confirmed for PC at the moment. You can wishlist the game at the following links:</p>
