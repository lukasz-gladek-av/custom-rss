<p>It is no secret that PUBG Mobile is just as popular as its console version, PUBG: Battlegrounds. The game also has its very own ranked mode, which has a large number of players competing to climb through the system every day. But how easy is it to rank up in PUBG Mobile? Here is a list of all the PUBG Mobile ranks and how you can rank up to the top.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-pubg-mobile-ranks">All PUBG Mobile Ranks</h2>



<p>PUBG Mobile has its own set of ranks just like any other competitive game. However, a few of the game’s ranks are a bit different than the average shooter Battle Royale. </p>



<p>Below is a list of all the ranks in PUBG Mobile:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze</strong> (III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Silver</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Gold</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Platinum</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Diamond</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Crown</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Ace</strong></li>



<li><strong>Conqueror</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>PUBG Mobile’s final rank, Conqueror, is made up of the top 500 players in the server you play on, making it incredibly hard to reach. So, how does some a player get to Conqueror?</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-conqueror-in-pubg-mobile">How to Get Conqueror in PUBG Mobile</h2>



<p>Ranking up in PUBG Mobile, like any other Battle Royale, relies heavily on placement points. The longer you stay alive in a match, the more points you earn. Obviously, if you win a game, you will earn the most points. </p>



<p>But placement is not the only way to climb the ranks in PUBG Mobile. Kills are an essential aspect of ranking up in the game, as the more kills you get in a game the more points you end up with. </p>



<p>Even looting and getting assists will help you rank up in PUBG Mobile.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-points-needed-to-rank-up">Points Needed to Rank Up</h2>



<p>Below is a list of all the points needed to move up a rank in PUBG Mobile:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze:</strong> Below 1500</li>



<li><strong>Silver:</strong> 1500 – 1999</li>



<li><strong>Gold:</strong> 2000 – 2499</li>



<li><strong>Platinum:</strong> 2500 – 2999</li>



<li><strong>Diamond:</strong> 3000 – 3499</li>



<li><strong>Crown:</strong> 3700 – 4199</li>



<li><strong>Ace:</strong> 4200 – 4699</li>
</ul>



<p>Will you be trying to hit Conqueror in PUBG Mobile?</p>

"Once we're out, we're out," a spokesperson said. Valve also confirmed that it has set aside stock "proportionally" across each region where the system will be available. To be able to buy one of the new Steam Decks, users have to have made a purchase on Steam before November 2024 and be in "good standing" with the company. Valve is limiting orders to one unit per account.</p><p>The new Steam Deck OLED: Limited Edition White will be available in the US, Canada, UK, Europe, and Australia, as well as Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea.</p><p>Around this time last year, Valve launched a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-deck-oled-preorders-go-live-next-week/1100-6519053/" data-ref-id="1100-6519053">translucent Steam Deck OLED</a> as an "experiment" of sorts to see if people would be interested in different colors. Valve said the answer was a resounding yes, and that's why the white version is now on the way. For the translucent OLED model in 2023, it only shipped in select regions (the US and Canada). But the new white edition will ship everywhere Steam Deck does.</p><p>"We're curious to see what the response is, and will use what we learn to inform future decisions about any potential new color variants down the line," Valve said.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1852209345" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

<p>Halo Infinite has a bit larger ranked system compared to other video games, with quite a few levels within each rank. However, this just adds to the thrill of trying to rank up in the game. Here are all the Halo Infinite ranks and how you can hit the final rank, Hero.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-halo-infinite-ranks">All Halo Infinite Ranks</h2>



<p>Below is a list of all the ranks in Halo Infinite in order from worst to best:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Recruit</strong></li>



<li><strong>Bronze</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold</strong></li>



<li><strong>Platinum</strong></li>



<li><strong>Diamond</strong></li>



<li><strong>Onyx</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hero</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Progressing through the ranks listed above is a bit different of a system compared to other games. Let’s break it down.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-progress-through-halo-infinite-ranks-and-hit-hero">How to Progress through Halo Infinite Ranks and Hit Hero</h2>



<p>Hitting Hero in Halo Infinite is no easy feat. There are quite a few different ranks you have to climb through before getting there. Each main rank is broken up into the following smaller ranks. Below is a list from worst to best:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Cadet</strong></li>



<li><strong>Private</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lance Corporal</strong></li>



<li><strong>Corporal</strong></li>



<li><strong>Sergeant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Staff Sergeant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gunnery Sergeant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master Sergeant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lieutenant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Captain</strong></li>



<li><strong>Major</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lt. Colonel</strong></li>



<li><strong>Colonel</strong></li>



<li><strong>Brigadier General</strong></li>



<li><strong>General</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The game’s Military-styled system applies to all ranks except Recruit and Hero. To hit Hero, you must climb through the entire ranking system. To do so, all you have to do is play the game’s Ranked mode. </p>



<p>Losses will push you back in rank while wins and high-kill games will skyrocket you forward. Every player’s rank is also showcased on their individual profile, letting other players know just how good they actually are at the game.</p>



<p>Special events, like Double XP, do not count towards your rank progression, however. What’s even more interesting, is one’s rank does not apply skill-based matchmaking. You will be playing with random ranks as you progress through the game’s levels.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-next-limited-edition-steam-deck-oled-comes-in-white-and-will-be-available-globally-this-time.1033098/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-limited-edition-steam-deck-oled-comes-in-white-and-will-be-available-globally-this-time<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> – which is like a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> but better in almost every way – is getting a new, if potentially more smudge-susceptible Limited Edition. A successor to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-deck-oled-is-out-now-and-ready-to-ship-immediately">translucent version</a> that only went on sale in the US and Canada last year, the Steam Deck OLED: Limited Edition White offers both a snowy look and, for those of us outside North America, the chance to actually buy one. It’ll go on sale November 18th, in all the countries that the Steam Deck currently ships in.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The white-and-grey makeover will set you back £599 / $679 / €719, so it’s a few notes more than the 1TB Steam Deck OLED it’s functionally identical to. But you would get the <em>exclusive</em> ability to protect your Deck from thieves by camouflaging it against a stack of printer paper, or to pair it more effectively with a boat-ready pair of summer chinos. It’s bundled with a white carrying case, too.</p>

<p>All the same, I’m probably not gonna go for this. Besides being perfectly happy with my bog-standard, goth-shaded Steam Deck OLED, I’d immediately develop a deep paranoia over marks, scuffs, and melted chocolate stains blemishing that pristine exterior. But if you’re the sort that thinks all consumer electronics should look like the iPod, it’s there, albeit temporarily. Limited means limited in this case, and once the initial round of stock sells out, it’s gone forever. Better be ready at 3pm PST / 11pm GMT on the 18th to grab one when they launch.</p><p>If you do end up missing out, take comfort in knowing that a successful Limited Edition White could lead to more vibrant Steam Deck recolours in the future. “We're curious to see what the response is, and will use what we learn to inform future decisions about any potential new colour variants down the line,” said Valve comms chief Kaci Aitchison Boyle in a statement.</p>

<p>Said missive also confirmed that Valve are involved with "ongoing work toward the future of Steam Deck and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-arm64-game-testing-points-towards-new-steam-hardware-if-vaguely">other hardware plans</a>", though you can probably expect new colours for the existing models before a full-on Steam Deck 2. That’s still not coming for some time, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-wont-sacrifice-battery-life-to-deliver-a-more-powerful-steam-deck-2">according to Valve’s engineers</a>, who want to “wait for a generational leap” in computing performance before committing to a whole new handheld.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
After a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-delay-hits-nintendo-theme-park">six month delay</a>, Universal Studios Japan's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country">Donkey Kong Country</a> themed Super Nintendo World expansion finally has an opening date. It'll be barrel-blasting open its doors from 11th December, and if you're curious to see what's in store, you can now watch Nintendo's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> take a tour of the area, with a brief pause to bonk on some bongo drums.
</p>
<p>
A Donkey Kong themed expansion to Universal's Super Nintendo World theme park area was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-expansion-coming-to-super-nintendo-world">officially announced in September 2021</a>, just months after the opening of its main Mushroom Kingdom-themed area (although it had been spotted on mock-ups long before). At the time, Universal teased it would feature "interactive experiences and themed merchandise and food", alongside a new coaster - and we've now had our best look yet at the finished thing.
</p>
<p>
Miyamoto toured the Donkey Kong Country expansion in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8OtALOr8JI">special ten-minute-long Nintendo Direct</a>, beginning by whisking players through the now unsealed warp pipe toward the rear of the Mushroom Kingdom. As park visitors navigate its length, its red brick walls transition to rocks before the pipe opens out into a jungle-themed expanse of swaying palms, faux wooden walkways, and even Donkey Kong's iconic treehouse. And looming over the whole area is its imposing centrepiece, the Golden Temple, housing a new coaster ride.
</p>

<p>
Before getting to that, though, Miyamoto spent some time showing off the area's (admittedly not especially enthralling) other features, including the Jungle Beat Shakes shop where visitors can buy hotdogs and other assorted food; Funky's Flay 'n' Buy, where a range of Donkey Kong themed merchandise can be perused and purchased, plus Donkey Kong's Treehouse, where patrons can grab their Donkey Kong photos ops.
</p><p>
Additionally, there's a three-player bongo-themed rhythm game where players must follow along to blinking lights in order to rouse Rambi the rhinoceros from his slumber inside a crate. "If there isn't a place to play bongo drums," Eurogamer's Tom Phillips wrote back in 2021, "I'll be disappointed." Tom's bongo-based dreams have finally come true.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, Universal's Donkey Kong Country area utilises the same Power Band system seen in the Mushroom Kingdom part of the park, and band wearers can explore their surroundings in search of Donkey Kong's familiar orange letter blocks, collecting them all in the Universal app. All of which finally took Miyamoto to the sprawling Golden Temple, where - as detailed by a couple of Cranky Kong and Sqawks animatronics - visitors can ride its Mine Cart Madness coaster in a bid to help protect the Golden Banana from Tiki Kong.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, today's Nintendo Direct didn't show much of the coaster at all, beyond brief peek at its barrel-themed lift hill, but we do know - thanks to various theme park fan sites over the years - it features a unique ride system designed to give riders the illusion their carts are leaping over sections of broken track, while the real track is concealed below.
</p>
<p>
You can take a virtual tour of Universal Studios Japan's new Donkey Kong Country expansion in video above, and those able to attend in person can do so from 11th December this year. Alternatively, the area will be included as part of Universal's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/universal-floridas-super-nintendo-world-park-gets-may-2025-opening-date">new Epic Universe theme park in Florida</a>, which opens on 22nd May 2025.

            <p>Valve has announced the Steam Deck OLED: White Edition.</p>
<p>This new version of the handheld PC launches on 18th November, but if you want one, be warned: only a limited number will be available ("Once we're out, we're out," Valve says).</p>
<p>"Last year, we released a smoky translucent limited edition Steam Deck OLED as an experiment to find out if there was interest in alternative colourways (there was!). This is our second experiment along those lines," Valve explained, sharing a look at the upcoming Steam Deck.</p>

<p>"The difference this time (aside from the colour!) is that we're able to ship the Limited Edition White to all regions where Steam Deck already ships," the company continued. "We're curious to see what the response is, and will use what we learn to inform future decisions about any potential new colour variants down the line."</p><p>Valve said it has been "super happy with the reception of Steam Deck" since the team first launched the LCD version back in 2022. "We've always said our intent is to continually work on improving Steam Deck, and that's true from both a software perspective (continuing to ship improvements) and a hardware one (Steam Deck OLED, as well as ongoing work toward the future of Steam Deck and other hardware plans)."</p>

<p>The Steam Deck: White OLED features all the same specs as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-deck-oled-review-a-beautiful-display-upgrade-and-so-much-more">Valve's Steam Deck OLED 1TB model</a>. Keeping with the white theme, it will arrive with a white carrying case and white microfiber cleaning cloth. It costs £599/$679, and those interested will be limited to one unit per account. "These accounts must have made a Steam purchase before November 2024 and be in good standing to be eligible," Valve said.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/11/bored-why-not-have-some-fun-and-design-a-car-park-in-parking-world/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Anything can be a game these days: Squirrel with a gun? Sure. Pigeon dating sim? Yep. Power washing a garage? A mega hit! Binary Impact and publisher Aerosoft have decided that car parks are not getting the love they deserve and have created a game specifically for that experience.</p>
<p>Parking World is a builder and economy simulator which provides a “dynamic experience” where players will focus on the creation, design and management of parking lots big and small, as well as the facilities around them. You can see in the trailer that you can go in to the smallest detail including working out all the pipes for the toilets.</p>


<p>Car parks <em>and</em> plumbing – what could be sexier?</p>
<p><iframe title="Parking World | Release Trailer | OUT NOW" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C94XnE2rPE4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>“Take on the role of a parking lot management professional. With both quests and freeplay mode, one can start their journey creating modest parking areas in support of local entrepreneurs, and expand their operations to include vast, multi-level parking facilities to serve malls and cities, should government officials grant you the job,” say Aerosoft. “The game challenges players to master planning, space and economic strategies, ensuring each parking venue operates smoothly regardless of the events or influx of users it encounters.”</p>

<p>The game has launched today on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2551570/Parking_World_Build__Manage/">Steam</a> for PC in Early Access for 19,99€ with a 10% discount during first week after release.</p>

In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/10/24293054/super-nintendo-world-donkey-kong-country-area-direct-showcase-theme-park">a Nintendo Direct today</a>, the company gave the first proper look at the <em>Donkey Kong Country-</em>themed expansion for the theme park, which includes a mine cart rollercoaster and a real-life, three-player version of the <em>Donkey Konga</em> rhythm game. The expansion opens on December 11th.</p><p>To get to the new area, attendees go through a tunnel seemingly made with rocks, that leads to a jungle-themed locale. There’s a towering tree house, a golden temple spewing steam, and lots of banana-flavored deserts. And just like in the games, you can find — and collect — giant letters hidden around the area using the park’s NFC bracelet. Naturally, there are now Donkey Kong-themed wristbands to collect as well. Also, there’s an animatronic Cranky Kong. If you missed it live you can check out the full presentation in the video embedded at the top of this article.</p><div><p>Nintendo first announced the park expansion in 2021, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697850/super-nintendo-world-donkey-kong-area-confirmed">with plans to open this year</a>. And while the stream today featured the Japanese version of Super Nintendo World, the company has previously said that all of the attractions in both Osaka and Los Angeles — including the Donkey Kong section — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/2/24147170/universal-orlando-super-nintendo-world-donkey-kong-country">will be part of the Super Nintendo World in Orlando when it opens next year</a>.</p></div><div><p>The theme park expansion is all part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23608700/super-nintendo-world-entertainment-miyamoto-takahashi-interview">Nintendo’s larger plan to become an entertainment company beyond just gaming</a>, which also includes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review">its foray into feature films</a>. The news also follows a string of reveals and launches from Nintendo over the past few weeks that span a surprising range of experiences. In early October, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/27/24256070/nintendo-museum-kyoto-tour-shigeru-miyamoto">the first Nintendo Museum opened in Kyoto</a>, and that was followed by the launch of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24273422/nintendo-alarmo-review-alarm-clock">the Alarmo alarm clock</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275596/nintendo-switch-online-beta-playtest-program-leak-mmo">an online test for a mysterious MMO</a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/5/24288201/nintendo-music-streaming-hands-on-impressions">a music streaming app</a>.</p></div><div><p>Of course, this all comes as fans await news of the company’s next console, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276650/nintendo-switch-2-predictions-playtest-alarmo">the long-awaited follow-up to the Switch</a>.

There’s a mind-busting appearance of multiple Avengers flying around in mech suits before they combine into one badass-looking <em>Power Rangers</em>-esque Megazord after Sam Wilson alters one of the most iconic Marvel lines ever when he says, “Avenger...assemble!” That alone needs time, not only to process what a machine with the combined powers of Avengers like Rambeau and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-character-x-men-avengers-fantastic-1851614564&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-character-x-men-avengers-fantastic-1851614564">Shang-Chi</a></span> with the Ten Rings can do, but what otherworldly force is strong enough to require this sort of over-powered behemoth to take it on.</p><p>One of those adversaries will undoubtedly be Spectral Vision, also known as White Vision, who makes his first appearance in a Marvel TV show since flying off during his battle with the Vision that Wanda Maximoff created in the Hex in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/wandavision-just-pulled-out-a-few-shockingly-big-guns-1846205601?_gl=1*17nhyd0*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTM1OTk0OS4xMDAuMS4xNzMxMzYyMjEzLjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/wandavision-just-pulled-out-a-few-shockingly-big-guns-1846205601?_gl=1*17nhyd0*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTM1OTk0OS4xMDAuMS4xNzMxMzYyMjEzLjYwLjAuMA.."><em>WandaVision</em></a></span>.

<p>Looking to rank up in Street Fighter 6? The popular fighting game has dominated the video game market since its release back in 2023 and has quite an immersive ranking system. Here is a list of all the Street Fighter ranks and how you can climb them quickly. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-street-fighter-ranks">All Street Fighter Ranks</h2>



<p>Here is a list of every rank in Street Fighter 6 from worst to best:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Rookie</strong></li>



<li><strong>Iron</strong></li>



<li><strong>Bronze</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold</strong></li>



<li><strong>Platinum</strong></li>



<li><strong>Diamond</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>So, how does a player climb through these ranks to hit Master?</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-progress-fast-through-street-fighter-ranks">How to progress fast through Street Fighter ranks</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Every game has its own ranking system, some more unique than others, and Street Fighter is no stranger to uniqueness when it comes to its popular ranked system.</p>



<p>Here is how you can move up and down in the official Street Fighter ranked system:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Rookie</strong>: Players get a win streak bonus. No LP loss on defeat.</li>



<li><strong>Iron, Bronze, Silver and Gold:</strong> Players get a win streak bonus. No league demotion. One-time rank-down protection.</li>



<li><strong>Platinum and Diamond:</strong> No win streak bonus. League demotion enabled. One-time rank-down protection.</li>



<li><strong>Master:</strong> No win streak bonus. No league demotion.</li>
</ul>



<p>Each rank consists of five smaller ranks that players will have to climb before moving to the next. One good game in Silver will not progress you immediately to Gold.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-hit-master">How to hit Master</h2>



<p>Climbing to Master in Street Fighter is no easy feat. In fact, quite a few gamers never even hit Platinum or Diamond. The game requires a heavy amount of dedication for those looking to make it all the way to the final rank.</p>



<p>With league demotions playing a factor in Platinum and Diamond, it can be easy to go backward when trying to achieve the rank of Master. You will have to consistently win matches if you want to make it all the way to the final rank.</p>



<p>Will you be trying to hit Master in Street Fighter?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/wipeout-futurism-art-history-book<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There's a new book out called<a href="https://www.thamesandhudsonusa.com/books/wipeout-futurism-the-visual-archives-hardcover" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>WipeOut Futurism: The Visual Archives</em></a>, and having recently made my way through it I'm here to tell you it is one of the finest video game books I've ever read. And I've been collecting books like this for a very, <em>very </em>long time.</p><p>Now shipping to the homes of its first online customers--and releasing everywhere else in early 2025 (though <em>very </em>early customers<a href="https://vol.co/products/wipeout-futurism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> got a fancier edition a while back</a>)--it's a thick, hardcover art book that covers the entire <em>WipeOut</em> series, with particular emphasis on the first few games, since that's where so much of the most important design work was first done.</p><p>In terms of traditional art book stuff, it's great. There are loads of examples of early ship designs and sketches of <em>WipeOut's </em>stages; even more importantly, there are as many glorious, double-page spreads of the game's iconic branding (famously done in collaboration with Designer's Republic) as you could hope for.</p><figure><figcaption>Where was this when I needed it in the 90s</figcaption></figure><p>As someone who, as a teen in the 90s, once dragged his dad into his office on a weekend just to download a Feisar wallpaper for my old desktop--<a href="https://aftermath.site/indulge-us-behind-the-scenes-of-aftermaths-branding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and who now has a website with a heavy <em>WipeOut </em>inspiration behind its own logo</a>--I was in heaven flipping through every page of this compendium.</p><p>It's so much more than just an art book, though. In addition to all the logos and storyboards there's a ton of genuine history behind the series, not just told by those who were there, but shown to us in the form of letters, faxes and scribbled notes detailing the creative process behind the game's creation, Designer Republic's involvement and even<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjGEuEokb1M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the process of putting <em>WipeOut</em>'s famous soundtrack together</a>.</p><figure><figcaption>These letters and faxes from the first game's development are a historical treasure</figcaption></figure><p>If there was ONE GAME in the history of this entire medium I would want this kind of access to, this kind of peek behind the curtains, it's this one, so to actually get to hold this book in my hands felt wild. As a <em>WipeOut </em>fan it doesn't just indulge my love of the series; it elevates it and takes it to new places by teaching me things I'd never known until now.</p><p>I'm grateful for all the work put in here by author Duncan Harris: for the collection of images, yeah, but also the history. That’s something too few video game art books are ever interested in, and which is thankfully immortalised here in print for this generation--and future generations--to enjoy.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Crowbar Collective, the team behind the infinitely successful remake of Half-Life named ‘Black Mesa’ has revealed an all-new cooperative shooter – Rogue Point. This intense shooter boasts tactical elements and a roguelite structure, with the squad at Crowbar Collective stressing that each mission has ‘hundreds of ways to play’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-black-mesa-to-rogue-point">Black Mesa to Rogue Point</h2>



<p>This is the first new release for Crowbar Collective in over ten years if you don’t count the definitive edition of Black Mesa that dropped on Steam in 2020.</p>



<p>Black Mesa has been a roaring success since day one, securing more than 100,000 reviews on Steam with an overall rating of ‘Overwhelmingly Positive’, so there’s already a strong foundation there for what comes next. To publish Rogue Point, Crowbar Collective has partnered with Team 17, just to give the project an even more solid backing.</p>



<p>In Rogue Point, players are pitted against tough and varied enemies across a range of maps. These environments will change with each new engagement, and the gameplay has been described as ‘constantly evolving’. With each match, players will need to manage their economy mechanics, upgrade their operators, and strategise with teammates.</p>



<p>It’s a campaign-based cooperative title that plays almost like a round of Counter-Strike, which is pretty innovative.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>







<p>There are plenty of options for customisation, and on the surface, Rogue Point looks like a great shooter – but the proof will be in the inevitable test phases that’ll be pushed out before long. Presently, the game is slated to be released in 2025 in early access, and we know that it has been in development since at least 2022.</p>

            <p>
Fornite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-season-looks-to-bring-back-sharks-and-midas">is doing it</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/apex-legends-season-23-takes-you-back-to-the-beginning-with-launch-royale">is doing it</a>, and now <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> is looking to tweak nostalgia nubbins by having a nostalgic throwback season of its own - specifically to celebrate the series' eighth anniversary this year - and it'll include the return of 6v6 games.
</p>
<p>
Blizzard has discussed resurrecting 6v6 matches for Overwatch 2 since July, when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-2-exploring-reintroduction-of-6v6-in-a-series-of-upcoming-tests">admitted</a> the switch to 5v5 had come "at the cost of match variety and player freedom". Later, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-2-is-testing-the-return-of-6v6-next-season-and-blizzard-will-be-watching-the-results-closely">laid out more definite plans for 6v6's return</a>, confirming it would be holding "two different 6v6 tests" as part of Overwatch 2's Season 14 in December. Obviously, though, it's not yet December, and Blizzard has confirmed 6v6's imminent return as part of its <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24146047/">newly announced limited-time Overwatch: Classic mode</a> is "separate from our broader 6v6 plans".
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>: Classic runs from tomorrow, 12th November, to 2nd December, and consists of a series of events featuring Overwatch's original heroes, abilities, and maps. While Blizzard is teasing the "fast paced and frantic gameplay of the 2017 Moth Meta [and] the triple-tank, triple-support style of 'Goats'" further down the line, things kick off with a mode inspired by Overwatch's version 1.0 release back in May 2016.

<p>
This is set to feature Overwatch's original line-up of 21 heroes, its first 12 maps, plus "many abilities that haven't been seen for years and all the chaotic gameplay from that era". Heroes will be grouped by their original classes but can be deployed as players see fit, and, for the funsies, there'll be a No Hero Limits rule for the "first few days" - although single hero limits will be implemented for the remainder of this first Overwatch: Classic event.
</p><p>
Additionally, expect all four original game modes to be playable once things get underway, split across their correlating maps: Assault (Hanamura, Temple of Anubis, Volskaya Industries), Escort (Dorado, Route 66, Watchpoint: Gibraltar), Hybrid (Hollywood, King’s Row, Numbani), and Control (Ilios, Lijang Tower, Nepal). However, despite Blizzard's nod toward nostaligic versimilitude (all but default skins will be disabled, it notes maps in the event will appear as they do in other Overwatch 2 game modes.
</p>
<p>
And should you end up enjoying the nostalgic blast of Overwatch: Classic, Blizzard indicates the event won't just be a one-off. "While we're not planning for this to be a single event," it explains, "we will be measuring player response to inform our future plans."

This will include the story, its system, and a better look at its 72 plastic demon miniatures. The press release does state the game is heavyweight, so be prepared to make room on your shelf.</p>

<p>Furthermore, the campaign will include stretch goals. These goals will be determined by choices made by the supporters, shaping the outcome of the game.</p>

<p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/shin-megami-tensei-v" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Shin Megami Tensei</em></a> is one of Sega's longest-running RPG series. It debuted in 1992 on the Super Famicom, set in an apocalyptic Tokyo overrun by demons. The protagonists of the games can summon and use these demons as allies, fighting greater demons and gods, all while grappling with the conflicting values of order and chaos. It even has a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/shin-megami-tensei-ttrpg-finally-gets-english-localization" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">TTRPG adaptation</a>.</p>

These include the <em>Devil Summoner</em> series, which features strategic grid-based tactical gameplay, and the party-based <em>Digital Devil Saga</em>.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/persona-3-reload" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Persona</em></a> series. This series keeps certain gameplay elements but are narratively lighter experiences. Each entry focuses on a group of teenagers balancing mundane life with facing supernatural threats in alternate dimensions. It has become so popular it is less a spin-off of Shin Megami Tensei and more a sister series.</p>

That happens.” Nothing more, nothing less. </p><p>The anonymous source who leaked information on Johnson’s pee proclivities explained the 52-year-old megastar did so in order to save time on set. But, allegedly having a production assistant or someone from his team dump it out may have rubbed the cast and crew the wrong way. Since Johnson was somewhat curt in his admission, we’d need an op-ed from one of the people who actually handled his container of urine entitled “Between The Rock and His Pee Place” to get to the bottom of this.

While Johnson admits he has been late, he calls the eight-hour tardiness a “bananas amount” that is inaccurate. Evans attempted to massage the truth a bit by saying Johnson’s lateness was predictable enough for them to factor it into the production schedule, before he altogether says he wouldn’t even call what Johnson did as being late. It sounds like Johnson is so irreplaceable to a film that he is allowed to live by the famous Nas lyric from his song “Can’t Forget About You”: “Never on schedule, always on time.” </p><p>Honestly, when a man has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://screenrant.com/dwayne-rock-johnson-box-office-hits-flops-reality/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://screenrant.com/dwayne-rock-johnson-box-office-hits-flops-reality/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">grossed over $12 billion</a></span> at the box office, a little pee and a later start to the work day should be no big deal. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>About halfway through yesterday afternoon, my usual Sunday ritual of having a few beers while watching the Chicago Bears implode was mixing with the conclusion of three days in front of a camera raising money for charity: sleepy Patrick. Heck, after I dropped my kids off at school, I poured out the cup of coffee I had in my hand and, instead, went to bed. I'm trying to ignore the mild headache that's bouncing around my skull, which, right now, I'm attributing to sleep debt. </p><p>But briefly: thank you. We've been hesitant to bring back Save Point for a number of reasons, but the stars aligned this weekend and, for a brief moment, it felt like the old days. That we've been able to keep that fire burning bright within this new era is special, and that translated into raising a ridiculous amount of money for a good cause. My great thanks to everyone who watched, donated, and supported us.</p><p>-pk, who is absolutely loving the new season of <em>Arcane</em> so far</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>HOA</em> – I'm rebooting my home office, and brought in the full crew to talk through what we should do with the tiny white room I call my office. We'll be doing a stream soon, where we use some fancy software to try and build the office in real-time, so that I can start buying the equipment for it.</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Remap Recommends</em> <em>— </em>The response to the first one was so great that we're doubling up on the idea. In the middle of the month, though, we'll be opening the field to whatever we're watching/reading/listening to. Video game recommendations will still come at the end of the month. And yes, I know people have asked for a podcast version of this article. I'm thinking about it.</li><li><strong>STREAM:</strong> <em>Wheel of GeForce Now</em> – It's back, baby!</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Remap Radio</em> – We'll  debrief on Save Point a bit, but I've also gained access to a PlayStation 5 Pro. Here are brief impressions from setting it up in my family room: well, it looks smaller. (I haven't played anything.)</li><li><strong>ARCHIVE:</strong> Cado will soon split up the Save Point segments into individual video archives, but in the meantime, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTbM52Fro5pvPGsc59Ex56h8GQWb4AOBL&amp;ref=remapradio.com">we do have first two full days up, complete with timestamps</a>. We learned over the course of this stream that YouTube has a hard cap of 12 hours, which means we're making a part one/part two of the third day. It'll be available sometime in the next 24 hours, worst case scenario.</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details on the issue to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Free Fire Announces Collab With Football Anime Blue Lock]]></title>

<p>In an effort to reach a larger audience, developer Gerana has unveiled a collaboration between its free-to-play battle royale title, Free Fire, and the ever-popular football anime Blue Lock. The Free Fire x Blue Lock collab will introduce in-game content straight from the Japanese anime series, with items, iconic jerseys, emotes, and other cosmetics that players can unlock and equip. The entire collab runs between November 20 and December 8, so it’s an extremely limited-time event you won’t want to miss!</p>



<p>For long-time fans of the animated series, you’ll be happy to learn all about Isagi’s Spatial Awareness and Nagi’s Trapping emotes, available as unlocks during the collab, that you can use mid-round in the battle royale game.</p>



<p>While emotes certainly prove interesting and can shake up the battlefield experience, it’s the cosmetics that most people seek from these collaborations. For the Free Fire and Blue Lock collab, you can expect the following:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Weapon Skins</strong></li>



<li><strong>Vehicle Skins</strong></li>



<li><strong>Avatars</strong></li>



<li><strong>Banners</strong></li>



<li><strong>Isagi’s Team Z Costumes</strong></li>



<li><strong>Nagi’s Team V Costumes</strong></li>



<li><strong>Football Uniform Costumes</strong></li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-what-is-blue-lock">What is Blue Lock?</h2>



<p>If you’re a long-time fan of Free Fire but don’t yet know about Blue Lock, let us enlighten you on the truly exceptional anime. It’s a highly-rated series out of Japan, focusing on the Japanese Football Association. The JFA launches a secretive training program designed to test the country’s best football players to the extreme, with each challenge resulting in the weakest member of the team being eliminated. Only one prospective player can win the training regimen and earn a place on the team vying for the World Cup. </p>



<p>With an average rating of 4.8 on Crunchyroll and an astounding three seasons to catch up on, Blue Lock continues to bring in new and returning fans, making this collab with Free Fire a surefire success for Garena!</p>



<p>Are you a fan of Free Fire? Do you prefer Blue Lock? Either way, discuss them at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming community forum</a>!</p>

<p>November 20 is proving a big day for gaming fans, with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nier-automata-photo-mode-coming-stellar-blade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NieR: Automata DLC coming to Stellar Blade</a> on the same day, along with a photo mode and a huge update to the action-packed adventure!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-classic-announced-new-mode-2016-release-blizzard<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Overwatch 2 is taking a page from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/05/14/world-of-warcraft-classic-preview">WoW Classic</a> and returning to the beginning, announcing a brand-new Overwatch Classic mode featuring the original 21 heroes and 12 maps from the 2016 release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The nostalgia mode, which launches Tuesday and continues over the course of three weeks, will feature key moments from Overwatch history, Blizzard says. It'll begin with the original 1.0 version from launch, with no limits on which characters you can pick, meaning you can theoretically have a team full of tanks or Torbjörns. And yes, it will be 6v6, though Blizzard says it's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/blizzard-is-looking-at-bringing-6v6-back-to-overwatch-but-it-wont-be-easy">unrelated to its experiments with bringing the format back to Overwatch 2</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Overwatch Classic is separate from our broader 6v6 plans. Overwatch Classic is meant to be a nostalgic experience, taking heroes, players, and the game back to moments in the game’s history for limited time events," Blizzard explains in its official <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24146047/a-blast-to-the-past-begins-with-overwatch-classic/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FAQ </a>about the event.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overwatch Classic's gameplay will largely match up with the original game's mechanics, with characters regaining their original abilities and Ultimates charging up much more quickly. However, maps like Dorado, Numbani, Route 66, and Watchpoint: Gibraltar will retain their changes from Overwatch 2, including match timing and how elevator platforms work.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the event progresses, Blizzard plans to progressively layer in changes, including single hero limits. Future updates will return to "popular moments in the game's history," with Blizzard citing the 2017 Moth Meta — in which Mercy was one of the most powerful characters — and the triple-tank, triple-support style of "Goats" as two examples. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/11/overwatch-2-classic-1731353883370.jfif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The first part of Overwatch Classic will let players choose any character they want with no restrictions. Image source: Blizzard.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans for their part have been generally positive about the news. Over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1gox6jy/classic_overwatch_trailer/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a>, one player joked, "Mass rez is back, I'm scared mom come get me." Others are asking for it to be a permanent arcade game mode, though Blizzard is being cagey about its plans for the future, saying it plans to measure player response.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overwatch Classic officially commences on November 12 and will continue until December 2. It'll be playable as a mode within the standard Overwatch 2 client, and will not include legacy features like loot boxes, the original UI, or the Competitive mode. Available modes include Assault, Escort, Hybrid, and Control.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat. Have a tip?

"Just nominated for my fourth Grammy in a row," he said. "So thrilled to be nominated alongside [Silverman] for our co-arrangement of Last Surprise from Persona 5 for The 8-Bit Big Band. Long live video game music."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last Surprise has been nominated for Best Arrangement, Instruments and Vocals and is up against the likes of John Legend's Always Come Back, Willow's Big Feelings, and more. The winner will be announced on February 2.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of Persona 5 will be familiar with Last Surprise because, as mentioned, it is the main battle theme of the 100 hour plus role-playing game. Those who've played through even a small portion of it will therefore recognise its jazzy beats, and it's also featured in Persona 5: Dancing in Starlight and Persona 5 Strikers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Persona 5 arrived in 2016 and, despite its critical acclaim, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-5-royal-review">with the enhanced version being dubbed a masterpiece in IGN's review</a>, developer Atlus hasn't released another entry since.
