Seeing as the game has just released in the West, it's likely we'll see at least one new code in the coming days.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning: Major Spoiler For Death Stranding 2: On The Beach Follow</strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hideo Kojima returns us to a world of porters, BTs, BBs, Voidouts, and more with the release of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. As you’d imagine, it’s a story filled with complex terminologies, philosophical concepts, metaphysics, and more, but we’re here to help you make sense of it all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, whether you finished the sequel and need help understanding the full picture of the ending, or just looking to see how Hideo Kojima’s newest adventure unfolds, here’s our full Ending Explained for Death Stranding 2: On the Beach.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Setting the scene</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Death Stranding 2 picks up 11 months after the events of the first Death Stranding. Following the successful connection of the former United States to the Chiral Network (this world’s magical internet that is helping the world rebuild following the apocalyptic titular Death Stranding), defeating the terrorist leader Higgs, and preventing his sister Amelie from destroying the world, Sam Porter Bridges attempts to settle into a quiet life with his daughter, Lou. But that idea is quickly brought to a halt by the reappearance of former accomplice Fragile and her new company, Drawbridge, when she asks Sam to head south and get Mexico back on the grid.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Upon connecting Mexico to the Chiral Network, it’s discovered that linking together a country appears to open a Plate Gate (a giant teleportation portal) to other continents. This is vital because after the events of the Death Stranding, civilization is still largely separated from each other, and Plate Gates would go a long way towards making Earth one interconnected society again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But as Sam completes his Mexican mission, tragedy strikes when a mysterious armed group in red invades Sam’s home and kills Lou and injures Fragile, sending Sam into a depressive spiral over the loss of his child. Lost, he agrees to join Drawbridge and the crew of its ship, the DHV Magellan, on a mission to connect Australia, the destination of the Mexican Plate Gate.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Who are the Armed Red Attackers?</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/09/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-pre-order-trailer-mp4-00-04-50-00-still020-1741556559513.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">You got red on you. Credit: Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Knowing who attacked Lou and Fragile is the first step to understanding the ending of Death Stranding 2. The group in Red are mechanical soldiers 3D printed by a reborn Higgs, who, after the events of the first game, killed himself on his Beach only to come back as a glam rock mercenary robot hellbent on getting revenge on Sam and Fragile. This is why he attacks her and Lou.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Higgs didn’t just come back to life by himself. His soul was revived thanks to an entity known as APAS, a private corporation that manages the automated delivery robots transporting packages around the UCA. Their goal is to connect Mexico and later Australia to the Chiral Network to open even more Plate Gates and eventually link up the whole world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But behind the scenes, APAS is actually run by a sentient entity known as APAS 4000, which is the fusion of the APAS AI system that manages deliveries and 4000 human souls from people who were killed in a massive Voidout. Their ultimate goal is to elevate all humans into souls, preventing humanity from evolving and instead keeping them trapped in the world of the dead, stopping them from triggering another Voidout ever again. A benevolent, but ultimately misguided attempt to try and contain humanity from once again exploring the world and making connections with one another. It would keep Earth’s population safe, but at the cost of what makes them human, changing people further into digital entities in the shape of their saviors.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>How Sam Defeats APAS 4000</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/09/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-pre-order-trailer-mp4-00-05-53-20-still054-1741556849891.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Who is this charismatic...doll? Credit: Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a game of cat-and-mouse, APAS 4000 believes it is using Sam to further its goal of one day containing humanity from ever leaving their shelters ever again. But behind the scenes, Fragile’s Drawbridge knows about this plan and is working to stop APAS 4000. Fragile and Drawbridge’s benefactor, who is eventually revealed to be former President of the UCA, Die-Hardman, as well as the crew of the DHV Magellan, were in fact connecting various settlements in Australia using a new Q-Pid. This device would sever the connection between the world of the living and the dead, and by extension, cut off APAS 4000’s connection to the world due to it being an entity made up of dead souls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">By fully connecting Australia with the new Q-Pid, APAS 4000 is split from the world of the living, and its plan to trap humanity fails.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Wait, but what about Higgs?</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/09/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-pre-order-trailer-mp4-00-06-42-07-still038-1741556559514.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Higgs returns. Credit: Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While Higgs may have been brought back by APAS 4000 to try and push along its plans, Higgs is by no means a lackey. Instead, Higgs uses his newfound robot body to carry out a separate, more personally fuelled plan of revenge. It was he who attacked Fragile and Lou while Sam was busy reconnecting Mexico, and eventually it’s revealed that Higgs plans to finish what he started in the first Death Stranding game and bring about the end of the world via “The Last Stranding”. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whereas in the first game, Higgs tried to use the Extinction Entity known as Amelie to trigger the earth-ending event, this time he tries to use Tomorrow, a young woman Sam recovers from the world of the dead, who has mysterious powers that allow her to use tar to speed up decay. By using Tomorrow as an Extinction Entity, Higgs’ plan is to once and for all end human life, killing Sam and Fragile in the process. While Sam manages to defeat Higgs and finally end his apocalyptic fantasy via a combo of samurai sword duelling, electric guitar battle, and good ol’ fashioned fistfight, Higgs does succeed in completing one of his goals…</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Fragile Dies</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/09/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-pre-order-trailer-mp4-00-04-17-25-still015-1741556559512.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A hero's death. Credit: Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For much of Death Stranding 2, we’re made to think thatFragile survived the attack by Higgs, but Lou died. In reality, Fragile used her trans-dimensional teleportation powers to send Lou to the world of the dead, while Fragile was the one killed by Higgs. Because time dilation and the distinction between life and death are all kinds of messed up in the world of Death Stranding, the Fragile that Sam and the DHV Magellan crew have been travelling with the entire game is actually Fragile’s soul that she temporarily left behind to help Sam and the crew defeat Higgs, stop APAS 4000, and reconnect the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, her time in the world of the living is only temporary, and she dies for real at the end of the game. But what about Lou?</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>BB-28/Lou/Tomorrow/Louise</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/19/master-00-11-14-22-still038-1750343168751.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Who is she? Credit: Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As it turns out, Lou was spared in the attack by Higgs in Mexico as Fragile used her powers to send Lou to another beach, effectively another dimension. Sent away by Fragile, Lou grew up in the world of the dead as manifested by the soldier Neil Vanna (more on him later). Years later, Sam Porter Bridges will end up fighting Neil in this world and inadvertently rescue Lou, who is none other than Tomorrow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s right, Tomorrow is in fact the same baby Lou that Fragile sent away at the start of the game. Lou, short for Louise, is also BB-28 that Sam traveled across the UCA with in Death Stranding, and more than that, is actually Sam’s biological daughter.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>The Neil, Sam, and Lucy Love Triangle</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/06/death-stranding-blog-1749244480461.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Vana. Neil Vana. Credit: Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, now we explain the final puzzle that ties all of Death Stranding 2 together. So Louise survives Higgs’ initial attack in Mexico and grows up to become Tomorrow. But why did Higgs want Lou in the first place?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s because decades ago, Sam, who I should remind you is a Repatriate — someone who can resurrect themselves thanks to the effects of the Death Stranding — was in a relationship with a therapist named Lucy. Around this time, Lucy was seeing another patient, a man named Neil Vana, who was a smuggler working for Bridges to deliver illegally acquired brain-dead pregnant women whose stillborn babies would become the very first Bridge Babies. Wracked with guilt, Neil sought the help of Lucy, who, it turns out, saved Neil when they were both children from the same village under attack by BTs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reunited after all those years, Neil rekindles a relationship with Lucy that becomes romantic even though Lucy was in a relationship with Sam at the time. Despite Neil and Lucy’s close relationship, Lucy chose to stay with Sam, and together they conceived a child.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, a baby born from a Repatriate like Sam held high value for Bridges, who were still conducting their original experiments with BBs. Once they discovered Lucy’s pregnancy, Bridges sought to take the child from her.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To protect the unborn baby Louise, Lucy convinced Neil to pretend to be the father of the child, making the baby less valuable to Bridges. Together with the baby, they would escape the city and Bridges, but would sadly never make it that far as both Neil and Lucy are killed, but not before Louise is removed from Lucy’s dying body, thus saving the baby. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Louise becomes BB-28, but is thankfully hidden away by Sam’s adoptive mother and President of the United States, Bridget Strand, keeping her hidden long enough to be reunited with Sam decades later during the events of the original Death Stranding.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Neil, his final act of revenge against Bridges is for his body to necrotize, therefore causing a Voidout and destroying the city and everyone in it. Meanwhile, Neil’s soul wanders the earth, unable to find peace. Similar to  Mads Mikkelsen’s Cliff in the first game, Neil’s mercenary soul haunts Sam until the two men face off in a destined duel that finally gives Neil peace and Sam closure with Lucy.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Post-credits scene, and will we get a Death Stranding 3?</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/25/vs-youtube-deathstranding2onthebeachendingandfinalbossfight4k-6911-1750884722656.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Will there be a Death Stranding 3? Credit: Kojima Productions</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But that isn’t quite the end of the revelations. Yes, Death Stranding 2 does have a post-credit scene, and it features a seemingly even more grown-up Tomorrow/Louise dressed up in full porter gear, as well as inheriting Fragile’s creepy second set of hands and her smoking habit. She’s faced with a Plate Gate, perhaps signalling that she’ll follow in her father’s steps and attempt to connect another new continent to the Chiral Network. Could Death Stranding 3 have us going to Europe, Asia, or Africa, for example? And could we be playing as Tomorrow in the sequel? We certainly wouldn’t say no to playing around with her unique tar-infused martial arts skillset.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s the full ending of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach explained.

<p>But it will support 12 players online</p>

<figure><a title="Drag x Drive" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/83b515fc5533b/drag-x-drive.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo is bringing out a new "fast-paced" multiplayer game this August called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>, where players will be able to "shoot hoops" with the Switch 2 Joy-Con 2 dual-mouse controls.</p>
<p>Following the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendo-confirms-the-release-date-for-drag-x-drive-on-switch-2">release date announcement</a> earlier this week, the eShop listing for this upcoming title has now revealed this "3-on-3" sports title will actually support double this amount online, bumping the fun up to 12 players. Details about this have not been provided just yet.</p>
<p>While this is exciting news, local multiplayer will apparently be restricted to just one player. So even if you have an extra set of Joy-Con 2 or someone nearby who is ready for a local wireless session across two units, it seems you'll still need to team up online with an active Switch Online subscription. If we hear any changes or updates about this, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Nintendo's page listing for Drag x Drive also reconfirms TV mode and Tabletop mode will be supported. You can find out more about Drag x Drive in our previous coverage here on Nintendo Life.</p>

<p>Update on the Switch 2 today</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/54b79c38cdbff/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has been rolling out game updates every week since the Switch 2 arrived earlier this month, and we've now got a new patch for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
<p>This follows a small patch last week and bumps the game up to Version 1.1.2. It comes with some general adjustments and also resolves some more issues you may or may not have encountered during the game's races.</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown via Nintendo's official support page:</p>
<h3>Mario Kart World - Ver. 1.1.2 (Released June 25, 2025)<br></h3>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Adjusted courses selected in “Random” when selecting next course in a wireless “VS Race.”</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Made readjustments to fix an issue where rate fluctuations were sometimes displayed incorrectly in “Online Play” and “Knockout Tour.”</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where you sometimes can’t recover quickly after falling off the course in "Dino Dino Jungle".</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where you continually hit the wall near the finish line of “Boo Cinema” when transformed into Bullet Bill.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Dataminer 'OatmealDome' has shared <a href="https://x.com/OatmealDome/status/1938057415347343870">what else is going on behind the scenes</a> in this latest Mario Kart World update:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Random option can now also pick from the options you are given (i.e. courses with an intermission) in version 1.1.2. It *can* still choose to teleport everyone to a random course with 3 laps."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This follows an update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a> yesterday. Nintendo has also updated <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a> this week.</p>

<p>Shoot some hoops this August</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Earlier this week, Nintendo surprised us with an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendo-confirms-the-release-date-for-drag-x-drive-on-switch-2">update about the release date</a> of the 3-on-3 sports game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>, confirming it would be arriving on the Switch 2 this August.</p>
<p>Adding to this <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/drag-x-drive-switch-2-eshop-price-revealed">was a price reveal</a> and now in another update, we've got what appears to be the game's estimated file size. According to Nintendo's official store listing it will require a download of 1.7GB.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, it's nowhere near the size of the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart</a> game and is instead closer to the file size of Nintendo's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Welcome Tour</a> eShop title.</p>
<p>Once again, pre-orders are live for $19.99 (or your regional equivalent) and you can pre-load the title, so you'll be able to play it as soon as it launches.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 comes loaded with a total of 256GB storage, which is a huge step up on the Switch's internal space, but if you are running out of space, you can always <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-microsd-express-cards-for-nintendo-switch-2">expand your storage with a microSD Express card</a>.</p>

Oddly enough, you're not actually catching these fish. These just mark the area where you'll be reeling in Pals and other in-game items.</p><p dir="ltr">You have the potential to catch both new and existing Pals in the game. To get started, you'll need a fishing rod and some bait. Then, head to the water and cast your line near a school of fish. A minigame will occur once a "fish" takes the bait. This game is similar to fishing in Stardew Valley, where you have a fishing meter and need to keep a green bar near the fish to successfully reel them in.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, you can also catch even more Pals by building and placing fishing ponds inside your base. We'll cover details on the fishing ponds below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4521808-fishing.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521808" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4521808-fishing.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521808"></a><figcaption>Fishing in Palworld</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4521808-fishing.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_craft_fishing_rods">How to craft fishing rods</h2><p dir="ltr">There are various fishing rods that you can craft at various levels, and here we'll break down the requirements for each.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Beginner_Fishing_Set">Beginner Fishing Set</h3><p dir="ltr">Available at technology level 15, the beginner fishing set costs 2 points to unlock.

There are several bait types you can use: Simple Bait, High Quality Bait, Deluxe Bait, and Alluring Bait.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Simple_bait">Simple bait</h3><p dir="ltr">Simple Bait is unlocked when you purchase the beginner fishing set. This is the most basic bait type for fishing for Pals. This is a decent starting point for fishing, but it won't be very effective in luring Pals to bite.</p><p dir="ltr">To craft, you'll need the following materials:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">2 Pal Fluids</li><li dir="ltr">4 Berries</li><li dir="ltr">2 Flour</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="High_Quality_Bait">High Quality Bait</h3><p dir="ltr">High Quality Bait is available at technology level 22, and it can be unlocked for 1 point.

This bait has several benefits, as it lures in Pals, improves the minigame, and increases the number of items obtained from earning. This includes Pals and salvage items.</p><p dir="ltr">To craft, you'll need the following materials:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">10 High Quality Pal Oil</li><li dir="ltr">1 Cavern Mushroom</li><li dir="ltr">3 Carrots</li><li dir="ltr">5 Flour</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Once you've unlocked a bait type, it can then be crafted at the High Quality Workbench.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4521810-fishingpond.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521810" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4521810-fishingpond.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4521810"></a><figcaption>Fishing pond at base</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4521810-fishingpond.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_use_fishing_ponds">How to use fishing ponds</h2><p dir="ltr">You can build fishing ponds at your base so your Pals can fish, too. You'll need to craft some bait to place here and assign a Pal to fish for you. Not every Pal can fish, but you should have quite a few options by the time you're high enough level to unlock them. You'll need to assign someone who can use their hands, which means you'll need a handiwork Pal like Anubis, Lyleen, or Katress.</p><p dir="ltr">These ponds have the potential to catch new and existing aquatic Pals, as well as in-game items such as gold and gems. These items can be collected from the cooler sitting next to your fishing Pal.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Fishing_pond">Fishing pond</h3><p dir="ltr">The first Fishing Pond is found at technology level 31, and it can be unlocked for 3 points.</p><p dir="ltr">To build, you'll need the following materials:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">40 Wood</li><li dir="ltr">5 Cement</li><li dir="ltr">10 Pal Fluids</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Large_fishing_pond">Large fishing pond</h3><p dir="ltr">This larger pond makes it possible to catch even larger Pals than the standard pond.

Just place an aquatic Pal in your party and make sure you've crafted a saddle for them. Use your fishing pole to reel in various items, such as Pal Souls, Gold, and gems.</p><p dir="ltr">Salvage spots in the sea are marked by floating bits of wood and barrels. You'll obviously need a fishing pole equipped, but bait isn't necessary. You simply need to interact with the floating junk to start a minigame. This is different from the fishing minigame, and instead, you'll see a ring that requires you to stop a spinning marker inside a highlighted green area.</p><p dir="ltr">Palworld's <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1937709560053285318" rel="nofollow ">patch notes</a> for the update state you can also salvage a new metal from the sea to use in upgrading your weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">Personally, I haven't caught any metal yet.

It's likely a magnet that will pull the new metal type and other high-end items from the sea.</p><p dir="ltr">The Powerful Fishing Magnet is available at technology level 61, and it costs 3 points to unlock.</p><p dir="ltr">To craft, you'll need the following material:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">1 Hexolite</li></ul><p>For more Palworld guides, make sure to check out how to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-change-a-pals-gender-and-passive-skills-in-palworld/1100-6532740/" data-ref-id="1100-6532740">change a Pal's gender and passive skills</a>, how to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-transfer-pals-to-different-worlds-in-palworld/1100-6530261/">move Pals to different worlds</a>, and how to<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-upgrade-palworld-schematics-to-better-rarities/1100-6530263/"> upgrade your schematics</a>.</p>

Capcom has said the livestream will last about 40 minutes.</p><p dir="ltr">Here are the start times for different time zones:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">3 PM PT</li><li dir="ltr">6 PM ET</li><li dir="ltr">11 PM BST</li><li dir="ltr">8 AM (June 27)</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr">What to expect</h2><p dir="ltr">While there is always a small chance for surprises, Capcom has announced the four games that will be featured in the livestream. Those games are Monster Hunter Wilds, Resident Evil Requiem, Pragmata, and Street Fighter 6.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6532378/">Resident Evil Requiem</a> was announced during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Games Fest 2025</a>, and now Capcom is planning to show off more of it during the stream. Some outlets, including GameSpot, got to see an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-9-requiem-hands-on-preview/1100-6532336/">extended demo of Resident Evil Requiem</a>, which could be shown here to the public. It's also possible that Capcom has even more to show, since Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 26, 2026</p><p dir="ltr">Pragmata got a new trailer at Summer Game Fest along with a 2026 release window. GameSpot played a hands-on demo of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pragmata-hands-on-juggling-gunplay-and-puzzles-gets-surprisingly-tense/1100-6532386/">puzzle-shooter</a> at Summer Games Fest, and it seems possible Capcom could show off more gameplay here. Considering Pragmata got its 2026 release window just a few weeks ago, it seems unlikely that a more specific date will be announced during the Capcom Spotlight.</p><p dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Wilds, which currently has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-on-pc-is-seeing-fewer-players-than-world-as-negative-reviews-continue/1100-6532587/">overwhelmingly negative reviews</a> on Steam due to ongoing performance issues, will likely see announcements of new content updates, including potential upcoming events or new monsters. While there will most likely be a Monster Hunter Wilds expansion announced at some point in the future, it is probably too soon for that to be revealed.</p><p dir="ltr">Capcom recently announced the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/street-fighter-6-adds-sagat-c-viper-and-two-more-characters/1100-6532220/" data-ref-id="1100-6532220">DLC fighters coming in Year 3</a> of Street Fighter 6--Sagat, C. Viper, Ingrid, and Alex--but Sagat, the first character to be released, doesn't have a release date just yet. There will likely also be other updates, like new cosmetics and perhaps a showcase of the new fighter.</p><p dir="ltr">With the showcase running for about 40 minutes, it seems like there won't be much time for additional announcements. However, Capcom has unveiled a classic game collection or two at past showcases, so never say never.</p>

Improved textures and lighting, as well as an audio experience that’s been completely remastered from the ground up, are just the start of what was outlined for players on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X | S. Nintendo Switch, however, was left out of the lineup entirely.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dying Light: Retouched - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN reached out to Techland to ask about a potential Dying Light: Retouched update for Nintendo Switch and if it’s something players can look forward to in the future. A representative for the studio tells us it’s not in the cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Dying Light: Retouched Update is not coming to Nintendo Switch,” Techland explained in an email exchange.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dying Light first arrived for Nintendo’s original hybrid gaming platform <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dying-light-nintendo-switch-platinum-edition"><u>in 2021 as an all-encompassing Platinum Edition bundle</u></a>. It’s unclear how this version fared in terms of sales, but we do know its performance was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/german-ban-of-dying-light-on-nintendo-eshop-affects-multiple-countries" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>affected by a ban in Germany</u></a> that has rendered it unavailable to purchase digitally through the Switch eShop across Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those hoping that Retouched or a similar update could instead arrive for Nintendo Switch 2 are also out of luck. For now, Dying Light is only playable on Nintendo’s new hardware via backward compatibility.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“When it comes to a Switch 2 port of the original Dying Light: We have no plans at this moment,” Techland tells us. “We're currently fully focused on delivering <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dying-light-the-beast"><u>Dying Light: The Beast</u></a> on August 22, 2025 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.

There’s no word on when or if it will ever be released.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Dying Light: The Beast, a spinoff that puts players back in the shoes of original protagonist Kyle Crane, is set to leave out Nintendo platforms when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-set-for-august-with-gameplay-trailer-at-summer-game-fest-2025"><u>it launches for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X | S August 22</u></a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you plug the world’s best-reviewed webcams into the Nintendo Switch 2 today, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/682008/which-webcams-work-with-nintendo-switch-2">they won’t work, while many comparatively ancient webcams do</a>. Why? That’s been a mystery for the nearly three weeks since the handheld launched. Now, two companies say they’ve figured it out and are pledging to update the firmware on their cameras.</p><p>Here’s a possibly oversimplified answer: today’s more powerful webcams advertise many different modes that they support to any device you connect via USB — but <em>that’s a problem</em> because the Nintendo Switch 2 appears to be choosing modes it can’t properly play.</p><p>In the case of Elgato, which will update its non-working Facecam MK.2 and Facecam Neo, the solve was adding an additional low-resolution 480p mode, <a href="https://x.com/JFest/status/1937966174429712886">with Elgato general manager Julian Fest speculating</a> that the Switch can only reliably support “very low resolution” cameras in order to put <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TZZ1akN8V8">multiple facecams on screen</a>.</p><p>But low resolution by itself isn’t the answer — as you’d probably expect, given that Nintendo’s own official Switch 2 camera is a 1080p camera that genuinely broadcasts a 1080p mode (we checked), and given it’s far from the only 1080p or higher camera that works with Nintendo’s new Switch.</p><p>Accessory company Ugreen tells <em>The Verge</em> that the technical details of making a camera work with the console are far more nuanced than resolution, or frame rate, or whether you have the enhanced bandwidth of USB 3 or the far slower USB 2.</p><p>Nor is it enough for the camera to support a single compatible UVC (USB Video Class) mode. Instead, Ugreen spokesperson Gabrielle Wang explains by email, the camera needs to <em>avoid</em> advertising modes or protocols that the Switch might not recognize, or that it might attempt to use but fail, after you plug it into the console.</p><p>Ugreen says three different conditions <em>all simultaneously </em>need to be met for a camera to work with the Switch 2:</p><div><ul><li><span>“The camera must not use the HID protocol.”</span></li><li><span>“The camera must be configured for Isochronous transfer mode.” (<a href="https://www.regami.solutions/post/isochronous-isoc-vs-bulk-choosing-right-transfer-mode-usb-cameras">As opposed to Bulk</a>, which can be more resource intensive.)</span></li><li><span>“The USB endpoint descriptors must not include unsupported low frame rate settings (below 30 fps).” More on that one in a sec.</span></li></ul></div><p>Unfortunately, you’re not likely to find any of those “specs” on a camera’s box or in its marketing materials, but but they are things you can check with a connected PC and <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/usbview">a tool like USBView</a> — and in so doing, <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZXg6qfvBkS5nhfzY6-ABoEp1RraYqh6s2VvPpLfByi4/edit?tab=t.8dlf1ievxdr9">we can see</a> the camera incompatibility situation is more nuanced than a single factor.</p><p>Elgato’s Facecam MK.2, for instance, already advertises isochronous modes to connected devices as far as I can tell, and it doesn’t advertise an HID interface. In fact, it appears to already offer a 480p mode as well.</p><p>But Elgato’s camera may have broken Ugreen’s third theoretical rule — it tells connected devices like the Switch 2 that it’s capable of running as low as 5 fps at a variety of different resolutions, according to the USB Device Descriptors I’ve viewed. Ugreen says that the Switch 2 may prioritize lower settings, “but if the camera hardware cannot actually output at such low frame rates, it will cause a failure.”</p><p>It wouldn’t be surprising if Ugreen had an easier time figuring this out: though none of Elgato’s webcams worked with the Switch 2 at launch, Ugreen had the benefit of discovering that some of its models did, while others did not.</p><p>Ugreen says its CM826 / 55512, CM797 / 45644, and CM825 / 75330 cameras will have updates by the end of June, while the CM678 / 15728, CM778 / 35626, CM717 / 25442, CM825 / 55721, and CM831 / 65381 already work.</p><p>But I wonder if this should solely be the responsibility of camera companies — PCs, for example, don’t generally have this same trouble picking from a webcam’s list of supported video modes. Perhaps Nintendo will address the webcam compatibility situation, globally, with an update of its own.</p><p>Nintendo didn’t have a comment for our story.</p><div><p><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andru-marino">Andru Marino</a> contributed to this story.</em></p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/report/693182/nintendo-switch-2-webcam-mystery-1080p-480p-uvc-iso-bulk-ugreen-elgato]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>When Epic first revealed and launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>'s popular new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-new-blitz-royale-mode-comes-with-a-free-skin/1100-6532511/" data-ref-id="1100-6532511">Blitz Royale mode</a> on June 17, it came with an expiration date of July 15. But it didn't take long for the company to deliver an extension.. Blitz Royale has consistently been Fortnite's most popular mode in the week since it launched, and on Wednesday, Epic updated the Fortnite API with <a href="https://x.com/FN_Assist/status/1937960260406296938" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">four additional weeks of Blitz Royale</a>. The new end date is apparently August 12.</p><p><a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1937963962600939740" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Leakers believe</a> they already know the themes Epic will give to each of the additional weeks: Jujutsu Kaisen, Mortal Kombat, and Dragon Ball. Blitz Royale is currently having Avatar Week, which will be followed by Boss Week next Tuesday, and then TMNT Week after that. Each of these weeks will feature weapons and items related to the theme--for the current Avatar week, for example, the loot pool is full of the bending scrolls that were in standard Battle Royale during Chapter 5 Season 2, and TMNT week will bring back each of the turtles' melee weapons from Chapter 5 Season 1. </p><p>Blitz Royale is a quicker and smaller version of Fortnite's battle royale, with 32 players on a tiny map, and rounds that last under five minutes. It's a faster and furiouser version of Fortnite, and it caught on immediately. If Blitz Royale continues pulling in tons of players, it's very likely that Epic will make it a permanent mode eventually. This initial launch period may be about seeing how Blitz Royale affects the overall Fortnite ecosystem. Since all seems to be going well on that front, we expect it won't stay away long if it actually does leave on August 12.</p><p>As it is, Blitz Royale will definitely need some overhauls. For one thing, the initial storm circle is the same in every round, always cutting off the northern part of the island. Secondly, Blitz Royale deserves its own fresh map, because the current Blitz map is just a smaller version of the Reload Venture island, and that in turn was just a smaller version of the Chapter 1 OG island. We've already wasted enough of our lives fighting over Pleasant Park and Retail Row, thank you very much.</p>

            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-1-gets-free-audio-and-visual-enhancements-this-week-but-they-wont-be-coming-to-switch</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
It's a big year for Dying Light; the open-world zombie series is celebrating its tenth anniversary, and developer Techland is marking the occasion with a variety of projects. That includes a newly detailed audio and visual refresh for the series' debut instalment, which arrives in a free update - titled Dying Light: Retouched - this Thursday, 26th June.
</p>
<p>
"One of the best things about working with your own engine is that the people building it are just next door," Techland <a href="https://dyinglightgame.com/news/ten-years-later-still-going-strong-dying-light-retouched-update-releasing-june-26">explains on its blog</a>. "Over the past couple of years, we've added a lot, customised a lot, and learned how to squeeze more from the tech we already have. One day, someone just started applying those learnings to some old assets - and it just clicked that we could do that across the whole game."
</p>
<p>
As such, players can expect increased texture resolution and quality, as well as improved lighting and physics-based rendering. Techland also promises a new 8K Ultra shadow quality ("a lot of surfaces that previously looked rather flat now really pop out and get depth!", it writes), and there's an increased maximum level-of-detail option for those with hardware to support it, meaning Dying Light's most detailed assets can now be seen much further away.

<p>
As far as audio goes, original composer Paweł Blaszczak has remastered Dying Light's soundtrack for the update, while new tracks and ambient sounds have been "woven in" throughout. That's alongside "seriously juiced up... hit reaction audio in combat", which is said to sound "more satisfying [and] more impactful."
</p>
<p>
Techland does, however, take great pains to stress that Dying Light's Retouched update is all about "enhancements" and is "not a complete overhaul or remaster." Additionally, the "level of changes" players can expect will "vary by platform".
</p>
<p>
Dying Light: Retouched launches Thursday, 26th June for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S. Notably absent from that list is the original Switch, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-dying-light-on-switch-another-mobile-miracle">received an impressive port of Dying Light back in 2021</a>, and Techland has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dying-light-retouched-update-isnt-coming-to-nintendo-switch-as-techland-denies-plans-for-switch-2-port">confirmed to IGN</a> the update is "not coming" to Nintendo's platform. Don't expect a version of Dying Light for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> either, as Techland says it has "no plans [to release one] at this moment."
</p>
<p>
Instead, it's apparently all-hands-on-deck for the studio's upcoming 18-hour standalone adventure, Dying Light: The Beast, which launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 22nd August. And there's more planned for the series beyond that; Techland <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/techland-teases-multiple-unannounced-dying-light-projects-including-board-games-and-a-webcomic">previously revealed it's working on "multiple unannounced projects"</a> that "go beyond video games", including board games, a webcomic series, merchandise, and "more".

The list of titles on the chopping block includes heavy hitters like <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/hades/hades-review-the-highs-and-lows-of-repetition">Hades</a>, the Monument Valley series, and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/deaths-door/deaths-door-review-reaping-the-rewards">Death’s Door</a>.</p><p>On July 15, 22 titles, which require a Netflix subscription to play, will exit the service. Some games, such as Hades, were only available on mobile devices through Netflix, so it’s unclear if they’ll become available on other mobile storefronts. Although July 15 is the removal date, some titles will disappear before then (such as Hades, exiting on July 1). Here’s the full list of games making their exit:</p><ul><li>Battleship</li><li>Braid, Anniversary Edition</li><li>Carmen Sandiego</li><li>CoComelon: Play with JJ</li><li>Death’s Door</li><li>Diner Out: Merge Cafe</li><li>Dumb Ways to Die</li><li>Ghost Detective</li><li>Hades (available only on iOS)</li><li>Katana Zero</li><li>LEGO Legacy: Heroes Unboxed</li><li>Ludo King</li><li>Monument Valley</li><li>Monument Valley 2</li><li>Monument Valley 3</li><li>Rainbow Six: SMOL</li><li>Raji: An Ancient Epic</li><li>SpongeBob: Bubble Pop F.U.N.</li><li>TED Tumblewords</li><li>The Case of the Golden Idol</li><li>The Rise of the Golden Idol</li><li>Vineyard Valley</li></ul><p>Netflix’s entire mobile library consists of 114 games, which means roughly 20 percent of its library is disappearing. While this isn't the first time games have been delisted from the mobile library, these removals come as some question Netflix Games' long-term future.</p><p>Last October, Netflix <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/netflix-has-closed-its-aaa-gaming-studio-133014946.html">shut down its triple-A game development studio</a> in Southern California, leading to the departures of several high-profile talents only a few months after the company <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/netflix-games-engagement-tripled-in-the-last-year-in-part-thanks-to-gta">expressed optimism</a> about its games division. In January, the company <a href="https://www.whats-on-netflix.com/news/netflix-abandons-release-plans-for-6-games-including-tales-of-the-shire-dont-starve-together-and-compass-point-west/">canceled plans </a>to bring previously announced titles to the service, including Thirsty Suitors, Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game, and Don't Starve Together.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Jurassic World Evolution 3</em> is, by most measures, an authentically promising-looking game. You get to build your own Jurassic Park, a dream we’ve all had at some point or another while succumbing to our own hubris. This time around, the series is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2958130/Jurassic_World_Evolution_3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">simulating 75 dinosaur species</a> across generations, with traits both beneficial and pernicious getting passed on to dino-youths. There are “distinct female, male, and juvenile variants” with “unique social needs” and “brand new behaviors.” All that painstaking effort, and yet developer Frontier was planning to take the easy way out with non-prehistoric park partners – until recently.&nbsp;</p><p>Earlier this month, prospective players noticed an AI disclosure on <em>Jurassic World Evolution 3</em>’s Steam page. "Scientists' avatars are created using generative AI," it read. This led to <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2958130/discussions/0/599654768975026771/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hundreds of negative comments</a> across multiple Steam threads, the kind of storm some developers would opt to try to wait out. As of this week, however, Frontier is singing a different tune: “Thanks for your feedback on this topic,” reads <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2958130/discussions/0/599654768975026771/?ctp=16#c599656262950498876" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a post on the game’s Steam forum</a>. “We have opted to remove the use of generative AI for scientist portraits within <em>Jurassic World Evolution 3</em>.”</p><p>Confusingly, some have suggested that <em>Jurassic World Evolution 2</em> also used AI for scientist portraits, though the game’s Steam page includes no such disclosure. Then again, the game came out in 2021, before Valve began requiring developers to take this specific tack where AI is concerned. Aftermath reached out to Frontier for more information but did not receive a response as of this publishing.&nbsp;</p><p>In any case, this is a more or less optimal outcome compared to, for example, <a href="https://aftermath.site/ark-aquatica-ai-trailer-snail-games-studio-wildcard-youtube" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple companies on another dinosaur-themed game playing hot potato with accountability</a> for hacky use of AI that serves no one, least of all the people pouring their blood, sweat, and tears into the rest of the video game.</p><p>"Good,” one Steam user replied to the devs’ post about removing generative AI from the game, “I'm sure you can afford an artist to create them for you. It's not like <em>Jurassic Park</em> is a small IP."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/roblox-sexual-exploitation-of-children-lawsuit-safety"><h3>Roblox Accused Of Allowing Sexual Exploitation In Four Separate Lawsuits</h3></a><p>All four — and more reportedly incoming, lawyers say — are filed by the same law firm</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/jurassic-world-evolution-3-ai-removed]]></content:encoded>

Although Nintendo became widely known in the early '80s for arcade hits like Donkey Kong, the company's first foray into gaming came in the early '70s with lightgun games. Since the launch of the Nintendo Entertainment System in North America in 1985, Nintendo has remained a major player in gaming.</p><p>The Nintendo Museum already has exhibits that celebrate the history of Nintendo's video games, as well as a selection of minigames that visitors are allowed to play. During <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/my-visit-to-the-nintendo-museum-made-my-life-flash-before-my-eyes/1100-6526764/" data-ref-id="1100-6526764">GameSpot's two-day visit to the museum in 2024</a>, Dan Ryckert noted that it "is light on text, descriptions, placards, and other traditional elements of a museum." He added that the room with fully-functional giant controllers from the Famicom, SNES, N64, and Wii Remotes was his favorite.</p><p>Nintendo Museum also has a large selection of exclusive merchandise. In response to demand from around the world, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-museum-puts-limits-on-gift-store-merch-to-discourage-scalpers/1100-6526911/" data-ref-id="1100-6526911">Nintendo Museum added limits to the merch that visitors can buy</a> in order to discourage scalpers. The museum still requires visitors to register for tickets, and <a href="https://x.com/Museum_Nintendo/status/1937405685819670914" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo also noted</a> that anyone who wishes to change their reservation for September should cancel their old reservation and reapply by the end of June.</p>
