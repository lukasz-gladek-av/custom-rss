		<p>Having a made a name for themselves with the minimalist rally game <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/26/art-of-rally-xbox-series-x-game-pass-summer-2021-kenya-update/">Art of Rally</a>, Funselektor is back with Over&nbsp;the Hill, a cosy looking off-road exploration game to play with your friends. The game is coming to Steam sometime soon.</p>
<p><iframe title="over the hill - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hFi39URiesI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Sending you off through simultaneously serene and challenging minimalist environments, Over the Hill has you rambling through the world in a 4×4, whether playing solo or going with friends. There’s a day and night cycle and dynamic weather that will help to make the experience all the more immersive, while dealing with less than reliable trails, needing to link together to traverse fast-flowing rivers and more.&nbsp;The goal, in case you really need on, is discover portals that link the various environments together.</p>
<p>It all sounds a bit MudRunner to me, but without the harsh Soviet-era vehicles and perhaps not as treacherous with its terrain.</p>
<p>Funselektor founder Dune Casu said, “<em>After having developed several games about motorsport, we wanted to go off-track by offering players a vast world to lose themselves at a slower pace. In a way, this game is similar to the experience I’ve had journeying across North America in my trusty camper van. There’s something special about being in the wilderness in the middle of nowhere, from the peace, the sounds of nature and less distraction from the civilized world. I hope this game can really drive that feeling home</em>.”</p>

<p>Over the Hill is a collaboration between Funselektor and Strelka Games, who they partnered with for their racing management sim Golden Lap last year. It will be the fourth Funselektor game, all of which have been motor vehicle-based.</p>

			<p>Ubisoft has just opened the pre-orders for Assassin's Creed Shadows, and in doing so, they also revealed the official PC system requirements. We already knew the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gamescom-preview-the-most-visually-advanced-assassins-creed-to-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">would be rather heavy</a>, which the specs below have certainly confirmed.&nbsp;All of them require 16GB RAM, Windows 10/11 with DirectX 12, and an SSD.</p>

That version, developed by Team Ninja, was ported to a handful of other consoles and also received a number of sequels. Based on the debut trailer, the new game looks to continue the dark action started with the 2004 release, but with even faster gameplay.</p><p>In addition to the brand-new release, a remake of Ninja Gaiden II was also announced called Ninja Gaiden II Black.

I hope this game can really drive that feeling home.”</p><p>The minimalism of past games like <em>Art of Rally</em>, while an aesthetic eye-catcher, has also carried through to the rest of the design. “<em>Art of Rally’s</em> minimalism serves a purpose,” former <em>Kotaku </em>writer Luke Plunkett <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/art-of-rally-turns-driving-into-meditation-1845099850&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/art-of-rally-turns-driving-into-meditation-1845099850">wrote previously</a></span>. “It’s not just a random aesthetic choice. It’s there to help create a zen-like experience. As is the electronic soundtrack that quickly retreats, kicks its feet up and puts on its slippers in the background. There’s no commentary, no pop-ups warning you about stuff, no other drivers out there, it’s just you, the car and a lot of gravel corners.”</p><p>I hope that vibe carries over into <em>over the hill</em> too, but with some extra companions along for the ride this time. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>"It's uneconomical and will cause us to lose a lot of money, [but] we feel like we have to break the logjam."</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Epic Games has announced a fresh push to convince app developers to launch their games on the company's fledgling mobile store, which company boss Tim Sweeney has admitted will be costly.
</p>
<p>
The Epic Games Store for mobile will today add its first swathe of third-party games, beyond the company's core offering of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rocket-league-sideswipe">Rocket League Sideswipe</a>.
</p>
<p>
19 titles have made today's line-up on Android - including Bloons TD 6 and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dungeon-of-the-endless">Dungeon of the Endless</a>: Apogee, which are the first titles to be offered in the store's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-bringing-free-games-to-its-mobile-store-in-a-bid-to-entice-new-users">previously-confirmed free games program</a>. 
</p>
<p>
16 of these will also be available via the Epic Games Store on iOS, where it is offered within the European Union. More will be added weekly, typically on Tuesdays.
</p>
<p>
Initially, Epic Games will offer free titles on a monthly basis, with its initial duo available until 20th February. A weekly schedule of free games will then kick in later this year.

</div><figcaption>Nintendo Switch 2 and Mario Kart 9 have been revealed - but questions remain.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UyPgPcxLlIk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Epic Games has clearly found it difficult to tempt mobile developers to its storefront, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tim-sweeney-no-regrets-on-fortnite-app-store-drama-as-epic-game-store-launches-on-mobile-in-europe">originally set to welcome third-party games last year and reach 100m installs by the end of 2024</a> - something it fell short of, only reaching around 30m instead. 
</p>
<p>
The company admits that none of the 100 highest-grossing app developers are yet willing to also distribute their game on the storefront - something it blames on Apple's controversial Core Technology Fee (CTF) policy.
</p>
<h2>Epic to pay developers to counter Apple's "insidious design"</h2>
<p>
What is the CTF policy? In a nutshell, iOS developers who want to launch games outside Apple's official App Store must pay a €0.50 fee for every install of its games - even via the App Store itself - after the company's first 1m installs.  It's a policy Epic Games and others have criticised as prohibitive of any real competition for the App Store, as no major app developer will want to penalise itself for launching elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
Today, Epic Games has announced it will cover the CTF for games that are offered as part of its store's free games program, for the program's first 12 months. 
</p>
<p>
"It's uneconomical and will cause us to lose a lot of money, [but] we feel like we have to break the logjam there," Epic Games boss Tim Sweeney said in a roundtable interview attended by Eurogamer. "[The CTF] is an absolutely insidious design, deviously constructed and deviously defended, and its the most critical thing the European regulators will need to overturn."
</p>
<blockquote>"We might run into serious financial problems after a couple more decades of this"</blockquote>
<p>
Asked whether Epic Games had the financial clout to continue the fight long-term, Sweeney said the company was in it for the long-haul.
</p>
<p>
"We might run into serious financial problems after a couple more decades of this, but we're determined to fight this out," he said. "I expect large parts of this struggle will go on over the rest of decade, and we're fully committed to it and breaking through. 
</p><p>
"The word for spending more money than you're making intentionally when you have a great business underneath is investment, and that's is what we see this as. It's an investment in Epic's future, both our future developer as a game developer ourselves - we see a much greater opportunity for Fortnite's future if iOS is open, and competition is allowed on iOS and Android, but we also see opportunities for all developers, and because we have businesses serving all developers such as Unreal Engine and Epic Games Store and our online services."
</p>
<h2>Apple and Google's "paywall" sees money going to "fuck all"</h2>
<p>
Either you have an ability to freely do business using fair market policies, or you're stuck behind Apple and Google's "paywall", Sweeney continued.
</p>
<p>
"Most of the profit your business produces will go to Apple and Google, who'll use it for fuck all - share buybacks and dividends rather than investment in hiring or technology or making the world a better place."
</p>
<p>
This includes Fortnite's big rival Roblox, which pays huge amounts to Apple and Google - something Sweeney says was "frustrating" and "sad" to see. 
</p>
<p>
In response to a question from Eurogamer on Epic Game Store's 30m installs to date, Sweeney said the company could have hit its 100m target if Apple and Google's "friction" had not gotten in the way.
</p>
<blockquote>"We could have had 60m users, we were denied that, and we're pissed"</blockquote>
<p>
"30m installs would obviously have been 60m if 50 percent of users hadn't been scared away by the scare screens and friction that Apple and Google uses," Sweeney said. "We could have had 60m users, we were denied that, and we're pissed. 
</p>
<p>
"But it's not just 60m, because there are network effects. If a number of users are in an ecosystem there's incentive for their friends to come in and interact with their friends. If we'd have 60m users come in instead of 30, each of those would have brought friends, and if those friends hadn't dropped off at a 50 percent rate due to the scare screens, then we might have 100m. I think it would have been easy for us to get to 100m users."
</p>
<p>
"Apple and Google are making this really hard," Epic Game Store boss Steve Allison added. 
</p>
<p>
"We had a goal of 100m installs of our first version of the store - with our first-party games - by the end of [last] year. We knew that was going to be a challenge, and where we ended up was around 30m. The friction is real and that number confirms that, absent this friction, we would have hit 100m by the end of the year.
</p><p>
"The Core Technology Fees on the iOS side and the rate of drop off on installs for the store are issues for some of these companies and they have got to get better before we get them to join," Allison continued. "But regardless, many of them will join us and some will wait before we make progress in these areas, and we're working really hard to do that."
</p>
<p>
Allison said Epic Games is not yet ready to share its new targets, but wanted to see the results of the free games program before discussing more. 
</p>
<h2>CMA investigation</h2>
<p>
The timing of today's announcement is interesting, coming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-set-to-pile-pressure-on-apple-and-google-app-store-dominance-as-fresh-investigation-launched">hot on the heels of this morning's confirmation by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) that it is launching a fresh investigation into Apple and Google</a> using last year's  Digital Markets, Competition and Consumer Act. 
</p>
<p>
Epic Games first launched the mobile version of its store last year, as the latest salvo in its long-running battle against Apple and Google which it says hold an unfair monopoly over the distribution of apps and games within their own ecosystems. 
</p><p>
The CMA will now investigate whether either Apple or Google should be labelled as having Strategic Market Status, a designation that would allow the authority to "guide the behaviour" of each firm, "tackling conduct that could undermine fair competition, or exploit people and businesses".
</p>
<p>
Lastly, today also brings a couple of new features to the Epic Games Store on mobile, including Epic Account login and an auto-update feature.

            <p>
Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment president David Haddad is stepping down after 12 years in the role, with his departure following a rocky period for Warner's game division that's been marked by a number of high-profile flops.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://x.com/Variety/status/1882452431146991914">reported by Variety</a>, Haddad will stay on with the company for the next three months, while Warner seeks his replacement. "David has thoughtfully and purposefully chosen a time when our release schedule is lighter," Warner's global streaming and games president JB Perrette wrote, "which will help minimise disruption to our ongoing projects and strategic plans and allow this team to smoothly prepare for its next record-breaking title."
</p>
<p>
News of Haddad's departure comes almost exactly a year after the disastrous release of developer Rocksteady's Suicide Squad, which was enough of a flop to that it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flop-leads-to-41-drop-in-warner-bros-gaming-revenue">resulted in a $200m loss</a> for Warner Bros. Free-to-play platform fighter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/multiversus">MultiVersus</a> also failed to find an audience despite almost a year of downtime for extensive retooling, resulting in a further $100m hit for the publisher.

<p>
And while 2023's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> was a significant financial win for Warner Bros., last year's Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions failed to replicate that success, with the publisher later admitting the title had "underperformed".
</p>
<p>
As to what's next for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a>, the publisher has yet to share much in the way of its future plans. The only game currently left on its announced slate is Monolith Productions' open-world Wonder Woman title - which Warner Bros. has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wonder-woman-is-not-being-designed-as-a-live-service-game">denied is a live service title</a>, despite a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wonder-woman-job-listing-suggests-itll-be-a-live-service-game">job listing sighted in 2023</a>, and despite company CEO David Zaslav's previous ambitions to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-says-it-plans-to-transform-its-biggest-franchises-into-live-service-games">transform its biggest gaming franchises</a> from traditional console and PC releases into "always on" live service games.

		<p>The Fuga: Melodies of Steel series is coming to an end this year with Fuga: Melodies of Steel 3 set to release on 29th May 2025, concluding its epic tale.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fuga: Melodies of Steel 3 Teaser Trailer #Fuga3 #FugaMelodiesOfSteel3" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-U57GugkGCQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The end of the trilogy will naturally continue in the same vein as the first two, with furry felineko characters going to war against a tyrannical enemy, the Berman Imperial Army. The crew of the Taranis are just completing training and improvements to convert their tank into a flying wonder when a transmission summons them to… the Moon? And there’s a load of laser satellites all set to blow up the world?</p>
<p>Fuga: Melodies of Steel 3 is coming to all the usual platforms: PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch and PC.</p>

<p>We’ve really enjoyed the series so far, with Reu saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/08/fuga-melodies-of-steel-2-review/">our review of Fuga 2</a>, “There’s a lot to love with Fuga 2, and the game is incredibly rewarding if you commit to the experience. It’s an improvement in every possible way on the original and provides an impactful and heart wrenching story with engaging gameplay throughout. If you played and loved the original game, this is an absolutely essential purchase, and even if you didn’t, this is turn-based strategy done very right. Just don’t you dare let Boron get loaded into the Soul Cannon, you monster.”</p>

As you slice and dice droids and criminals, you experience a condensed retelling of 1999's <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-best-and-worst-parts-of-every-star-wars-movie-1850406311?_gl=1*1dp6uhr*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzY0ODc5NC4xNDguMS4xNzM3NjUxNzg3LjE5LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-and-worst-parts-of-every-star-wars-movie-1850406311?_gl=1*1dp6uhr*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzY0ODc5NC4xNDguMS4xNzM3NjUxNzg3LjE5LjAuMA.."><em>The Phantom Menace</em></a></span>. And uh, the game wasn’t very good, with clunky combat and bad platforming segments. But, that hasn’t stopped<em> Jedi Power Battles </em>from returning in 2025 via a newly released remaster. </p><p>Developed by Aspyr, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-bounty-hunter-remaster-review-is-it-good-ps5-1851610382&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-bounty-hunter-remaster-review-is-it-good-ps5-1851610382">the same studio behind last year’s <em>Star Wars Bounty Hunter</em> remaster</a></span>, this new and improved version of <em>Jedi Power Battles</em> is out now on basically every platform under the sun. And like the original it includes local co-op as well as multiple characters (include non-Jedi ones) to play as, and 10 levels to work through. </p><p>As you would expect, Aspyr has visually upgraded <em>Jedi Power Battles</em>, too. So you get improved textures, better looking menus, and increased performance, which is much appreciated as the original PlayStation game looked rough and played poorly. (I should know, last year I streamed and beat the original.) This spiffy port also includes new characters to play as and all the original unlockable characters now included right from the get go.</p><p>And all the remastered aspects of this new port are great. In fact, this is a perfect version of <em>Jedi Power Battles</em>. It includes everything, looks great, runs well, and also features <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-episode-i-jedi-power-battles-announce&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.starwars.com/news/star-wars-episode-i-jedi-power-battles-announce" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nice bonus features</a></span> that will make super<em> Star Wars</em> nerds (like me) happy. For example, you can swap Mace Windu’s lightsaber color from the original, inaccurate blue seen in the game to a perfect purple. If you want to play <em>Jedi Power Battles</em> in 2025, this is the way to do so. No question about it.</p><p>However, I would point out that I’m not sure anyone really wanted to replay <em>Jedi Power Battles </em>25 years later. I mean, sure, there are probably people who grew up with this game and have nostalgia for it. I was one of those kids who played hours and hours of this game back in 2000. But whenever I return to it, most recently to play this remaster, I find a bad, clunky game. Combat feels stiff and unresponsive; enemies take way too many hits; levels, like the section on Coruscant, go on forever and feel miserable. Playing in co-op is a bit more fun and some boss fights are entertaining, but overall <em>Jedi Power Battles </em>is a bad game that would have been forgotten if it weren’t connected to <em>Star Wars. </em></p><p>So where does that leave the remaster of <em>Jedi Power Battles?</em> Well, if you are really desperate for a new couch co-op<em> Star Wars </em>game—which there aren’t many of—then you might have a fine time. For everyone else, well, I’d recommend only buying and playing this remaster if you are super nostalgic for the original game. Just be warned: You likely won’t enjoy <em>Star Wars: Episode 1: Jedi Power Battles</em> as much in 2025 as you did in 2000.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>It’s pretty strange to think that it’s been almost half a decade since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/12/03/assassins-creed-valhalla-review-ps5-xbox-series-x/">Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</a>. Sure, there was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/04/assassins-creed-mirage-review/">Assassin’s Creed Mirage</a> as a back-to-its-roots palette cleanser, but Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the first ‘full’ new game in the modern action-RPG style since 2020, though with Ubisoft Quebec as lead developer, it’s more a successor to Assassin’s Creed Odyssey. With such a passage of time, you’d hope for some big changes to the formula, shifting the focus point and tone of how the game plays. We’ve been hands-on with a few hours of the game, its prologue and a more open mission from later in the story.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows Preview – Strike from the shadows, kick from the rooftops" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3JumaCsHXcI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Running through <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> are its two contrasting characters – Naoe a female shinobi assassin, and Yasuke, an African samurai based on the real historical figure. The opening of the game introduces them separately, with Yasuke coming to Japan as an enslaved bodyguard to a Jesuit missionary who rescued him from drowning, and who is in Japan to try and receive Oda Nobunaga’s favour. Nobunaga, much like the historical account, is fascinated by seeing a black man for the first time, but also spots the potential in him as a warrior and breaks him from his servitude to fight for him, giving him the name Yasuke – he’s called Diogo prior to this. The prologue skips around his timeline, jumping ahead to a siege by Nobunaga’s army, with Yasuke able to charge through in the hunt for the enemy leader as the castle burns around him and the battle rages.</p>


<p>On the other side of this fight is Naoe, whose path to becoming a member of the Assassins is much more straightforward and obvious, but also significantly more tragic. There’s a great Tarantino-esque reveal of the cabal of bad guys at the end of the prologue – apt when considering how heavily inspired by Westerns he has been through his filmmaking career, and some of the crossover and blending of ideas they had with Japanese cinema.</p>


<p>Eventually, the pair are united in their cause, to track down this cabal one by one, unravel their nefarious plot and retrieve whatever mystical macguffin they plan to use to enact it. Following the prologue you can play as either of them, pretty much whenever you want. During open-ended sections you can switch between Yasuke and Naoe from the pause menu, and through narrative missions you’re regularly given the choice to choose which character you’ll play as through the next 5-10 minute section. Both approaches are equally valid because of this, but there’s a thematic style that I feel will dictate most players through the game’s story –&nbsp;you also have an option to have the canonical story auto-pick for you at any narrative decision points, which is a nice touch.</p>
<p>The pair of them provide great contrast in their approach. Naoe is all about stealth and striking from the shadows, much like the original core fantasy of the Assassin’s Creed series, while Yasuke is more of a brawler, able to wade into the fight. Both are more than capable of clambering around the world or holding their own in combat against many enemies, but their abilities skew one way or the other. Naoe has a grappling hook so she’s much more able to reach high up vantage points and scope out the world, while Yasuke has mighty kicks and attacks that bring to mind the 300-esque kicking frenzy that was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/10/01/assassins-creed-odyssey-review/">Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</a>.</p>

<p>Combat is naturally related to the action RPG stylings of Valhalla, Odyssey and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/26/assassins-creed-origins-review/">Origins</a>, and it’s satisfyingly punchy, though you do have to gradually whittle away enemy armour and health bars. It strikes a good balance between feeling like 1-on-1 fights where all the other enemies watch before taking their turn, and allowing multiple enemies to gang up on you together, leaving you to dish out counter attacks in that Batman: Arkham style.</p>
<p>Yasuke can wield large katanas, yari spears and brutal looking kanabō war clubs – he’s also capable of what’s branded as a brutal assassination, which really lives up to the name as you barrel into combat. At range, you can pull out a bow and arrow or an arquebus, one of the earliest firearms. Naoe, by contrast, is much more traditional as a shinobi, coming with smaller blades, throwable shuriken and kunai. Both then have special attacks on a cooldown, whether it’s a quick samurai strike to dash and slash forward, or the aforementioned kick that can send smaller enemies flying.</p>
<p>You can also call upon allies recruited to your network of spies and contacts. This helps maintain your concealment in stealth, as an NPC shinobi dashes in, attacks a target and then smoke bombs their way outta there, or can just give you some backup when battling.</p>

<p>Coming back to the vantage points, while these serve a similar function to previous games, letting you get up high, spot nearby points of interest and then leap from a ludicrous height into a hay bail. The key difference here is that, instead of a quick pan around of the camera that immediately marks and highlights everything for you on the map, telling you exactly what’s in each location, you’re instead presented with a big bunch of question marks. You now have to manually look at and mark each one, where you’re given a coloured highlight that suggests what it might be –&nbsp;a location, an activity –&nbsp;and from that you’re given a bit more agency in the adventure you’re undertaking. Chasing down a marker is more engaging when you don’t know exactly what’s at the other end, and when you’ve chosen this particular rabbit hole to venture down.</p>
<p>Something similar is true for the missions and quests in the game, which can feel much more like an active investigation than a string of waypoints that you need to sprint between. Trying to piece together the events that led to an attack on a group of nobles and the kidnap of a child that threatens an alliance, you have to follow various leads, but they’re not all as specific as “go and talk to the trader by the docks”, and even when they are, the next step isn’t necessarily as clear cut. Instead you’re often directed to a particular area, like the west or south of a city, and told to look for a particular person’s home, a shrine or temple, and the like. Here you’ll often have the choice of fighting your way in to find the person or next clue that you need, or be able to take a stealthier approach.</p>

<p>It’s a great change that feels less clear cut and guided, but as Ubisoft toe this delicate line, they point their feet toward still presenting you with a quick solution. When looking at your next objective, the three clues quickly make it very clear what you need to do and are presented all at once instead of being doled out as you might need them. More fundamentally, as soon as your character sees the objective, they talk about it and they can be immediately highlighted, or a location can be found and marked well before you actually need it. It means that means if you’re looking for a particular guard in an area that doesn’t quite fit in, this crucial final step to solving the puzzle feels like it’s being handed to you on a platter instead of actually testing you to spot the character that’s acting funny.</p>
<p>This is, admittedly, a very difficult thing to get right, and we’ve seen various games take quite different approaches – most recently, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/06/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> drew plaudits for its use of the camera to give hints as players request them, and Sony Santa Monica added a hint timer setting for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-review/">God of War: Ragnarok</a>. I hope that Ubisoft Quebec can tweak things just a little bit in this regard to really follow through on this philosophical shift.</p>
<p>Visiting Japan in any time period has been high on pretty much every series fan’s wishlist, and Assassin’s Creed Shadows is going to fulfil that dream for many. We’re still riding the cultural tidal wave that is so keen to explore Japanese history, whether it’s with the Shogun TV series or the handful of major video games that have beaten Ubisoft to the punch. It certainly isn’t the first to get here, but I’m very encouraged by my time with Assassin’s Creed Shadows that Ubisoft are going to strike a lot of the right notes with this long-awaited game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/assassins-creed-shadows-hands-on-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-odyssey" rel="nofollow"><em>Assassin's Creed Origins</em></a> came out eight years ago, it revolutionized the formula. But it was also a massive departure from its stealthier roots, with a more pointed focus on action-oriented combat. <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>feels like the closest the series has gotten to marrying both halves of its identity, perhaps in the most interesting way yet.</p>

<p>Naoe plays a lot like your classic <em>Assassin's Creed</em>. She's nimble and swift, effortlessly flipping off ledges. In open combat, she's fragile and falls after just a few hits. And as you'd expect, she can scale any wall, manmade or otherwise.</p>

<p>Yasuke, on the other hand, leans way more into the action of the more recent games, doubling down on combat. He's tanky, and his finishing blows are violently satisfying. However, he can't really climb much—and that changes the game more than I thought it would.</p>



<h2><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>-&nbsp;Verticality Isn't a Given Anymore</h2>

<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> is the 13th mainline entry in this long-running series, which means it's had nearly two decades to cement one thing in me: Up is always an option. It was one of the first games to feature dynamic climbing in a 3D open world, a core part of the series' identity.</p>

<p>It's so intrinsic, in fact, that I didn't think about it until I played as Yasuke. He's big and beefy, much like Connor from <em>Assassin's Creed III</em>. However, he can't move like Connor; he feels like a tank.</p>

<p>When he sprints into walls or fences, he smashes right through them. His attacks look and feel absolutely deadly; he sells every gruesome decapitation animation. His special attacks just have a lot of oomph and muscle to them.</p>

<p>But he can't parkour.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-finisher.jpg?itok=TmSPC9eS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-finisher.jpg?itok=UaDCtagH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The next second is about as satisfying gas you're imagining.</figcaption></figure><p>This felt the most apparent to me during the last mission of my play session, which had a series of checkpoints where I could choose between Yasuke and Naoe. I did the final approach with Yasuke, which led to what felt like a claustrophobic mini dungeon.</p>

<p>He climbed ladders—not random walls—inside Himeji Castle, tearing down enemies on each floor. It reminded me of dungeons from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/like-dragon-infinite-wealth" rel="nofollow">the <em>Yakuza </em>series</a>, but make no mistake: This is still an <em>Assassin's Creed</em> game.</p>

<p>I didn't have the freedom to step outside and scale the tower. When he fast travels to a viewpoint, he doesn't perch—he's about to fall off, like Sonic the Hedgehog on a ledge. Then he blunders onto the haystack, screaming for dear life.</p>

<p>I specify "fast travels" because he can't climb up those towers himself. The quintessential, belabored&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed</em> mechanic, climbing towers, is rendered impossible for Yasuke.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-falling-into-haystack.jpg?itok=nZBFm5Ea 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-falling-into-haystack.jpg?itok=BoDthyZl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sometimes, you have to take the leap of faith butt first.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>&nbsp;-&nbsp;Two Protagonists, One Story</h2>

<p>Yasuke represents a real mood shift for the series. He's so drastically different from Naoe that it makes me rethink how I approach each mission.</p>

<p>It seems like most missions' narratives will play out similarly regardless of your character. However, how you accomplish them is dictated by your actions.</p>

<p>For example, there was a mission where I had to confront some thugs who were pretending to make a deal with a merchant. As Naoe, I instinctively climbed a nearby rooftop, assassinated a few from the air, and dealt with the rest in quick combat.</p>



<p>As Yasuke, though, I decided to approach them head on—what did I have to fear? And I found that they don't attack on sight. Instead, I could talk to them. The dialog still led to a fight, and overall, the result was the same.</p>



<p>In retrospect, I'm sure I could've done the same thing as Naoe, but the drastic change in mindset really stuck with me. My journey and thought process felt meaningfully different between them.</p>

<p>That final mission of the preview, where I fought through Himeji Castle, featured multiple checkpoints where I could swap between the heroes. I was told that there was a Yasuke-specific segment, which I played, that led to a mini boss fight. On the other hand, picking Naoe would've led to a segment specific to her playstyle.</p>

<p>I imagine for big story missions, those sorts of pronounced differences would be more apparent, but for run-of-the-mill open-world fare, it likely just comes down to which character you prefer playing.</p>

<p>You can swap between them any time in the open world as long as you're not in combat, though for most of my time exploring, I imagine myself sticking to Naoe. While Yasuke's lack of parkour is fascinating for quest design, it handicaps him severely for anything not accessible by horseback.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-map.jpg?itok=Px-owkib 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-map.jpg?itok=KHqbsc4B 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We only got to see Harima, and with how huge this map is, no parkour would make things difficult.</figcaption></figure><p>A worry I have with the dual protagonist system, though, is loot management. I found myself pretty over the amount of loot I gathered in <em>Odyssey</em>, and in my nearly 4 hours with <em>Shadows</em>, I already picked up a handful of items. Having to manage two sets of equipment does feel like it could get cumbersome across dozens of hours.</p>

<p>On top of that, each character gets multiple weapons. Naoe has the katana, kusarigama, and tanto, with tools like kunai and smoke bombs too. Yasuke gets the long katana, kanabo, naginata, a bow, and a musket. It's a lot of options, but also a lot to keep track of when each item has different rarities, special effects, and damage numbers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-inventory.jpg?itok=3kTMNqLU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-inventory.jpg?itok=-osP_O8V 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The tanto acts like a fast dagger, and the kusarigama is a stylish way to deal with multiple enemies.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> - Exploring Feudal Japan</h2>

<p>We were restricted to one region of the map in our <em>Shadows </em>preview session, which had a recommended level of 25. The overall game design will let players explore wherever they'd like, but if you're not at a comparable level, you'll run into some difficulty.</p>

<p>I explored the countryside outside of Himeji Castle once I finished the story missions, and the landscape was picturesque and beautiful. The sun and morning fog created a scenic pink-orange sky as I rode through some rice paddies. Any time I perched atop a viewpoint, the land around me unfurled like a rich tapestry.</p>

<p>Say what you will about the franchise, but historically, the series has done a great job at bringing historic places to life, and this small vertical slice I've seen of Feudal Japan has me eager to see more.</p>

<p><em>Shadows </em>will have seasons—but not like battle passes (as far as I know). After a certain amount of time has passed, spring will give way to summer, and so on. I only experienced spring in my preview, but being able to explore this virtual recreation of Japan in the snow or with cherry blossoms sounds pretty exciting.</p>



<p>Much like <em>Odyssey </em>before it, the mission structure encourages exploration. Instead of specific waypoints, you're given directions (e.g. "it's southeast of this landmark"). If you're in a rush though, you can use a scout to explore a part of the map, and they'll give you a radius to narrow your search down a bit.</p>

<p>Those scouts play into the larger hideout and brotherhood mechanics that I only got a little bit of time to interface with. In game, I could call in an assassin or tank scout to help with a fight. These scouts are upgradeable, too; for example, the assassin could take down an extra target when I called him in.</p>

<p>I could also purchase hideouts across the map to strengthen my network and have spots to restock essentials. In the introductory video of the session, I also saw that you could eventually build out a larger hideout, sort of like build mode in <em>The Sims</em>. I imagine that will take resources, which your scouts can harvest after the passing of every season.</p>



<h2><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> - History Is Written by Ubisoft</h2>

<p><em>Shadows </em>is set during the great unification of Japan in the Sengoku era. Oda Nobunaga shows up, and I wouldn't be surprised if Hideyoshi and Ieyasu appear, too. Meanwhile, Naoe is the fictional insert into the story, acting as the avatar for all the capital-A Assassins lore.</p>

<p>I can't claim to know enough about Japanese history to know how accurate the story will be, nor can I really say which of the characters I met were fictional or historical aside from Nobunaga.</p>

<p>But what I found interesting is that <em>Shadows </em>comes with a "canon" mode. I played it normally, so I could choose dialog choices for Yasuke and Naoe, and by the end of the preview's quest, I could choose to kill or spare a noble. Canon mode would take that choice away and make one for me.</p>

<p>I'm unsure how big of a ramifications his death would have on the larger story (or its potential implications on historical accuracy), but canon mode implies that there's an intended "correct" choice there, in Ubisoft's eyes. Whether it'll tell a good story—regardless of player agency—is yet to be determined.</p>



<p>However, I will say, in the small slice I played, I did find myself paying less and less attention to cutscenes. The voice acting in general just fell flat to me, especially for the two leads. They were stiff, awkward, and lacked charisma.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Maybe things will play out differently in the full game when there's time to build a connection with them. But as of now, I'm a little worried about their ability to carry the whole story, especially if it's even half as long as <em>Odyssey</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-kick.jpg?itok=5P4nc7iA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-kick.jpg?itok=W4oMfxO9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This kick sends enemies flying, and it's so satisfying to use every time. It reminded me a little of the kick in&nbsp;<em>Bulletstorm</em>.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> Hands-on Preview – Final Thoughts&nbsp;</h2>

<p>We're now two months out from <em>Shadows</em>' release on March 20. Granted, it used to be one month away until they delayed it (again). The delays made me raise an eyebrow, considering the larger implications of Ubisoft's current status in the market. I've written a lot about it <a href="https://magic.beehiiv.com/v1/271d2405-1f1f-4b77-938c-abc0f26d7327?email={{email}}" rel="nofollow">in our newsletter, if you haven't subscribed already</a>.</p>

<p>But I was pretty impressed with my 4 hours with Yasuke and Naoe. It felt like the best <em>Assassin's Creed</em> game I played in years, and aside from two visual/collision bugs, it ran pretty smoothly, despite being streamed across the internet (worth noting it was still a work-in-progress build, too). The setting is interesting, and the dichotomy between the two characters makes me rethink how to play these games.</p>

<p>However, I also walked away with one other conclusion: On the whole, this still feels like an <em>Assassin's Creed</em> game. I slotted into most of the gameplay loop easily, and while the new additions are nice quality-of-life changes, it still felt like a fairly known quantity—albeit a more refined version of it.</p>

Pocketpair Publishing has teamed up with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24146692/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review-metroidvania-platformer"><em>Tales of Kenzera: Zau</em></a><em> </em>developer Surgent Studios to produce its next title, a horror game slated for release later this year. Surgent Studios was founded by video game voice performer and on-screen actor Abubakar Salim. After launching <em>Tales of Kenzera</em>, an afro-futuristic metroidvania, the company was forced <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/takes-of-kenzera-zau-dev-surgent-studios-puts-entire-games-team-on-hiatus-due-to-lack-of-funding">to furlough its games division</a> due to lack of funding — a common occurrence that’s become endemic over the last two years.</p><p>The indie game space has not been insulated from the effects of the layoff crisis that’s plagued the game industry. The big publishers, from which smaller indie outfits typically receive funding, are tightening their belts, choosing to either keep their cash or only dole it out to projects they believe are sure to make money. And even the publishers known for supporting quality indie games, like Annapurna Games, are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/9/12/24243317/annapurna-interactive-staff-reportedly-resigns">having a hard time staying in operation</a>. </p><p>However, Pocketpair Publishing joins a group of new companies that have entered the indie games space via non-traditional means. In 2022, YouTube video game critic and content creator videogamedunkey, created his own publishing company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/22/23365263/videogamedunkey-publishing-company-bigmode">Bigmode</a> which published its first game, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24162572/animal-well-platforming-difficulty-bigmode"><em>Animal Well</em></a><em>,</em> to critical acclaim last year. Also last year, Innersloth, developers of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/8/22221075/among-us-2020-most-downloaded-mobile-game">wildly-popular murder mystery multiplayer game <em>Among Us</em></a>, <a href="https://www.innersloth.com/outersloth/">established Outersloth</a>, which is an indie game fund rather than a traditional publisher. Like Outersloth and Bigmode, Pocketpair Publishing is seeking to parlay its commercial success into an avenue for more indie games like <em>Palworld </em>to get made.</p><p>“Game development comes with many challenges,” said Pocketpair Publishing head John Buckley. “But we want to ease that process as much as possible and provide an environment where creators can pursue their dreams.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Where were you on October 11th last year? If you were Edwin, Brendy, or myself - which, statistically, you are not - you were writing news articles about one of three aspirant spiritual successors to detective <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a>. It was an "I'm Spartacus"-ass day of press releases, culminating in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sure-why-not-third-group-of-former-disco-elysium-devs-announce-revolutionary-new-rpg-studio">announcement of a project</a> from former ZA/UM writers Argo Tuulik and Olga Moskvina.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yet-another-studio-formed-of-disco-elysium-alumni-has-announced-a-cerebral-sci-fi-rpg-just-to-confuse-you">Before that</a> came sci-fi RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/xxx-nightshift">XXX Nightshift</a>, and before <em>that</em> was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-disco-elysium-devs-are-working-on-a-spiritual-successor-at-new-studio-longdue-though-robert-kurvitz-and-aleksander-rostov-arent-involved">an unnamed "psychogeographic RPG"</a> from newly formed Longdue. We now know that it's called Hopetown, and Longdue are set to launch a crowdfunding campaign which you can "pre-register" for <a href="https://www.longduegames.com/">here</a>, should you wish. Here's the sell:</p>
<!--more-->
<blockquote><p>Merging the raw emotional depth and psychological intricacy of Disco Elysium with the philosophical richness and narrative complexity of Planescape: Torment, this new psychological RPG invites players into an unforgettable world where stories are weapons, choices ripple through the environment, and light and darkness collide—not just between its denizens, but within them too.</p></blockquote>
<p>Contributors to the project include Piotr Sobolewsk, who worked on Disco Elysium's system design as part of support studio <a href="https://theknightsofu.com/projects/disco-elysium/">Knights Of Unity</a>. Longdue promise "more extraordinary talent set to be unveiled as part of the crowdfunding launch," having previously teased the contributions of mystery alumni from Bungie, Rockstar, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/yes-your-grace">Yes, Your Grace</a>’s Brave At Night.</p><p>You'll be playing as a rogue journalist: "a chaotic, self-destructive provocateur who sees humanity as inherently selfish and cruel". Well, I <em>do</em> love to be told how I see humanity before making a single dialogue choice. "Unapologetically cynical and dangerously unhinged, you thrive on poking at bruises, pulling at loose threads, and watching what unravels."</p>
<p>So, how does old Funter S. Tedious here stand out from H.D.B? Here's a bit more on that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Meanwhile, a new journalism-based RPG system gives you the tools to craft stories that shape the world—and yourself. Will you embrace chaos as a gonzo journalist, spinning wild, attention-grabbing narratives? Will you twist reality as a conspiracist, bending events to suit your worldview? Or will you dig deep as a calculated investigator, exposing brutal truths to spark rebellion—or sow complacency?</p></blockquote>
<p>Is there a word for being interested but unenthusiastic at the same time? I should probably know one, but I'm afraid I'm simply too much of a cynical unhinged rogue gonzo bruise-poking provocateur to work on my vocabulary.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-studio-bosses-humiliated-the-cancelled-expansions-lead-writer-for-speaking-to-journalists-claims-report">little primer</a> if you're looking to get up to speed on the messy events that transpired in the fallout of Disco Elysium's release. It's got everything: People being dicks to each other. People being cosmic megadicks to each other. People being ensorceled turbodicks to each other. The works.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Again</a></span>.</p><p>It’s clear that Ubisoft really needs a big win here and is betting a lot on <em>Shadows</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-release-date-star-wars-1851657285?_gl=1*we5t6x*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzU2OTE0NS4zMTQuMS4xNzM3NTgxOTgxLjU0LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-release-date-star-wars-1851657285?_gl=1*we5t6x*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzU2OTE0NS4zMTQuMS4xNzM3NTgxOTgxLjU0LjAuMA..">giving the devs as much time as possible</a></span> to make a great game that it hopes sells really, really well. So yeah, there’s a lot riding on this game. And while I can’t say, after my hands-on demo, whether or not the full game is going to be enough to help turn things around for Ubisoft, I’m at least convinced  that <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> could be a very good game. In fact, it might be <em>two </em>good games smashed into one package. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-red-release-date-trailer-1851479039?_gl=1*iv8elb*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjQzODI0NS4xMjcuMS4xNzM2NDQzMzczLjQ0LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-red-release-date-trailer-1851479039?_gl=1*iv8elb*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjQzODI0NS4xMjcuMS4xNzM2NDQzMzczLjQ0LjAuMA.."><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a></span><em> </em>is set in Japan during the 16th century, toward the end of the Sengoku period. During this time, Japan was rife with civil war and guns were becoming more common on the battlefield. As with many past <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games, <em>Shadows </em>features members of the Assassin Brotherhood fighting the Templars and their various proxies. </p><p>However, rather than the series’ ongoing, interconnected lore, my demo was focused mostly on the two main characters—Yasuke and Naoe—and their involvement in a war between clans and family. And after four hours of playing <em>Shadows </em>over a mostly stable livestream connection under the watchful eye of a Ubisoft representative, those two characters really stood out to me, not least because they offer two drastically different ways to play.</p><h2 id="h8925"><a id=""></a>A tale of two assassins</h2><p>First up, there’s Yasuke, a Black man who has made his way to Japan via Christian missionaries. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-who-is-yasuke-black-samurai-1851482754?_gl=1*6ey1xx*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjQ0MTIzMS4yNTkuMC4xNzM2NDQxMjM5LjUyLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-who-is-yasuke-black-samurai-1851482754?_gl=1*6ey1xx*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNjQ0MTIzMS4yNTkuMC4xNzM2NDQxMjM5LjUyLjAuMA..">This character is based on a real person</a></span> from history, though the exact details have been changed to better fit the world of <em>Shadows</em>. And yeah, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/this-was-never-about-anything-other-than-hate-1851602820?_gl=1*158so5*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzU2OTE0NS4zMTQuMS4xNzM3NTgyNTE1LjUzLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/this-was-never-about-anything-other-than-hate-1851602820?_gl=1*158so5*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzU2OTE0NS4zMTQuMS4xNzM3NTgyNTE1LjUzLjAuMA..">a corner of the internet is angry about a black man being in <em>Shadows</em></a></span>. Who cares! Anyway, Yasuke is a tough, combat-focused character who plays a lot like the heroes from<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-origins-the-kotaku-review-1819862017&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-origins-the-kotaku-review-1819862017"><em>Assassin’s Creed Origins</em></a></span><em>, Odyssey, </em>and <em>Valhalla.</em> Yasuke can kick people across a room, break down doors, and wield large weapons against crowds of enemies. And while he can sneak around a bit and do some parkour, he’s slower and less effective at stealth than his counterpart. </p><p>On the flipside, you have Naoe, a ninja-like Assassin who plays a lot more like the heroes of older <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-assassins-creed-games-worst-to-best-1844019813?_gl=1*158so5*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzU2OTE0NS4zMTQuMS4xNzM3NTgyNTE1LjUzLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-assassins-creed-games-worst-to-best-1844019813?_gl=1*158so5*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczNzU2OTE0NS4zMTQuMS4xNzM3NTgyNTE1LjUzLjAuMA.."><em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games</a></span>—stuff like <em>AC2, Rogue, </em>and <em>Unity. </em>Naoe is skilled at sneaking in an out of places and taking out people without anyone noticing. She’s also really fast and can easily scale walls and roofs in seconds. </p><p>In my time with <em>Shadows</em>, what surprised me the most was just how different the game felt depending on who you selected.</p><p>As Yasuke, I could do a bit of stealth to get into a base and then fight my way through using a big sword and abilities like a charge attack. He played a lot like a walking samurai tank; able to destroy enemies easily while taking a lot of damage. Naoe is the opposite.  Returning as Naoe to the small enemy base I’d previously ransacked as Yasuke was interesting. I could take advantage of all the shadows around the base more easily, hiding from enemies and taking them out with my hidden blade. I could escape quickly with smoke bombs, too. </p><p>As I bounced between the two characters, I got the sense that Ubisoft really wants this<em> Assassin’s Creed </em>entry to appeal to all of the franchise’s fans. Ever since <em>Origins</em>, which was a more RPG-focused action game compared to past titles, a split has developed between fans. There are those who like that type of action-focused game and others who miss the stealth gameplay of the older installments. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175">2023's <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em></a></span> was Ubisoft’s attempt to provide  those older fans with something that would make them happy, and it worked.  But <em>Mirage </em>might have scared away the players who want a big new open-world, RPG-style <em>Assassin’s Creed. </em></p><p>With <em>Shadows </em>and its two characters, Ubisoft is trying to merge both playstyles and fanbases into one big package. You love sneaking around and using a hidden blade? Play as Naoe! Prefer a big sword and large fights? Good news, you can play as Yasuke.</p><p> It’s a smart approach that worked shockingly well in my four-hour preview. At times I’d force myself to play as one or the other, and I was always able to  make progress regardless of the situation. And while there will be parts that force you to switch to one or the other, Ubisoft seems dedicated to mostly leaving the option of who to play as in the hands of players.</p><p>For those who want to frequently swap between both and enjoy everything the game has to offer, Ubisoft has your back. Every mission I played featured numerous points where I could swap between characters. And outside of quests, I was able to freely swap between Yasuke and Naoe as long as I wasn’t in combat. Ubisoft really, really wants everyone to be happy, and while that approach can sometimes lead to games that feel bland or sanded down, my admittedly limited demo left me with the feeling that in <em>Shadows</em>, it could work really well. </p><h2 id="h8926"><a id=""></a>Exploration, questing, and the open world</h2><p>Beyond the two-character approach, Ubisoft is also trying to encourage more exploration and a slower pace in <em>Shadows</em>.</p><p> Quests aren’t automatically marked on your map, for example, with the game instead encouraging you to read clues, explore the area, and find your next objective yourself. If that doesn’t sound like your cup of tea, however, you can also use scouts to find places to go, so there’s a way to skip the searching and get to the killing. Another example of Ubisoft trying to satisfy everyone. </p><p>Between those quests, I found a gorgeous world packed with a ton of detail. I came across some deer fighting in the woods, sneaked close to them, and was reward with some XP and a short cutscene of my character drawing the animals. Later, I cut my way through some bushes and discovered that a lot of stuff can be cut and destroyed in <em>Shadows</em>. Trees, bushes, paper doors, crates, and more are all dynamic and can be broken or sliced. Fighting some guards near a bush I was hiding in led to the bush getting cut up and me losing my sneaky spot. Oops! </p><p>Sadly, I was only granted access to a small section of what looks like a really big map to explore. But even so, there was some neat stuff to experience. I spent a lot of my time riding a horse, though you can walk around the map if you prefer. At one point I stumbled upon a challenge to hit targets with my bow while on horseback. Another time, I prayed at a small temple. Nothing mind-blowingly cool, but in general, I got the sense that <em>Shadows </em>wants you to slow down and poke around the world more than past <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>games. </p><p>My only major disappointment with the demo was that a lot of the quests boiled down to go somewhere, kill some stuff or sneak in, and then leave. Sprinkled between these moments were cutscenes that featured dialogue choices and I did enjoy these moments as I got to better define Yasuke and Naoe. But the quests weren’t that memorable, and I worry that trying to support two very different characters might prove tricky when it comes to designing engaging and varied missions. </p><p>We’ll have to wait and see if the rest of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-base-building-rpg-settlement-1851655892&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-base-building-rpg-settlement-1851655892"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a></span> has more interesting missions and if the slower pace and dual-character approach works in the long run. I’m not sure<em> Shadows </em>is the game that will save Ubisoft, mainly because I’m not sure one single game can do that. But it might be the game that finally unites the <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>fanbase, and that would be impressive, too.</p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 20. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-ac-shadows-ps4-xbox-one-next-gen-only-1851479764&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-ac-shadows-ps4-xbox-one-next-gen-only-1851479764">It will be the first game in the franchise to skip PS4 in over a decade.</a></span></p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gray-zone-warfare-turned-heads-in-2024-%E2%80%93-what%E2%80%99s-next-for-the-tactical-shooter.1090059/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-whats-next/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Gray Zone Warfare was released in April 2024, and while the launch was ‘far from flawless’ (as the dev says), it made a splash in the tactical shooter scene and attracted stacks of players. It stormed up the charts on streaming platforms, and as 2024 unravelled, MADFINGER Games coaxed the game into a better space.</p>



<p>Today, Gray Zone Warfare has sold more than 1.5 million units, and at the peak, 322,600 players were concurrently exploring this open-world, intense game. In a recent press release, MADFINGER doubled back to look at the game’s performance in 2024 before dipping into what comes next for Gray Zone Warfare.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-build-the-game-with-them">‘Build the Game with Them’</h2>



<p>In a recent press release, MADFINGER Games said they invite ‘you to build the game with them’. In the months ahead, Gray Zone Warfare will receive two major updates, introducing key elements like deeper and richer PvP content and a dynamic weather system.</p>



<p>It was just weeks ago that MADFINGER rolled out the Night Ops update, which was a pivotal point for the game that pushed it into new territory in terms of review sentiment on Steam.</p>



<p>Through 2024, MADFINGER Games fixed 2163 bugs, according to data revealed in the aforementioned press release. Many of these fixes were spread across the 19 releases pushed throughout the year.</p>



<p>Gray Zone Warfare isn’t your average tactical shooter. It blends a few genres, offering players a unique ‘extraction shooter’ feel in a wide, open world that isn’t bound by a raid timer. It has survival elements, including health mechanics, weight management,  and the need to stay fed and watered.</p>



<p>Players are invited to join factions, spawning at a starting base that they’ll use to get kitted, call in a helicopter, and jet off across the map – a fictional, sprawling world called Lamang. It’s visually sumptuous and intense, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I had the chance to play it</a> before it landed in early access last year. I loved every minute.</p>



<p>If you want to give Gray Zone Warfare a try, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2479810/Gray_Zone_Warfare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">pick up a copy on Steam</a>.

A crowdfunding campaign is planned, with a limited number of registrations for its pre-launch now available via the studio’s <a href="https://longduegames.com/" target="_blank">official website</a>. <span id="more-939677"></span></p><p>“Having overseen the team of 15 that was credited with ‘saving’ <em>Disco Elysium</em> and which worked on it for nearly six years, pre- and post-release, I’m excited to work with the Longdue team to create a rich RPG experience to serve fans of the genre,” said contributor Piotr Sobolewsk in a press release.</p><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Merging the raw emotional depth and psychological intricacy of <em>Disco Elysium</em> with the philosophical richness and narrative complexity of <em>Planescape: Torment</em>, this new psychological RPG invites players into an unforgettable world where stories are weapons, choices ripple through the environment, and light and darkness collide—not just between its denizens, but within them too.</p><p>Contributors include Piotr Sobolewsk, who previously oversaw pivotal contributions to the core systems that defined <em>Disco Elysium</em>. These groundbreaking mechanics, celebrated for their depth and ingenuity, reimagined how <a title="Genres > RPG [16,943 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">RPGs</a> handle narrative, choice, and player agency.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Now, Piotr is building on those foundations, applying the lessons learned from <em>Disco Elysium</em> to help the Longdue team craft bold, innovative designs at the heart of <em>Hopetown</em>—shaping a new vision for what narrative-driven RPGs can achieve.</p><p>In <em>Hopetown</em>, words are your deadliest weapon, and every choice leaves its mark. Set in a mining town caught between decay and transformation, shaped by ambition, exploitation, and the fragile systems that bind society together, you step into the role of a rogue journalist—a chaotic, self-destructive provocateur who sees humanity as inherently selfish and cruel. Unapologetically cynical and dangerously unhinged, you thrive on poking at bruises, pulling at loose threads, and watching what unravels.</p><p><strong>A Town of Contrasts</strong></p><p>The town itself is an arena of extremes. The suffocating darkness of the mine’s depths mirrors the buried truths of its inhabitants, while the surface world—glittering with the promise of progress—is steeped in corruption and power plays. It’s a place where <a title="Genres > Survival [370 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> depends on who controls the story, and where every decision ripples outward, reshaping not just the world, but yourself.</p><p><strong>Groundbreaking Mechanics</strong></p><p>Building on the legacies of <em>Disco Elysium</em> and <em>Planescape: Torment</em>, <em>Hopetown</em> introduces systems that redefine player agency. The psychogeography system transforms how players interact with the game world: emotions, memories, and conversations replace traditional mechanics like keys and levers, becoming the tools that unlock doors, alter landscapes, and reshape relationships. Progress isn’t just about solving puzzles or finding items—it’s about navigating the protagonist’s fractured psyche and the ripples it creates in the environment.</p><p>Meanwhile, a new journalism-based RPG system gives you the tools to craft stories that shape the world—and yourself. Will you embrace chaos as a gonzo journalist, spinning wild, attention-grabbing narratives? Will you twist reality as a conspiracist, bending events to suit your worldview? Or will you dig deep as a calculated investigator, exposing brutal truths to spark rebellion—or sow complacency?</p><p><strong>A Crucible of Choices</strong></p><p>The mining town is more than a setting—it’s a crucible. What truths will you reveal? What lies will you tell? Will your words inspire hope or destruction? Will you reshape the systems of power, or will they consume you?</p><p><strong>Every Word Matters</strong></p><p>This is a game where everything transforms everything else. Every word you choose matters. Every decision carries weight. And every story you tell changes the world—and the fragile systems that hold it together.</p><p><strong>Why Back <em>Hopetown</em>?</strong></p><p>Backing Hopetown isn’t just about funding—it’s about building a community, backing a vision and casting a vote. Longdue is an independent studio daring to create the kinds of games bigger studios won’t or can’t make—games that challenge their players and let players challenge the games back. With Hopetown, Longdue is building a movement for <em>Disco Elysidum</em>-like narrative-driven RPGs that don’t shy away from complexity, emotion, or ambition.</p><p>Those who register in time for the pre-launch crowdfunding campaign via <a href="https://longduegames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Longdue’s website</a> will gain first access to a limited number of rewards that will be available privately shortly before the crowdfunding campaign goes public.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Contributors from <em>Disco Elysium</em></strong> – Seven people who worked on Disco Elysium across production, narrative and writing, world design, sound, audio, and technical design have contributed to <em>Hopetown</em> to date, bringing their expertise, learnings, and knowledge to this bold new project.</li><li><strong>An All-Star Team of RPG Talent</strong> – Supported by industry veterans with credits on <em><a title="Games > Cult of the Lamb [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/cult-of-the-lamb">Cult of the Lamb</a></em>, <em>The Witcher</em> universe, <em>Yes, Your Grace</em>, and more, Longdue is combining the raw creative energy of <em>Disco Elysium</em> with the best talent in the RPG space to deliver something truly extraordinary.</li><li><strong>A Spiritual <a title="Companies > SUCCESS Corporation [97 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/success-corporation">Success</a>or</strong> – Drawing inspiration from the narrative depth of <em>Disco Elysium</em> and the philosophical complexity of <em>Planescape: Torment</em>, <em>Hopetown</em> redefines what a psychological RPG can achieve.</li><li><strong>Groundbreaking Mechanics</strong> – Introducing innovative systems like psychogeography, where emotions and memories reshape the world, and a journalism RPG system, which empowers players to craft stories that influence perception, inspire rebellion, or enforce complacency.</li></ul></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
