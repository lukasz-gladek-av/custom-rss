<p>As spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-callisto-protocol-dev-striking-distance-studios-has-made-another-round-of-layoffs.1117866/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Cyberia</a> (who also spotted posts confirming Wizards of the Coast subsidiary Skeleton Key's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wizards-of-the-coast-skeleton-key-project-canceled" rel="nofollow">project cancellation</a>), Striking Distance staff members <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jesseleeconceptart_opentowork-activity-7298625255500091392-t4QX" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Jesse Lee</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/zach-volker_it-was-a-tough-morning-at-striking-distance-activity-7298480796674183168-Ft3a" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Zach Volker</a> posted on LinkedIn earlier this week confirming that they were laid off.</p>

<p>Lee, who served as concept art director for Striking Distance for four years, says in his post that "most of the devs" at the studio "were laid off", while Volker says there were "lots of layoffs, including [himself]".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Striking Distance, it's a studio founded by&nbsp;<em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em>creator Glen Schofield back in 2019. The studio's first project was survival horror title&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/callisto-protocol-is-set-in-pubg-universe-apparently" rel="nofollow">originally to be set in the&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>universe</a>, although this aspect of the game was subsequently downplayed.</p>

<p>The game's production was reportedly troubled, with staff <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/callisto-protocol-crunch-is-problem-with-100-hour-work-weeks" rel="nofollow">being asked to work 100-hour weeks</a> in order to finish the project on time.</p>

<p>Eventually,&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol&nbsp;</em>was released in 2022, attracting a range of opinions. Our own Sam <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/callisto-protocol-review" rel="nofollow">"awarded" the game a 4.5 out of 10</a>, praising its "beautiful" visuals but criticizing its story, chaotic combat, and "terrible" boss encounters.</p>




<p>Following&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol</em>'s release, Striking Distance founder Glen Schofield <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-space-co-creator-pursuing-new-opportunities-less-than-year-after-callisto" rel="nofollow">departed the studio</a>, with parent company Krafton confirming his departure was in order to "pursue new opportunities".</p>

<p>A spinoff game,&nbsp;<em>[Redacted]</em>, was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/redacted-callisto-protocol-spinoff-release-date" rel="nofollow">released back in October</a>. Set in the same universe as&nbsp;<em>The Callisto Protocol</em>, the game eschews the&nbsp;<em>Dead Space</em>-style survival horror trappings of its parent, opting instead for a top-down action roguelike approach.</p>

<p>Striking Distance is far from the only studio to lay off staff in recent months. Others include&nbsp;<em>Killer Instinct&nbsp;</em>developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rumbleverse-and-killer-instct-studio-iron-galaxy-suffers-layoffs" rel="nofollow">Iron Galaxy</a>,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-layoffs-veilguard-failure" rel="nofollow">BioWare</a>, and tech giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">Microsoft</a>, among many, many others.</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is all set to release on February 28, 2025, and just 3 days before its launch, the game’s trophy list has surfaced online. With a game like this, players will already be scouring around for all the loot they can find, and between that chaos, you can miss out on some of the trophies the title offers. This guide has collated every Monster Hunter Wilds Trophy, featuring its rarity, description, and title on PlayStation 5.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is the latest instalment of Capcom’s popular series, taking players to an unexplored region called the Forbidden Lands. Here, players will hunt to their heart’s content and defeat strong monsters to acquire better armour and weapons while uncovering the many secrets of this mysterious land and finding the connection between the people of this region and the locales they inhabit.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-monster-hunter-wilds-trophies-and-achievements-are-there-nbsp">How Many Monster Hunter Wilds Trophies and Achievements Are There?&nbsp;</h2>

			<p>Bandai Namco made the announcement that Tekken 8 has sold 3 million copies a year from release, which is a major milestone for the game thus far. It's been said that Tekken 8 has achieved the sales milestone at a faster pace than <a href="https://wccftech.com/tekken-8-cost-three-times-tekken-7/">Tekken 7</a>, which has sold 12 million copies across the globe 10 years after launch. While the sales are slowing down a little bit, Tekken 8 came out of the gate with a major milestone,<a href="https://wccftech.com/tekken-8-has-sold-2-million-units-in-one-month-says-bandai-namco/"> selling 2 million units</a> just a month after going on sale. Since then, it has sold an additional 1 million units over the course of the last 12 months.</p>
<p>"We hope that everyone will stick with us, as we have a lot of cool stuff planned to keep the franchise going," said Bandai Namco.</p>
<p>This information was released in a special Tekken Talk Live that took place yesterday with Katsuhiro Harada, Michael Murray, Kohei "Nakatsu" Ikeda, and Jun Yasuda. The Tekken Talk went into some of the specifics about the upcoming season and what is in store for the players of the popular fighting game. You can watch the livestream that took place down below, where you'll get to hear some important information about the future of Tekken 8 across a two-hour livestream.</p>

<p>Compared to the other two popular fighting games that were released around the same period, Tekken 8 has a little bit to go before reaching the milestone of Mortal Kombat 1 and Street Fighter 6. However, it's doing incredibly well for itself already and has had major updates that have added some very popular fighters, including the return of Jun Kazama, who only had cameo appearances in Tekken 3, 4, and 6. Jun was available in some of the spin-off titles, such as Tekken Tag Tournament and Tekken Revolution. However, she has now returned as a playable fighter in Tekken 8.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco also announced that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b6hYwWoOrDk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anna Williams</a> will be the newest fighter to join the Tekken 8 roster as part of the Character Year 2 Pass. She will be available on March 31 for Character Year 2 Pass owners and will then be available on April 3 for all.</p>
<p>Going into the second year of Tekken 8, summer 2025, will bring some major updates to the game. This includes the release of a new stage and character, with another new character coming in fall 2025, and a new stage with a new character being released in winter 2025.</p>

			<p>Brandon Greene, known to gamers simply as PlayerUnknown, hardly needs much of an introduction, but we'll do it anyway on the off-chance you've been under a rock these past few years. Once a photographer and freelance web designer, PlayerUnknown was arguably responsible for spawning the Battle Royale genre when he started modding DayZ (itself an Arma 2 mod) to add a last-man-standing mode. His first work was DayZ: Battle Royale, inspired by the Japanese movie Battle Royale.</p>
<p>Later in 2013, Greene moved to the newly launched Arma 3 and released another mod called PlayerUnknown's Battle Royale. This mod introduced for the first time the now ubiquitous feature of dropping into the map via airplane. The success of his Battle Royale mods caused professional game studios to take notice of Greene. The first one to do so was Sony Online Entertainment, which hired him to create a Battle Royale mode for its zombie survival game H1Z1. The mode was called <a href="https://wccftech.com/h1z1-king-kill-pc-release-date-confirmed-console-development-paused-focus-fully-pc-version/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">H1Z1: King of the Kill</a>. But it was with Krafton (then still called Bluehole Ginno Games) that his vision was finally realized.</p>
<p>CEO Chang-han Kim brought him to South Korea as Creative Director for a new project that would ultimately become PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, or, as it is more commonly known, PUBG. The rest, as they say, is history. The game launched in late 2017, literally <a href="https://wccftech.com/pubg-30-million-concurrent/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">taking the industry by storm</a> and establishing Battle Royale as the biggest gaming trend. According to estimates, it is the best-selling game ever released on PC with 42 million units, and on Xbox One with 9 million units. Across all platforms, it is estimated to be the fifth best-selling game of all time with 75 million units, behind only Minecraft, Grand Theft Auto V, Wii Sports (which was bundled into the Wii console), and Mario Kart 8/Deluxe. On Steam, PUBG still retains the top spot in the all-time concurrency peak chart with 3.2 million users playing at the same time.</p>
<p>Over time, the game's immense popularity diminished in favor of Epic's Fortnite. However, PlayerUnknown had left his mark and was about to move on to his next and even more ambitious project. In early 2019, he relocated to Amsterdam to establish a new studio called PUBG Special Projects, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playerunknown-no-deadline-years-explore/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealing</a> they had a blank slate to explore new concepts with no strict deadline to follow. Later that year, Greene began <a href="https://wccftech.com/playerunknown-dreams-to-create-a-massively-big-world-for-his-next-game-prologue/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sharing</a> that he wanted to create a massively big world, way beyond current standards, in a game called Prologue.</p>
<p>We didn't hear from him for a couple of years until it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/playerunknown-creates-a-new-independent-studio-after-krafton-inc-departure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the studio had been spun off into the independent PlayerUnknown Productions, with only a minority stake from Krafton. Later in 2021, Greene <a href="https://wccftech.com/playerunknown-says-prologue-will-likely-be-boring-artemis-will-be-planet-sized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> some adjustments to the plan: Prologue would be a tech demo for a subsequent planet-sized game called Artemis. That wasn't the end of the changes to the plan. A couple of months ago, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/playerunknown-drops-free-tech-demo-unveils-roadmap-of-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> it had switched to a three-game plan that started with Preface: Undiscovered World, a free tech demo of the Melba engine now available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2820060/Preface_Undiscovered_World/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Prologue: Go Wayback! (also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943740/Prologue_Go_Wayback/?curator_clanid=45328259" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available for wishlisting on Valve's platform</a>) would instead be a single player survival game where players would explore a detailed world where emergent systems influence gameplay, facing unpredictable weather events and ever-changing landscapes as they attempt to escape the untamed wilderness. Finally, the third and final game that should realize PlayerUnknown's vision is codenamed Artemis,&nbsp;a massive multiplayer sandbox game that is, however, still far away, given that the updated plan has a 10-year roadmap.</p>
<p>I recently had the opportunity to have a nice, long conversation with Brendan 'PlayerUnknown' Greene himself, where he opened up to discuss the games, the studio's plans, and his view of the metaverse, which is starkly different from others we've seen so far in the industry. You can read the full transcript of our chat below.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'The whole drive was just to create these kinds of emergent play spaces that aren't bound by scale. They should be able to scale up to planet size as we've done in Preface. But ultimately, it was always just about creating these bigger, emergent spaces where players can get together and do stuff, play games, or interact in other ways, but really in a shared environment.'</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>You've had a big impact on the Battle Royale genre. Now, you're doing something completely different, and you're building your own studio. How is that going so far, and what was the drive behind this new initiative for your own career?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PlayerUnknown:</strong> The drive was - the reason I got back into gaming was that I fell in love with games with the DayZ mod and ARMA 2 and that idea of this emergent survival space, I really fell in love with. But the thing that I didn't like was just the scale of the world, that there was always an edge to a map.</p>
<p>We've been kind of trapped in these small 20-by-20 or 8-by-8-kilometer worlds for quite a long time. After PUBG, I thought, well, I'd like to do a 100-by-100-kilometer survival game. I thought that would be interesting. You could have trade routes with a world of that size. Imagine Rust on that kind of scale.</p>
<p>We found the way to do a 100-by-100 meant that we could do any scale, because doing it by hand means involving a lot of artists, and it takes a long time to do everything handcrafted. At the time, we had a research director who had a PhD in machine learning, and he thought this would be a good way to generate these worlds rather than doing it in a more traditional way, because then you could do them in real-time. I was told at the time that doing worlds in real time wasn't really a serious thing, but now, four years later, we have a demo on Steam to show that I'm not so crazy, thankfully.</p>
<p>But the whole drive was just to create these kinds of emergent play spaces that aren't bound by scale. They should be able to scale up to planet size as we've done in Preface. But ultimately, it was always just about creating these bigger, emergent spaces where players can get together and do stuff, play games or interact in other ways, but really in a shared environment. I loved playing DayZ and then having that sort of camaraderie with your squad and never knowing what was happening. Trying to recreate that on a massive scale is just something that excited me back then and still does now. The vision has kind of moved on a little from then, but that's where it came from.</p>
<p><strong>How long have you been working to realize this vision?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PlayerUnknown: </strong>PUBG Special Projects started probably 3 or 4 years ago now. Oh, no, it's more than that, five years, because we have people in the studio that have been with me for five years. So it's been a long time, but as an independent studio, just over two years. We had our 2-year anniversary last October, so we are into year three now. It's been 5 years since the idea was established and I started building a team. The core team we have now is pretty much complete. We have 60 people on the team; it's a good, solid studio. It's taken some time, and I've made some missteps along the way, but not having a huge amount of experience when I got into this, it happens. Thankfully, I've met some great people in the last year and a half who have really helped stabilize the idea and get it into something that we can actually do.</p>
<p><strong>Did you experience any trouble managing a growing studio while also developing the project?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PlayerUnknown: </strong>Of course I did. I was a photographer, graphic designer, and freelancer who was then given a team to build a game. I then did PUBG and a press tour for about a year and then got some funding to do this project. I'd never really run a studio. I relied on the intelligence of others, and I made some bad decisions with certain hires in leadership positions, but thankfully, after meeting <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-boss-our-game-still-grows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Polfeldt</a> from Massive, he became a good friend and really helped me see where I was doing stuff wrong and where I could improve. He also helped me hire some great people in leadership roles.</p>
<p>Now, we have Kim Nordstrom as the CEO, Laurent Gorga as our CTO, and Scott Davidson and Petter Sydow on the game team as producers and creative directors. These people really believe in the vision and understand what I'm trying to do. They drilled down our three-game plan.</p>
<p>We thought this was how we should do it: by taking the tech we needed to solve at the time and building games around that. They came back with a plan very similar to that, so I was happy to hear I wasn't super crazy. However, I needed that sort of leadership team that could implement a plan to make it happen rather than just telling me it's fine and never really moving forward.</p>
<p><strong>Do you have the full team over there in Amsterdam, or is it also kind of hybrid or remote?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PlayerUnknown: </strong>I'd say we are hybrid more than fully remote. We have a studio here in Amsterdam that accommodates about 60 people, but we have maybe fifteen of those working remotely. Some work remotely from Amsterdam and other cities in the Netherlands, but others work from other European countries. We hire mostly from Europe because we want to be in the same time zone. With the management team, we've come up with this seven-week sprint, and it's happening this week actually, where we bring the whole team into Amsterdam. We also have a planning week where there's no work done. We all just get together and figure out what we're doing for the next sprint and what's achievable.</p>
<p>We're trying to come up with a system that works for us because I think that fully remote is not ideal, especially when you're creating an idea, though some teams have made it work. We're really trying to make a system that works for us, and I think the seven-week sprint that we have with one week on-site, and again, the people who live in Amsterdam can be in the office if they want to. It's been a challenge to find the right process, but I think we've gone on to something that's pretty good now.</p>
<p><strong>I think one of the key components of&nbsp;the whole project is the engine that you're making. It's interesting because lots of AAA developers are actually moving away from their proprietary engines to Epic's Unreal Engine 5. Then again, they are making traditional games that are not nearly this large. To make a planet-sized game, you definitely need a proprietary engine. I only know of another game that is attempting something like this, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/light-no-fire-is-a-planet-sized-fantasy-online-multiplayer-sandbox-rpg-from-no-mans-sky-developer-hello-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Light No Fire</a> from Hello Games, also based on their own proprietary engine. Can you talk about the Melba engine and what are the technical challenges of trying to make such a big vision come to life?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PlayerUnknown: </strong>It gets back to why I'm doing this. I hate using the word metaverse, but I have heard a lot of talk in the last few years about what people are vying for the metaverse.</p>
<p>You see, Epic is trying to make the metaverse with Fortnite and all these other companies are making their metaverses, and I never really understood them. It just looked like IP bubbles to me. It didn't really seem like anything like the metaverse I thought in my head should be, which is an open digital place. It's like a 3D internet with worlds instead of web pages, and you can just travel between them. I never really saw that happening there. With the way people were talking about it, having a server-client infrastructure, it just doesn't work. You can only have maybe a few thousand or tens of thousands of players together rather than millions of players.</p>
<p>The whole aim of building this engine is to create this world generation platform engine that is going to be open source, and that's why we have left Preface relatively open. You can already mod it to hack the fly speed or the travel speed and shrink the world size if you want.</p>
<p>We're trying to be as open as possible with everything we can and trying to build it with the community, because I think for something to power the metaverse, whatever it is, it has to be open source. It can't be managed by a corporation. It has to be like HTTP, an open-source protocol that everyone can build on and create 3D worlds.</p>
<p>That's what we're trying to achieve with Artemis, and that's why it's 10 years away. We're trying to solve many steps, like building Earth-scale terrains locally first and then adding lots of interaction to that. Again, we're trying to keep it as local as possible and adding identity and marketplaces and all this stuff on top of that.</p>
<p>This is why we have this three-game plan. We recognize that each of these systems is a big challenge to solve. If we take them in small chunks and build on top of each other, I think we have more of a chance of achieving this world creation engine that will hopefully provide some kind of metaverse that isn't hardware-locked.</p>
<p>Kids in Africa should be able to access the metaverse as easily as kids on the West Coast. I don't see these things with the current iterations of what people are calling the metaverse. To me, it looks like strapping rocket engines onto a horse to get to the moon instead of rethinking how you do it and building something new. That's why we're building our engine, if that makes sense. And I hate to use that word, metaverse, because it's been corrupted. To me, it's a fifth place to go. I can create a world and what we're doing with Artemis is like a wilderness. It's like Minecraft survival, right? It's that layer. And then the engine is just open for you to create whatever world you want, and then all these worlds just work together, like a multiverse of worlds.</p>
<p>You should be able to create your own character and dress them however you want and not be bound to just play as your favorite comic book hero. There's so much creativity out there that needs to be given a platform to happen, but I think people are just still thinking in these small bubbles and not about truly big spaces where lots and lots of people can interact together.</p>
<p><strong>It's an interesting subject, for sure. Personally, I've always been a big MMO fan. The way I see it, it's going to be like a massive virtual world, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PlayerUnknown: </strong>Yes, but I don't want to tell people to do something. I can leave systems in place that they can, resurrect the town and create borders and do stuff with the land that you take over by doing something in that town, or you do nothing and just wander around and see things.</p>
<p>I don't want to say this is the game. It's just a world or a world of civilization; mechanics are there if you want them. But if not, you don't have to do anything. You can just run and explore. With Preface, we have this fun thing called Deplex. You can be anywhere in the world, then press F5 or F6, and it brings up a deep link panel where you can just create a hyperlink that brings other people to that point in the world.</p>
<p>I thought, isn't that kind of what an HTTP link is? A hyperlink is just this, a link to a place in the virtual world. So you can go exploring by just friends sending you links rather than having to physically move in the world. You can do that if you want, of course, but it just gives that sort of freedom of exploration to everyone, and I think for worlds of the size we're building, that really needs to be necessary.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'What we've done with Melba is that we do the world simulation locally so that the world is generated locally on your GPU rather than relying on servers to do it. Every agent and every hardware will generate the same world. We know then we can do stuff via ML agents without servers. I don't think servers are a solution to the metaverse or to creating millions of people in the same space. I think it has to be peer-to-peer.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>You mentioned that the world is going to be very large, but you are also aiming to have lots of people eventually online at the same time, on the same server. What's your solution to that? So far, in a 3D world, I think the maximum amount is like 10,000 or 20,000 players at once on a server. If you want to go higher than that, you have to create a custom solution.</strong></p>
<p><strong>PlayerUnknown: </strong>Exactly. And the problem is the server. There's hardware. Well, actually it's not the server as such, it's where the simulation is gone and where it's validated, and that's the issue because you're passing so much data around.</p>
<p>What we've done with Melba is that we do the world simulation locally so that the world is generated locally on your GPU rather than relying on servers to do it. Every agent and every hardware will generate the same world. We know then we can do stuff via ML agents without servers. I don't think servers are a solution to the metaverse or to creating millions of people in the same space. I think it has to be peer-to-peer.</p>
<p>We know we can do secure peer-to-peer with stuff like BitTorrent and blockchain as well, but it's more that peer-to-peer with a hybrid solution, where maybe we have peers that maybe you host, or a service provider hosts, where they do a more taxing simulation like weather or physics, and then people on lower end devices just get sent the data to recreate it on their devices.</p>
<p>But I think as long as the simulation is done locally before the network tick, then all you really have to share is player position and not much else, and that opens up to doing, hopefully, millions of concurrent players. But I don't know yet, because I'm not the tech guy. I have a dream and I try to pursue it.</p>
<p>But really, I think we have to do some kind of hybrid peer-to-peer system because I think doing server-client, as you said, there's physical limits there to how many players you can get. And I think chasing that server client... I think you still need that for certain game modes that will take place in the world. I see it just like sharding off that, okay, there's an FPS game happening here, and we need a different network protocol for this. But for the main world itself, it's peer-to-peer. I think that's probably the only solution to get to the kind of player numbers we need.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, that makes sense. Developers are usually wary of bringing stuff from the server to the client, as there is a legitimate fear that the player may exploit it to cheat.</strong></p>
<p><strong>PlayerUnknown: </strong>For sure, but this is how you look at what we're building, right, because we're not building a game; we're building a world. There will be cheating in the world, but I think the core here is how you offer moderation and how you empower the community to make sure that people who are cheating are easily banned.</p>
<p>And I think it comes down again to one of the core problems we have to solve, which is identity. How do you build a solid identity system that allows people to know that there's consequences to their actions? If you act like an idiot, communities can kick you out. It's like the real world, right? If you go into a supermarket and start shouting slurs, you're going to get kicked out pretty quickly.</p>
<p>There's not that sort of barrier yet online, where people just have anonymity, which I still believe is super important. I don't want to get rid of that, but I still think you need to have a system that ensures consequences for actions. Again, it's about empowering the community. The Internet doesn't ban people; communities ban people, but ensuring that players do have consequences for their behavior, I think there is your solution. But again, it's one of the big problems that we have to solve, and there's many other smarter people than me working on it. So, I don't want to go too deep into it because then I might sound like a fool.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'I thought for moderation, if you're running around shouting slurs all the time, then we can just make sure no one sees or hears you, and make sure you can't interact with anyone. You can still just float around the world like a ghost, and you can see what you're missing, but you can't interact with anything because you've been labeled a f*cking idiot. There's probably many creative solutions, but again, I think my core priority here is putting tools in the hands of the community to allow them to do it.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Do you envision people potentially putting others in virtual jail or something like that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PlayerUnknown: </strong>I thought about this and I thought for moderation, if you're running around shouting slurs all the time, then we can just make sure no one sees or hears you, and make sure you can't interact with anyone. You can still just float around the world like a ghost, and you can see what you're missing, but you can't interact with anything because you've been labeled a f*cking idiot. There's probably many creative solutions, but again, I think my core priority here is putting tools in the hands of the community to allow them to do it.</p>
<p>Because ultimately, if I'm providing a platform for something like the metaverse, then there can't be an authority banning everyone. It can't work like that. It has to be community-driven because that's what great platforms are.</p>
<p><strong>It sounds very sandbox-driven. It's clearly a sandbox-inspired game.</strong></p>
<p><strong>PlayerUnknown: </strong>I love what Garry Newman does. I love what he's done with Rust and the whole dev mentality that he has. Facepunch is just great, so if we're compared to that, it's fantastic.</p>
<p><strong>Let's talk a bit about Preface since it's out now. How was the community's reception?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PlayerUnknown: </strong>In our Discord, it's been great. I have a message from a CTO saying thank you for, like I've never felt this feeling before where the community have taken apart your demo and shrunk the world or made Millennium Falcon speed when moving or they're now adjusting how the hey like when we're switching between waypoints, how that camera movement and and working with the community.</p>
<p>It's been really lovely, seeing that the devs on the team are now posting challenges to the community and going, can you do this? It's really exciting to see people who really get it; they understand what this is. Yes, it's a bit empty for now, but they're willing to work on it and mod it and then try to see what they can create already, which was one of my hopes. It's meant to be an open platform, and it's quite empty right now.</p>
<p>I shouldn't call it a game. It's not a game. It is very much a tech demo. I say it's almost like the early Internet. It's empty right now with very few biomes and not very much to do or see. But I hope people can see the possibilities. If we can generate worlds of this scale for 3.6 GB of space, I think that's super exciting for what creators can do in the future once the tools are there.</p>
<p><strong>I'm reading that it will be in early access for about a year, correct?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PlayerUnknown: </strong>For Preface, this is an engine demo. It serves a purpose, which is that we'll keep iterating on it. It may stay in early access for a year, but it'll just keep being iterated as we keep improving the engine. There may be a full release, but I don't see it like that. It's an engine product rather than a game product. It'll always be iterated on. This is the visualization of what the engine is capable of, and as we improve the engine, the demo should also improve.</p>
<p><strong>Right now, it's free. Once it leaves early access, do you plan to add a price tag to it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PlayerUnknown: </strong>No, it has to stay free. It's like the HTTP, right? It can't be charged for. The engine for the metaverse has to be free and open for everyone. That's our view for Preface. Having someone just download it and run it on their PC is fantastic because it just gives us more data as to how we can improve the engine for everyone and what we have to take into consideration. I don't ever see us charging for preface because that's not the point of it. The point is to have an open source engine for everyone.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We're not trying to reinvent the survival wheel with Prologue. We're trying to make it not realistic, but as intuitive as possible, right? Light fires, find food, eat food, get across the map. As I said, the survival mechanics are not the point of this. I think it'll be interesting what we put into it. But I think the point is to test the ML terrain and make it feel good, make it feel realistic, make it feel playable. That you're not always losing because of something the terrain has done. I don't plan on reinventing survival mechanics here because that's not the point of the game.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Moving on with your plan, then there is Prologue, right? That one is a bit different because it's going to be a single player game, which is a bit new for you, I guess.</strong></p>
<p><strong>PlayerUnknown: </strong>Yeah. Again, it was more about how we leverage what we're doing and create something simple to test, right? I like survival games. When I first started, we discussed the possibility of doing a new map every time you press play. Now, after plugging our machine learning tech into Unreal Engine 5, we can do that. I think it's like 4.2 billion maps, mathematically. Maybe a million or a few million of those are interesting maps.</p>
<p>But the team has enjoyed exploring and discovering how it all works and how these maps are created. It's super exciting to see the progress. We're discovering how this tech works, how this new way of creating terrain can bring us advantages, and what we can do with it. We've just launched playtests on our Discord, where about 200 people are playtesting a very early demo of the game. It's broken, but people are having fun. As I said, I want to build games with the community, not for them. These are our very early steps in doing this.</p>
<p>I keep mentioning the three-game plan because it's about solving the three core problems: building the world, populating it, and filling it with interaction and millions of players. Each of these three things is being tackled by a game. Prologue is tackling the terrain where we generate new terrains every playthrough by using our machine learning tech. That'll help us prove out and mature the ML tech. Then, when we go to game two, which is hopefully on our own engine, we can have that ML tech matured, go bigger, and keep scaling up. That's the intention for Prologue. It's quite a simple game. It's not my next opus, but it serves a purpose, which is that of a testbed for our ML tech.</p>
<p>I still want to make a great single player experience and I'm excited about emergent gameplay in a single player world, kind of like Don't Starve and these games that are unique in every playthrough. Hopefully, we can create an 8x8 world that looks pretty good. Having a unique world every time, I think, gives us something interesting to play with.</p>
<p>That's why I want to work with the community as well, because I don't know how exciting this can be. This is so new and breakthrough that I want to work with them early to get feedback and think, okay, what can we do to make this a better experience from the get-go rather than trying to put band-aids on it like 6, 7 months in the future.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned that Prologue will have some survival mechanics. Is that going to be fairly traditional or are you going to maybe introduce some twists to the formula?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PlayerUnknown: </strong>Yes, we're not trying to reinvent the wheel. We're trying to make it not realistic, but as intuitive as possible, right? Light fires, find food, eat food, get across the map. As I said, the survival mechanics are not the point of this. I think it'll be interesting what we put into it. But I think the point is to test the ML terrain and make it feel good, make it feel realistic, make it feel playable. That you're not always losing because of something the terrain has done. I don't plan on reinventing survival mechanics here because that's not the point of the game.</p>
<p><strong>Let's say the community asks for a co-op mode for Prologue. Would you be interested in adding it, or do you see it strictly as single-player?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PlayerUnknown: </strong>I'm open to anything the community wants, but we have to make sure that we have the resources to do that. I'd love to add co-op because I'm sure I can do it, and it's interesting, but it means adding a multiplayer layer to something we haven't planned to do. If we enter early access and there's a good reception and people are super interested and the game is doing well, then maybe that allows us to scale up and think about it.</p>
<p>But it would be diverging from the purpose, which is trying to make this a solid early access product first, and then we worry about that. But we do plan to release updates every 6 or 9 months or so. I'm not really sure about the timeline yet because we're still working on getting the product ready. We really want to use Prologue as a testbed, not only for the terrain but also for the minute-to-minute, hour-to-hour stuff that you would do in the survival layer of any game.</p>
<p>Maybe we'll scale up the map eventually, maybe we'll add more biomes. There's a lot of stuff we can do over the next few years of Prologue to help us get ready for Melba coming online, and we can learn a lot from the data we get from Prologue.</p>

There's a lot of stuff we can do over the next few years of Prologue to help us get ready for Melba coming online, and we can learn a lot from the data we get from Prologue.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What's your opinion on machine learning for NPCs? I don't know if you've seen the Inworld demos.</strong></p>
<p><strong>PlayerUnknown: </strong>I think micro LLMs and LLMs for NPC interaction could be interesting, right? I want to be careful. I really think that when used correctly, like we're using ML to do our terrain, that's all trained on NASA data or open-source Earth data. I think as long as ML is used in the right way, it can be super useful. It's useful as a tool to speed up an artist's hand or a writer's drafting, but I think using it just to fully replace storytellers and creatives is not the way we should be using it, because I really don't think it's there yet. I think if you're in any way good at anything, you can see the mistakes it makes, you can see that it's not really good. It serves as a flash in the pan, sure.</p>
<p>But I think when leveraged right, it's a very good tool. We're using it at an engineering level to speed up simulation and do simulation locally, and it's very good.</p>
<p><strong>I understand that the platform of reference is, of course, PC, but do you have plans to even potentially release them on consoles, whatever they may be eventually?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PlayerUnknown: </strong>Well, Artemis has to be platform-agnostic. If it is a digital world platform, then it has to run on everything from phones to consoles to PC to VR to anything. At least, that is how I see a platform like that existing. It can't be bound exclusively to high-end hardware. It's just not like that. Even Preface already runs on pretty average hardware, I would say, not super high end, but it still works and you have ray tracing and it looks pretty good.</p>
<p>The idea is that we will scale. The world doesn't necessarily have to look exactly the same for every player. It can have lower LODs or lower textures for one player and other players. As long as you have the interaction, I think it's fine. But when you move into game spaces within the world, then you have to think about these things a bit more carefully. But ultimately, I don't want this Artemis as a platform or that is a world to be bound to any particular hardware because that doesn't serve the purpose of the metaverse. It&nbsp;has to be an open source platform that everyone can use anywhere.</p>
<p><strong>You said that it's a 10-year plan, right?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PlayerUnknown: </strong>Probably 15, but yes.</p>
<p><strong>Are you considering this timeframe from when you started the project?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PlayerUnknown: </strong>From about a year ago. I would say that that's when we really formalized the longer timeline and it came to about 10 years. But that may be quicker depending on whether we solve some of the problems sooner and depending on how the games do. It's trying to be realistic about what we're trying to achieve, which is pretty massive and has to be done the right way.</p>
<p>I want to give the team the freedom to do it the right way rather than doing it in a way that serves to make us money because then I don't think you ever get the Internet, or the metaverse, right. It has to be done with the right spirit or else it just ends up as a monetized piece of garbage. It takes a long time to do something like this.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'I think Artemis just has to be a digital world. There'll be stores where you can buy stuff. I think for me, as a platform holder, I'll have just a financial services fee or something like this, that if we provide a financial layer and you use that to sell goods and services and do stuff in the world, then we'll just take a small tax on that. But I don't think Artemis is a platform that will be monetized by me, because that's not what it's meant to be. It'll be an open platform for everyone to come, you know, hawk their wares, rather than everything coming from me because I don't think that that's the metaverse.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Since you mentioned monetization, of course, it's very, very early days, but what do you envision monetization to be like in Artemis?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PlayerUnknown: </strong>I think it just has to be a digital world. There'll be stores where you can buy stuff. I think for me, as a platform holder, I'll have just a financial services fee or something like this, that if we provide a financial layer and you use that to sell goods and services and do stuff in the world, then we'll just take a small tax on that.</p>
<p>But I don't think Artemis is a platform that will be monetized by me, because that's not what it's meant to be. It'll be an open platform for everyone to come, you know, hawk their wares, rather than everything coming from me because I don't think that that's the metaverse. The Metaverse is everyone comes, everyone can do work and get paid. Buy other stuff.</p>
<p><strong>So players could sell an item for real money.</strong></p>
<p><strong>PlayerUnknown: </strong>Yeah, they have to, right? I mean, that's the metaverse, at least in my head, the one that we've been sold in books and stuff like that. I just see that the current metaverse is everything Ready Player One warned us against, right? It has to be something more open and for everyone and done with the right spirit, or else it ends up like AOL. I think it was a stab at monetizing the internet.</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to use blockchain to track transactions and everything?</strong></p>
<p><strong>PlayerUnknown: </strong>I don't know yet. Blockchain, hashgraph, or whatever other decentralized ledger solution, it's an interesting financial layer for sure, but we really haven't thought about it that seriously. I want to get the world working first.</p>
<p>Even getting a marketplace system that works doesn't need blockchain. It doesn't mean this. It needs a lot of time and economists to try to figure out how we build a marketplace system that works for millions of people trading. That alone is a challenge. There's lots of interesting tech out there, but right now, we're focused on building the engine rather than worrying about anything like that.</p>
<p><strong>I don't know if there's anything else that we haven't touched that you can or want to discuss today.</strong></p>
<p><strong>PlayerUnknown: </strong>I would encourage you and whoever is reading to <a href="https://discord.gg/playerunknownproductions" target="_blank" rel="noopener">join our Discord</a>. We have a pretty good community, still quite small but really active. We're doing play tests in there with Prologue already, and we're scaling up pretty well. If you want to get involved and see what we're doing, come join and help us build something great.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

While it doesn’t elaborate any further on which assets are made with AI and how, the confession has reaffirmed what some fans had been claiming for months. </p><p>The <em>Black Ops 6</em> slop controversy began last October, a week before the game released, with allegations <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7LZ0kokKBQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7LZ0kokKBQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spreading on YouTube</a></span> of certain prestige emblems looking AI-generated.

Loading screens depicted hands with extra digits, a tell-tale sign of work produced by algorithms built on stealing other artists’ work, but not knowing how to count. One loading screen included a black glove with six fingers holding billiard balls. </p><p> The second was a zombie Santa holding up hand that had six fingers. Both were laughably egregious at the time, but also fostered fears that other less obvious examples might also have been AI-generated. The appearance of the Zombie Santa was even worse in the context of Zombies mode’s voice actors <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-zombies-actors-quit-lack-of-ai-protection-its-claimed/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-zombies-actors-quit-lack-of-ai-protection-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">being replaced</a></span> amid a SAG-AFTRA strike for greater AI protections in game acting. </p><p>Activision’s new disclosure comes after previous reports that developers within the company were encouraged to experiment with new AI tools in their work. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A report b<em>y Wired </em>claimed</a></span> an entire paid cosmetic was made with help from AI in 2023's <em>Modern Warfare</em>, after the publisher had greenlit the tools for help with making concept art and marketing materials.

Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer even claimed similar technology would aid in game preservation by making it easier to emulate classics on modern hardware. </p><p>But so far, <em>Black Ops 6 </em>has proven generative-AI tools and the current level of quality control around them often can’t  even get simple static images on loading screens right.

Sony and God of War studio Sony Santa Monica have declined to comment on the topic, but if there is an inkling of truth to the current reports, then it won't be a long wait to see these remasters officially revealed.</p><p>While God of War Ragnarok was the last official game released--and ported to PC in 2024--we do know that one of the two live-service games recently canceled by Sony was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-games-including-a-live-service-god-of-war-report/1100-6528869/">supposedly based in the God of War universe</a>.

<p>My lunch yesterday consisted of air fried lumps of failed pizza dough from a disastrous first batch. One of my new year's resolutions was to learn how to make flawless pizza. This might be against the spirit of asceticism these goals usually incorporate, but such puritan edicts have no place here. The platonically perfect slice, like hailstones battering the word 'bum' into soft cement, is a natural marvel impervious to notions of morality both spiritual and profane.</p>
<p>Would the dough have turned out better if I'd sought the help of Into The Restless Ruins's harvest maiden, who grants the desires of those who petition her? Oh. <em>Oh</em>. The 'harvest' refers to slaughter, not grain. Should have guessed really.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/into-the-restless-ruins">Into The Restless Ruins</a> is a roguelite dungeon crawler deckbuilder. A yawnsome genre prospect on paper, until I noticed that the dungeon you crawl is one you build yourself from your deck. Hang on! That's a bit like the original <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1634/warhammer-quest">Warhammer Quest</a>, my beloved! Only where the tabletop game used a randomised dungeon tile deck to create a sense of mystery, this one inverts the idea by having you build and plan your route before each run.</p>
<p>To a backdrop of chunky 80's synthpop, you'll begin each night by drawing a hand of five tile cards. Some of them are plain corridors or junction points, some are rooms with special effects. A damage-buffing armoury, say, or a place to heal. You get three build points, which normally means you can place three tiles. Your goal here is to go from entrance to exit by unlocking progressively deeper sections of the dungeon through locked seals, which require collectibles. But you also need to return to the entrance at the end of each run before your health runs out, either through combat or because you've let your torch die. You can place bonfire rooms which replenish your torch, but they might end up making your overall layout a little awkward, and it's possible to get completely blocked out of progression.</p>
<p>Your character swings their weapon automatically, but you can finesse combat through movement and positioning. Slain enemies drop glimour, and the harvest maiden will grant you new room cards when you collect enough. You can keep runs short and safe but there's an ominous counter that fills up each night at the top of the screen. I'm certain something bad happens if it fills but I always blocked myself off and had to restart before it got to that point.</p>
<p>This is all wrapped up in Scottish folklore, which is where the harvest maiden comes from, although that version of her <em>was</em> all about the grain. Storytelling is svelte during the actual runs, but room tiles do have snatches of detail. A training room where blood seeps from the dummies. A campfire you can't feel the warmth from. But I think my favourite thing here is - as far as I could tell - you can't pull the map up during the actual runs, which means you have to navigate from plans and memory, perhaps building yourself entire mazes of health and bonfire buffs off to one side to let you harvest glimour. I could have just pressed every key on my keyboard and seen if any of them brought the map up, but I'm choosing to believe this is deliberate because I like the implications. I did press, like, four of them.</p>
<p>If I had to describe it in a single word, I'd say "addicting". And then I'd beat myself up because the correct word is "addictive". And then I'd beat myself up some more because that's a horribly nefarious and cold word to describe something as lovingly made as a nice videogame. Ahem: I had to tear myself away and I want to play more of it. On the wishlist it goes.</p>
<p>You can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2877770/Into_the_Restless_Ruins/">Into The Restless Ruins' demo on Steam here</a>. It's due out this April from Wales Interactive and Ant Workshop Ltd, whose previous forays into ill-lit catacombs include <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2144040/Dungeon_Golf/">Dungeon Golf</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Her kit is admittedly a bit all over the place, but we have the tips to help you master the Limbo ruler and bully the opposition.</p><h2 id="h170517"><a id=""></a><strong>You can dive in or be an off-tank</strong></h2><p>Magik has two prominent play-styles that can find success. The more popular strategy in my experience is using her as a dive character. This means using her Stepping Discs to teleport in from the sides or behind the enemy team, getting an elimination or two, and then returning to safety. I wouldn’t recommend taking on a Vanguard, but any <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-strategist-supports-best-worst-luna-snow-1851738627&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-strategist-supports-best-worst-luna-snow-1851738627">support heroes</a></span> or lonely ranged attackers are perfect targets.</p><p>Another viable strategy is to play Magik as more of an off-tank, to keep enemies from focusing on your team’s Vanguards. The main difference is that you’ll be fighting on the frontline alongside your Vanguards. Feel free to mix it up occasionally and use your stepping stones for a quick dive on the opposing team as well.</p><h2 id="h170518"><a id=""></a><strong>Watch out for the damage falloff on her primary Soulsword attack</strong></h2><p>One of my favorite qualities about Magik is her sword’s reach. The 6.5m length outclasses all other melee units and has helped me get numerous eliminations that seemed just out of reach. However, it does come with a unique drawback of damage falloff. Her primary Soulsword melee only deals the maximum 65 damage if the enemy is within 4.5m. It will then fall to 50 percent at the end of its range.</p><p>This drawback exists in her Darkchild form as well. Although her Soulsword range increases to 10m, the damage falloff begins at 6m and drops to a measly 25 percent damage at maximum range. The key takeaway here is that it’s better to be up close and personal when swinging this sword.</p><h2 id="h170519"><a id=""></a><strong>Animation canceling is your friend</strong></h2><p>Another drawback with Magik’s Soulsword is the slow rate of the attacks. Thankfully, just like other heroes, you can get a lot more damage in with animation canceling. Many of her abilities can instantly cancel the swinging animation, but the sweet spot is right after the sword makes contact. My go-to combos typically follow a loop of Soulsword &gt; universal melee &gt; another ability. Thanks to the damage buff she receives from her <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-season-bonus-team-up-health-damage-1851725468&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-season-bonus-team-up-health-damage-1851725468">Season Bonus</a></span>, I usually just need another Soulsword swing plus melee added to ensure that combo eliminates weaker heroes.</p><h2 id="h170520"><a id=""></a><strong>Stepping Discs and Umbral Incursion should be used often</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="ce2ee11b904b0f1ba0c927304833c524" data-recommend-id="image://ce2ee11b904b0f1ba0c927304833c524" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magik launches upwards towards Iron Man on the practice range." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Magik launches upwards towards Iron Man on the practice range." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ce2ee11b904b0f1ba0c927304833c524" data-recommend-id="image://ce2ee11b904b0f1ba0c927304833c524" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magik launches upwards towards Iron Man on the practice range." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Outside of animation canceling, the proper balance to her weighty attacks is some nifty mobility techniques with Stepping Discs and Umbral Incursion. Stepping Discs is a two-charge ability that teleports her horizontally in whichever direction she’s moving. Aside from becoming invincible to damage during the movement, it also allows her to cast one of two additional attacks for three seconds after teleporting. These special attacks include a wide area-of-effect swing and a demon familiar summon.</p><p>Umbral Incursion is a rapid dash that will slash enemies upward if it makes contact. Its range is longer than her teleport and the potential launcher is a great way to deal more damage. While she isn’t invincible during the dash, Magik can use it to dash upward or downward.</p><p>My advice is to use these liberally with fights and general movement alike. Both abilities are perfect for repositioning around enemies and putting the hurt on them. Pair them together and you can even get in the face of flying heroes like Iron Man. Equally important, the invincibility of Stepping Discs and verticality of Umbral Incursion makes them perfect for making a quick exit.</p><h2 id="h170521"><a id=""></a><strong>If your health gets low in a fight, keep on fighting</strong></h2><p>Whenever a fight gets too dicey for most heroes, the solution is either to use a protective or healing ability, or to escape. The appropriate response in Magik’s case is usually to keep swinging that sword and using her abilities. Thanks to her Limbo’s Might passive, Magik converts 30 percent of the damage she inflicts as bonus health. I can tell you from experience playing with her and against her that she can last a long time in a fight. Once the odds get stacked against her, such as a pesky ranged hero joining the fray, it’s time to leave.</p><figure id="" data-id="b3aa292dbc1e2893291c810f2cbcde19" data-recommend-id="image://b3aa292dbc1e2893291c810f2cbcde19" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Darkchild breaks the ground beneath her as she roars on the Hero information screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Darkchild breaks the ground beneath her as she roars on the Hero information screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b3aa292dbc1e2893291c810f2cbcde19" data-recommend-id="image://b3aa292dbc1e2893291c810f2cbcde19" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Darkchild breaks the ground beneath her as she roars on the Hero information screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h170522"><a id=""></a><strong>Play even more aggressively as Darkchild</strong></h2><p>Magik’s ultimate has her transform into the corrupted Darkchild for 12 seconds. Unlike the Hulk, the ability moveset is the same across both forms. The difference is that everything is enhanced as Darkchild. Attacks can do more damage and land additional hits, Umbral Incursion reaches a longer range at a quicker speed, and cooldowns are lowered across the board. All of it comes together to allow her to deal massive amounts of damage and gain a decent amount of bonus health at the same time.</p><p>Whether you’re diving in the back or pushing up front, the goal of Darkchild is to be aggressive and do whatever you can to get some eliminations.

                <p>An update to the Call of Duty HQ page on Steam confirms that Activision's development teams do in fact use "generative AI tools" as a means to "help develop some in-game assets."</p><p>About a year ago, it came to light that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3862463747997849618" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam would begin to ask developers</a> to disclose if and how AI is used in any given game.

			<p>Just as it seems they are in real life, the museums of Two Point County are in a right old state. Luckily, you’re on hand to become the curator in Two Point Museum, taking charge of these underfunded, understaffed and under-exhibit-filled establishments while pioneering the exploration of everything from dinosaur skeletons to ghostly apparitions and even the wonders of outer space!</p>
<p><iframe title="Two Point Museum | ... MUSEUMS!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wx0_n1fGkWg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It’s easy to lump the Two Point series together, each of them being management sims with a homely art style and a love of puns that could only come from British developers. At a baseline, you’re creating rooms and flows for patrons to pass through, managing the happiness of your team of employees, and trying to make as much money as possible, but each of these games has some striking differences.</p>


<p>For Two Point Hospital, it was about creating a sequence of rooms, taking a patient from diagnosis through to treatment. Two Point Campus upended that with students locked in for a full year of learning, going through term time lectures as you also try to encourage their extra-curricular activities and foster lasting friendships and relationships, hoping to get good grades out of them at the end of the year. Two Point Museum swings back the other way, now with the most freeform and customisable layout for your buildings full of exhibits, and a separate layer that sees you sending employees off on expeditions to find things that belong in a museum.</p>


<p>There’s five overarching themes that run through Two Point Museum –&nbsp;Prehistory, Marine Life, Supernatural, Science and Space –&nbsp;each of which is the basis for the five main museum locations in the game. There’s some really fantastic variation between the five, all permeated by Two Point’s typical sense of humour. Prehistory has that classic dino skeleton museum look to it, that’s immediately contrasted to having to put up aquariums that cater to various fishy demands, the spectres and haunted mannequins of the supernatural, and how the Science museum puts more emphasis on creating steampunk-adjacent exhibits in your workshop. There’s also plenty of crossover between them, so you’ll be hiring experts from other disciplines to support your work in other museums.</p>
<p>That’s felt most heavily when sending teams out on expeditions. There’s a five regions, each filled with points of interest that are home to certain finds, and each with certain requirements and potential dangers. You’ll need to create a team with experts, and sometimes taking janitors, assistants and security staff alongside. Their particular trained skills and perks will give certain advantages to, alongside the single gear slot, cancel out dangers, boost your potential finds, and more.</p>
<p>It’s a good meta layer that you’ll constantly keep returning to, though it can also be a sticking point as you have to keep rolling the dice to try and find that one particular exhibit of the 3 or 4 available, or require you to level up staff and craft particular items to bypass obstacles.</p>

<p>In terms of raw numbers, having five museums (plus a few high score tasks) is a bit disappointing when compared to the 12 distinct campuses and themes in the last game. There’s hundreds of exhibits to uncover, though, and Two Point Museum’s structure through the career is different, having you flit back and forth between museums as you reach each milestone and earn a star, finding new narrative beats at each stage, and with each level having more than just a three star rating to hunt for. Of course, there’s also a sandbox mode that you can play across those core maps.</p>
<p>You’re given more freedom than ever before in how you want to construct your museum. The concept of placing individual rooms is still here for staff rooms, research, gift shops and the like, but the main areas through which visitors meander is as plain a canvas as you could want for. You can just have a totally open sprawl, if you want, but there’s a new kind of partition wall that you can use to create freeform rooms and layouts, adding structure and a flow to how you want visitors to experience your museum –&nbsp;and it’s also important when certain exhibits have particular environmental requirements.</p>
<p>These walls break from the strict grid layout that regular rooms and buildings still have, letting you block things out with diagonals and on the grid’s midpoints. That’s a huge increase in the flexibility it gives you, and in tandem with now being able to paint floor tiles with quartered triangles, it means that you can really customise the look of different areas, but it doesn’t always hang together quite right. In particular, setting a new wallpaper on the building proper won’t stop at a partition wall attached at the half grid, so you have a bit of orange (let’s say) sticking through to the cool blues you wanted next door, and the fill tools to quickly slap a new look down sometimes get confused and paint through to other areas. It can just be a little fussy. Thankfully, placing items is better than ever, defaulting to the grid an 45º angles, but letting you make micro adjustments from that to perfect their placement.</p>

<p>That’s important, because each exhibit needs to be situated in a good spot with access, but also have plentiful decorations, information boards, and more surrounding it to generate as much Buzz and Knowledge for your visitors. It’s can be generally quite straightforward, grouping exhibits together that come from a similar branch of research –&nbsp;all the prehistoric plants in one room with heaters, misters and other plants for decoration, all the dino skeletons together with interesting fossils nearby with thematic tusks, torches and dino footprints on the floor – but each will also have a particular decoration requirement to fulfil to help bump the Buzz level up further.</p>
<p>Your curated experience is really tied together by creating tours that your experts run, walking guests to a sequence of exhibits, explaining things to your patrons (with a bit of playacting), and looking to boost their enjoyment from their visit to your museum. A tour has a bunch of criteria that gives it a rating out of 5, including the overall Buzz, the length (sometimes less is more), the cohesiveness and the quality of the exhibits featured. The better the rating, the bigger the donations you receive, but it sometimes feels impossible to inch a tour past a particular rating –&nbsp;a regular objective –&nbsp;and can lead you to throwing money at expedition after expedition to get there.</p>
<p>Because, believe it or not, it is still all about money, and museums can’t live on entry ticket fees alone. No, there’s obviously the various vending machines, cafeteria and the plushie-filled gift shop to drain your patrons pockets, but if they’re enjoying their time, they’ll also throw any other cash they have into a nearby donation bin.</p>
<p>Each guest will have particular hopes for what they want to see. You’ll need to cover the basics of food, drink and loos, keep the environment neat and tidy, the exhibits in good condition, but they’ll also have a particular dream that you will want to fulfil. Kids might want to have a bunch of interactive exhibits, Cheese-moongers might want some cheesy food, Goths might want to be transformed into a vampire by a prehistoric chair. The usual kind of museum activities…</p>

<p>It’s easy to gloss over some of these finer details, just work on the fundamentals and still generally keep your museum growing and improving. If there’s a really pressing need, icons will pop up over someone’s head to let you know, and you’ve got a lot to juggle with adding security patrols to combat thieves, sending out expeditions, and doing the research and training in-house as well. Still, you can really dive in a get a deeper understanding of how things are going, boost you exhibits with upgrades, train up staff to specialise in particular areas, assign them to specific jobs, mark out zones and more. It’s often good to overhaul your museum’s layout, remix the exhibits you have and make efficiencies, just as it is to buy adjacent plots of land and expand, but this relies on nitty-gritty adjustments without a click and drag to select multiples.</p>

<p>As part of&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>'s first season of DLC characters, iconic fighters like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-heihachi-mishima-dlc-release-date" rel="nofollow">Heihachi Mishima</a>, capoeira dancer <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-reveals-eddy-gordo-as-first-dlc-character-alongside-season-pass-1-roadmap" rel="nofollow">Eddy Gordo</a>, and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>'s Clive Rosfield, and Bandai Namco is continuing to add classic&nbsp;<em>Tekken&nbsp;</em>characters to&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>'s roster with its second season.</p>

<p>Introduced as "Scarlet Lightning" in her debut trailer, Anna proceeds to beat seven bells out of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-victor-chevalier-reveal" rel="nofollow">French agent Victor Chevalier</a>, who's voiced by none other than acting legend Vincent Cassel.</p>

<p>After battling Victor, Anna moves on to taking on Polish Prime Minister (in the game, of course, not in real life) and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-lidia-release-date" rel="nofollow">fellow DLC fighter</a> Lidia Sobieska. As you'd expect given that this is Anna's trailer, the assassin makes short work of Lidia.</p>

<p>Finally, in a showdown for the ages, Anna gets to take on her sister Nina, who once again takes a beating from Anna. We also get to see Anna's Rage Art, which sees her summoning a helicopter to provide fire support as she blasts her opponent with Lovely Tom.</p>

<p>Anna will be released for&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>on April 3rd, with three-day early access available on March 31st for those who purchase the game's second season pass. You can see Anna in action via her debut trailer right here.</p>




<p>The second round of&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>DLC will include not only Anna, but also three more characters, as well as two extra stages. The first stage will arrive in summer, as will the next character after Anna. One more character will arrive in fall, and in winter, the season's final character and stage will launch.</p>

<p>The Two Point series has long been known for its quirky humor, engaging management mechanics, and distinct art style. Two Point Museum is no exception. Following in the footsteps of Two Point Hospital and Two Point Campus, this new entry takes the tried-and-true formula to a fresh setting. If you couldn’t guess by the title, that setting is museums. While it doesn’t break the mold from what Two Point has offered players in the past, the additions it brings to the series—like expeditions and collections—make it a standout title that keeps players hooked.</p>



<h2 id="h-two-point-museum-review"><strong>Two Point Museum Review</strong></h2>



<p>Visually, Two Point Museum retains the same charming aesthetic as its predecessors. Upon your first load into the game, it immediately feels familiar, making it easy for veterans of the series to jump in.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At its core, the gameplay loop also remains simple yet satisfying:</p>

<li>Build out your museum with exhibits.</li>



<li>Attract visitors who pay for entry, gift shop items, and leave ratings on your museum.</li>



<li>Use their feedback and earnings to improve and expand.</li>



<li>Rinse and repeat.</li>
</ol>



<p>The campaign offers a well-paced introduction to the game, easing the sense of being overwhelmed with a structured progression. Each level introduces different environments and museum themes, ensuring variety and keeping things fresh. Whether you’re setting up a traditional city museum, converting a haunted hotel into a set of spooky exhibits, or building a marine-themed waterfront attraction, each setting presents unique challenges and opportunities.</p>



<p>One of Two Point Museum’s standout new features is the ability to send staff on expeditions to retrieve artifacts and exhibits. These can range from fossilized floppy disks to full dinosaur skeletons. Some exhibits require multiple trips to different regions to complete a full display, adding an extra layer of depth to the collection process. However, danger lurks&nbsp; as staff may encounter dilemmas, such as whether to retrieve an artifact teetering on the edge of a cliff, where the wrong decision could result in a lost team member. Occasionally, staff can even go missing entirely, forcing you to hire, train, and build up a replacement.</p>



<p>Adding to the fun, the game mocks loot boxes with an obnoxious animation when expeditions return, reinforcing that signature humor.</p>

<h3 id="h-managing-the-madness"><strong>Managing the Madness</strong></h3>



<p>Beyond collecting artifacts, keeping the museum running smoothly presents its own set of challenges. Managing staff is key, as employees tend to wander off or take seemingly endless breaks if not properly supervised. Visitors also present their own set of problems—families with kids need entertainment, which can mean setting up play areas with oddly positioned ladders, while mischievous guests might climb exhibits when you’d really prefer they didn’t.</p>



<p>Security plays a role, but theft, even on higher difficulty settings, doesn’t feel like as big of a threat as it could have been. Running the museum can get expensive, but (mostly) thanks to grants, finances never feel overly restrictive, even on harder difficulties. The real challenge comes in dealing with Kudosh—the game’s “premium” currency—, which can sometimes be frustrating to earn but never to the point of breaking the experience.</p>



<p>For those who prefer more creative freedom, Two Point Museum includes a robust sandbox mode. Players can choose between creative, career, or hardcore modes, with the latter increasing difficulty through limited cash, a higher chance of theft, and other obstacles. The Steam Workshop integration also opens the door for endless customization, allowing players to add new exhibits, museum themes, and more.</p>



<p>The campaign progression carries over across locations, meaning unlocks and inventory persist as you expand your museum empire. This incentivizes returning to previous museums to complete special exhibits, like one requiring both a marine and prehistory expert, or to integrate newly unlocked features like museum tours and small aquarium exhibits.</p>

<h3 id="h-areas-for-improvement"><strong>Areas for Improvement</strong></h3>



<p>While Two Point Museum delivers an overall enjoyable experience, there are a few areas where it could be refined. The inability to expand or adjust the layout of existing buildings is a bit frustrating, especially as space becomes limited. Although adjacent buildings can be added, the lack of flexibility in modifying layouts feels restrictive. Sure, you can build interior walls, but it’s not the same.</p>



<p>Additionally, the game’s user interface could be more intuitive, particularly when unlocking new areas of the map. For instance, progressing in the campaign requires reaching Level 5 Enlightenment, but the game does not clearly explain how to achieve this milestone, which can be confusing for players. Another missed opportunity lies in the security mechanics. While theft is present, even at higher difficulty settings, as mentioned earlier, it never truly feels like a significant challenge. A more dynamic security system could have added another engaging layer of management. These minor issues don’t detract from the overall enjoyment, but refining these aspects could elevate the game even further.</p>



<h3 id="h-two-point-museum-review-verdict"><strong>Two Point Museum Review Verdict</strong></h3>



<p>Two Point Museum doesn’t revolutionize the series, but it successfully adapts the beloved formula to a new and entertaining setting. Expeditions and collections inject fresh gameplay elements, while the humor and accessible mechanics make it enjoyable for both newcomers and seasoned players. Despite a few minor frustrations with building expansion and UI clarity, the game’s charm, depth, and variety make it an easy recommendation.</p>



<p>Whether you’re uncovering ancient artifacts, dealing with frozen bees and cavemen (who, if thawed, cause chaos on your guests), or wondering why Yetis and vampires are visiting your museum, Two Point Museum has that special something that hooks you.</p>



<p>In my time with the game, it became way too easy to find myself sitting down to play only to realize five hours have passed and it’s now 2am with a baby who wakes up at 6am. Still, Two Point Museum is a one of those games well worth the sleep deprivation.</p>



<p><strong>VERDICT: BUY</strong></p>

However, the script has been flipped—literally! Players now progress sideways, breaking through barriers and building up combos that ramp up the intensity of the effects, rewarding the most skilled players with a dazzling light show. Breaking special blocks offers powerful advantages, like massive brick-clearing blasts, a protective barrier to shield the ball, and a laser cannon to carve a path forward. Each one unleashes stunning dynamic effects, delivering dazzling visuals never seen before in <em>Breakout</em>.</p><p>Featuring 72 challenging levels, players’ brick-blasting skills will be pushed to the brink—but they won’t need to face the challenge alone. Block-breakers can forgo going solo and team up with a friend for local two-player cooperative play and tackle the mayhem together. Alternatively, a new focus mode slows down time, sacrificing a higher score for greater control.</p><!-- AD: content -->

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-konami-new-game-ip</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-2-remake-studio-bloober-team-working-with-konami-on-new-game.1118211/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-konami-new-game-ip<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake developer Bloober Team has announced that it's working on another project alongside Konami, and that the game will be based on Konami's intellectual property.</p>

<p>In a press <a href="https://blooberteam.prowly.com/383560-bloober-team-and-konami-continue-their-collaboration" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">release</a>, Bloober says it's "focusing on a new game based on Konami's IP" and that details of the project "remain a mystery" right now. The studio goes on to say it "can't reveal too many details at this time" but that fans will be "just as excited" about the collaboration as Bloober is.</p>

<p>It's interesting that Bloober is remaining cagey about exactly what IP it's working on. The obvious choice would, of course, be&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>; perhaps the team has been selected to develop another remake. Still, it's a little odd Bloober would play those cards so close to its chest given its work on&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bloober-team-konami-new-game-silent-hill-2.jpg?itok=vItbk2rq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bloober-team-konami-new-game-silent-hill-2.jpg?itok=Uhp93h6U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bloober Team is working on another game based on Konami IP, and it may or may not be&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Given Bloober Team's penchant for horror, it doesn't feel like any other IP makes sense; I can't quite picture a Bloober Team&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid&nbsp;</em>game, for instance, although<i>&nbsp;</i><em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>might be a slightly easier pitch.</p>

<p>If you ask me, I think it'll likely be a remake of the original&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>. Remaking the third game before the first makes no sense to me since they share plot elements, and while I'd love&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 4: The Room&nbsp;</em>to get a remake, it hasn't been that long since <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-4-room-comes-to-gog-for-gogs-12th-anniversary" rel="nofollow">the game was re-released on PC</a>.</p>

<p>Either way, picking Bloober Team to work on a new Konami game makes sense given their first collaboration's success; Konami recently revealed that the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">topped two million sales worldwide</a>,&nbsp;</p>




<p>It's been a pretty active time for Konami recently in terms of its major franchises. After many years of dormancy, the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake launched in October, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-and-more-all-but-confirmed" rel="nofollow">more&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>projects are on the way</a>&nbsp;as well.</p>

<p>Not only that, but <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">in August</a>, Konami will release&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>, a full remake of the 2004 stealth-action classic built in Unreal Engine 5 and sporting revamped gameplay.</p>

<p>Now, all Konami needs to do to complete the trifecta of my childhood dreams is to revive&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>. It's been so long that I'd even take a remake at this point, although I'd prefer an entirely new game, of course. Stay tuned for more!</p>
