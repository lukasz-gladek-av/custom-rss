<p>A new Ghost of Yotei trailer shows off one of Atsu’s newest weapons, the brash odachi, in combat gameplay. </p>



<p>The highly anticipated sequel to 2020’s Ghost of Tsushima, Yotei looks to live up to what came before and more. Following a vengeful mercenary on the hunt for her family’s killers, the game has been rolling out new content every week. Now, a month from the October 2nd release date, we’ve got new footage of a new weapon in Atsu’s arsenal: the odachi.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8ivos7Bnjs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the trailer above</a>, we see protagonist Atsu unleash another weapon in her collection, the odachi. A longer version of the katana, the weapon’s length can shorten the distance between your blade and an enemy. While not as fast, it can deliver devastating blows to foes and thin a crowd should you be overwhelmed. </p>



<p>Weeks prior, we’ve seen footage of the kusarigama, yari, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghost-of-yotei-firearms-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">firearms in action</a> in Ghost of Yotei. With the odachi trailer out, it leaves the dual swords, katana, and bow left. It does fit quite nicely with the timeline, ending right near the upcoming release date. As one of PlayStation’s biggest titles of 2025, fans won’t have to wait long to get their hands on it, especially if they are at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-tokyo-game-show-2025-lineup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tokyo Game Show</a>. Still, given the many accolades Ghost of Tsushima received at launch, Yotei may live up to the Ghost moniker in the Game of the Year discussion.</p>



<p>Are you going to use the odachi in Ghost of Yotei? Looking forward to its October 2nd release? Let us know in the comments below and on the forums!</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/munchkin-vox-machina-brings-first-critical-role-campaign-to-iconic-card-game</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/munchkin-vox-machina-brings-first-critical-role-campaign-to-iconic-card-game.1289283/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Steve Jackson Games has announced another collaboration with Critical Role. Their newest project, <em>Munchkin Vox Machina</em>, combines the addictive, zany card gameplay of Munchkin with the heroes, villains, and events of the actual play series' first campaign.</p>

<h2>The <em>Munchkin Vox Machina</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to the store page, <a href="https://munchkin.game/products/games/munchkin-vox-machina/" rel="nofollow"><em>Munchkin Vox Machina</em></a> is based on the first campaign of Critical Role. The campaign that made Critical Role into the wildly successful multimedia company that it is today, producing blockbuster TTRPGs like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/daggerheart-review-narrative-forward-yes-and-ttrpg-that-is-force-to-be-reckoned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a> and beloved animated shows like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-confirms-2026-release-for-legends-of-vox-machina-s4-announces-fifth-and" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Legend of Vox Machina</em></a>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/munchkin-vox-machina-game-board.jpg?itok=y5rfuNFn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/munchkin-vox-machina-game-board.jpg?itok=0curuzqX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The core gameplay is still the same Munchkin goodness. Explore, get loot, defeat monsters, and reach level 10 before anyone else does.It is the same malleable core loop that made <em>Munchkin</em> a household name since 2001, spawning countless <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-munchkin-babies-game-spits-up-over-tables-in-2022" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">spin-offs</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/munchkin-big-box-brings-definitive-game-to-backerkit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">collector's editions</a>.&nbsp;The game is designed for 3-5 players ages 10+ and takes about 1-2 hours to finish.</p>

<p>Like their previous collaboration, <em>Munchkin Mighty Nein</em>, you play as a member of the iconic adventuring party. Each character has a thematically appropriate special ability. For example, Grog Strongjaw's <em>Heart of Gold</em> gives you a power boost if you help or get help in an encounter. The set will even include a d20 for some tabletop-themed shenanigans.</p>

<p><em>Munchkin Vox Machina</em> contains more than just the titular party. The game is packed with support characters like Shawn Gilmore, devious foes like Delilah Briarwood and Thordak, Leader of the Chroma Conclave, and powerful items like Percy's pistols and legendary Vestiges of Divergence like the Titanstone Knuckles.</p>

<p>A copy of <em>Munchkin Vox Machina</em> contains the following:</p>

<ul><li>172 Cards</li>
	<li>7 Character Cards</li>
	<li>A Deluxe Game Board</li>
	<li>7 Standies with Plastic Stands</li>
	<li>A Six-Sided Die and a Twenty-Sided Die</li>
	<li>A Rulesheet</li>
</ul><p><em>Munchkin Vox Machina</em> will be available in retail stores on March 2026. It will be sold at an MSRP of $39.95.</p>

<p>The upcoming Street Fighter film now has an official release date: October 2026.</p>



<p>Originally being distributed by Legendary, the live-action adaptation of the iconic Capcom fighting series is coming to theaters soon. In the past few months, the cast has slowly been revealed. With Warrior’s Andrew Koji and The Recruit’s Noah Centineo as leads Ryu and Ken, the ensemble is quite fitting of the franchise. From rapper 50 Cent as Balrog to wrestler Cody Rhodes as Guile, fans are excited to see it come to life. Fortunately, as filming continues, the movie now has a new distributor, as well as an official theater date.</p>



<h2 id="h-street-fighter-film-now-distributed-by-paramount-synopsis-revealed">Street Fighter Film Now Distributed by Paramount, Synopsis Revealed</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Street Fighter film now releasing Oct 16, 2026 under Paramount </p><p>Logline: “Set in 1993, estranged Street Fighters Ryu (Andrew Koji) and Ken Masters (Noah Centineo) are thrown back into combat when the mysterious Chun-Li (Callina Liang) recruits them for the next World Warrior… <a href="https://t.co/7bK7UEnkCY">pic.twitter.com/7bK7UEnkCY</a></p></div>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1963680725808390578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 4, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In an article from <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-movie-plot-cast-1236361494/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, Paramount Pictures is now distributing Street Fighter. The studio inked a deal with its previous distributor, Legendary, for three years. With the news, the studio revealed the official release date: October 16th, 2026. The film had started filming earlier last month, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-noah-centineo-ken-tease/">teases of looks</a> from several actors.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the first synopsis of the Street Fighter film is now out. The logline, shared by <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/street-fighter-movie-plot-cast-1236361494/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, is available below.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Set in 1993, estranged Street Fighters Ryu (Andrew Koji) and Ken Masters (Noah Centineo) are thrown back into combat when the mysterious Chun-Li (Callina Liang) recruits them for the next World Warrior Tournament: a brutal clash of fists, fate, and fury. But behind this battle royale lies a deadly conspiracy that forces them to face off against each other and the demons of their past. And if they don’t, it’s GAME OVER!”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition, new cast members have been announced, filling out the roster. This includes Reacher’s Olivier Richters as Zangief, Cobra Kai’s Rayna Vallandingham as Juri, SNL’s Kyle Mooney as Joe, and Mortal Kombat’s Mel Jarnson as Cammy. </p>



<p>There’s a lot riding on the new adaptation of Street Fighter, to say the least. Previous Hollywood adaptations have been decent, despite some great casting like Raul Julia as M. Bison and Ming Na Wen as Chun-Li. Still, there’s a lot of potential with the series and, with the recent Hollywood successes of Minecraft and Fallout, perhaps Street Fighter will join them.</p>

                <p>Last month, the long-awaited <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/titan-quest-2-early-access-will-begin-this-summer/1100-6531406/">Titan Quest 2 arrived in early access on PC</a>, and according to THQ Nordic, it sold 300,000 copies in just its first three days. While reacting to that news, former THQ vice president of studio operations Richard Browne shared a few of the reasons why Titan Quest 2 wasn't released almost two decades ago.</p><p>On <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7358661819734921216/?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28ugcPost%3A7358661819734921216%2C7358864581047341056%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287358864581047341056%2Curn%3Ali%3AugcPost%3A7358661819734921216%29" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> (via <a href="https://gameworldobserver.com/2025/09/03/former-thq-vice-president-the-development-of-titan-quest-2-was-first-approved-19-years-ago-but-it-was-halted-due-to-marketing-issues-and-the-lead-game-designer-not-being-pr-friendly" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game World Observer</a>), Browne noted that THQ had given the greenlight for the sequel in 2006. However, the development team at Iron Lore Entertainment couldn't get past THQ's marketing department, which rejected the proof-of-concept demo.</p><p>"[Titan Quest] was one of those games that just sold and sold; but our marketing department didn't see it," wrote Browne. "We had a great 360 demo with the camera lower and controlled--they nixed it using 'Emsense' to show that the demo (three months work) didn't resonate."</p><p>Emsense utilized sensors that monitored players' heart rate, breath rate, and other factors to measure their response to a given product. Because Titan Quest 2 didn't get a favorable response through Emsense, that was one of the justifications for shelving the project.</p><p>Browne also mentioned that the marketing team wasn't eager to work with the game's lead designer, Brian Sullivan, whom they considered as "not being PR friendly."</p><p>"Brian was great," recalled Browne. "He [was just] a khaki shorts, black socks, and loafers kinda [guy] and that made their job hard."</p><p>Titan Quest 2 eventually ended up in development under Grimlore Games for THQ Nordic. The sequel is currently only available on PC during its early access period. But the game will eventually be released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S as well.</p>

              <p><em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em> is the second best-selling game of all time. Only <em>Minecraft</em> beats it. No other game even comes close. So it’s not surprising that after more than a decade, people expect big things from <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>. But the growing gravity well around the game’s impending release transcends fan hype and bullish proclamations from LinkedIn-pilled industry watchers. The vibes keep intensifying to the point of bordering on desperation. <em>GTA 6</em> will be huge. <em>GTA 6</em> <em>must</em> be huge.</p> <p>Out of this uniquely volatile cocktail comes statements like the following. “I mean, there are AAA games and then there’s AAAA games and I’d argue that<em> Grand Theft Auto</em> is potentially the AAAAA game, it’s just bigger than anything else both in the scope and scale of the game and the kind of cultural impact that it has and the attention it demands,” Devolver Digital co-founder Nigel Lowrie <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-hollow-knight-silksong-is-this-years-gta-6-and-whether-a-juggernaut-stomping-on-your-release-date-really-matters">told <em>IGN</em></a> this week.</p> <p>It was in the context of a conversation about how smaller companies navigate the minefield of modern release dates, where at any moment all of the oxygen could be sucked out of the room by bigger hits, suffocating a game’s chances of finding an audience before players even give it a try. Hardly anyone was staking out release dates for the fall until Rockstar announced that <em>GTA 6</em> had been delayed to May 2026. Even now, <em>Silksong</em>‘s surprise release date announcement just last month drove scores of other indie games <a href="https://kotaku.com/every-game-delayed-silksong-hollowknight-demonschool-baby-steps-cloverpit-2000620407">to get out of the way</a> of its September 4 launch.</p>

 <p>Lowrie suggested <em>GTA 6</em> has the power to “blot out the sun” when it comes to attention in the gaming world. “AAAAA” isn’t just a reflection of the long-awaited open-world game’s budget, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-development-began-in-earnest-in-2020-following-the-massive-success-of-red-dead-redemption-2-take-two-says">suspected to be over $1 billion</a>, or its marketing, which by some estimates is likely to cost another half-billion. Nor is it just a testament to the consumer spending crater that will be left in the wake of its sales, <a href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2025/08/03/grand-theft-auto-online-safety-laws/">projected by one analyst</a> to be $10 billion over the life of the game, not including any new <em>GTA Online</em> component.</p> <p><em>GTA</em> 6 being the first “AAAAA game” is also a prediction about the way it will funnel humanity’s collective boredom and curiosity into a cultural singularity that trumps everything from 2023’s Barbenheimer to this year’s viral “Coldplay couple.” That’s the growing consensus at least, which grows more conventional with each passing month. And like the bond ratings that gaming’s triple-A shorthand for blockbusters is borrowed from, “AAAAA” is as much a prediction about possible futures as a measurement of current facts.</p>

 <p>Publishers want their games to sell lots of copies and fans want those games to be great or even, in the rarest cases, life changing. But with <em>GTA 6</em> there’s as much a hope that it will be transformative as there is a sense of potential panic if it’s not. After years of being in the driver’s seat, console gaming has stalled out. While industry boosters tout the size of the overall gaming market compared to Hollywood and sports, <a href="https://www.matthewball.co/all/stateofvideogaming2025">growth over the last five years was effectively flat</a>. Social hubs like <em>Roblox</em> surging in popularity is great for their investors, but another sign that traditional gaming is on the back foot.</p> <p>Even outside of the numbers, the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S console cycle has felt surprisingly unexceptional. There have been plenty of great games, sure, but nothing hardware-defining the way some of the biggest hits from the second half of the PS4 and Xbox One era felt. Fans searching for that unmistakable feeling of “next-gen” magic from years past are left to comb over Digital Foundry forensics like lapsed believers threatened by a crisis of faith.</p>

 <p>Consoles increasingly struggle to distinguish themselves in much the same way smartphones keep adding more camera lenses to convince you you’re upgrading more than just RAM. <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps6-leak-specs-sony-handheld-price-release-date-2000614206">The latest leaks</a> suggest the new hardware from from Sony and Microsoft is just a couple of years away and will be even less of a generational leap. And why should they bother if half of their current install base won’t be updating anytime soon? I can’t wait for system architect Mark Cerny to show me how much better Joel and Ellie’s hair looks in <em>The Last of Us Part 1</em> when it gets ported to PS6.</p> <p>What an “AAAAA” rating for<em> GTA 6</em> really means is that it’s the only game people believe can single-handedly shift those trends. Proof of what the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, the only consoles it’ll be available for at launch, are truly capable of, from <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-gta-vi-new-trailer-gameplay-story-1851779368">cutscene-level shooting animations</a> to <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-trailer-2-beer-graphics-grand-theft-auto-rockstar-1851779653">mouth-watering condensation on beer bottles</a>. A best-seller that doesn’t just move copies of the game but reignites sales in a flagging console race to once again grow the total install base. A sign, perhaps, that the most polished and sophisticated craftsmanship money can buy can once again capture the imagination as much as a crudely <a href="https://kotaku.com/grow-a-garden-roblox-5-million-active-users-record-pc-1851781824">reskinned Cookie Clicker in <em>Roblox</em></a>.</p> <p>Even if <i>GTA 6</i> can shower shareholders with a historic new windfall, if it can’t do those other, grander things it’ll be the surest evidence yet that the “AAA” rating, and the aura farming it does in the video game industry hype cycle, was a junk bond status all along.</p>

<p>No, you're not hallucinating — that is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> live on the Switch eShop. After <em>years</em> of waiting, Team Cherry has delivered its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> follow-up today (4th September 2025), with Hornet taking centre stage this time around.</p>
<p>Now, as you're no doubt are aware at this point, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwwfrbrtwc2x">review codes for Silksong were not available prior to the game's launch</a>, so we're currently playing it right alongside you lot. We'll have our full review out as soon as we've trudged the breadth and depth (heights?) of Pharloom, but in the meantime, we wanted the team to get together and share their early thoughts on the games.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067omsjig&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Of course, we also want to hear what you all think of Silksong so far. We're sure there's still hours of content for everyone to discover, but what are you liking most so far? Do you have a favourite location or boss? Let us know in the comments, but first, here's what team NL thinks so far...</p>
<h2>The devil's in the details (Ollie Reynolds, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d55792e15b4cb/hollow-knight-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I must admit, I wasn't <em>quite</em> so hot on the original Hollow Knight compared to my pals here at Nintendo Life. I liked it well enough, but I just felt like something was missing... I still can't quite tell you what, though.</p>
<p>Playing through the opening moments of Silksong, however, I suspect I might just enjoy this one a little bit more. Hornet feels a lot more agile than Hollow Knight's protagonist, and I love the little backstep she does before turning in the other direction; a blatant nod to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/castlevania_symphony_of_the_night">Symphony of the Night</a> if I ever saw one.</p>
<p>The environment is generally a lot more visually pleasing too, with floating embers lighting up the background, and the soft, mossy ground sinking ever-so-slightly as you make your way across.</p>
<p>That said, small details aside, this is very much 'more Hollow Knight' so far, and I can only hope that the game has a few more tricks up its sleeve as I progress.</p>
<h2>What's a Silksong? (Gavin Lane, editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c69b7b749562a/hollow-knight-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Look, I just started Hollow Knight a couple of weeks back, so after resisting downloading this in the eShop frenzy earlier — despite having access to the page while all around me were crashing! — I'll do the responsible thing and wait for a sale on this one. First discount will be in, what, 2029?</p>
<p>Sorry. Next!</p>
<h2>Rewiring my bug brain (Jim Norman, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/562bb413f3cfc/hollow-knight-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><em>Yikes</em>, well I'll change the tone from Gavin's entry as I <em>am</em> playing the game and that I <em>love</em> Hollow Knight — like, <em>really love</em> it. Whether that puts me in a more or less favourable position going into this sequel, I'm not sure, but I'm very much enjoying what I've seen so far.</p>
<p>But of course I do, right? It looks, sounds, and feels exactly like Hollow Knight... except for when it doesn't. I have lost <em>so much</em> health in my first two hours through forgetting that my faithful Down Slash is now more of a Diagonal Slash. I chained a couple of them together in a speedy bell-based mini-boss, and it certainly did <em>feel</em> good, but I can't help but wonder how long it's going to take me to stop trying to claim the high ground over airborne enemies, only to immediately yeet Hornet into diagonal danger below.</p>
<p>The same can be said for my Bind button. How many times am I going to mistakenly hit 'A' and then curse as I waste a reel of Silk? Probably not too long, in all honesty, but it feels weird having to rewire my little bug brain with all of this 'same but different'-ness.</p>
<h2>A bit Alien (PJ O'Reilly, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f6f65aa92ece3/hollow-knight-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It took a while to get downloaded thanks to the great eShop crash of 2025, but now that I'm in and playing (and as someone who hasn't been quite as excited as a lot of folk are for this particular game), well, Silksong is very nice to look at, and it plays wonderfully smoothly on my Switch 2 so far.</p>
<p>Team Cherry are maestros of creating rich and all-encompassing atmospheres, they can conjure a real depth to their vibes from a single screen of action, and Silksong is standing out most to me in this regard thus far. Not much more than an hour in and I've already been having blackouts in a weird cave that looks like something <a href="https://www.hrgiger.com/">H.R Giger</a> has been hiding in the back of his garden, got to grips with some light platforming around some very lush forestry, and been amazed <em>all over again</em> at how often a tiny bug can kill me. Especially when I bump into one mid-air with some big shiny spikes below to cushion my fall.</p>
<p>It's challenging from the get-go, it looks and sounds the business, and I'm all in for seeing how things develop. Oh, and isn't it nice, too, that the game is actually real. Who knew?!</p>
<h2>Sound the bells! (Alana Hagues, deputy editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1f72decf85618/hollow-knight-silksong.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life / Team Cherry</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm going to build on something PJ and Jim mentioned — Silksong feels a lot harder right out of the gate. Not only that, Pharloom feels a hell of a lot more hostile than Hallownest did in its opening hours. I've already met enemies that take <em>two</em> masks of health off of you in the first few areas, spikes that pop out of the ground and catch you off guard, hot coal that blows up in my face after breaking a jar, and burning lava that will damage Hornet unless you jump repeatedly. <em>And I'm loving it</em>. Thankfully, it's a little more generous with benches this time around.</p>
<p>Hornet herself is much more brash than The Knight; she actually has a voice for a start, but she's always a little cold and reserved when talking to NPCs. Speaking of the other characters, I'm delighted that Team Cherry has just made a bunch more Weird Little Guys™ that make silly noises and do silly things.</p>
<p>But, if I'm going to pick one early standout, it's not Hornet's moveset, the gigantic forgemaster with the tiny tools, or the harshness of this new world: it's the score. Christopher Larkin has somehow upped his game for Silksong and, so far, Pharloom's music is hauntingly beautiful and ethereal. Despite how gnarly and tough the world is, the soundtrack makes me feel reflective and sombre. I can laugh at my self-inflicted deaths and the unusual little bugs everywhere, but I can't help but feel empty and unsettled by the music (in a good way).</p>
<p>Oh, and one final shoutout — Bell Beast is precious and I love them.</p>

			<p>Dying Light: The Beast is due to launch in a little more than two weeks from the time of this writing, and Techland has been publishing a series of <a href="https://wccftech.com/techland-bts-creating-dying-light-the-beast-road-to-launch/">behind-the-scenes</a> developer blogs and releasing new trailers leading up to its September 19, 2025 launch.</p>



<p>Today's <a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/behind-the-beast-parkour-and-combat">deep dive</a> included the release of a new trailer, showing off more gameplay and Kyle Crane's struggle with controlling the Beast within him.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast — Part 2: Out in the Wild" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V-mmibvJRQ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Alongside the new trailer, Techland delved into its approach to parkour and combat mechanics in Dying Light: The Beast, adding "<em>over 100 new animations</em>" and 17 new grab animations to properly convey Crane's agility and ferociousness.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast was technically supposed to have launched by now, with its initial release date set for August 22. Less than a month before that August date, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-receives-four-week-delay/">Techland announced</a> it had delayed the game by four weeks to September 19.</p>



<p>When we last checked the game out for a<a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-final-hands-on-pc-preview/"> final preview</a>, Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto wasn't able to give any definitive thoughts on what he played due to only being able to check out an early part of the game, but he was sure about one element, saying, "<em>One thing's for certain though: years of captivity have turned Kyle Crane into a raging beast</em>." </p>

              <p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em><a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-steam-eshop-crashing-twitch-game-pass-hollow-knight-2000623137">may have crashed Steam, PSN, and the Switch eStore with its launch</a>, but that doesn’t seem to have hurt its success any once they all crawled back online. Team Cherry’s enormously anticipated Metroidvania sequel has just reached over half a million concurrent players on Steam alone. That’s a figure that doesn’t include Xbox, PlayStation, or Switch numbers, nor indeed PC players who bought the game on GOG or elsewhere, or who are playing it via Game Pass. It’s fair to say things are going pretty well.</p> <p>At around 10.30 ET this morning, September 4, <em>Kotaku</em> team members began dropping&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>‘s concurrent player numbers as <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1030300/charts/">compiled by&nbsp;<em>SteamDB</em></a> into the Slack. 156,271 was the first big number to astonish us. The original&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>‘s all-time peak was 72,916, and even that was set only yesterday. On release in 2017, it was lucky to see just a thousand, its popularity building up to a big August 2018 spike of 10,000 concurrent players. It took until May 2022 to find 20,000, and only hit those numbers again last month after the announcement of the release date for the long-delayed sequel. I explain all this because it’s fairly important context when looking at the hundreds of thousands who have shown up for <em>Silksong</em>.</p> <p>By 12.30 today, that number had reached 245,587, and it seemed like it might be time to write about hitting a quarter of a million. But the number kept going up. At 1 p.m. it was 382,195, and just six minutes later had risen to over 400,000. At 1.30, 478k, and then at 2 p.m. it reached a ridiculous 534,450. That makes it the game with the 18th highest number of concurrent players on Steam, <em>ever</em>. It just beat the hugely popular&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>beta weekend into 19th. That, let’s not forget, was a&nbsp;<em>free</em> weekend with a multiplayer game—this is a 2D single-player platformer.</p>

 <p>Of course, a large part of&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>‘s launch day success is the extraordinary build-up and anticipation it’s received. Absent from industry showcases for years on end, its potential audience became almost cult-like <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-world-showcase-no-show-1851416028">as it endured the long stretch of silence</a>. The original&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight&nbsp;</em>was much more of a sleeper hit, slowly building its audience and reputation, hence lacking any headline spike at any point over the last eight years. It’ll be interesting to see how long <em>Silksong</em> can maintain this momentum, as people get over the sense of disbelief that it actually really exists and is finally here. The number has started dropping for the first time all day as I’ve written this, just by five thousand or so, but it suggests it’s calming down for the moment. Of course, this could start climbing again once the U.S. workforce that <em>didn’t</em> book the day off are released home to reach their computers and consoles.</p> <p>In the meantime, it strongly suggests that Team Cherry were <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-when-release-live-price-hollow-knight-steam-2000621785">very wise to pick the price point that surprised so many</a>. Yes, the game could absolutely have sold incredibly well at $60, based on reputation alone, but going for $20 vastly increases the potential audience who will pay right now, rather than waiting six months for a 90 percent off Steam sale. Given the half a million people simultaneously playing on Steam likely only represents a fraction of those who will have bought the game today, this will be a massive financial success. And we’re just talking about <em>today’s</em> sales.</p> <p>Whether the game’s actually good or not? That, rather intriguingly, is something everyone’s finding out simultaneously today, given no review code was supplied to press. The lines who played a brief demo at Gamescom had an inkling, but it’ll be tomorrow before consensus begins to appear.</p>

Neither Sony, Nintendo nor Microsoft make player numbers public, but Silksong crashed those storefronts, too, so it will be massive everywhere.

                <p>One of the most-anticipated upcoming features for the soccer game Rematch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-cross-platform-games/2900-5425/" data-ref-id="2900-5425">cross-play support</a>, has been delayed. Developer Sloclap announced today that the update has been pushed to an unspecified point in the future after the team discovered an issue. The patch was set to be released this week, so the last-minute delay is frustrating some fans.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1963629952139424001" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>, Sloclap said its "final tests" found a "major matchmaking issue" related to cross-play, and that's why it's delaying the update.</p><p>"Since cross-play is the heart of Patch 3, we've decided to delay the release while we fix it. We know this is disappointing and we're truly sorry for the repeated delays. Thank you for your patience and support. We'll share a new update as soon as we have more news," the developer said.</p><p>This is actually a second delay for the cross-play update, as Sloclap was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rematch-patch-notes-detail-whats-new-cross-play-update-coming-soon/1100-6533965/" data-ref-id="1100-6533965">originally aiming to launch it by the end of August.</a></p><p>In addition to cross-play, Patch 3 for Rematch will make some gameplay changes, including tweaks to the volley system. "This will also remove certain situations in which players seemed to be moving very fast towards their volley target, which felt both unrealistic and unfair," the developer said</p><p>Additionally, Patch 3 reduces the power boost that stems from the aerial extra effort volley shot.</p><p>Rematch launched in June and reached more than 5 million players after a month, but the $30 game hasn't necessarily sold that many copies, as it's also available on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Game Pass</a>. The game takes place decades in the future and there are no fouls, offsides, penalty kicks, ties, or shootouts.</p>

                <p>Players can finally get their hands on the long-awaited Hollow Knight: Silksong, and with its launch also comes the release of the game's soundtrack.</p><p>Composer Christopher Larkin shared the link to the soundtrack, which is <a href="https://christopherlarkin.bandcamp.com/album/hollow-knight-silksong-original-soundtrack" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available to purchase on Bandcamp</a> for $11.99. The Silksong soundtrack is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3928720/Hollow_Knight_Silksong__Official_Soundtrack/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">also for sale on Steam</a> at the same price, but users can buy both the game (normally $20) and the soundtrack at a discounted $25.58.</p><p>The Silksong soundtrack contains 53 tracks, compared to the original Hollow Knight soundtrack, which included 26 tracks. Another music release titled "Hollow Knight: Gods &amp; Nightmares" had 15 tracks from the original game's DLC. That's all to say that Silksong has a larger soundtrack than both the original game and its DLC combined.</p><p>Both the Hollow Knight soundtrack and the Gods &amp; Nightmares release are also streaming on Spotify and Apple Music, though there has been no official word at this time about any streaming debut for the Silksong soundtrack. The original Hollow Knight soundtrack even <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hollow-Knight-Original-Soundtrack-Limited/dp/B07RWDS264?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">received a vinyl record release</a>, which is still available.</p><p>Larkin also composed the music for the original Hollow Knight and its DLC. His video game discography also includes the soundtracks for Pac-Man 256, Outfolded, and the upcoming Moonlighter 2. As described on <a href="https://composerlarkin.com/portfolio-item/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Larkin's personal website</a>, the Silksong musical score "extend[s] on the established musical world of Hollow Knight from soft melancholic pieces to soul thumping, heart racing boss themes and beyond."</p><p>Of course, fans can also hear this music through playing the game itself, which they certainly are, as the game has already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-big-launch/1100-6534482/" data-ref-id="1100-6534482">reached high concurrent player numbers on Steam</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Over the past several years, indie developers have raised more than $1 million for Palestinian aid; in 2021, the Indie Bundle for Palestinian Aid raised nearly $900,000 for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, and in 2024, the Palestinian Relief Bundle raised nearly $600,000 for Palestine Children's Relief Fund. More than a year has passed since Israel’s renewed assault on Palestinian people in which tens of thousands of people have been killed or injured—and game developers are urging the industry not to look away.</p><p>Experts with the International Association of Genocide Scholars recently declared in a report that Israel’s actions against Palestine constitute a genocide, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cde3eyzdr63o" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the BBC</a>, joining groups like <a href="https://msf.org.uk/issues/gaza-genocide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Doctor’s Without Borders</a>, <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2024/12/amnesty-international-concludes-israel-is-committing-genocide-against-palestinians-in-gaza/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amnesty International</a> and Israeli human rights organization <a href="https://www.btselem.org/publications/202507_our_genocide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">B’Tselem</a>. Israel has disputed the accusation for years, calling its actions a justified response <a href="https://www.vox.com/2023/10/7/23907296/israel-war-hamas-attack-rocket-strike-response-2023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to an Oct. 7 attack</a> in which militant group Hamas attacked and killed hundreds of civilians, some of which were attending a music festival, and injured thousands more. The current situation in Gaza is a continuation of an ongoing conflict in the region. In 2022, Human Rights Watch called Gaza an “<a href="https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/06/14/gaza-israels-open-air-prison-15" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open air prison</a>.”</p><p>“It is imperative that everybody in the world does not look away from the ongoing genocide, destruction of livelihood, culture and humanity in Palestine,” organizer Jun Shen Chia told Aftermath. “The games industry is built on communities of compassionate developers, artists, creators, writers, players who want to make a difference—and so we have the power to bring together our "kampung" (Malay word for "village") and harness our collective spirit to contribute to the welfare and freedom of the people of Palestine.”</p><p>Chia and a group of volunteers organized the <a href="https://itch.io/b/2979/play-for-peace-games-for-palestine-2025-charity-bundle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Play for Peace - Games for Palestine 2025 Charity Bundle</a> to continue raising funds for Palestinian aid; the effort began around 10 months ago, Chia said, with outreach to different organizations, volunteers, Itch itself, and game developers. The group partnered with the UNRWA USA, who will accept the raised money and pass it along to the UNRWA, which funds the direct support of Palestinians. Chia said the group chose the UNRWA because the proceeds go directly to relief efforts in Palestine.</p><p>The UNRWA was founded in 1950, <a href="https://www.unrwa.org/who-we-are/frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">per its website</a>, and has provided “assistance and protection to Palestine refugees pending a just and lasting solution to their plight.” It also helps with emergency response and is almost entirely funded through fundraising via “voluntary contributions, and mostly from donor states.” It continued, <a href="https://www.unrwa.org/who-we-are/frequently-asked-questions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via an FAQ page on its website</a>: “UNRWA is asking all donors to find ways to comprehensively address the Agency’s recurring shortfalls to ensure the uninterrupted delivery of critical services until there is a just and durable solution to the plight of Palestine refugees. Maintaining smooth and predictable operations, including the provision of emergency assistance, is of the utmost importance for the well-being, protection and human development of Palestine refugees, as well as for the stability of the region at large.”</p><p>Since the Play for Peace bundle launched on Sept. 2, it’s raised more than $33,000 for the charity. It’ll stay open until Sept. 23, with the goal of raising at least $200,000. The price is set for just $8, but people are able to donate more if they choose.</p><p>The bundle has been curated with 382 games from 248 creators—everything from “cozy narrative sims, to meditative adventures, to action games, visual novel tools, experimental sims, an RPG about being a cow, to tabletop experiences about everything from the occult, to journaling of self-discovery.”</p><p>Chia said it was important to him that the games represented in the bundle included “as many developers and contributors from all over the world,” including south east Asia, where he is from. “I created SEA Games for Good—a community-powered platform from which we can do good together—and as a way to encourage more participation from devs everywhere,” Chia said.<br>The Bundle includes <a href="https://togeproductions.itch.io/coffee-talk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Toge Productions’ <em>Coffee Talk</em></a>, <a href="https://softnotweak.itch.io/spirit-swap-lofi-beats-to-match-3-to" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Soft Not Weak’s <em>Spirit Swap: Lofi Beats to Match-3 To</em></a>, <a href="https://hthr.itch.io/extreme-meatpunks-forever" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Heather Flowers’ <em>Extreme Meatpunks Forever</em></a>, <a href="https://terrycavanagh.itch.io/vvvvvv" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Terry Cavanagh’s <em>VVVVVV</em></a>, <a href="https://necrosoftgames.itch.io/hypergunsport" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Necrosoft Games’ <em>Hyper Gunsport</em></a>, and <a href="https://kitfoxgames.itch.io/lucifer-within-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kitfox Games’ <em>Lucifer Within Us</em></a>, among many, many more. “All of it represents the creative expression of artists and developers who want to help raise money through their art for one of the most important causes of our time—freedom and the ending of genocide in Palestine,” <a href="https://itch.io/b/2979/play-for-peace-games-for-palestine-2025-charity-bundle" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the group said on its Itch page</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/oxo-rapid-brewer-coffee-espresso-soup-shots"><h3>The OXO Rapid Brewer Is Great For Coffee And Better For ‘Soup’</h3></a><p>The OXO Brew Rapid Brewer is a fantastic portable coffee brewer.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>“I do not need another coffee device” is what I told myself recently. I have already spent countless hours powerfully disassembling, powder coating, and modifying an off-the-shelf espresso machine, and it serves me perfectly. I have an Aeropress, a pour-over, and a beautiful, gothic <a href="https://us.alessi.com/products/pulcina-espresso-coffee-maker-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alessi Pulcina</a> moka pot. And yet when I saw what people were doing with the OXO Brew Rapid Brewer, I sighed, because someone had finally gone after Aeropress, and succeeded in making something new.</p><figure><figcaption><a href="https://www.oxo.com/rapid-brewer.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Credit: OXO</a></figcaption></figure><h2>A New Portable Coffee Contender</h2><p>The OXO Brew Rapid Brewer (I have seen people affectionately dub it “ORB” for short) is a compact coffee maker that claims to make hot or cold concentrated coffee in less than five minutes. To make a cup of coffee you disassemble the machine, place the included carafe under it, grind some fresh beans, pour the grounds into the lower basket, tamp it down with the self-stored tamper, then pour hot or cold water in the top chamber of the container. When you’ve reached the correct immersion time, you force water through the puck by pressing the built-in pump, which forces air out, sort of like a bike pump. Individual factors depend on how you’d like to brew. It’s a beautifully designed machine, and the constituent parts of the pump, carafe, and the tamper are all self-contained in a way that collapses down for easy storage.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="OXO Rapid Brewer Quick Start Guide" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pkzNoG2hws8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The immediate thought you may have is “that seems like an Aeropress,” a beloved staple of the coffee world and campers in particular, and I would say “sort of.” The Aeropress typically uses paper filters, which the Rapid Brewer does not need if you use it as OXO suggests. The Rapid Brewer creates a chamber with a dense puck more akin to the kind you make when you make a shot of espresso, while the Aeropress has an immersion chamber, and when it’s done the coffee gets forced through a paper filter like an oversized syringe. Though they serve a similar market, and both would be handy for making coffee while camping, the Rapid Brewer works in a fundamentally different way.</p><figure><figcaption>The Rapid Brewer broken down. </figcaption></figure><p>The Rapid Brewer would be noteworthy enough on its own, but what truly makes it novel is how the coffee community has found ways to use it. It came to my attention originally thanks to coffee YouTuber Lance Henrick, who had originally seen that it had become the pet project of a channel on the Espresso Aficionados Discord (which I was conveniently already in) called the Soup Kitchen, dedicated to making what are dubbed “Soup” shots.&nbsp;</p><h2>From Turbo To Soup</h2><figure><figcaption>The Cafelat Robot, my favorite manual espresso maker.<span></span><a href="http://www.cafelat.com/robot.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Credit: Cafelat</a></figcaption></figure><p>Modern espresso styles have changed over the last few years, with much of this changing due to “turbo shots.” The turbo shot originated from a <a href="https://strivefortone.com/blogs/coffee/low-pressure-turbo-shots-and-the-perfect-espresso" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">research paper in 2020</a> and is a style of smooth espresso shot that uses lower pressure, coarser grinds, and a much shorter extraction time. Traditional espresso machines typically force water through a puck of finely ground coffee at about nine <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_(unit)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bars</a> of pressure, while the turbo shot initially only used six. The resulting shot is sweet, floral, and easy to drink. Getting a turbo shot out of a traditional espresso machine is not possible unless you are either using a machine that has flow profiles (like the <a href="https://decentespresso.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Decent </a>or the hacked <a href="https://aftermath.site/gaggiuino-gaggia-classic-pro-mod-open-source-hack" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gaggiuino </a>I built) or you are using a manual espresso machine like the Flair58 or the Cafelat Robot with a gauge to measure the pressure.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="This OXO Brewer Might Replace Espresso" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Odo0f9P2SgQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>“Soup” is a further evolution of styles like turbo shots and other low pressure shots. Though terms like “soup,” “yeet,” and “piss”&nbsp; had been kicking around in the Espresso Aficionados Discord to describe these styles, “soup” was eventually chosen because it is more family friendly. It was originally popularized by user DC, although he stresses that he did not “invent” it per se. After much experimentation, the “Soup Kitchen” thread was established, with DC showing the style off on a Cafelat Robot – my favorite manual espresso machine because it looks like a little pastel robot guy that wants uppies. Soup calls for even lower pressure than turbos (never exceeding one bar) and a grind with twice the burr gap of a turbo shot. Lighter roasts are often employed. Circular paper filters are added to the bottom before the grounds, with an additional one added to the top for cleanliness and puck consistency (DC prefers Chemex filters cut to size for the bottom).The puck is preinfused super gently, often with the assistance of a tiny $7 dollar folding mirror. DC described his ideal soup to me as “Very forgiving to dial in, like a pourover while highlighting complex acidity in coffees, aromatic.”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Getting in the Weeds with the Rapid Brewer: Three Niche Profiles" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fHwX4u_4t3w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The resulting “shot” produces foam but no “crema” like a traditional espresso or turbo. It’s clear and drinkable like a pourover, an extraction level similar to espresso but with none of the oily body. Eventually, the members of the discord realized that OXO excelled at making soup shots, and a cult began to form around the device. According to DC, the Rapid Brewer&nbsp; “makes it really easy to do a soup shot because it prevents you from building too much pressure by accident while giving you tactical feedback about puck resistance.”&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Soup’s On</strong></h2><p>Since I was already set up for espresso, I was already set up for soup. I needed a lighter roast than what I was used to, so I went with Pink Bourbon from Variety Coffee. Soup calls for near boiling water, and conveniently I have a Zojirushi water boiler that I use for tea. You don’t strictly need a Japanese water boiler, but mine is one of the single most useful appliances in my house. It’s a big self-heating vacuum flask with variable temperatures and pour speeds that makes it so you constantly have hot water at precisely the right temperature at all times. Soup’s grind size takes a while to dial in, but a good rule of thumb is that water should be very nearly dripping through when you pour it in without applying additional pressure; for me, that’s roughly in the area between a fine moka grind and coarser espresso grind.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Espresso Without Pressure? The SOUP Method Changing Coffee Forever" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_GeFEwNfLZg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Recipes vary depending on a number of factors, but generally for the stock orb I’ve seen people suggest 18-20 grams of coffee and roughly 82 ml of hot water. Soup requires additional filtration in the form of paper filters above and below the puck. Aeropress filters are slightly too large for this purpose but will work in a pinch, although I’ve heard custom-cutting Chemex filters to size is a meaningful improvement. You place a filter in the basket, place your freshly ground and dosed coffee over it (WDTing if you like), lock it into the brewer, place it over the carafe, pour the correct amount of hot water, and place the pump on it. Preinfusion is the most important part, and the first pump is done as slowly as possible to saturate the coffee puck. Brewing time is short, about 20 seconds in total. Once the puck is saturated and you can pump without resistance, go to town on it. Congratulations, you’ve made soup.</p><p>As an espresso drinker, soup is a bizarre drink. It’s about the volume of a lungo shot, with the clarity of a pourover. Though it does not have the oily, viscous consistency of espresso that I love, it has an extraction that’s closer to it than other forms of coffee. It's like mutant pourover. If you make it correctly, soup is strong and beautiful, exceedingly floral and seductively clear. I have heard people describe it as “juicy,” which is a bizarre descriptor for any coffee drink, but it’s an apt one. Soup is exceedingly drinkable and downright beguiling. I have seen multiple people claim that their espresso machines have laid dormant since they started pulling soup shots. I have not, but I see with the utmost clarity why.</p><p>The Rapid Brewer does not replace espresso machines, but it’s cheap (in the US), well built, and lets you try a bizarre style of drink that you could mainline for the rest of your life. You do not need the level of investment as an espresso machine to get it right: A simple digital scale, hand grinder, a kettle and some filters are enough to get you there. Though many devices can make soup, none are as cheap and convenient at the task as the Rapid Brewer. You know a product has “the juice” when you see people 3D printing custom accessories for it, and rabid coffee fans have already found ways to modify the Rapid Brewer to take <a href="https://makerworld.com/en/models/1694474-oxo-rapid-brewer-58mm-basket-adapter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">different espresso basket sizes</a>. I have a good feeling that the Rapid Brewer is more than a simple fad. The ORB has escaped containment, it’s making soup, and the coffee world might never be the same.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/play-for-peace-bundle-palestine-aid-fundraiser"><h3>10 Months In The Making, Play For Peace Bundle Launches To Raise Money for Palestinian Aid</h3></a><p>‘It was important that our charity's proceeds directly went to Palestinian relief efforts’</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/32-9-long-handheld-amd-pc-steamdeck"><h3>Long Handheld</h3></a><p>ᗡ□□□□□□□□□□□□D</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-king-is-watching-pc-steam-review-impressions"><h3>The King Is Watching: It’s A Very Good Video Game</h3></a><p>'There's no wrong way to play this!

			<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/2k-confirms-layoffs-at-civilization-developer-firaxis">Game Developer</a>, 2K studio Firaxis Games has suffered layoffs, and while 2K wouldn't say exactly how many developers were impacted, sources Game Developer spoke to indicated that "<em>dozens</em>" of employees were affected.</p>



<p>2K cites the layoffs as an effort to "<em>restructure and optimize</em>" the studio for "<em>adaptability, collaboration, and creativity.</em>" One of the impacted developers, Emma Kidwell, is an award-winning writer who wrote for leaders on Civilization VII and Marvel's Midnight Suns characters Deadpool and Storm. In her LinkedIn post about being impacted, Kidwell wrote that she is "<em>an incredibly adaptable writer</em>."</p>
