			<p>The brand-new Spiritborn class received a <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-spiritborn-class-revealed-in-blizzard-livestream/">deep-dive livestream</a> about a month ago, during which the Diablo IV developers explored what makes it so unique. It has a ton of utility and variety, allowing players to play aggressively or defensively, depending on their preference. Diablo IV's first expansion, Vessel of Hatred is due to release on October 8, where players will be introduced to Neyrelle, a character who is on a vicious and gory path.</p>
<p>In addition to the Spiritborn class being added to Diablo IV, players will now experience the Mercenaries feature. This allows players to meet companions that can accompany them in battle. They can be customized to fit your play style and compliment your build in a way you see fit. Not only this, but the Mercenaries will all come with their backstory and skill trees that you can get lost in to make them more supportive or aggressive, depending on how you choose to play in the expansion. To utilize Mercenaries, they are listed as reinforcements, which can then periodically join you in battle to perform attacks to help you clear out mobs.</p>
<p>There are four Mercenaries you can choose from, all hailing from different parts of Sanctuary. Below is what you can expect from each of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Raheir</strong> - Born on the streets of Gea Kul, they were trained by the Iron Wolves.</li>
<li><strong>Varyana</strong> - Former cannibal who left her tribe and became a butcher by trade turned mercenary.</li>
<li><strong>Aldkin</strong> - Half-child, half-demon creature born half-demonic due to the First Khazra from the Citadel performing dark rituals on his mother.</li>
<li><strong>Subo</strong> - A disgraced archer from the mountains, shunned by the people who turned to him for aid, and has now become a bounty hunter for hire.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you explore the world alongside your Mercenaries, they can gain rapport with you, allowing you to unlock rewards and bartering currency. As you increase your rapport levels with your chosen mercenary, you can barter with them to get a chance to snag some powerful loot that may benefit your character in the long run.</p>
<p>One of the other new features added in this expansion for Diablo IV is The Dark Citadel. This is PvE content made for the end-game, where players participate in multiplayer combat in a dungeon-crawler to take down bosses they encounter. You can enter the Dark Citadel with up to four players to take down complicated bosses. If you are playing with them and don't have the option to communicate, you can utilize the brand-new marker system added to help develop some tactics.</p>
<p>Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred is receiving a <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/diablo4/24128995/delve-deeper-into-nahantu-with-mercenaries-dark-citadel-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ton of new content</a> aside from just those two features, such as major progression updates and a new time-attack dungeon.</p>
<p>On August 29, excited Diablo fans will be able to get more information on what to expect from the upcoming expansion, where the developers detail changes to the Paragon system, difficulty tiers, and more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/an-inside-peek-at-indiana-jones-gameplay-looks-whip-crackingly-fist-punchingly-fun.960240/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-bethesda-footage-1851628386<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There’s a fairly good chance that you, like us, keep forgetting that <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> is a first-person game. Each time we see any footage, it’s a jarring moment to remember that this isn’t a reskinned <em>Tomb Raider </em>or <em>Uncharted</em>, but instead puts us directly inside Dr. Jones’ head. This is exacerbated by so much of the stuff we’ve seen in trailers constantly jumping to cinematic third-person views, given how odd of an angle it is when trying to show off the game. But now we’ve seen ten minutes of in-game footage, and it’s starting to make more sense.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196013" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="316" data-playlist="196013,195301,196345" data-current="196013"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21533.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>At this week’s Gamescom, developer MachineGames, the force behind games like 2014’s <em>Wolfenstein: The New Order </em>and its sequel, described what has been shown before as highlighting their approach to “building an immersive narrative, full of twists and turns and exciting set-pieces.” But today we would see the enigmatic “gameplay.” They wanted to show off “what it is like to actually play as Indiana Jones and experience his adventure, to look through his eyes.” So it was perhaps unfortunate that this was immediately followed up by yet more footage of the grave robber smashing an ancient statue to recover a secret doohickey, all via a staged, third-person view.<br></p><p>This continued on as Indy’s thievery caused traps to trigger, closing the doors and filling the room with sand. But lo, a high window eventually comes within reach, and here, at last, we’re actually seeing the world through the behatted one’s eyes and leap forward into…a scripted series of slips and slides as the temple falls down around him.<br></p><p>OK, I’m being mean, but they set me up. After this, we do at last start to see some actual footage of the game as it will be experienced, and it’s a far more controlled and considered game than I was expecting. At some points, it appeared to play more like a first-person adventure game, with Indy inspecting scenes for clues, picking up objects to examine, and attempting to piece together where he needs to be. And where he needs to be is stopping evil Nazi rival explorer Emmerich Voss from finding a series of relics and returning them to his Fuhrer.<br></p><p>This all begins when Voss breaks into the doctor’s Massachusetts university and steals one such relic, and we begin trying to find out what he’s up to. In the aftermath of the break-in, we see Indy picking up photographs, looking through papers, snapping photographs to unlock more details about various items and areas, and arguing with Italian journalist Gina, who is only interested in accompanying him to find her sister.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="3cca21333ff4f32560f24dc302dc14c4" data-recommend-id="image://3cca21333ff4f32560f24dc302dc14c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1916" data-height="1078" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A POV shot shows Indy holding and looking at a map in what looks like a bazaar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A POV shot shows Indy holding and looking at a map in what looks like a bazaar." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->MachineGames/Lucasfilm</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3cca21333ff4f32560f24dc302dc14c4" data-recommend-id="image://3cca21333ff4f32560f24dc302dc14c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1916" data-height="1078" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A POV shot shows Indy holding and looking at a map in what looks like a bazaar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But it’s not all poking around in ancient ruins and halls of academia. The other most joyously repeated theme of what we were shown was hitting bad people on the back of the head with shovels. There seems to be a strong emphasis on improvisation, with objects lying around in the world available to be grabbed and used as a one-off advantage. Those shovels, for instance, shatter at the handle once they’ve been walloped around an unsuspecting head, and Indy tosses the remains aside. The same goes for metal bars used to knock loose bricks out of walls, or staffs thrown across ravines into the rock wall, to then be swung on with Indy’s whip.<br></p><p>Shovels weren’t the only means of combat, of course. The real focus was fisticuffs, with fights playing out as a sort of boxing minigame, you and the enemy exchanging blows, attempting blocks, and general biffing noses. Such moments would often begin with Indiana using his whip to pull at a buddy’s ankle to bring them to the floor, and then engaging in pugilism on their recovery, swapping punches until one of you is down.<br></p><p>Talking of Indy being down, in a highlight of the shown footage we saw our hero losing a fight and falling to the ground, but then thanks to a skill—True Grit—gained and added to his skill tree, he was able to make a last-ditch effort to reach out for his iconic hat and rally himself for one more try. It felt so very, very <em>Indiana Jones</em>.<br></p><p>It’s also worth noting that Indy’s perspective is not stubbornly first-person, after all. When he climbs, it switches out to third-person view, looking <em>extremely</em> like a <em>Tomb Raider</em> game as he Lara Crofts his way around ledges and climbs vines. It’s almost as if…it could have been a better perspective? But the insistence on “seeing through his eyes” prevails. It’ll end up being a combination of the two as we experience the larger challenges, climbing around vast obstacles to solve elaborate puzzles.. At one point we saw Doc Jones pouring wine into ancient bowls to reveal secret numbers, then finding routes to reach a huge raised frieze of Christ and adjusting levers to match the code.<br></p><p>Honestly, watching the footage and realizing that this is a slower, more focused game than the frantic cutscenes we’ve seen before have suggested, has made me much more excited to play it. Stealthing into a room, ker-blamming a baddie with garden equipment, and then using a whip to kwa-ping a gun out of another enemy’s hand looks really rather tremendous, especially when such action is interspersed with both exploration and puzzle solving. As sound director Pete Ward puts it, “The focus of this game is adventure,” with a desire that players find their own uses for the tools the game offers.<br></p><p>I’m much more excited now to return to 1937 having seen this footage, to see how well this mix of approaches can meld together, especially with the good news that Troy Baker’s Harrison Ford impression holds up much better than I’d previously thought. This could…maybe…actually be one to get really excited about. Although I’ve still no idea what’s so great about the circle.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/21/drive-rally-preview-arcade-thrills-meet-sim-rally-spills/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>For people who worship at the glorious squelch of mud and the reassuring spray of dirt from a rear wheel, rally games are the pinnacle of the racing genre. Rather than your Forza Motorsports and your Gran’s Turismo, fans have enjoyed games like the iconic Sega Rally, Colin McCrae, and WRC series from a variety of developers, with the rally game becoming a grubby staple of our racing heritage. It’s fair to say though that it’s all got very serious, shifting away from arcade thrills to pure sim racing.</p>
<p>Drive Rally looks to forge a point between those two extremes, bringing chunky, retro-styled visuals together with a thoughtful, but not overly exacting, handling model. It’s doing something that no one else is right now – come on Sega, we’re waiting! – and in our early hands-on, it’s doing it very well indeed.</p>
<p><iframe title="#DRIVE Rally | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0hhmI6MoImo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Drive Rally doesn’t feature any licensed cars, but it does feature cars that bear striking (but legally distinct) resemblances to iconic rallying legends of the past. There’s the Celestia doing it’s very best Toyota Celica impression, as well as a very Audi Quattro-esque little number called Das Sandstorm. Meanwhile, Das Bretzel is totally not a BMW. Definitely not.</p>
<p>While they’re not quite the real thing, they’re all very characterful, and you can upgrade their bodykit and various parts, adding increasingly outlandish spoilers, headlights and tyre mounts. Each car handles differently, with that profile changing as you alter its spec and upgrade, and while we only had a small selection to choose from, there’s going to be at least 27 different cars in the final version.</p>

<p>Much of Drive Rally’s attraction lies in its art-style, with a landscape that focuses on the key elements, and presents them in the same retro-infused 3D as the cars. It’s fun returning to a world where every tree isn’t a million polygons, and it allows you to concentrate on staying on the track, which, as you’d expect with a rally game, is not a foregone conclusion.</p>

<p>Drive Rally straddles the line between exacting precision and arcade-y floatiness, and once you get used to what it’s asking of you you’ll have the same edge-of-seat experience you’ll find in the best rally games. Hurtling along, waiting for a corner to leer out at you is tempered by one of the three enigmatic co-drivers and their relatively accurate pace notes. There is a strange drop-off in traction when you brake at the moment, and cars feel a little too sluggish to get going again once you’ve slowed, but I like the handling overall.</p>
<p>In true old-school fashion, there’s two options here, either a Quick Race or the Championship series. Each manufacturer has their own set of tracks within the championship, and you can unlock new car parts and new cars as you progress through the in-game scrapbook. It’s beautifully laid out, showcasing your times, rewards and a few other bits and pieces, though it could do with being a bit clearer about the race you’ve just completed. While there’s no online multiplayer, there are online leaderboards so you can compare yourself to the other Drive Ralliers out there.</p>

<p>There’s so much to like about Drive Rally. I love the visual style, and there’s a sense of fun that’s often lacking in modern racers. I like how focused it is too, and while there are some elements of the cars handling that that need a little tuning up, it’s in a great place as it heads towards an Early Access launch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-imposes-golden-demon-ai-ban-preventing-its-use-in-miniature-painting<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Back in January, Games Workshop released details for this year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-reveals-golden-demon-2024-details" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Golden Demon</a> competition. It is one of the largest miniature painting competitions in the world, accepting submissions from all <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer</em></a> properties and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/middle-earth-strategy-battle-game-second-edition-updates-war-for-ring" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Middle-earth Strategy Battle Game</em></a>. Now, GW has updated its guidelines, and implemented a Golden Demon AI ban.</p>

<p>The Golden Demon AI Ban can be found in the <a href="https://citadelcolour.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rIUY6MVHgkR2J1Vj.pdf">official 2024</a> category list and entry guidelines. The change can be found in the FAQ section. Question 8 asks "Am I allowed to use Artificial Intelligence to generate any part of my entry?" The answer is a simple "No."</p>

All AI-generated artwork is, by design, stolen from other artists and cobbled together into a derivative work. To pass off such derivative work as your own is plagiarism. It is a fact many tech companies are contending with <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/nvidia-sued-for-scraping-youtube-videos-for-ai-training/">in court right now</a>.</p>
<p>Games Workshop enforcing this Golden Demon AI ban has precedent from last year. Neil Hollis, a 12-time Golden Demon winner, took home the gold in 2023's <em>Warhammer 40,000: Single Miniature</em> competition for his <a href="https://thegoldendemoncompendium.com/entry?id=mkNYh9HTQB">Exodite miniature</a>. The miniature and paint were all made from approved materials, but the backdrop was AI-generated.</p>
<p>Hollis spoke openly about the controversy in a video interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouFUPIA9bug">The Painting Phase</a>. Hollis mentioned the contention around his entry, including waves of hostility and support from parts of the community.</p>
<p>In the video, Hollis expressed the convenience of AI tools and acknowledged using them to generate his backdrop was a risk. Not due to the ethical implications of the technology, but on the basis that the backdrop was printed and not painted.</p>
<p>Regardless, if Hollis plans on winning any awards at this year's Golden Demon, he will have to do so without AI tools.</p>

Albeit a horror-driven, combat-intensive chair set in a half-destroyed capital city that’s the victim of a tear in space-time. But rather than another galaxy-wide sprawling set of adventures like the base game, this is a tale told on one planet, a confined and controlled narrative that is far more reminiscent of the old <em>Elder Scrolls</em> approach.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

Its capital city has been rent asunder by a tear in the fabric of space-time, a place described as somewhere humanity’s search for knowledge—that otherwise drives the overarching narrative of <em>Starfield</em>—has “gone too far.” Whatever its scientists were up to, and it was something to do with “grav-drive technology,” it’s had devastating effects, and you’re now exploring the remains as various factions fight for control in the void of leadership.<br></p><p>The <em>Shattered Space</em> demo footage shown at this week’s Gamescom began with a brutal scene of floating dead bodies in dank, metallic corridors, a vibe that immediately spoke far more of horror than <em>Starfield</em>’s more familiar science fiction cleanliness. This is a planet with a more <em>alien</em> feel, its landscape much more peculiar, featuring gravitational anomalies among the many things going wrong for the locals.<br></p><p>What followed in the demo was a lengthy series of events taking place in the aftermath of the Va’ruun people’s recent disaster, which is so much worse when you learn those rifts in space are now letting in some gruesome monsters from another reality. The immediate vibe was <em>FEAR</em>— it very strikingly reminded me of Monolith’s classic spook-shooters, as the player character crept around abandoned sci-fi corridors, plagued by the grim beasts incessantly leaping at them.<br></p><p>Bethesda’s Brian Chaplin described Va’ruun’kai as a “secluded, hand-crafted location,” featuring an “isolated faction” who had been living on the planet separate from outside communication. Their culture had therefore developed independently of what has previously been explored in <em>Starfield</em>, which of course gives carte blanche for the team to make something that feels other, distinct, and not shackled by the perhaps less than-adored nature of the rest of the game. If anything, it seems to have given them freedom to return to their roots.<br></p><p>So following this recent crisis, with vast amounts of the capital city destroyed, and before any rebuilding has begun, you show up. The remainder of the citadel, where the power structure of the area was based, is now contained within some peculiar energy field, and the leader is missing, meaning there’s a power vacuum. This is pursued by “minor houses,” the area’s factions—the Zealots, Spacers and Crimson Fleet—looking to fill the political void. And that of course means all sorts of factional rivalry.<br></p><p>To match the different location, Bethesda is looking to see the game played differently too. While most people have approached <em>Starfield</em> as a remote shooter, keeping your distance and sniping from afar, in <em>Shattered Space</em>, there’s a push to force people to get far more up close and impersonal, with ambushes, close quarters combat, and a great deal more panic.<br></p><p>“We wanted to lean in on the mystery and horror aspects,” said Bethesda. “Space is scary, and part of getting that across is tapping into the chaos of combat.” It’s all very much part of what is a horror-first expansion.<br></p><p>While you can leave the planet any time you wish, given <em>Starfield</em>’s open nature, the plot here is entirely self-contained, and exploration of the planet and the city will lead to uncovering exactly what happened here, and, we’re told, becoming “entangled in the political feud between the minor houses.” You, of course, will be a part of deciding the fate of the city, and which faction eventually takes control.<br></p><p>This refocusing of how <em>Starfield</em> is played and experienced could be a boon for the ailing project. While Bethesda describes it as “one of our biggest games,” the publisher could well be including the likes of <em>Rogue Warrior </em>and <em>Wet</em> in that list, and <em>Starfield</em> has certainly not retained its audience. At the time of writing, it’s sporting a desultory 6,000 players on Steam, compared to 2015’s <em>Fallout 4</em> with a casual 17,000. So releasing something that seems so deliberately different, both in terms of its vibe and its nature, could be a well-timed decision.<br></p><p>The idea that there’s a complete, detailed story to play through, all taking place in one confined location, alongside its <em>FEAR</em>-like atmosphere, has me wanting to return to the game for the first time since its launch week. Presumably Bethesda is hoping this will be a desire shared by the hundreds of thousands who were playing back in July.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Dig to the center of the planet, find rare materials, and defend yourself from alien attack as you build your mining platform base and plan the best way to strike it rich.</p><p>Boss others into doing the hard work for you as you manage your own mining crew to descend deeper into the planet’s core. Deep dive and drill down on those deliverables by investing in a mix of barracks, factories and new tech during the day to keep your colony strong and reach the planet’s core. Make important corporate decisions like building up your platform’s defenses with turrets and guards to keep everyone safe, or pushing on for glory and greater rewards by focusing on the dig. Be mindful though, as when night falls aliens will attack from both above and below and endanger your precious revenue.</p><p>Each mission is unique, with procedurally generated planets, monsters, and conditions to test your strategy prowess. Will you move the needle and disrupt your approach or is it all above your paygrade? Collect valuable resources as you mine downwards to spend on upgrading your rig and employing new workers to optimize your dig. Each successful mission will unlock new upgrades for your platform so be sure to plan carefully and pick the right tools for the job. How deep will you get on your next run?</p><!-- AD: content -->

Revealed during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/__dNDhhJzQo?si=7dIv5Ol72pO8107i&amp;t=1769">Monster Hunter Wilds developer livestream</a> during Gamescom, Capcom showed a character equipping both male and female armor pieces from the same armor set, where they confirmed the feature would be in the new entry.</p><p dir="ltr">While this might not sound like a big deal, this is the first time in the Monster Hunter series that armor isn't locked to your created character's gender. In previous entries, there were different designs for each armor set: one for male characters and one for female. While the two different sets will still be present in Monster Hunter Wilds, you will no longer be forced into one set or the other. Instead, you can choose which version of the armor set you want for each individual piece.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Not only does this double the number of cosmetic options for armor, but Monster Hunter has previously had restrictions when it came to editing your character's appearance. In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/582010/Monster_Hunter_World/" rel="nofollow ">Monster Hunter World</a>, Capcom offered a single character-edit voucher for free to claim as DLC, but getting more vouchers cost real money. If you didn't want to pay, you would have to make a new character to change your appearance or gender, making it difficult to switch if you preferred the other look for an armor set. It also gives players who prefer to build their armor sets based on visual appearance even more freedom when it comes to making their outfits.</p><p dir="ltr">Monster Hunter Wilds is set to release in 2025 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.

<p>Sea of Thieves continues to be a massive success for Xbox and PlayStation. According to a new report, Sea of Thieves has sold more than 1 million copies on PlayStation 5 (PS5).</p>



<p>“[T]rusted sources have indicated to me that Sea of Thieves has crossed a million sales on PlayStation since its launch over there, and is most likely higher still since this information came to me,” Jez Corden of <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/phil-spencer-we-have-more-xbox-console-players-than-ever-as-fans-question-microsofts-multi-platform-strategy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Windows Central reports</a>.</p>







<p>If the numbers are accurate, Microsoft is looking at an extra $40 million-plus in revenue that it wouldn’t have had if they kept the game exclusive. As Corden astutely states, however, the actual revenue is likely higher due to in-game purchases that can also be made.</p>



<p>The game launched on PS5 on April 30. The game has been available on PC and Xbox since March 2018.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft and PlayStation for comment on the rumored sales numbers. Should a response be received, this article will be updated accordingly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/black-myth-wukong-feminist-propaganda-politics-twitch-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Chinese action-RPG <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>is officially a hit, <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/black-myth-wukong-breaks-steams-concurrent-single-player-record-within-hours-of-launch-184559634.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAM6-oR4EjeU4eldsTz-da3U4XHqeuTAXHL9o-5A4_mejqOrmOxNfBj2gE4YS_YLaZaQVS8hmSzHnzyf4BLT_29P_WboaMSq6XbXu1igYyAfz8RBXaSRqQTfHYMTqFbPMfb6jmxty3nz2Gn-cpIkYci5mKyKcLM1JfS5mgBVAkDzP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">breaking Steam’s concurrent single-player record</a> within hours of release. It’s also embroiled in a culture war that, unlike a great deal of others, is not <em>entirely </em>contrived. Following <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports of sexism</a> at developer Game Science last year, the studio sent pre-release code to content creators last week with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-marketing-team-offers-content-creators-a-steam-key-but-bans-feminist-propaganda-and-all-talk-of-covid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a series of stipulations</a>, one of which barred “politics, violence, nudity, feminist propaganda, fetishization, and other content that instigates negative discourse,” as well as mentions of covid and “content related to China's game industry policies.” These are extreme restrictions. They are, however, not that far afield from what content creators sometimes encounter during dealings involving game code.</p><p>It’s important to situate <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> in the broader context of content creation not to minimize the overbearing directive issued by marketers at Game Science collaborator Hero Games, but to understand the forces that can inform creators’ thinking – even slightly – as well as the ways companies try to control the messaging around their games.&nbsp;</p><p>In <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>’s case, the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/u/0/d/1aKlZvxWxbPOzldSUdc6CaHmoy80Fl7W_wQt-Ex-vl0k/mobilebasic?pli=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">list of do’s and don’ts</a> was only issued to content creators, not reviewers at websites and other more traditional publications (who received a different set of guidelines with restrictions largely centered around spoilers). It was also not tied to any sort of contract or sponsored content. As Aftermath understands the situation, Hero Games sent out code with what essentially amounted to a gentle – albeit forcefully worded – suggestion. Aside from denying opportunities in the future, there’s not much the company can do to actually enforce these rules.&nbsp;</p><p>That part immediately struck creators to whom Aftermath spoke as strange. Typically, you don’t encounter rules this specific until you’re in the fine print of a contract for a sponsored stream or video – aka, one in which a company is directly paying a content creator to play a game.&nbsp;</p><p>“The normal language of 'No politics, please don't talk about current events (covid), etc' have always been part of contracts,” longtime Twitch streamer <a href="https://x.com/CohhCarnage" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben “Cohh Carnage” Cassell</a> told Aftermath. “That's totally normal and has been in there for years. Even the vulgar language stuff, although I've never seen it enforced. ... I do many sponsored streams, and I've never seen anything about ‘feminist’ anything in any of them. That is new. And definitely very strange."</p><p>"It's only in sponsored, actually-paid stuff when we're signing a contract and agreeing to certain things [that] I ever see 'Don't bring up politics. Don't bring up this. Don't bring up that,'" pirate-themed streamer <a href="https://x.com/0BurkeBlack0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Burke Black</a> told Aftermath.</p><p>"The vast majority [of creator emails about game keys] I’ve seen don't require behavioral restrictions," <a href="https://x.com/shannonplante" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shannon Plante</a>, director of business operations for popular Twitch streamer <a href="https://x.com/Sacriel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sacriel</a>, told Aftermath. "Those are usually kept to paid activations, which makes sense [because] they’re paying you. … Typically restrictions would be normal stuff like refraining from abusive conduct, hate speech, [and] sometimes too much swearing depending on the game and brand.”</p><p>A creator who was granted anonymity so as not to lose out on future opportunities shared several such documents with Aftermath. One, for <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, included mandatory streaming language, but only around <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/resources/disclosures-101-social-media-influencers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FTC disclosures</a> (“Thank you to Epic Games for sponsoring this video” at the beginning of the stream and again every 30 minutes). Another, for <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</em>, included talking points to help advertise the game (“Talk about what makes <em>SMTV: V</em> so interesting to you – the ominous atmosphere, the metal music, demons, etc”) as well as a request that streamers include spoiler tags in their titles. </p><p>A third, for Meta-published VR game <em>Asgard’s Wrath 2</em> was a little stricter, with a list of do’s and don’ts that forbade third-party IP in creators’ content (logos, etc), alcohol consumption, and derogatory, sexual, or explicit comments. The streamer who received it told Aftermath that they nonetheless made “plenty” of sexual comments during the stream and were not penalized.&nbsp;</p><p>In general, while language can at times be restrictive, enforcement is rare.&nbsp;</p><p>"I’ve never experienced a situation where a brand hasn’t paid, but technically I guess if you violate those things it could result in them withholding," said Plante. "It would have to be proven, though, I’m guessing, [because] talent management firms would go after the brand for denial of pay otherwise."</p><p>"I’ve broken the ‘no swearing’ rule by accident a handful of times before and have never seen any enforcement, nor even any negative feedback,” noted Aftermath subscriber (and content creator and writer and actor) <a href="https://x.com/Charalanahzard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alanah Pearce</a> told Aftermath. “Generally if a brand wants to sponsor a creator, they know who that creator is and know their audience [and] can tell when they aren’t being authentic; if you talk about politics or you swear, they wouldn’t want you to stop doing that to the extent that it goes against your established brand."</p><p>But not all companies are created equal in this regard. In May, <a href="https://x.com/JeffHoogland" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jeff Hoogland</a>, a <em>Marvel Snap</em> streamer, was invited to join the creator program for upcoming <em>Overwatch</em>-alike <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, which, like<em> Black Myth: Wukong</em>, is being published by a Chinese company, NetEase. The program would not have paid Hoogland any money. Despite this, he was sent a “commitment letter,” which Aftermath has viewed. Among other things, it required a signature and included language like "I pledge not to disseminate any content associated with misinformation, hate speech, discrimination, politics, pornography, or other objectionable subjects" and "not to publish any illegal content, distorting game facts with malicious intent or insult to others." Hoogland objected to the “politics” restriction and asked a company representative if that language could be removed. The rep, Hoogland said, ended up ghosting him.</p><p>“Effectively policing what I post on social media in general just to be a part of a creator program is a huge overreach,” Hoogland said. “Code of conduct for no hate speech and hostile stuff is typical [for these sorts of creator programs]. Blanket no 'politics' as an incredibly vague catch-all is a first for me.”</p><p>Game Science and Hero Games have yet to publicly comment on <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>’s content creation restrictions. They’ve also <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/black-myth-wukong-sexism-controversy-interview-no-comment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remained tight lipped about other, similar subjects</a>. Aftermath asked the PR firm representing the game on the press side of things, One PR, for more details, but did not receive a response. Given the outcry around <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>’s approach, however, other companies employing heavy-handed tactics might want to reconsider.</p><p>"Simply put, what that studio is requiring just for a key is absolutely insane," said Plante, "and they should get called out for it."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>A sequel to Journey to the Savage Planet has been revealed by Raccoon Logic, and the new game is Revenge of the Savage Planet. Revenge of the Savage Planet is due to release in early 2025 for PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p><iframe title="Revenge of the Savage Planet | Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mVjBRZqajYY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“We’re beyond excited to welcome budding explorers back to the Savage Planet universe. A lot has happened since we launched the original title – both in-game and life, with the whole studio being shuttered during a global pandemic. On the back of this, Raccoon Logic was born, and with it Revenge of the Savage Planet, which may or may not incorporate an element of the journey we all went through. The XBOX showcase today is the tip of the asteroid, and we can’t wait to show everyone the world we’ve created next year.”, </em>said Alex Hutchinson, Creative Director at Raccoon Logic.</p>
<p>Revenge of the Savage Planet will be playable solo and in co-op, including local split screen, and it will have four planets for players to explore. You’ll be tasked with cataloguing the plants and animals of each planet, and you can even capture the animals too. Not every venture will be easy and you will have to fight some dangers out on the planet surfaces. Exploration will net you rewards with all sorts of gear scattered around the place.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/01/27/journey-to-the-savage-planet-review/">Journey to the Savage Planet Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Journey To The Savage Planet review, Dom wrote,&nbsp;<em>“Few games generate enough excitement, intrigue, or fun to have you hoovering up all the collectibles in order to bag all the trophies and achievements, but Journey to the Savage Planet will have you searching every nook and cranny, leaping seemingly impossible gaps and scanning every last rock, simply because you’ll want to. A rollicking space adventure, Journey to the Savage Planet has the smarts to make you laugh out loud while taking shots at consumerism and big business.”</em></p>

<p>Journey to the Savage Planet was released in 2020 for PC, PS4, and Xbox. Then in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/24/journey-to-the-savage-planet-lands-on-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-in-february/">February 2023</a>, a PS5 and Xbox Series X|S version was released, and included the DLC, 4K visuals, performance options, and improved photo mode.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dice-towers-mike-diliso-starts-board-game-company-massive-asterisk-first-project<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new board game company is making its debut. The company is called Massive Asterisk, created by Mike DiLiso. DiLiso is a content creator for the tabletop-focused website The Dice Tower. The first game it will publish is coming to Kickstarter this Fall, and it is packed with 90s nostalgia.</p>

<p>According to Massive Asterisk's <a href="https://massiveasterisk.com/">official website</a>, they are a company dedicated to creating strong theme-driven games with a passion and commitment to quality.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/massive-asterisk-i-made-you-a-mixtape-card-artwork.jpg?itok=shlPIHcv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/massive-asterisk-i-made-you-a-mixtape-card-artwork.jpg?itok=yj6mpUD8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Massive Asterisk's debut board game is titled <em>I Made You A Mixtape</em>. It is a board game set in the 1990s where you try to make an awesome mixtape for the coolest kid in the neighborhood as they leave for college. Whoever makes the best tape gets the grand prize: a <em>Quantum Leap</em> poster signed by Scott Bakula.</p>
<p><em>I Made You A Mixtape</em> was created by both Mike DiLiso and Dan Hughes. It is an easy-to-learn, quick-to-teach drafting game utilizing an 'I cut, you choose' system.</p>
<p>Players slowly create a mixtape of songs on the cards. Players earn points based on how well the tracks flow, their genre consistency, and if both the A-side and B-side of the cassette are balanced in length.</p>
<p>It is designed for 1-4 players and a single game can be finished in 30 minutes. Overall, it is a novel take on a card game with a strong nostalgic appeal to an older Millennial audience.</p>
<p>Mike DiLiso is a content creator and video editor for The Dice Tower. The Dice Tower is a website dedicated to videos, reviews, and podcasts discussing interesting or acclaimed board games across multiple categories. DeLiso is also the co-host of the "Sporadically Board With Mike and Dan" podcast.</p>
<p>The Kickstarter campaign for <em>I Made You A Mixtape</em> will launch this November.</p>

It wasn’t at all what I expected out of an open-world crime game, though my experience was pretty limited to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tag/grand-theft-auto&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tag/grand-theft-auto"><em>Grand Theft Auto</em></a></span><em> </em>back then, and I think these days I’d really find a lot to love about it and its atmosphere.<strong> Hell, if you want to stick to that classic feeling, the original version of </strong><em><strong>Mafia </strong></em><strong>is also on sale  right now for just about $5.</strong></p><p><em>Mafia 2 </em>came about a decade later in 2010, and though it got knocked for its linearity—even if in my opinion, it means it doesn’t suffer from open-world bloat— it’s still probably my favorite. I remember being wowed by its production values, a staple which carried over from the original game, and its attention to detail. While other open-world games were certainly upping their fidelity and the sizes of their worlds, <em>Mafia </em>was always a series more interested in the minute details, which always led to interesting wrinkles and systems that flew under the radar despite the franchise’s clear success and longevity.</p><p>In <em>Mafia 2</em>, one of those systems was the ability to interact with certain objects in one of two ways: either neutrally, or in a more violent manner. It was a subtle system that might not have meant much to too many people back in the day, but as far as roleplaying tools that help build immersive worlds and characters, this was absolutely wonderful.</p><p><em>Mafia 2 </em>was also just a tried-and-true mobster story, filled with the kind of deplorable characters and tragic twists one might expect from their favorite mob movie. <strong>Yeah, I’m a </strong><em><strong>Mafia 2 </strong></em><strong>apologist, and you can be too once you pick it up as part of the </strong><em><strong>Mafia Trilogy </strong></em><strong>or on Steam where it’s going for $7.49 right now.</strong></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mafia-iii-the-kotaku-review-1787722761&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mafia-iii-the-kotaku-review-1787722761"><em><strong>Mafia 3</strong></em></a></span>&nbsp;<strong>is the most recent entry, releasing back in 2016, and it and its DLC are now compiled into a </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fmafia-iii-definitive-edition%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fmafia-iii-definitive-edition%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>definitive edition</strong></a></span><strong> that you can pick up for $7.49.&nbsp;</strong>I admittedly haven’t played this game, but it’s at the top of my to-do list due to its main character, Lincoln Clay. A Black veteran of the Vietnam War, he returns from overseas only to be plunged into a life of crime in the deep South, where he still feels the effects of racism and segregation as he rises through the ranks. Games that are frank in their tackling of subject matter such as institutional racism in America aren’t exactly a dime a dozen, and though <em>Mafia 3 </em>sounds like it has trouble clearing some technical hurdles, I’m more than happy to hear it out.</p><p>Altogether, the <em>Mafia </em>series is one of the more interesting open-world crime franchises, departing from the do-anything zaniness of its closest competitors with more somber, linear stories and some unique systems. Everywhere they could (and maybe <em>should</em>) have zigged, the developers stewarding the series have zagged. I think that makes the series bolder and more unique than a dozen other <em>GTA </em>clones that have come and gone. And after all of this, the <em>Mafia </em>series is still standing, and even has a fresh new game on the horizon, so these games clearly stand the test of time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
