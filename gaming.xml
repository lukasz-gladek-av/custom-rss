            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>Helldivers 2 is coming to Xbox Series X/S on August 26. This marks the first appearance of the series on a Microsoft platform.</p><p>The cooperative third-person shooter was first released on February 8, 2024, for PlayStation 5 and PC. As soldiers defending Super Earth in 2184, players work together in three-person squads to fight in the never-ending Galactic War against the insect-like aliens, the Terminids (among other threats). Helldivers 2 on Xbox will support cross-play on all platforms.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nTs9VDm4KAU"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nTs9VDm4KAU" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>“We know gamers have been asking for this for some time and we are so excited to bring more Helldivers into our game," says Helldivers 2 game director Mikael Eriksson in a press release. "We have so much more in store for the future months and years – and the more players we have the more stories we can tell! The fight for Super Earth has only just begun.”</p><p>This announcement is notable because while we've seen several first-party Xbox titles make the jump to PlayStation hardware in the last year, this is a more uncommon instance of a Sony-published game migrating to Microsoft's console. Helldivers 2 was one of our favorite games of 2024. We scored it a 9 out of 10 upon its release (check out our<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/helldivers-2/bullet-heaven"> review</a>), and it also landed a spot on our <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/03/20/game-informers-belated-top-10-games-of-2024-awards">Top 10 Games of 2024</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/03/helldivers-2-airdrops-on-xbox-series-xs-in-august]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Tamagotchi Plaza" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a935b4561cf2d/tamagotchi-plaza.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We are back with an updated look at the Japanese physical charts, courtesy of <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202507/46365">Famitsu</a>, and while pole position has remained ever-steady, a couple of newbies have shaken up the rest of the proceedings.</p>
<p>Surprising nobody, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is <em>still</em> in first place after having put up an additional 145,069 sales in its fourth week in the top spot. But it's not quite as one-sided as you might expect this time, thanks to a staggering debut from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tamagotchi_plaza">Tamagotchi Plaza</a>, which combined for a sweet 128,685 units across its Switch 1 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tamagotchi-plaza-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Switch 2</a> releases. As it turns out, yes, Tamagotchi <em>is</em> still A Thing.</p>
<p>It wasn't a complete Switch-fest, of course, with Kojima's latest, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, squeezing the PS5 onto the podium after pulling in a cool 71,964 sales in its first week. AQUAPLUS's remastered visual novel <strong>ToHeart</strong> and the physical release of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/castlevania_anniversary_collection">Castlevania Anniversary Collection</a> managed to break the top 10 in the debut week, too. <em>Cor</em>, what a time for new releases!</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/neil-druckmann-steps-down-hbo-the-last-of-us</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/neil-druckmann-steps-down-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-to-focus-on-naughty-dog.1235136/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Neil Druckmann, best known for his work as creative lead on Naughty Dog's successful&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>series, has announced he will step down from his "creative involvement" with HBO's adaptation of the games in order to focus on his work with Naughty Dog.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Naughty_Dog/status/1940465773639880781" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media, Druckmann says the decision to step away from the show was "difficult", but that he wants to "transition [his] complete focus to Naughty Dog and its future projects", including the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/naughty-dog-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet" rel="nofollow">upcoming <i>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</i></a>, on which Druckmann serves as writer and director.</p>

<p>Druckmann says that working on HBO's&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>series as a co-creator "has been a career highlight", and that now, after the completion of series two and "before any meaningful work starts on season three", is the "right time" to step away.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-last-of-us-neil-druckmann-hbo-joel-ellie.jpg?itok=6oNAxVsA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-last-of-us-neil-druckmann-hbo-joel-ellie.jpg?itok=F2ujDyRH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Neil Druckmann is stepping away from his role on HBO's&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The first season of&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/last-of-us-episode-1-review" rel="nofollow">debuted back in early 2023</a>, quickly earning critical acclaim for its faithfulness to the source material, as well as for the performances of leads Pedro Pascal and Bella Ramsey, who play Joel and Ellie respectively.</p>

<p>When the second season aired earlier this year, the response from audiences, as well as some critics, was decidedly more muted. Our very own Andrew Stretch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hbos-last-of-us-season-2-review-skeleton-of-story-no-heart" rel="nofollow">awarded the season a 7 out of 10</a>, praising its set dressing and Pascal's performance but criticizing "pacing issues".</p>

<p>A third season of the show is on the way, and given that the second season didn't conclude the story of&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us: Part II</em>, we can reasonably assume that the upcoming season will do so.</p>




<p>As for the games, as far as we know, there's no third installment in development, although Druckmann has said before that he believes there <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/last-of-us-creative-director-there-is-probably-one-more-chapter-to-this-story" rel="nofollow">could be "one more chapter"</a> to the story the games tell.</p>

<p>Given that Naughty Dog is currently hard at work on&nbsp;<em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em>, however, and given the sheer amount of time games take to make these days, I wouldn't bank on seeing a third&nbsp;<em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>game for quite some time yet.</p>

            <p>Romero Games have announced in the wake of mass layoffs at Microsoft that funding for their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/john-romeros-making-a-mysterious-new-fps-in-unreal-engine-5">next shooter</a> has been pulled by its publisher. A number of former staff at the studio founded by Doom co-creator John Romero and Brenda Romero have since written on social media that they've lost their jobs as part of those <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-cancel-perfect-dark-reboot-and-shut-the-developers-down-in-the-name-of-continued-success">MS cuts</a>.</p>
<p>A statement posted to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/romero-games">Romero Games</a>' Twitter account attributed to Brenda Romero asserts that the game's publisher, which it didn't name, had opted to pull the funding for it "along with several other unannounced projects at other studios".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This was a strategic decision made at a high level within the publisher, well above our visibility or control," Romero continued. "We deeply wish there had been something, anything, we could have done to prevent this outcome. This absolutely isn't a reflection of our team's work, performance, or the quality of the project itself. We hit every milestone on time, every time, consistently received high praise, and easily passed all our internal gates. We are incredibly proud of the work being done, and of the talented team behind it. The best we've worked with.”</p>
<p>Following the statement being put out, a number of now-former Romero Games devs have posted on social media that they've lost their jobs as part of the recent mass layoffs at Microsoft and Xbox. These include hard surface artist <a href="https://x.com/christophredl94/status/1940719223472640128">Christoph Redl</a>, senior 3D character artist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346477302404329472/">Conor Jordan</a>, and senior producer <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346477777308573697/">Emily Winters</a>.

<p>"The mass Microsoft layoff effectively cancelled funding for Romero Games and as a result the whole team was laid off," wrote former Romero Games UI artist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346535464591355909/">Ana Mitrovic</a>. Meanwhile fellow former artists <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346495054519173120/">Sadbh Flanagan</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346522896481034241/">Eric Wong</a> both referenced the studio closing in their posts.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Microsoft for comment.</p>
<p>"We appreciate any attention you can bring to our talented team who are now looking for work," Romero Games community developer and communications manager Maezza Romero wrote in response to a request for comment RPS made to the studio. "I have to refer you back to our public post, which is in keeping with our confidentiality agreement."</p>
<p>The original statement closes by saying that Romero Games are "currently evaluating next steps and working quickly to support our team. Many of us have worked together for more than a decade, some for more than 20 years," it goes on. "It’s an extremely difficult day, and we’re heartbroken it’s come to this."</p>
<p>"These people are the best people I've ever worked with," John Romero added on social media, "and I'm sorry to say that our game and our studio were also affected."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-new-shooter-from-romero-games-loses-funding-as-staff-post-theyve-been-let-go-thanks-to-microsoft-cuts]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> is officially coming to Xbox Series X/S on the 26th August.</p>
<p>This announcement came via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXIFF4D6LOs&amp;ab_channel=HELLDIVERS%E2%84%A22">a Helldivers announcement stream</a>. Arrowhead's hit third-person shooter will have full crossplay with both PC and PlayStation. Those interested can pre-order the game on the Xbox store  for £34.99 now.</p>
<p>It's also the first ever Sony-published game on Xbox platforms, which is certainly a massive milestone in the ongoing rivalry between the two companies (Sony's baseball series MLB The Show is published by MLB on Xbox). <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-remaining-thoughtful-about-how-and-if-it-brings-games-to-additional-platforms">Sony previously expressed interest in bringing its big games to more platforms</a>, with this Helldivers 2 port acting as the first big sign of this shift in strategy.

<p>Said game director Mikael Eriksson on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/03/helldivers-2-xbox-release-date-pre-order/">Xbox Wire</a>: "We know gamers have been asking for this for some time and we are so excited to bring more <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> into our game. We have so much more in store for the future months and years – and the more players we have the more stories we can tell! The fight for Super Earth has only just begun."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-quietly-removes-pc-sale-restrictions-in-dozens-of-countries-for-four-huge-playstation-games">Helldivers 2 only recently had its geographical restrictions lifted on PC</a>, which had previously had people from countries including the Bahamas, Armenia, Burkina Faso and many more unable to play the smash hit. Now, with the game coming to Xbox, it looks like one more massive wall keeping folks apart has crumbled.</p>
<p>Previously, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-roblox-riot-and-now-helldivers-tencent-just-acquired-a-15-stake-in-arrowhead-games">Tencent acquired a 15 percent stake in Arrowhead Games</a> for roughly $80m. A lofty sum for a chunk of what has certainly been a rare gem in the modern live service landscape.</p>
<p>For those who hop into the game on Xbox, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update-sees-super-earth-itself-invaded">they'll have missed the Illuminate invasion of Super Earth</a>, as well as the special cape added to the game in memory <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-year-after-that-psn-fiasco-helldivers-2s-long-anticipated-review-bomb-cape-is-finally-here">of the review bomb fiasco</a>. Still, there's surely plenty more surprises yet to come for fresh-faced Xbox players.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-is-coming-to-xbox-series-xs-in-august-as-first-sony-published-game-on-the-platform]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-version-confirmed-for-august.1235109/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>will soon break out of its console exclusivity prison, PlayStation and Xbox have announced, as the bug-slaying shooter is due to land on Xbox Series X|S later this summer.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/03/helldivers-2-xbox-release-date-pre-order/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official Xbox Wire news platform,&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>will be released on Xbox Series X|S on August 26th. Coincidentally (or perhaps not), that's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-ps5-release-date-enhancements" rel="nofollow">the same date</a> on which<i>&nbsp;Senua's Saga: Hellblade II&nbsp;</i>lands on PS5.</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, no specific enhancements or unique features will be introduced for the Xbox version of&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, although you will net yourself some extra goodies if you pre-order either the standard version or the Super Citizen Edition of the game.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-port-shooting.jpg?itok=clTAExid 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-port-shooting.jpg?itok=-nOmHKTH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is finally coming to Xbox.</figcaption></figure><p>It looks like porting work for&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>was handled by Nixxes, a celebrated porting and support studio that Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-has-acquired-porting-studio-nixxes" rel="nofollow">acquired back in 2021</a>. The studio has also helped out with PC ports for the likes of&nbsp;<em>Marvel's Spider-Man</em>,&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>.</p>

<p>If you're somehow not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, it's a co-op-focused third-person shooter in which players band together to slay enemies belonging to one of three factions: the insectoid Terminids, the robotic Automatons, and the alien Illuminate.</p>

<p>The game's theming is heavily satirical; while players are routinely encouraged to support Super Earth and its introduction of "managed democracy" to the galaxy, in truth, Super Earth's government is much closer to an autocratic regime.</p>

<p>Missions revolve around completing a series of objectives while fending off enemies from the three aforementioned factions, and with friendly fire not only present but constant, I'd recommend playing with those with whom your friendship is ironclad.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/helldivers-2/9mx9wn9dfpgt" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> when it launches on Microsoft's hardware on August 26th. The game is also currently available on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>.</p>

There are a variety of missions you can take on against aliens, robots, and a newer Illuminate species. And, since it’s a live-service title, the lore and the stakes are always evolving (and the developers often troll players).

            <p>It's been a long time since the last major <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-tips-and-tricks">Manor Lords</a> update and it'll likely be a while till the next. This might strike you as dismal news, if you adhere to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/long-dark-dev-criticises-manor-lords-for-lack-of-updates-hooded-horse-ceo-replies-that-not-every-game-needs-to-be-some-live-service-boom-or-bust">"death by a thousand patches"</a> school of Steam early access, but you have to remember that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> is a city <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> set in late 14th-century Franconia, when technology <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-followed-this-ox-around-in-manor-lords-for-a-day-to-see-what-wisdom-it-could-teach-me">lolled along at the pace of a dying ox</a>. Also, the developers Slavic Magic are carrying out a "full rework" of the game, rather than dolling things out in smaller patches. In particular, there's a new building affinity system in development that may please fans of pollination. Any flowers reading this? The next update is for you, I guess.</p><!--more-->
<p>"I know you've been waiting a long time, and the reason for the delay is pretty simple," begins <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1363080/view/505080786253252678?l=english">a Steam post</a> from lead developer Grzegorz Styczeń. "We're overhauling a lot of systems at once. It's not just a new feature or two. It's a full rework of how things like buildings, production chains, and environmental interactions function. Because we're working on all these big changes, we haven't been able to put out smaller patches. They would make things messy or break stuff that's still being worked on."</p>
<p>The developers plan to shift to smaller, more regular updates once the "full rework" is done.</p>
<p>Ever the giver, Styczeń closed the post with a few highlights from the forthcoming megapatch. These include a "more in-depth relational system" between buildings and between buildings and the environment. They experimented initially with applying building effects across a radius, as in many other city builders, but this disagreed with the Manor Lords plot system. Besides which, Styczeń feels that "fitting rectangular plots into circles is not pleasant, and it reduces the creativity the player has".</p>
<p>Gah, I can picture how annoying this would have been. I can imagine the hours I'd have spent gnawing my fingernails over stray wedges and curls of unexploited affinity radius. How I'd have cursed your name, Greg. Such plagues I'd have called upon your houses.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Slavic Magic are going with a system of matching environment types, instead. So far, the types include Meadow, Woodland, Farmland, Rural, and Urban. Buildings have affinities with specific environments: apiaries like sharing a region with some woodland, for example. There are buffs and multipliers to ponder, too: apiaries increase the bonuses that pollination orchards get from meadows, while placing fresh houses appears to proportionately increase urban affinity.</p>

<p>Sweaty questions of infrastructure chemistry aside, Slavic Magic are working on a new map, Divided, which as the name suggests has a mountain range running down the middle. They've also shared screens of new shop fronts and artisan workstations, see-through fortifications for those who want to ensure that their castle guards aren't nodding off, a new development perk card style, and a whole raft of reworked building cards. Consider all this subject to change, naturally.</p>
<p>Even in early access form, Manor Lords is one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">favourite city builders</a>, and an appetisingly mucky simulation of medieval life. It even <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-did-a-medieval-peasants-raw-sour-breath-sound-like-manor-lords-composers-tell-us"><em>sounds</em> like a flyblown heap of feudalism</a>. I look forward to rearranging my apiaries.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/manor-lords-is-getting-a-full-rework-with-a-new-affinity-system-map-shops-and-workstations]]></content:encoded>

That’s not entirely relevant, but it’s also the name of a puzzle format created by legendary Japanese puzzle publisher Nikoli. Like so many other puzzling conceits, it begins on a square grid, with numbers scattered across various tiles, and the inherent demand is that the player eliminate squares until the puzzle is solved. But Nurikabe is a little different than others.</p><p>The basic idea here is to create a contiguous path of eliminated/shaded cells, such that each numbered tile is boxed off in an island containing the appropriate number of cells. If there’s a 2, it needs to be the 2 tile and one other blank, sealed off from others by all orthogonal routes. However, what makes Nurikabe more involved is that it has other rules that apply—there can be no two-by-two shaded areas, for instance. And that path of eliminated space must be orthogonally linked across the whole grid. It’s with these pieces of information that you can deduce possible solutions, in a way that’s far more involving and interesting than a bog-standard sudoku or what have you.</p><p>That’s Nurikabe, but what about <em>Nurikabe World</em>? Well, for the most part it’s this exact puzzling format, but presented in a stunningly clever and engaging way that makes it feel so much more special. And beyond that, it invents its own twists on the format, introducing new rules that require even more inventive thinking.</p><p><em>Nurikabe World</em> takes the islands metaphor literally, having you eliminate cells on its 3D levels by turning land into water. As such, each puzzle has you carve a river through the green land that successfully isolates each numbered island, with the logic that the river itself must be linked up throughout. Once an island has been segregated into the correct number of tiles, the green grass then blossoms with plants, trees and traditional Japanese buildings, growing out of the ground in lovely animations. Absolutely, it’s all decoration, but it’s so superbly delivered that it makes the puzzles feel far more meaningful, and delivers a continuous sense of being rewarded for your efforts.</p><p>It helps that the enormous 150 levels are all hand-crafted, rather than procedurally generated, and like the best puzzles, demonstrate the wit and intelligence of the creator. For the first few dozens, as specific techniques become unavoidably necessary to solve the level, the concept will be explicitly explained—but rather brilliantly this happens long after you should have stumbled upon them for yourself if you’re paying attention. They’re only overtly explained when you’d be screwed without them.</p><figure id="" data-id="f6b42fe4d7b8169f33993793b7a871f9" data-recommend-id="image://f6b42fe4d7b8169f33993793b7a871f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1438" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A nearly finished Nurikabe level." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A nearly finished Nurikabe level." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hemisquare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f6b42fe4d7b8169f33993793b7a871f9" data-recommend-id="image://f6b42fe4d7b8169f33993793b7a871f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1438" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A nearly finished Nurikabe level." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Then, in the second half of the collection, new twists are added. There are numbers with dots beneath them, indicating that these must be paired with another dotted number, their island representing the paired sum. Working out which two numbers are to be paired of the many available becomes a fascinating new challenge. Then there are numbers with lines underneath, which must form islands made in a straight line. And at the game’s best, all three number types appear in the same puzzle, meaning you need to weave all these freshly learned techniques together.</p><p>The final of the four groups of puzzles is called “Advance,” and contains far more meaty challenges, and it’s from midway through this collection that I write to you. I was not intending to be playing this game at all this week. I wrote about it last week <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://buried-treasure.org/2025/06/nurikabe-world/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://buried-treasure.org/2025/06/nurikabe-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on my own little site</a></span>, and had meant to move on by now. But there it is, in the background, distracting me as I try to get through this sentence.</p><p>And when you’re done with the 150 puzzles, there are daily challenges too, and user-made puzzles to add and create!</p><p>Logic puzzle games are certainly pretty commonplace, but one designed and presented this well is a rare treat. And right now, in the Steam summer sale, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2964540/Nurikabe_World/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2964540/Nurikabe_World/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it’s 25 percent off at just $7.50</a></span>. That’s incredibly good value for puzzling money! Although, perhaps don’t make other plans.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/nurikabe-world-logic-puzzle-game-hemisquare-1851785568]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Plans to relaunch the game.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Build A Rocket Boy, the Edinburgh, Scotland-based developer of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a>, has issued at-risk emails to its around 300-strong UK workforce following the disastrous launch of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sources familiar with the goings on inside the embattled studio told IGN at-risk emails were also sent to staff at PlayFusion, which BARB acquired late 2024. PlayFusion, whose CEO Mark Gerhard became co-CEO of BARB as part of the buyout, is working on a different game — a fast-paced FPS called Ascendant which was meant to come out this year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-begins-layoff-process-amid-disastrous-launch-studio-sources-say">IGN reported that BARB had begun a redundancy process following the release of MindsEye</a>. The standard 45-day consultation process kicked off on June 23, which according to UK law is triggered when an employer proposes 100 or more redundancies within a 90-day period. IGN understands Build A Rocket Boy currently has around 300 UK employees, with 200 abroad.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, BARB issued a statement confirming the redundancy process, insisting the cuts will let the studio “focus on delivering ongoing updates and performance optimization for MindsEye, while also ensuring the long-term success of Build A Rocket Boy’s future ambitions.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Soon after MindsEye launched, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-dev-heartbroken-amid-troubled-launch-as-players-report-success-with-refunds-and-sponsored-streams-are-canceled-last-minute"><u>BARB said it was “heartbroken” over the issues players had faced with the game</u></a>, and promised to release a series of patches to fix the significant performance problems, glitches, and AI behavior bugs. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-dev-releases-performance-improvement-hotfix-as-first-in-series-of-emergency-patches-designed-to-address-disastrous-launch"><u>Rollout of these patches has begun</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All the while, MindsEye’s troubled launch saw the developer cancel sponsored streams, with reports of players securing refunds, even from the normally stubborn Sony, surfacing online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Steam, which does not paint the whole picture of MindsEye’s current popularity, the game hit a peak concurrent player count of 3,302 on launch, but had a 24-hour peak of just 46 players. At the time of this article’s publication, 26 people were playing on Steam, where MindsEye has a 'mostly negative' user review rating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Story-driven action adventure game MindsEye was initially designed to be a part of Everywhere, the ‘Roblox for adults’ creation platform led by former Grand Theft Auto design chief Leslie Benzies. BARB eventually switched to focus on MindsEye, but it has so-far failed to do the business for the company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, BARB sources told IGN that Benzies finally addressed staff following the release of MindsEye in a brief video call yesterday, July 2. According to two people present who asked not to be named in order to protect their careers, Benzies insisted BARB would bounce back and relaunch MindsEye, blaming the studio and the game’s struggles on internal and external saboteurs, among other things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The comments rekindle memories of those issued by Mark Gerhard ahead of the release of MindsEye. The co-CEO hit the headlines for claiming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-co-ceo-claims-there-is-a-concerted-effort-by-some-to-trash-the-game-and-the-studio-suggests-people-are-being-paid-or-using-spam-bots-to-post-negative-comments"><u>there was a "concerted effort" by some to "trash the game and the studio,"</u></a> suggesting people were being paid or using spam bots to post negative comments. The boss of publisher IO Interactive, which makes the Hitman games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-boss-says-he-doesnt-believe-people-are-being-paid-to-post-negative-comments-about-mindseye"><u>subsequently issued a denial</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BARB sources told IGN that internally, there is a desire for a MindsEye redemption arc that would eventually see it become successful for the studio. But as staff face an anxious wait to discover their fate, there are serious questions over whether BARB will be able to fulfill its post-launch roadmap for content, including the promised multiplayer mode, on time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this week, BARB released MindsEye’s third post-release update on console, with a PC release to follow. “We’ve watched hundreds of hours of gameplay footage and reviewed player feedback across multiple channels to prioritize the most pressing issues and improve the experience for all our console players,” the studio said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Though it had been in development since 2018, the length of time it was taking to make the game was expected, as ZeniMax was building an entirely new game engine for it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the last year, sources tell IGN that pre-production was going well, and the team was actively ramping up in the hope of moving into full production soon. Xbox had approved the scaling up, and some individuals were being moved onto the project from other teams such as The Elder Scrolls Online, as well as some people absorbed from the shuttering last year of Arkane Austin.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One source recalled being told last year by head of Xbox Game Studios Matt Booty in a meeting that Xbox's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">closures</a> of Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks, and Alpha Dog Games were done for the purpose of justifying increased headcount for other game studios that needed it, including ZeniMax Online Studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But now, every person working on Blackbird is gone.

Sources IGN spoke to said that those within ZeniMax only knew that layoffs were coming due to ongoing news reports leading up to yesterday, but even today are still in the dark as to how widespread the cuts actually are. They also confirmed reports that a number of people's Slack access was deactivated before they were told by HR that they were impacted, resulting in confusion and distress.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft's mass layoffs have devastated its games division, and our understanding of the impact is still evolving. IGN was told that Candy Crush developer King was hit hard, and we learned yesterday that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-and-xbox-developer-the-initiative-closed-as-part-of-devastating-microsoft-layoffs">Perfect Dark has been canceled and The Initiative is no more</a>.

A number of other games and teams are rumored to be impacted as well, though the full scope is still unknown.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes on the heels of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce"><u>Microsoft's laying off 1,900 staff in January 2024</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda"><u>closing Redfall developer Arkane Austin and Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks months later</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-sends-memo-to-staff"><u>laying off 650 more individuals in gaming the following September,</u></a> and then in May of this year Microsoft laying off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-cuts-3-of-its-workforce-affecting-thousands-of-staff"><u>an additional 6,000 people.</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: zenimaxonline.com.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> is coming to Xbox Series X and S next month in a shock announcement that sees Sony publish a game on PlayStation's rival consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arrowhead’s explosive co-op third-person shooter launches on Xbox on August 26, 2025, a livestream confirmed. Remarkably, that's the same day Microsoft releases Gears of War: Reloaded on PlayStation 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/03/helldivers-2-xbox-release-date-pre-order/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a>, Helldivers 2 Game Director Mikael Eriksson commented on what this launch means to the studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We know gamers have been asking for this for some time and we are so excited to bring more Helldivers into our game," he said. "We have so much more in store for the future months and years – and the more players we have the more stories we can tell! The fight for Super Earth has only just begun.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Crossplay across all platforms is confirmed, which means PC, PlayStation, and Xbox players will be able to play together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Helldivers 2 launched on PC and PS5 in February 2024 and was a rare live service smash hit for Sony. It is the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time, selling an incredible 12 million copies in 12 weeks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While player numbers on Steam, which Valve makes public, remain healthy a year-and-a-half on from the record-breaking launch, the Xbox release will no-doubt boost the player pool even further.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Helldivers 2's release on Xbox comes as a big surprise. Sony, typically, does not release PlayStation Studios games on Xbox, preferring instead to launch on PlayStation consoles only and, in an increasing number of cases, PC. MLB The Show, developed by Sony's San Diego Studio and published by Sony Interactive Entertainment, is an exception and does launch on Xbox, albiet under the MLB banner. Sony also recently released LEGO Horizon Adventures on Nintendo Switch, PS5, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clearly, the once impenetrable walls of console exclusivity are coming down. Microsoft, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff">which only yesterday made sweeping cuts to its gaming business as part of an eye-watering round of layoffs affecting over 9,000 staff</a>, is all-in on PlayStation. The aforementioned Gears of War: Reloaded marks the once Xbox-exclusive series' debut on PlayStation, Hellblade 2 hits PS5 in August, and Obsidian's The Outer Worlds 2 releases on Sony's console in October.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

In our own research online, we found examples of players <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1lo1w9q/me_when_the_update_actually_fixed_performance_and/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reporting genuine improvements</a>.

"I've reached a quiet acceptance of losing 239 hours of playtime alongside all my loadouts, layered armor, events, saved characters, stats, guild card, hunt log, and achievements.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is out, and as porters worldwide begin trekking across Hideo Kojima’s newest adventure, all sorts of little secrets and discoveries are being uncovered. While much attention will be paid to the grand, cinematic experience on display, Kojima also went ahead and stuffed Death Stranding 2 to the gills with little flourishes and details, some obvious, some very, very hidden.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve compiled a list of all the little details that help bring the world of Death Stranding 2 to life, from easter eggs to ingenious gameplay we can’t believe Kojima Productions thought to even add in the first place. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Death Stranding 2: 45 Amazing Details That Blew Us Away</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">1. The best part of Death Stranding 2 is seeing how the natural world interacts with Sam, or how Sam interacts with the natural world. Given that this is a game about traversing the different biomes of Australia, Sam will naturally get dirty, and this will be reflected on Sam’s character model. He’ll be covered in dirt, snow, and sludge after long journeys, which will require you to take showers to clean off.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701165334-1751416322609.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">2. It’s not limited to just the elements, either. After an intense fight, Sam will also become covered by the blood of his enemies. While this might make him look very battle hardened, it probably isn’t how Sam wants to present himself when he’s on deliveries, so be sure to clean off the blood in the shower too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">3. When not covered in grime, even just exposure to the sun can affect Sam’s appearance. He’ll turn redder as he gets more and more sunburnt, to the point where he can start resembling a cherry tomato in the face. Taking a shower will heal these burns, so bathe regularly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">4. However, if you decide to take off your backpack before showering, you’ll find that while you become clean, your backpack will stay dirty. Why you'd take your pack into the shower is beyond me, but it's better than carrying around a dirty pack, I suppose.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701165429-1751416322609.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">5. If you can’t make it to a shower, hopping into a lake or river will clear off some of the dirt up to the point you submerge yourself. Meaning if you only dip your shoes into the river, your boots will be clean, but the rest of you won’t be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">6. There are all sorts of different weather conditions in the world of Death Stranding 2, all of which will hit in real-time.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/09/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-pre-order-trailer-mp4-00-03-15-11-still012-1741556559512.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">7. The earliest natural event you encounter is the sandstorm, which severely impairs Sam’s visibility, forcing you to rely on your Odradek scanner to scope out the terrain. When the storm gets particularly bad, you’ll lose stamina and will need to hide behind large structures to shield yourself from the storm.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250615164856-1751416322606.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">8. Other natural disasters include blizzards that, like a sandstorm, will impair Sam’s vision and slow him down. Plus, when Sam’s too cold, his stamina will deplete faster than normal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">9. Lastly, thunderstorms will also strike Sam when he’s out and about. The rain in Death Stranding 2 is known to degrade Sam’s cargo and equipment faster than usual so be sure to find shelter fast to prevent your packages from getting damaged. And watch out for lightning strikes. While I haven’t seen anyone get hit by one yet (unlike in The Legend of Zelda), they can strike awfully close to Sam if he’s not careful.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701165537-1751416322610.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">10. What’s more, you can even see these weather events in real-time from afar. Meaning if there’s a blizzard happening on a mountaintop, you can see it from the base of the mountain.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/img-8382-1751420229357.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">11. Dust, rain, snow, and even chiral creatures build up on the screen when you spend too long in them, which adds to the immersive and cinematic approach Kojima takes with his games.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701164157-1751416322609.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">12. If you’re in the high heat of the desert too long you’ll begin to see mirages of rivers flowing through the sands. But as you get closer you’ll realize there’s no water there. Sorry.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/screenshot-2025-07-01-at-3-27-11-pm-1751416696816.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">13. Depending on which biome you’re in, whether it’s the hot desert or freezing mountaintops, Sam will take either a cold shower to cool off, or a hot shower to warm up.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/19/master-00-02-10-57-still013-1750343168746.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">14. As you and other porters begin carving paths through the world of Death Stranding 2 to make deliveries, you’ll find that regularly used paths become roads by themselves from being worn down, making them easier to traverse over time.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701170700-1751416322610.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">15. Rivers will also rise and fall with the rain. Some rivers become flooded under heavy rainfall, making them more difficult to traverse than under dry conditions.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/screenshot-2025-07-01-at-3-36-37-pm-1751416696816.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">16. The iconic image of Death Stranding as a series is Sam carrying a stack of boxes on his back. That’s because his porter job is inspired by the Japanese Bokka porter who transport boxes to homes that aren’t reachable by trucks or cars. There are references to the Bokka in dialogues with other porters and even a Bokka skeleton for Sam, which make it easier for him to traverse difficult terrain like rivers, inclines, and snow.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/img-8383-1751420229357.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">17. One of the most useful vehicles is the Pickup Off-Roader, which lets you haul tons of packages across long-distances. Depending on how and where it’s parked, Sam changes the way he climbs into the driver’s seat.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701170543-1751416322610.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">18. Ramps are invaluable when it comes to getting your vehicle across large gaps. But depending on what vehicle you use to jump the ramp, whether it’s on a vehicle, your floating carrier you ride like a skateboard, or even just using a skeleton on your legs, you can even do some cool skateboard and acrobatic tricks off the ramp.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701162151-1751416322608.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">19. Some Pickups aren’t driveable because they belong to specific shelters. Weirdly, Pickups that aren’t owned by Sam or Drawbridge feature the logo of Yamato Transport, a real-life Japanese delivery company.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701162026-1751416322608.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">20. There are numerous monorail lines you can build across Death Stranding 2 at set points, much like the roads you can build in Death Stranding 1 and 2. But they’re not just for trains as you can use a zip line to attach yourself to a monorail pole and travel that way.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701170006-1751416322610.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">21. But if you’re inclined to travel on foot, always remember to wear shoes! Walking barefoot too long will eventually cause Sam’s feet to bleed, which leaves a trail of blood behind. While you'll still be able to get around without shoes, Sam will refuse to run given how uncomfortable it is on his toes.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701155854-1751416322607.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">22. If you choose to give Sam a rest while on the road, or leave your controller idle for too long, Sam will have a nice sit down to catch a breather, at which point a floating Lou will appear over Sam’s head as he dreams about her.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/img-8385-1751422116928.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">23. While it might be fun to see how high you can stack boxes on your back, be careful of your surroundings as tall stacks of boxes won’t fit through certain doors and will instead topple over if they hit the ceiling, forcing you to pick them up again.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/screenshot-2025-07-01-at-5-51-40-pm-1751417560089.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">24. There are also special timed events set to specific dates, just like in the first Death Stranding. At the beginning of the game you’re asked to input your birthday. And if you boot up the game on your special day a unique cutscene will trigger where all your friends (and enemy) will wish you a happy birthday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">25. More than that, if you go out into the world and use the call out feature, other NPC porters will wish you a happy birthday too.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/img-8384-1751420229357.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">26. Your birthday isn’t the only special day. Playing Death Stranding 2 on Christmas day will add Christmas Tree holograms to shelters and give NPCs little Santa hats to wear to celebrate the joyous occasion. If you don’t want to wait for Christmas or your birthday, changing your PS5’s internal clock to the correct date will trigger these events.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/26/ds-pr-blog-1750947107288.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">27. While Death Stranding 2 isn’t purely about combat, there are a ton of ways to fight the BTs. Sam’s blood already has anti-BT properties making Blood Grenades lethal to BTs, but shooting a normal bullet through the blood cloud left behind the grenade will make them deadly against BTs too.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701165002-1751416322609.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">28. Guns aren’t your only weapons in a fight. If you <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/Connection_Level_Rewards_-_Weapons,_Items,_Upgrades_and_Star_Rating_Unlocks"><u>unlock the secret cutscene for the Pizza Chef</u></a> (played by Ghost in the Shell director Mamoru Oshii), you’ll unlock an entire new martial arts fighting style based around the delicious meal.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701164919-1751416322609.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">29. One of your constant companions on the road is Dollman, who you can throw up high into the air to do reconnaissance on enemy bases. But you can also throw him straight at an enemy to temporarily stun them.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/19/master-00-13-11-36-still041-1750343168751.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">30. Unlike other weapons, Dollman is a living being and he will eventually get mad at you if you throw him at too many enemies, or let him drop to the ground after a recon trip. If he’s upset, he won’t let you throw him for a while.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701161604-1751416322608.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">31. Bandits in Death Stranding 2 are often equipped with stun rods that blast waves of electricity. However, if you have the Electric Shock Absorber add-on for you backpack, you can turn their electric attacks into power for your battery.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/screenshot-2025-07-01-at-5-49-44-pm-1751417424510.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: Eurogamer</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">32. Boss fights return in Death Stranding 2, and while you should have all the weapons and tools to get through them, some are incredibly tough and can cause you to die repeatedly. If a fight is too annoying, the game will trigger a “Pretend You Won” option to skip the fight in exchange for a small impact to your overall mission score.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701161415-1751416322608.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">33. Death Stranding 2 is populated by a ton of survivors, many with familiar faces, and if you make enough deliveries to them they might give you some unique items. The Data Scientist, who is a famous Vtuber named Usada Pekora, will give you a bunny hood that makes Sam say “Peko” after each sentence, similar to Pekora’s verbal tic. Peko.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701161445-1751416322608.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">34. The Peko hood is only one of a variety of hoods and hats you can earn in Death Stranding 2 with others giving Sam unique abilities. The camel hood will protect Sam from the heat of the desert and refill his water for stamina, and the seal hood returns which lets Sam safely float across rivers. One gooey looking Chiral Roden hat will even ward away Chiral Creatures.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701154746-1751416322607.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">35. Shelters house different survivors, and depending on their real-life counterpart, will have little nods to their identities. The Adventurer and his son who are played by RRR director SS Rajamouli and SS karthikeya, for example, their holograms outside their shelter has them doing an iconic pose from their hit film.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701161239-1751416322608.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">36. Another shelter in Australia is an animal sanctuary overseen by members of a conservationist group, played by the music group CHVRCHES. If you rescue animals and send them to the sanctuary, the group will send you social media pics of the animal living happily in their new home.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-20250701161342-1751416322608.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">37. However, you have to be careful when traveling because you can accidentally run over and kill these poor creatures if you’re not paying attention. Which is one way to earn dislikes in the world of Death Stranding 2. While a lot of what you do in the world will get you likes from your fellow porters and shelter dwellers, there are ways to have likes taken away, and accidental animal killing is one of them.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/screenshot-2025-07-01-at-5-46-33-pm-1751417234985.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">38. There are also a ton of scares in Death Stranding 2. During certain times, Sam will get nightmares while sleeping aboard the DHV Magellan, which trigger some frankly terrifying cutscenes, including one notable one that features a mannequin doing some freaky stuff.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/09/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-pre-order-trailer-mp4-00-04-58-11-still022-1741556559513.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">39. There are scares out in the world too. One mission revolves around a Ghost Track haunted by Headless Bikers.

A developer told the site, "I don't think anybody is really happy about the quality of the product right now. There's been a lot of tension and pep talks trying to rally folks to ship."</p><p>Microsoft just recently announced that it would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amid-rumors-of-halo-on-ps5-and-switch-2-microsoft-confirms-halo-news-is-coming/1100-6532848/" data-ref-id="1100-6532848">share more details on the future of Halo in October</a>, and all eyes will be on the studio following the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-launch-was-like-a-runner-tripping-and-falling-at-the-finish-line-xbox-boss-says/1100-6508915/" data-ref-id="1100-6508915">disappointment of Halo Infinite</a>.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/">Helldivers 2</a> will be deploying its brand of managed democracy to Xbox Series X|S consoles in August. Officially announced during a livestream, the game is a co-op third-person action game in which players take on the role of a Helldiver, a soldier determined to protect Super Earth and all of its interests by any--mostly violent--means necessary.</p><p>The PlayStation-published game originally launched for PS5 and PC in early 2024, and it was one of the breakout hits of the year. <em>"</em>We know gamers have been asking for this for some time and we are so excited to bring more Helldivers into our game," game director Mikael Eriksson said in a press release. "We have so much more in store for the future months and years--and the more players we have the more stories we can tell! The fight for Super Earth has only just begun."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QmoO17UZE48" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QmoO17UZE48" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Helldivers 2 on Xbox is an unusual move by Sony, because while we've seen several games from Microsoft's game studios appear on PlayStation consoles recently, the same can't be said for Sony with its titles. The company has brought several of its first-party projects--like Insomniac's Spider-Man games and Naughty Dog's The Last of Us series--to PC, but they've technically remained exclusive to PS5 and PS4 consoles. While we don't expect that to change, it is still encouraging to see a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/people-really-want-helldivers-2-on-xbox-including-some-playstation-fans/1100-6521227/" data-ref-id="1100-6521227">PlayStation-published title on Xbox</a>.</p><p>Best described as Warhammer 40K meets Starship Troopers, Helldivers 2 revolves around players achieving specific objectives on various alien planets as part of the ongoing Galactic War. While there's stiff resistance on the ground in the form of the Terminid, Automaton, and Illuminate factions, players can call in for some extra firepower from their loadout, and since launch, the game has added new weapons and tactical options to player arsenals.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-update-sees-players-returning-in-droves/1100-6531700/">Recent content updates have been received quite well</a> amongst the fanbase, with the recent release of the Heart of Democracy update proving to be a reinvigorating shot in the arm for the game.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/doom-co-creator-john-romeros-entire-romero-games-studio-has-been-laid-off-following-microsoft-layoffs-as-xbox-cuts-funding-for-new-fps/">VideoGamer</a> reports that the upcoming shooter was being funded by Microsoft, specifically Bethesda — which works on the current iteration of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/doom">DOOM</a>. Most of the studio's output was on PC and mobile, but it did release the strategy RPG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/empire_of_sin">Empire of Sin</a> on Switch back in 2020. And it goes without saying that John Romero is one of the most influential figures in the industry.</p>
<p>Studio co-founder Brenda Romero shared a statement on <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/07/we-have-some-difficult-news-to-share-microsoft-kills-off-john-romeros-upcoming-fps-title">social media</a> (via <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/07/we-have-some-difficult-news-to-share-microsoft-kills-off-john-romeros-upcoming-fps-title">Time Extension</a>) earlier today revealing the news that funding has been cut-off; "This was a strategic decision made at a high level within the publisher, well above our visibility or control."</p>
<p>Romero says that the cuts aren't "a reflection of our team's work", and that all internal deadlines were met.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We’re currently evaluating next steps and working quickly to support our team. Many of us have worked together for more than a decade, some for over 20 years. It’s an extremely difficult day and we’re heartbroken that it’s come to this. If you know of any opportunities or ways you can help our incredible team, please reach out."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Christoph Redl, a now-former surface and 3D artist at the developer, <a href="https://x.com/christophredl94/status/1940719223472640128">shared that</a> "due to the recent Xbox layoffs", he's now looking for work.</p>
<p>Another big loss at Romero Games is senior producer Emily Winters, who posted on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346477777308573697/">LinkedIn</a> "Unfortunately, I’ve been impacted by the recent layoffs at Microsoft and am now #OpenToWork effective immediately," despite only working for the company for a few months.</p>
<p>Sound designer <a href="https://x.com/sarahsherIock/status/1940723994023678240">Sarah Sherlock</a>, 3D character artist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/conorjordan7_opentowork-activity-7346478140136845316-6aZ3?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAFI2MAQBamN-UABQSztFbGwWwUXpLI2zSZU">Conor Jordan</a>, and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7346509606413582337/">a host of other artists and talents</a> have all been let go.</p>
<p>This follows yesterday's news that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/microsoft-announces-another-wave-of-layoffs-over-9000-jobs-affected">Microsoft and Xbox Gaming have laid off over 9,000 staff</a> across all of its divisions, with studios such as Rare, Halo Studios, The Initiative, ZeniMax Online, Raven, and Turn 10 all affected.</p>
<p>We're sending our thoughts out to all of those affected.</p>

			<p>Arrowhead Games has announced that the previously PlayStation-console exclusive, Helldivers 2, is finally making its way across the aisle to team green, and will launch on Xbox Series X/S later this summer on <strong>August 26, 2025</strong>.</p>



<p>The announcement was made by Arrowhead's chief creative officer, Johan Pilestedt, during a short livestream where Arrowhead revealed the trailer for Helldivers 2 coming to Xbox, followed by Pilestedt briefly speaking about how players have been requesting backup since Helldivers 2 launched, and the best way for Arrowhead to accommodate those requests in the fight for democracy, was to add a new platform to the mix. </p>



<p>Pre-orders for Helldivers 2 on Xbox are already live for those who want to make sure they can join the fight right when the game goes live on August 26. Helldivers 2 will also not be launching on Xbox Series consoles directly into Xbox Game Pass. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>In an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/03/helldivers-2-xbox-release-date-pre-order/">Xbox Wire blog post</a>, game director on Helldivers 2, Mikael Eriksson added "<em>We know gamers have been asking for this for some time and we are so excited to bring more Helldivers into our game. We have so much more in store for the future months and years - and the more players we have the more stories we can tell! The fight for Super Earth has only just begun.</em>"</p>



<p>Despite the fact that players have been asking for Helldivers 2 to come to Xbox since the game first released on PlayStation and PC, it wouldn't have been the biggest shock if it never happened, considering the fact that PlayStation did publish the game. Arrowhead isn't a PlayStation first-party studio, but as the game's publisher, it still held strong sway over where the game ended up. Fortunately for Xbox players, a deal was reached, and now those with naught but a Series X/S at home can join the fight for Super Earth. </p>



<p>And just in time too, since Xbox players need something to take their minds off the week that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-bet-wrong-horse-subscriptions-says-analyst/">Xbox and Microsoft have had</a>. Yesterday, news of mass layoffs at Microsoft started to trickle out, with more than 9,000 people laid off across all of Microsoft, a not insignificant amount of those coming from the Gaming division. Multiple projects were cancelled, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">Rare's Everwild</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">The Initiative's Perfect Dark</a>, the latter of which saw the studio shut down. <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">ZeniMax Online's unannounced MMORPG was canned</a>, along with several other unannounced projects. <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-creators-romero-games-next-unannounced-project-has-been-cancelled/">Romero Studios had the funding for their game cut</a>, and there's <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-developer-turn-10-hit-hard-layoffs/">still more details coming</a> regarding <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">just how many people are losing their jobs</a>. And the week isn't even over yet.</p>

                <p>Romero Games, the studio headed up by John and Brenda Romero, has announced that an unspecified publisher has canceled funding for its new game, and it's believed to be Microsoft.</p><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/romerogamesltd/status/1940716112922190248?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a>, Brenda Romero said "our publisher has canceled funding for our game along with several other unannounced projects at other studios." She added, "This was a strategic decision made at a high level within the publisher, well above our visibility or control."</p><p>The wording and the timing suggests that Microsoft was the publisher for this new game, given Microsoft just confirmed it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">canceled multiple unannounced games</a>. Romero Games said years ago when its new FPS was announced that it was working with a <a href="https://www.romerogames.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"major"</a> publisher, and Microsoft would fit that bill. An affected staffer at Romero Games <a href="https://x.com/christophredl94/status/1940719223472640128?s=46" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said outright on social media</a> that, "Unfortunately, due to the recent Xbox layoffs, I've lost my position at Romero Games."</p><p>Romero went on to say, "We deeply wish there had been something, anything, we could have done to prevent this outcome." She added that Romero Games "hit every milestone on time, every time, consistently received high praises, and easily passed all our internal gates."</p><p>"We are incredibly proud of the work being done, and of the talented team behind it," she said.</p><p>Romero said the studio is now "evaluating next steps and working quickly to support our team." According to an affected staffer, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/john-romeros-next-fps-has-lost-funding-in-the-wake-of-the-microsoft-cuts/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the "whole studio" is being let go.</a></p><p>In 2022, John Romero <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/john-romero-releases-a-new-doom-2-level-donating-proceeds-to-help-people-of-ukraine/1100-6501222/" data-ref-id="1100-6501222">released a new Doom II level with all proceeds going to help the people of Ukraine.</a></p><p>If the new FPS from Romero Games was indeed canceled by Microsoft, it would join the likes of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-a-decade-rares-everwild-canceled-as-part-of-xbox-layoffs-report/1100-6532912/" data-ref-id="1100-6532912">Everwild</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-aaaa-perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shutting-down/1100-6532921/" data-ref-id="1100-6532921">Perfect Dark in being cancelled</a> as a result of Microsoft latest changes.

            <p>EA's executive leadership has reportedly set a goal of 100 million players for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">the upcoming Battlefield game</a>, which "very few" developers believe is achievable.</p>
<p><a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/07/behind-the-next-battlefield-game-culture-clash-crunch-and-colossal-stakes/">This comes from a tell-all report from Ars Technica</a>, which explores the game's many ambitions and problems through information gathered from anonymous sources. In this article, battle royale modes in competitor titles like Call of Duty inspired this <em>optimistic </em>figure.</p>
<p>"Obviously, Battlefield has never achieved those numbers before," stated one source, while another said: "It's important to understand that over about that same period, 2042 has only gotten 22 million."</p>

<p>For reference, Call of Duty Warzone reached 100 million players back in April 2021 <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2021/04/Incredible-Warzone-and-Game-Sales-Milestones">per an official blog post</a>. Warzone originally came out in March 2020, so it took roughly a year for the biggest FPS IP out there to hit that figure. In 2018, <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-fortnite-triggered-an-unwinnable-war-between-parents-and-their-boys-11545397200?mod=e2tw">a Fortnite interview in the Wall Street Journal</a> revealed the game had over 200 million people download and play the industry defining battle royale.</p>
<p>According to the report, those who had worked at DICE for a while were "particularly sceptical", with one source saying: "nothing in the market research or our quality deliverables indicates that we would be anywhere near that."</p>
<p>The article also states Battlefield 5's battle royale mode Firestorm failed to meet expectations, while the aforementioned competitors continued to retain vast playerbases. Nonetheless, it seems that a new attempt at this format is what EA leadership expects will attract much of that 100 million figure. </p>
<p>This new Battlefield is currently undergoing a closed alpha test, though that hasn't stopped leaks from getting out. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-leak-confirms-return-of-fan-favourite-mode">Rush mode has been leaked</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-battlefield-single-player-campaign-details-leak-online">some single player campaign info</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-most-important-leaks-battlefield-6">a deluge of info on weapons and a battle royale mode</a>. If this next Battlefield can hit the targets set out by EA executives, it'll be the most popular Battlefield game ever by a large margin. Whether it actually can, is something else entirely.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reportedly-expects-battlefield-6-to-have-100-million-players-three-times-more-than-the-series-best-seller]]></content:encoded>
