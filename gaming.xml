            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/silver_bullet">Silver Bullet</a>’s aesthetic is dark, cartoony, and full of Halloween charm. But beneath its playful premise of a pint-sized Van Helsing rescuing puppies from the forces of darkness lies a razor-blade-stuffed apple - an arcade game with a wicked edge.</p>
<p>Mashing genres into something unique, its crosshair shooting setup is reminiscent of Cabal or Wild Guns, but eradicates ambiguous pseudo-3D trajectories by flattening everything onto a pure 2D plane. You trace your crosshair about the screen to gun down ghouls and dash to avoid bullets, while giant bosses - everything from fiery skeletons to undead dinosaurs - rain down fun and fearsome bullet hell-style patterns that are both inventive and thrilling to work through.</p>
<p>Helsing has a regularly refilled super attack that can be aimed and fired in a straight line, bleeding point icons as it wipes out enemies, and a close-encounters button-tap parry for expert use. His dash manoeuvre can also destroy enemies and certain obstacles, essential for tidying cluttered screens.</p>
<p>The goal is simple: don’t die and make your super shots count. Fine-tuned for scoring, each stage is plumbed with tricks to propel you up the leaderboards, with an accuracy meter that rises when hitting an object, multiplying your points, and falling when firing on dead air. A death, however, cuts this right down. Coins can be teased from each stage to be spent in a shop, doubling your super usage and improving accuracy, amongst other effects, implemented to incrementally improve your chances.</p>
<p>There are six stages and six interim, viciously creative bonus games that are frankly very tough to crack, borrowing ideas from Namco’s <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/point_blank">Point Blank</a> and Capcom’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/pang">Pang</a>, amongst others. There’s a challenging score attack mode and a novel <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/tetris">Tetris</a> shooting-hybrid called Terror Blocks to unlock, with a unique scoring system all its own.</p>
<p>If you don’t care about points, continues are freely available to get you through the game. At only 35 minutes in length, however, Silver Bullet shines brightest when you attempt a one-credit clear, and it's meticulously engineered around this. Extra lives appear at certain waypoints, and pocketing coins to rapidly empty the shop is a smart approach. Challenging though it is, the reward for success is all the more elating. This is owed largely to a clever arrangement that, once understood, keeps drawing you back for another go.</p>
<p>Yet, there are a few frustrations. It's occasionally difficult to discern which objects you can safely dash through, and positioning with walk or dash isn't entirely foolproof. Silver Bullet’s most prominent foible, though, is its control dilemma. Designed around a twin-stick setup - one for Helsing’s movement and the other for crosshair positioning - it's awkward to have button work restricted to the shoulders and triggers. Switching to traditional controls is far more comfortable, but then you can’t move the crosshair independently unless you’re firing at the same time. This negatively impacts your accuracy and, in turn, your scoring.</p>
<p>It’s not a colossal problem, and casual gamers will have a great time with its cleverly devised stages, but those aiming to play as intended face a tough choice: master the twin-stick controls or accept reduced scoring potential in favour of a more intuitive experience. It's a thorny choice, but regardless of how you choose to play, Silver Bullet is a bewitchingly fun little Halloween title that will have arcade enthusiasts howling at the moon.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/silver-bullet]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-final-story-dlc-out-november-11/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii%E2%80%99s-final-story-dlc-is-out-on-november-11.1332991/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, publisher Plaion and developer Warhorse Studios announced that the final story DLC planned for Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, titled Mysteria Ecclesiae, will be released on November 11.</p>



<p>In this expansion pack, Henry, the game's main character, becomes Sigismund Albicus's assistant. Albicus is a renowned healer with ties to King Wenceslas himself. Henry is tasked with a clandestine mission within the monastery's ancient walls and finds himself entangled in a web of intrigue and a deadly, mysterious plague, where each faction harbours its own hidden motives.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II players can explore the fascinating Sedletz Monastery and meet its elusive inhabitants. A sudden epidemic has hit the area, and it is imperative to discover its origin. Warhorse promises a rich, cinematic quest that will test the player's deductive and sleuthing skills.</p>



<p>Unraveling the secrets of Sedletz Monastery will require interacting with its inhabitants and discovering their hidden agendas. They will engage with various factions, each with its own motivations, and shape the course of events with their decisions. Players will traverse the diverse areas of the historically accurate Sedletz Monastery, gradually unlocking new sections as they solve mysteries and uncover hidden secrets. As you would expect from such a DLC, the developers have introduced new outfits, weapons, potions and books to expand Henry's knowledge and abilities.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Mysteria Ecclesiae can be purchased at $13.99 on its own, or as part of the Expansion Pass, which is priced at $29.99. That also includes the other two previously released story DLCs, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-brushes-with-death-story-dlc-out-now-on-all-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brushes with Death</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-legacy-of-the-forge-dlc-update-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Legacy of the Forge</a>. Kingdom Come: Deliverance II Gold Edition owners will get Mysteria Ecclesiae automatically, since the Gold Edition includes the Expansion Pass.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II has been a great success for both Plaion and Warhorse Studios, having sold over three million units to date. The game also received outstanding acclaim from critics, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including a perfect score from Wccftech's Chris Wray</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Warhorse Studios and publisher Deep Silver have announced the final&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II&nbsp;</em>story DLC, and it'll take Henry to a plague-stricken monastery to investigate the deadly disease's origin next month.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Mysteria Ecclesiae&nbsp;</em>will serve as the celebrated medieval RPG's last major expansion, and it's set for release across all platforms on November 11th.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Mysteria Ecclesiae</em>, you'll serve as the assistant to renowned healer Sigismund Albicus, and together with that venerated figure, you'll be investigating the Sedletz Monastery, where "a web of intrigue and a deadly, mysterious plague" await you, as well as factions with their own "hidden motives".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-final-dlc-monastery.jpg?itok=dXRM_Tco 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-final-dlc-monastery.jpg?itok=HRYkLbut 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II&nbsp;</em>is getting one final story DLC next month.</figcaption></figure><p>As you'd probably expect from&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>, the Sedletz Monastery will be a "historically accurate" area in which you can expect "diverse areas" to explore, as well as "hidden secrets" to uncover.</p>

<p>Naturally, you'll also be able to take advantage of a brand new outfit for Henry, as well as new weapons, potions, and books to help you "expand [your] knowledge and abilities to new horizons". In short, if you loved the base game, it'll almost certainly be worth checking this DLC out.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>, it's the sequel to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">hugely successful</a> 2018 action RPG&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>, and like its predecessor, the sequel emphasizes historical realism and accuracy over fantasy elements.</p>

<p>You'll once again take the role of Henry of Skalitz as he sets out on a journey to avenge the murder of his parents, and along the way, you'll discover plenty of medieval court intrigue to get wrapped up in.</p>




<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II&nbsp;</em>is no slouch in the sales department either; at last count, the game had managed to rack up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">three million sales for itself</a>, and it's almost certainly topped that figure by now as well.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Mysteria Ecclesiae&nbsp;</em>expansion when it launches on November 11th. The game itself is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/9N4W31HSMVVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and you can read our review <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-review-deliciously-executed-revenge" rel="nofollow">right here</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-switch-2-delayed-2026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-switch-2-version-delayed-for-performance-adjustments.1332985/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco have announced that the upcoming Switch 2 version of celebrated open-world action RPG&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>has been delayed into next year.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1981360180580217143" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media, the two studios say that while development on the game's Switch 2 port "continues wholeheartedly towards release", a delay is necessary in order for the developers to implement "performance adjustments".</p>

<p>No new release date has been given; all we know is that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</em>, for 'tis its name, is now due to arrive on Nintendo's new console sometime in 2026.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-switch-2-delayed-margit.jpg?itok=ggS7d90b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-switch-2-delayed-margit.jpg?itok=7L1R1DRX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>won't be hitting the Switch 2 this year.</figcaption></figure><p>News of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s delay on Switch 2 follows reports that the game's performance on the console was lackluster, to say the least; during a hands-on at Gamescom, IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/elden-ring-on-switch-2-is-a-disaster-in-handheld-mode-gamescom-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">described</a>&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s Switch 2 handheld performance as "a disaster".</p>

<p>The publication said that frame drops were "significant" when turning the camera outside of the game's initial tutorial area, and that the Switch 2 version of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>also sported a "confusing button layout", which is odd considering the console's controller setup is pretty much the same as any other.</p>

<p>IGN didn't say anything about&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s docked performance on Switch 2, but it presumably won't fare much better than the handheld version, so hopefully, this extra time gives FromSoftware and Bandai Namco time to polish up&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>on Nintendo's new machine before release.</p>

<p>When it does eventually launch,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition&nbsp;</em>will bring the full game experience to Switch 2, including last year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree" rel="nofollow">excellent</a>&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC and all updates that have been released since the game's initial 2022 launch.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition&nbsp;</em>when it launches sometime next year on Switch 2, and the game is also currently available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/elden-ring/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/elden-ring/9P3J32CTXLRZ/0010" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a> (albeit with the DLC sold separately).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced&nbsp;<em>Mega Rising</em>, the latest expansion for the mobile smash hit&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, and it's due to bring a game-changing new set of 'mons to the digital card game next week.</p>

<p>Launching on October 29th,&nbsp;<em>Mega Rising&nbsp;</em>makes good on a promise made by The Pokemon Company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-evolution-fall" rel="nofollow">back in August</a>&nbsp;by introducing Mega Evolved Pokemon into the mix. As you'd imagine, these are powerful cards, but they come with risks, too.</p>

<p>Mega Evolved Pokemon will have higher stats and attack power than regular creatures, but if you manage to knock them out, you'll win three whole points for yourself. That's right; defeating a Mega Evolved Pokemon wins you the match, regardless of where things currently stand.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-rising-cards.jpg?itok=AOziJHCb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-rising-cards.jpg?itok=G8yqf7Kh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s new&nbsp;<em>Mega Rising&nbsp;</em>expansion has plenty of Mega Evolved cards for you to admire.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, just like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-expansion" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-expansion-shining-revelry" rel="nofollow">expansions</a>, you can expect a bevy of new cards to collect and admire in&nbsp;<em>Mega Rising&nbsp;</em>as well, and some of the artwork for these cards is truly jaw-dropping. Here's hoping its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-production-issue-plagiarism" rel="nofollow">provenance is legit this time</a>, eh?</p>

<p>Mega Evolved 'mons include the likes of Blaziken, Gyarados, and Altaria, and you can also expect new art for existing Pokemon like Pidgey, Growlithe, and Jirachi, among others. It's a real smorgasbord of beautiful Pokemon drawings.</p>

<p>Not only that, but you can also look forward to accessories based on Mega Blaziken, which will be available starting from October 31st to give you the opportunity to "make your hottest cards look even more scorching".</p>

<p>You can take a look at the (appropriately epic) announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Mega Rising&nbsp;</em>expansion, which shows off some of the expansion's beautiful artwork and new cards, right here.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Mega Rising&nbsp;</em>expansion when it launches on October 29th.

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Reportedly Pushing Xbox to Hit Sky-High 30% Profit Margins]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-profit-margins-30-percent-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-reportedly-pushing-xbox-to-hit-sky-high-30-profit-margins.1332976/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox is reportedly being pushed by parent company Microsoft to achieve profit margins far in excess of those towards which the rest of the industry aims, according to a new report.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> (which, of course, cites "people familiar with the business"), Microsoft has set goals of 30% for Xbox's "accountability margins", which is apparently the term Microsoft uses instead of "profit margins". Start brushing up on those corpo-jargon dictionaries now.</p>

<p>Bloomberg reports that average industry profit margins sit between 17% and 22%. Xbox's have generally been lower than that over the past few years at between 10% and 20%, so this 30% profit goal is a massive jump even for Xbox, let alone for the rest of the industry.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-xbox-profit-report.jpg?itok=q8T0vi_o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-xbox-profit-report.jpg?itok=fzU76ZfK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox is reportedly being pushed to hit 30% profit margins by overlo-er, parent company Microsoft.</figcaption></figure><p>S&amp;P Global analyst Neil Barbour told Bloomberg that the 30% target is one "usually reserved for a publisher that is really nailing it". Given the controversy surrounding <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-tiers-reworked-2025" rel="nofollow">recent Game Pass changes</a>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">project cancellations</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">layoffs</a>, I'd say you'd struggle to apply that descriptor to Xbox right now.</p>

<p>Speaking of Game Pass, Bloomberg's sources say that Xbox's requirement for all first-party games to launch on Game Pass on day one "has hurt Xbox game sales".</p>

<p>According to Bloomberg, Xbox offers a developer incentive that is calculated based on "several factors", one of which is the number of hours players spend on Game Pass titles. Naturally, that means these rewards will be given more often to developers of live-service titles or those without finite campaigns.</p>

<p>In previous years, Xbox staff weren't given specific numerical figures as profit goals; this change, according to Bloomberg, came in 2023 and was introduced by CFO Amy Hood, who's been taking "a larger role in the gaming business" alongside her team recently.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-xbox-profit-margin-report.jpg?itok=N5fYh_Q6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-xbox-profit-margin-report.jpg?itok=RUcgzQTr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Game Pass apparently continues to cause problems for Xbox developers.</figcaption></figure><p>This isn't the first time we've heard of Game Pass reportedly causing problems for developers and Xbox insiders. Back in September, former Xbox VP Shannon Loftis said the service <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-shannon-loftis-comments" rel="nofollow">creates "weird inner tensions" among developers</a>, with Game Pass adoption coming "at the expense of retail revenue".</p>

<p>It's not hard to see how that might make hitting the aforementioned 30% profit margin difficult, and if Bloomberg's report is to be believed, the publisher is still being expected to hit this target even when taking day one Game Pass games into account.</p>

<p>If it's accurate, the 30% profit margin figure might explain some of Xbox's recent moves, including hiking the price of Game Pass, cancelling projects left and right, and shutting down studios.</p>

<p>For its own part, Xbox told Bloomberg that success "doesn't look the same across every project", and that the company sometimes has to make "hard decisions" while "shifting resources towards the projects that are more aligned with [its] direction and priorities".</p>

She’s <a href="https://x.com/natalie_thenerd/status/1980151692625842526?s=61">currently developing a kit</a> so <a href="https://nataliethenerd.com/products/brick-boy-in-stock-notification">anyone can upgrade Lego’s Game Boy</a> to actually play games, but the creators of the BrickBoy have beaten her to the punch by taking a few shortcuts.</p></div><p>Natalie’s Lego Game Boy upgrades were all the more impressive because she had to create a custom circuit board, smaller than a Game Boy cartridge, to fit inside the replica using original chips so it could play actual cartridges. The BrickBoy is instead a custom self-contained module that slots into the Lego Game Boy’s cartridge slot and plays games through ROM files and emulation.</p><p>The BrickBoy’s creators claim it takes about five minutes to integrate the kit into Lego’s model, including installing a 2.4-inch LCD screen module, aligning magnetic sensors beneath the action buttons and D-pad, and reassembling it all. It looks easy enough, but those concerned with aesthetics may be disappointed to see that one version of the cartridge module does appear to stick out of the back of the Lego Game Boy because it houses a pair of AAA batteries.</p><p>The BrickBoy will be <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brickboy/brickboy-the-kit-that-makes-the-lego-game-boy-come-alive">available for preorder through a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign</a> that’s set to launch on October 28th, 2025, in three versions. The Essential Kit can play Game Boy games in grayscale and includes a mono speaker, while the Gamer Kit adds support for Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance titles, Bluetooth headphone connectivity, and a rechargeable battery. There will also be a Collector’s Edition with a permanent power supply for those wanting to display their Lego Game Boy running demos, but pricing for the various kits hasn’t been announced yet.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/805376/lego-game-boy-brickboy-emulator-kickstarter]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re kicking yourself still for not jumping on any of the deals from a couple weeks ago over at Amazon for Prime Big Deals Day, something wonderful just dropped into your lap. Right now, Amazon has one of its Fire TVs on sale for 31% off. And this isn’t a Fire TV Stick, this is a full 50-inch TV with a Fire TV interface.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4953/"> That discount brings the price down from $520 to just $360, saving you a whole $160</a>. <strong>If that’s not enough to get you excited, it also includes a free Fire TV Soundbar.</strong> Those start around at least $100 and it’s bundled here for no extra charge.</p>
<p>The Amazon smart TV measures across at 50-inches making for a pretty sizable display for a living room, den, or any shared space really. This is the 4-series model from 2024. It supports vivid 4K entertainment withy HDR10, HLG, and Dolby Digital Plus which all work together to make an impressive picture for your enjoyment with clear clarity and bright colors.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4953/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>As an Amazon smart TV, this comes with an Alexa-enabled remote. The Alexa remote is a complete gamechanger when it comes to browsing for content. Those on-screen keypads can be so cumbersome to type on. Every app lays them out differently, with some being in alphabetical order and others following the popularized QWERTY layout. And all you have in the little directional pad to hop over one letter at a time. That can take forever to type out a long title like “<em>Only Murders in the Building</em>.” Sweat not, because with the Alexa remote, you can just hold the button and speak the title aloud, then be brought right to it.</p>



<h2>Fire TV Soundbar Included</h2>
<p>TV speakers have gotten better and better over the years, but they’re still no comparison to a dedicated surround sound system or sound bar. What a treat it is that this TV comes with its own soundbar free of charge. This can be set right in front of your TV on top of your media center so you can enjoy rich, three-dimensional virtual surround sound. It supports DTS Virtual:X and even more detail with Dolby Audio. It’s easy to set up too. Just plug it into the TV with the included HDMI cable to the HDMI eARC/ARC on the TV. Presto, now the soundbar will work just like that.</p>
<p>The TV has three additional HDMI ports along with that HDMI eARC/ARC port so you can connect to a cable box or multiple gaming consoles if you wish.</p>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has a release date for the Nintendo Switch 2. </p>



<p>On Thursday, it was announced that the latest game in the long-running Ubisoft series will come to Nintendo’s latest console on December 2. Its launch marks the first time a current Assassin’s Creed game will release on Nintendo Hardware. </p>



<p>“Experience Feudal Japan as shinobi Naoe or samurai Yasuke while enjoying cross-progression and touchscreen support on all menus,” the announcement reads.</p>



<p>The game will cost $59.99 and will come with all post-launch updates included. The recently released Claws of Awaji DLC, which adds roughly 10 hours of content for players, will come to the platform early next year. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Earlier rumors suggested a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-release-date-leaks-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">December 5 release</a> date for the game. That would’ve seen the game release on Friday of the same week as opposed to Tuesday. Turns out, however, Ubisoft wanted the game out a few days earlier.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Counter-Strike 2 fans worldwide are ruing a recent change made by Valve that has drastically impacted the CS skins market. In an update to how players can obtain and trade Counter-Strike skins, Valve has made it so that players can offer up five Covert-quality skins for a <strong>guaranteed knife </strong>or <strong>pair of gloves</strong>. Before the update, these were some of the most valuable items on the market.</p>



<p>This tweak to the pre-existing trade-up system has meant that items once considered rare and expensive have crashed in value, slicing some players’ inventories a considerable amount.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-did-valve-destroy-the-skins-market">Why Did Valve Destroy The Skins Market?</h2>



<p>Valve has long had a tentative relationship with the wider skins market. The nature of the market has lent itself to some dubious practices rising in recent years, especially around the concepts of skin gambling and off-platform trading.</p>



<p>The most valuable Counter-Strike skins can run up price tags in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and private collectors have parted ways with that much without thinking about it. That might be about to change, thanks to an update made by Valve that caused the skins market value to shatter, dropping by $2 billion overnight.</p>



<p>Valve has made these changes to shift market dynamics, rebalance the economy, make high-tier items much more attainable, and potentially even <strong>democratize </strong>rare cosmetics. Covert skins will now have their prices skyrocket as knife and glove prices, some of the highest in the game, will deflate.</p>



<p>Overnight, some of the most valuable knife and glove prices in Counter-Strike 2 dropped by as much as 40%. The hit caused the overall market cap for Counter-Strike skins to collapse in on itself. Before the change, the skins market was estimated to be worth as much as <strong>$5 billion</strong>.</p>



<p>For some, it’s a critical change that has drastic financial implications, especially for those who were HODLing their skins and weathering the market. For others, it’s a healthy correction that could make the cosmetic market in Counter-Strike 2 a little more accessible.</p>



<p>From a competitive perspective, this could have a knock-on impact on sponsorships, special events, and streamers opening cases and such to keep their community engaged.</p>



<p>Do you think this change was worth the hit, or should Valve rethink this action? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

However, after EA and Battlefield Studios finally pulled back the curtain with a trailer yesterday, the only thing on the community’s mind was a question: could this be the beginning of the end?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New Battlefield 6 maps like Blackwell Fields and Eastwood certainly served as meaningful attention grabbers, but it’s just one skin that has completely controlled the conversation. The cosmetic in question is Wicked Grin, a new skin for the Assault Class. A sneak peek at the suit arrived via various Battlefield 6 Season 1 previews that hit the web yesterday, revealing a wardrobe that fans feel ranges from grounded to gaudy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/battlefield-6s-first-batch-of-soldier-skins-is-more-tactical-than-tacti-cool-but-if-you-thought-that-one-green-skin-was-a-step-too-far-i-dont-know-what-to-tell-you/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PC Gamer</u></a> was one of a few sites to share an image of the skin, which features dark blue highlights from head to toe. It’s Class operator also sports a toothy smile painted across their bandana. It’s been more than enough to set off alarm bells among the Battlefield 6 community, especially considering the Wicked Grin skin description teases that it can be “unlocked as a free store gift.” It suggests Assault players could flood lobbies with those standout blues as soon as next week, potentially bringing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/youre-too-good-for-camo-battlefield-6-players-cant-help-but-poke-fun-at-absurd-orange-recon-skin">fans' fear of goofy skins</a> into reality. Even if this or any of the other Season 1 skins remain a far cry from the dozens of celebrity, superhero, and cartoon character crossovers present in other popular shooters <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-devs-paying-attention-to-community-feedback-on-goofy-skins">like Call of Duty</a> and Fortnite, tens of thousands of fans are clearly unhappy with what they’re seeing so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So, weren't we supposed to have realistic skins for some time?” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1oddt46/grounded_skins_for_a_while_18_days_exactly/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>popular comment from a fan</u></a> says. “Something that someone would really wear during a war? Yet it seems that with the start of Season 1, everything will turn to colorful mess, with no way of differentiating teams based on uniforms, the game will look more like a Paintball or [ActionSportGames] event.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I will not revive anyone wearing this kind of skin.

Still, the Season 1 skin is being perceived as a breach of trust after the community had been told to expect grounded visuals across the board for at least a while.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are a gritty, grounded, realistic shooter,” Ripple Effect and BF Studios technical director Christian Buhl <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secretly-console-first-ripple-effect-talks-building-battlefield-6-and-lessons-learned-from-battlefield-2042"><u>told IGN</u></a> last month. “That's what we intend to be, and that's what the game is going to look like for a while.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many admit that there is still much ground to cover before Battlefield 6 stops looking like the grounded military shooter that it currently is and starts introducing some of the more outrageous characters seen in other games. There's also the fact that there are, of course, many other more grounded outfits both in the Battlefield 6 base game and coming in Season 1. As for what we’ve seen from Season 1 so far, though, fans are now more on edge than ever.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Is it realistic?

The game’s fall roadmap was also revealed. <span id="more-999763"></span></p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> first launched for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,657 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,134 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,599 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3159330/Assassins_Creed_Shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/assassins-creed-shadows" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/us/assassins-creed-shadows/660e5a03fbff4e2940488bcd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft Store</a>, Mac via App Store, and <a title="Platforms > Luna [67 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/cloud/luna">Luna</a> on March 20.</p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p><strong>■ Title Update 10</strong> (October 28)</p><p><strong>Parkour Update 2</strong></p><p>Following our first Parkour update, we’ve listened to your feedback and are coming back with a second Parkour Update coming October 28. This update will feature a new toggle option named “Advanced Parkour.” It will remove all parkour barriers, allowing you to do side ejects and back ejects from any height. We also bring some tweaks with side eject on parkour down, giving you more freedom of expression.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The vertical ledge grab in regular parkour will now work in more situations, including non-standing objects, whether or not the advanced parkour toggle is on. From those non-standing objects, we are also introducing a new beam manual jump option. Finally, we are reintroducing a much-requested feature: the directional catch ledge mechanic.</p><p><strong>Corrupted Castles</strong></p><p>October 28 is also when you can expect a new Animus themed activity called Corrupted Castles. Any previously completed castle may get corrupted and filled with Animus anomalies, including Samurai Daisho and their corresponding reward chests. Up to five Corrupted Castles will appear on the map each season, allowing you plenty of opportunities to reengage those castles and higher levels of play for even greater rewards.</p><p><strong>■ Title Update 11</strong> (November 25)</p><p><strong>Free Story drops</strong></p><p>The 3rd story drop is coming your way on November 25th, and it’s called “A Puzzlement”. This quest has a much more humorous, silly tone, much more akin to something like AC Odyssey, in which we are digging up old foes from Naoe’s past who are looking for a bit of redemption. Our two protagonists will learn new skills from each other:</p><ul><li>Naoe will learn how to perform her own spectacular version of Yasuke’s war kick ability.</li><li>Yasuke will learn how to <a title="Genres > Stealth [101 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/stealth">stealth</a>ily dispatch enemies in a non-lethal way.</li></ul><p>As the name suggests, “A Puzzlement”, also introduces a brand new and intricate environmental puzzle that may hold the answers to a bunch of questions that you, the community, have been asking for a while.</p><p>But there is more! We are doubling down on free story drops because our next special collaboration is also dropping on November 25th.</p><p>You can also expect a bunch of freebies around the holiday season.</p><p><strong>■ Switch 2 Version</strong></p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is coming on the Nintendo Switch 2 on December 2. It will have all the recent updates and free content drops, except for the “Claws of Awaji” expansion that will come later in the new year. It will also work with cross-progression to Ubisoft Connect, so you will be able to pick up where you left off. Switch 2 also offers a new way to play with touch screen features in all menus including world map, store, and hideout.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Switch 2 Announce Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="[ESRB] Assassin's Creed Shadows: Nintendo Switch™ 2 Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B011oT5j4iU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2><span><a title="Games > Fall Up [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/fall-up">Fall Up</a>date Roadmap Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="[ESRB] Assassin's Creed Shadows: Fall Roadmap Update" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qf2bP-Ri5mk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/assassins-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2-on-december-2-fall-roadmap-announced]]></content:encoded>

<p>All of those Pokémon sales were bound to go somewhere, and the Switch 2 has done rather well out of it. Nintendo's latest hardware sits comfortably at the top of the hardware chart this week, with an additional 201,684 sales under its belt.</p>
<p>Combining the three Switch 1 SKUs this week give us 23,713 sales, while the PS5 models total in at 12,085.</p>

It's also the location of skip drive manufacturing, allowing Earth Directorate ships to travel across all systems. Of course, there's an issue that brings you here, aside from toppling the regime of the Sovereign, which is to learn why skip drives are creating dangerous space rifts. Promising a more polished experience and defined story,&nbsp;see if it hits the mark in our&nbsp;<em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2d44108b-4675-49c2-9b33-fb5caaa62a59" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/outer-worlds-2-review" rel="nofollow">The Outer Worlds 2</a>&nbsp;</em>review.</p>

<h2>Choices Matter in a Colorful World</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rift-anomaly-outer-worlds-2.jpg?itok=wdqu51no 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rift-anomaly-outer-worlds-2.jpg?itok=2PkkWtal 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The main story is relatively straightforward, with some minor plot twists added in. You have six Companions you can recruit, starting right off the bat with two of them. You can go solo, with a single partner, or bring a max of two people with you when you leave your ship, the Incognito.</p>

<p>There are a variety of areas to explore, but many can feel too hard too quickly if you just follow the main quests. Upgrading your weapons and armor, as well as completing companion quests, are requirements for moving forward without struggling. While this is the case for many RPGs, it feels like side quests are more necessary than optional.</p>

<p>Speaking of side quests, they are the real star of&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>. I don't mean the Companion quests, which can often be resolved with little to no combat. Side quests have you hunting for Manticore pupa, taking out scavengers, finding magazine issues, or finding patent schematics. These involve combat, use a variety of skills, can bring you to new places, or offer a trophy for the Incognito.</p>

<p>While most of the main quests use the same skills or traits, these other missions give you more opportunities to explore what makes your Commander unique, hone in on your individual playstyle, and potentially earn some sweet perks.&nbsp;While all the writing is passable, the side quests are where the different, and often wacky, personalities shine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most interesting aspect of&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>&nbsp;is how your actions, or lack of actions, impact the game. This can be seen quickly, as well as in the long term. Some decisions can cause you to lose companions, be attacked on sight by a whole faction, or destroy a location. These change the general feeling of the game, while the main narrative stays the same. Your interactions with companions and NPCs can take on a completely different tone and direction.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bibliomania-flaw-outer-worlds-2.jpg?itok=Pa5ve57O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bibliomania-flaw-outer-worlds-2.jpg?itok=ciPdEeh- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Large choices obviously have larger consequences, but small actions also have an effect. As you progress through the game, you'll start racking up Flaws. Crouch often? You may have a Flaw discovered that your knees start to crack, reducing your stealth. If you steal frequently, you may end up as a Kleptomaniac, causing you to steal regardless of your current surroundings when you hover over an item. You don't have to accept a Flaw, but they can open new avenues for you to experience the title.</p>

<h2>More of the Same</h2>

<p>Even though there are a number of Flaws that can influence your playthroughs,&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>&nbsp;story focuses on the utilization of very few traits, skills, or perks. When it comes to impact, many of the perks you can select, and about half of the skills, don't seem to really affect the overall gameplay. All you need is Lockpicking, Brawny, Hack, Science, and Leadership (or Speech) to make it through the storyline quickly and easily. By the time that I reached the endgame, it was apparent that you should focus on three or four Skills and ignore the rest to reach the high-level requirements seen in the final missions.</p>

<p>The main way the majority of Traits and Skills are seen is through different dialogue options. Outside of that, interacting with the world, completing quests, or finding unique items, mainly require the same things over and over again. Even talking to people with specialized dialogue can become repetitive.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outer-worlds-2-perks-menu-scrabbles-perk-description.jpg?itok=NcufFWYE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outer-worlds-2-perks-menu-scrabbles-perk-description.jpg?itok=EqIqU-hx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Repetition isn't necessarily bad, especially when dealing with the strict dogma ingrained in the three factions found in <i>The Outer Worlds 2</i>. Getting the extent of brainwashing or cultural control across is one of the themes present. It gets to the point, however, that the game becomes uninteresting. It doesn't necessarily reach the level of boring, but there were quite a few conversations I skipped through because they sounded exactly like the one before it, or my dialogue resulted in the same conclusions.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On top of that, there were a couple of bugs that impacted the game. Loot chests not disappearing off the mini map, bodies dematerializing without creating an ash or goo pile, NPCs or enemies spawning partially in the environment, and game crashes made the experience less than streamlined. Most of the bugs don't greatly impact a playthrough. Other bugs could be occurring that make playing the title difficult, including one experienced by a colleague that pretty much blocks them from using guns at any point in time.</p>

<h2><em>The Outer Worlds 2 Review</em>&nbsp;| Final Thoughts</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/archivist-dialogue-outer-worlds-2.jpg?itok=MAzPIzrT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/archivist-dialogue-outer-worlds-2.jpg?itok=wQGpF294 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>The Outer Worlds 2 </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Compared to other single-player RPG releases this year,&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>&nbsp;just falls flat. While there's nothing intrinsically wrong with the game, there's nothing that makes it stand out against star performers like <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="07f3b1f2-234f-4782-8556-c21c1fb23302" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-french-revolution" rel="nofollow">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>.</em>&nbsp;There wasn't any amazing writing, the focus on different societal structures and themes felt surface-level, and repetitive interactions made the title uninteresting. There was no hook that kept me wanting to play beyond reaching the end of the main story in the hopes that something amazing would wow me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For fans of&nbsp;<em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cd8a1852-2307-4184-b0df-b9afab69154e" href="https://techraptor.net/games/outer-worlds" rel="nofollow">The Outer Worlds</a>,&nbsp;</em>the sequel is more of the same. Newcomers to the franchise can find humor laced throughout the game, unique weapons, and a mostly bug-free experience. Those looking for exquisite writing with a fresh take on RPG mechanics will not find great pleasure in&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>.&nbsp;</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>I have come to the conclusion that it was a mistake to play the demo for cyber <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror game</a> Oneway.exe on my lunch break. I'm not going to tell you what I had for lunch - I think if I describe it in full, I will throw up. But I will say that it featured red peppers and purple onions, and I now wish never to see those colours ever again. 
</p>
<p>Also, it's possible that I'm <em>still</em> playing the demo for Oneway.exe, because the game takes place inside an off-brand mock-up of a desktop operating system. Yes, we are in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everything-is-going-to-be-ok">Everything Is Going To Be OK</a> territory. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hypnospace-outlaw">Hypnospace Outlaw</a>-ville. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pony-island">Pony Island</a>, er, land. But you never saw quite such... sights in either of those games, as far as I can remember. You never saw such reds and purples. You never saw such delightful little piggies. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>There is only one way to tell if I have successful exited Oneway.exe's demo, and that is to drag random images from my screenshots folder into the middle of this screen, and see if they are eaten. Let's try that now. Oh thank god. 
</p>
<p>Now, let me turn around slowly, just in case there is a hideously disfigured catgirl leering behind me. Ah phew, we're in the clear. All I can see is some guy having lunch in the house across the street. Argh, lunch. Let's not dwell upon such matters. Let's talk about the game, I guess, now that I have determined beyond reasonable doubt that I have ceased playing it.

<p>Created by Disordered Media - who wholesomely <a href="https://disorderedmedia.itch.io/">describe themselves</a> as "a husband and wife duo with a small group of friends with the shared passion of creating" - Oneway.exe is about being stuck inside another, abandoned game, Untitled.exe, and trying to work out what happened to its three developers, whose notes litter the desktop, and who are hopefully fictional.</p><p>It combines snatches of first-person exploration and puzzling with a seeping collage of impressively parodied aesthetics from across the history of the internet: gobbets of MySpace, video streams of a Minecraft-like game, discussions of "controversial indie games" on "Glitch", you get the idea. It's both a celebration of digital culture, and a putrid palimpsest of "the worst aspects of internet nostalgia", to cite a trailer blurb. It is windows upon windows upon windows, incoherent and hungry. 
</p>
<p>While firing up the game within the game, you're treated to some urban legends about a woman who had her skin peeled off. Then you're transported to a dark hallway of locked, labelled doors, plus one unlocked "Meaty" door leading to a bedroom. One wall of Meaty's bedroom is covered by what looks like a character editor from a noughties Barbie Flash game, which lets you toggle between dresses, hairdos and accessories in return for cake. The cake is used to feed a happy little mutilated piggy inside a virtual pet game on another wall.</p>
<p>A third wall carries a projection of a blog, where an unknown poster gushes in curly fonts about creativity and dressing up and did you ever think about how a blog is like a body with organs? (&gt;w&lt;) (&gt;w&lt;) The blogger boasts of having a "closet full of handmade dresses". Do not look in the closet. Lot of red and purple in there.

<p>Oneway.exe's body horror metaphors aren't exactly subtle, so far. Often, it just feels like a gleeful B-movie atrocity - squirming, cackling pulp. I doubt it has the wit, eerieness and pathos of Nathalie Lawhead's work. Still, there's a depth to its depthlessness. All the bloody, bony objects you find in Meaty's room are also flat images, invisible from the side. The New Flesh is still figuring out its own contours - there's a sense that all it can be, at the moment, is skin. But perhaps if you keep feeding it cake...
</p><p>The game's first "module" is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2349570/onewayexe_Module_10/">out now on Steam</a>, and it still has a demo as of writing. If you're interested in the demo, I strongly advise you look through the content warnings in the readme file on the game's simulated desktop, before playing Untitled.exe.</p>
<p>I also strongly advise that you consider the Steam reviews before buying, and maybe wait for the first patch - right now, there's talk of a glitch or two that blocks progress early on. As and when these technical problems are addressed, Oneway.exe has the makings of a memorable stomach-churner.

              <p>Recreations of classic maps and modes from other games are nothing new in shooters. Lately, however, publishers have started getting prickly over users remaking maps from their game in someone else’s, and it seems this may be especially true when those games are as competitive with each other as <i>Battlefield</i> and <i>Call of Duty</i>. <i>Battlefield 6 </i>players remaking <i>CoD</i> maps via the game’s new portal mode are finding this out the hard way, with their recreations of modes and maps from Activision’s popular shooter getting taken down over intellectual property violations.</p>

 <p>In an email to <i>Kotaku</i>, <i>Battlefield</i> player and YouTube creator Phiality saw their “<a href="https://youtu.be/7xo_Z9mr3zE">Battlefield Zombies 2028: Osiris</a>” Portal creation struck down, which notably took place after the mode gained some traction on YouTube. On October 23, 2025, EA sent them a copyright takedown notice specifically naming Activision as having filed the complaint. The notice asks them to “permanently delete the experience and create a new one that incorporates only your original work.”</p>

 <p>The use of intellectual property in user-made maps has been a thorny topic in recent years. Though some of us vets may recall the days of <i>Halo 3</i>’s user-made Forge maps that remade popular <i>CoD</i> playspaces surging in popularity without issue, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-uefn-call-of-duty-dmca-creator-copyright-1850299456">youth of today hasn’t had it as easy</a>. <i>Fortnite</i>’s publisher, Epic, has in the past policed the recreation of maps from other intellectual properties in its popular battle royale.</p>

 <p>Still, the targeting of <i>CoD</i> maps and modes in <i>Battlefield</i> feels very specific. As Phiality notes in their statement to <i>Kotaku</i>, other games, including <i>Fortnite</i>, presently have recreations of <i>CoD</i> maps. In a reverse situation, you can even download a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3587806355&amp;searchtext=BF4"><i>Battlefield 4</i> weapon pack for <i>BLOPS 3</i></a> via the Steam Workshop.</p> <p>Phiality isn’t alone in seeing their Portal creations taken down. As reported by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-shuts-down-call-of-duty-inspired-battlefield-6-portal-maps/"><i>Insider Gaming</i></a>, a recreation of the classic <i>CoD</i> map “Shipment,” titled “Shipment first test,” got yanked with a warning that repeat copyright offenses might result in a temporary or permanent ban from not just <i>Battlefield</i>, but potentially all “EA Games &amp; Services.”</p>

<p>The PlayStation 5 surpassed PlayStation 3’s lifetime sales in the US in September 2025. </p>



<p>The PlayStation 5 has been a smash hit for Sony, with the console still accounting for a significant share of hardware sales. This is why the developers keep working on the console and its iterations, releasing slim versions and mid-gen upgrades for the consoles. Thanks to their efforts, the console has now crossed PlayStation 3’s sales record. </p>



<h2 id="h-the-playstation-5-now-sits-above-ps3-and-ps4-in-us-sales">The PlayStation 5 Now Sits Above PS3 and PS4 in US Sales</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poor-old-playstation-3-the-ps5-has-just-overtaken-its-lifetime-sales-in-the-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, the new information about PlayStation 5 beating PS3 comes from a senior director at Circana, Mat Piscatella. Piscatella’s recent post on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m3ry7dpojc2x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BlueSky</a> reveals that, based on US Video Game data through September 2025, the PlayStation 5 has now surpassed the PlayStation 3 in lifetime installed base. The analyst also revealed that PS5 has been ahead of PS4 on a time-aligned basis in the US for a very long time, and as of September, it is ahead by 4.6%. </p>







<h2 id="h-ghost-of-yotei-s-sales-performance-was-basically-flat-to-that-of-ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Yotei’s Sales Performance Was “Basically Flat to that of Ghost of Tsushima”</h2>



<p>Talking about sales, Mat Piscatella also shared some facts about Sony PlayStation’s latest game release, Ghost of Yotei. Piscatella revealed that with just one week in the market, “the US sales performance of Ghost of Yotei was basically flat to that of Ghost of Tsushima. It did great.” </p>



<p>The analyst added that Ghost of Tsushima launched in 2020, when the PS4’s installed base was significantly higher than the PS5’s installed base today. Additionally, there was a lot of stuff happening at the time that “significantly boosted gaming.” So, “anyone with ‘concern’ about this title should be looked at with a side eye,” concluded Piscatella. </p>

Additionally, the PS3 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps3-has-received-a-new-system-software-update-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received a new system software update</a> earlier this year.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-president-says-console-exclusives-are-antiquated/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-president-says-console-exclusives-are-%E2%80%9Cantiquated%E2%80%9D.1332904/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The console wars are quickly becoming a thing of the past—if they’re not dead already. But Xbox’s President coming out and saying that Xbox exclusives, and the idea in general, are becoming antiquated, shows the direction the industry is moving towards.</p>



<p>Xbox’s strategies and ideologies are a shadow of what they were 20, 10, or even five years ago. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-xbox-profit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft</a> was dominating the gaming landscape in the mid-00s to late-00s, and had a myriad of exclusive franchises at its disposal: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-ce-remake-virtuos-studio-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo</a>, Gears of War, Forza, and others. Now, almost all of these have appeared on PlayStation at some point or another, and Sarah Bond thinks this is what people want.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-biggest-games-in-the-world-are-available-everywhere">“The Biggest Games In The World Are Available Everywhere”</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We still can’t get over Gears of War being on PlayStation. Credit to The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p>Now, you could argue that we’ve all wanted to be able to play every game on the same console for decades, as it would save a lot of money. But business is business at the end of the day. With the gaming business, in particular, changing, Xbox President Sarah Bond’s words (via <a href="https://mashable.com/article/interview-president-xbox-sarah-bond-rog-xbox-ally-future-console-exclusives?_gl=1*63mw61*_up*MQ..*_ga*NzIwODYzMTIzLjE3NjEyMjcyNzQ.*_ga_8TEVGCYPY5*czE3NjEyMjcyNzckbzEkZzAkdDE3NjEyMjcyNzckajYwJGwwJGgw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mashable</a>) sound as prophetic as ever:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We’re really seeing people evolve way past that. The biggest games in the world are available everywhere. You look at&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>, you look at&nbsp;Minecraft, you look at&nbsp;Fortnite, you look at&nbsp;Roblox. That’s actually what’s really driving community in gaming. That’s where people gather, and they have experiences. And the idea of locking it to one store or one device is antiquated for most people. You want to be able to play with your friends anywhere, regardless of what they’re on. And we’re really leaning into that with this experience.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This is true and accurate to a certain degree. The lines between PlayStation and Xbox are as blurred as they’ve ever been. On the other hand, we can confidently predict you’ll never see Mario or Zelda anywhere near a PlayStation or Xbox console.</p>



<p>Still, there’s been a definite changing of the guard in recent years, and while Sony can still afford to release exclusives for PS5 users, it’s becoming more clear and obvious that Microsoft and Xbox’s goal posts are moving by the day.</p>



<p>Do you agree with Xbox’s President on exclusives? Is a day coming when there will be no exclusives, maybe apart from on a Nintendo device?

                <p>Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella's total pay package for fiscal 2025 has been confirmed, and the executive earned a total of $96.5 million for the year. That is up 22% from the previous year and represents his highest-ever annual pay. It's a massive multiple over what the median Microsoft worker makes, with the median worker taking home around $200,000.</p><p>The executive's pay details are coming to light as the company faces scrutiny over its recent Xbox decisions, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/" data-ref-id="1100-6535643">layoffs, game cancellations, studio closures, price hikes, and increasing profit-margin mandates.</a> The company as a whole has faced ongoing criticism as well due to its slate of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-microsofts-ceo-told-employees-about-ai-and-future-of-company-after-mass-layoffs/1100-6533420/" data-ref-id="1100-6533420">mass layoffs</a>, partnership with Israel, and investments in AI, among other things.</p><p>Nadella is paid a $2.5 million salary, a figure that's been the same since 2019. The majority of his pay for fiscal 2025 came from stock awards, making up $84.2 million (87%) of his total pay. Microsoft revealed all of this as part of a regulatory filing disclosed this week, as reported by <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadellas-pay-soars-to-almost-100-million-for-2025/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Seattle Times.</a></p><p>Nadella also makes money from an annual cash bonus--for this latest fiscal year, Nadella got paid a bonus of $9.56 million. The bonus he got last year--$5.2 million--was millions less than this year. That's because he requested a lower cash bonus for 2024 due in part to cyberattacks against Microsoft.</p><p>The median pay for a Microsoft employee, excluding Nadella's pay, rose in fiscal 2025 to $200,972, up from $193,744. At the same time, the delta between Nadella's pay and the median Microsoft salary is growing, reaching 480-to-1 for fiscal 2025--that's up from 250-to-1 in 2023.</p><p>The regulatory filing revealing Nadella's latest pay included a memo from Microsoft's board of directors saying the CEO's efforts to <a href="https://x.com/andrewrsorkin/status/1950717933774385623" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">push on artificial intelligence</a> helped Microsoft's fortunes overall in the latest fiscal year. "His leadership team have positioned Microsoft as a clear artificial intelligence leader for this generational technology shift," the board said.</p><p>Microsoft reached a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-reached-4-trillion-valuation-after-mass-layoffs/1100-6533588/" data-ref-id="1100-6533588">$4 trillion market cap this year</a> and the company's stock also reached an all-time high of more than $535 earlier this year. Microsoft is the <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">No. 2 most valuable company in the world right now</a>, only trailing Nvidia.</p><p>Nadella became CEO of Microsoft in 2014, taking over for Steve Ballmer. He is just the third CEO of Microsoft, following Bill Gates and Ballmer. Since Nadella took over as CEO, Microsoft's stock price has risen from about $36 in 2014 to more than $520 today, an increase of more than 1,300%.</p><p>Recently, Microsoft made headlines again over a report that said CFO Amy Hood has implemented a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/" data-ref-id="1100-6535643">new profit-margin mandate for Xbox of 30%, which is well above industry standards.</a> Many have theorized that this reported mandate has contributed to some of the decisions Microsoft has made in recent times, including bringing its first-party games to rival platforms, raising prices on consoles and Game Pass, investing in automation technologies with AI, canceling games, closing studios, and laying off workers.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MTIxNzIzNiwiZXhwIjoxNzYxODIyMDM2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNEtaV0FHUTdMMTAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.bf1wS0et59C0q96ZZnfBqLTX_eTIqjZTmQbk_j6Pwok&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sources told Bloomberg</a> that Microsoft will look to focus on producing titles that are "cheap to make" or more likely to generate revenue as opposed to "riskier bets."</p><p>Microsoft will publish its next earnings report on October 29, at which time the company's financial fortunes for the latest quarter will be revealed.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Nintendo will let Switch 2 owners try out Kirby Air Riders in just a little over two weeks, as long as they're Switch Online subscribers. The upcoming sequel--from Kirby and Super Smash Bros. creator Masahiro Sakurai--will have online demo sessions during two different weekends next month: November 8-9 and 15-16.</p><p dir="ltr">Called the Kirby Air Riders: Global Test Ride, the online demo will offer the Air Ride and City Trial modes. Air Ride is traditional racing and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-is-basically-mario-kart-sakurai-says/1100-6534066/">"basically Mario Kart,"</a> according to Sakurai. There will be three different courses to check out: Floria Fields, Waveflow Waters, and Mount Amberfalls. Meanwhile, City Trial sees players prepping for battle in a hub area in the first phase (gathering power-ups and upgrading your vehicle) and then competing in the second phase.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Kirby Air Riders Is Faster, Deeper, and Cleaner Than The Original</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Nintendo notes that the special demo software for Kirby Air Riders can be downloaded starting November 7. Outside of the online play test times, players can have a go at Lessons in Kirby Air Riders. So basically, practicing at the game is possible before the first play test begins on November 8.</p><p dir="ltr">Another detail highlighted for the online demo by Nintendo relates to eShop preorders for Kirby Air Riders. The company states that digital purchasers of the Switch 2 exclusive will get to wear a special hat for the Global Test Ride, but the cosmetic won't be available in the full game.</p><p dir="ltr">Sakurai presented <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/kirby-air-riders-14-new-things-we-just-learned-about-the-game/2900-7166/">an hourlong Nintendo Direct for Kirby Air Riders</a> earlier today. The developer stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-wont-have-dlc-sakurai-confirms/1100-6535652/">the Switch 2 exclusive won't have DLC</a>, for instance, while also introducing the Road Trip campaign and return of Top Ride. Kirby Air Riders is set to launch November 20.</p><p dir="ltr">The Kirby Air Riders: Global Test Ride times are below:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Nov. 8, 12-6 AM PT / 3-9 AM ET</li><li dir="ltr">Nov. 8, 4-10 PM PT / 7 PM - 1 AM ET</li><li dir="ltr">Nov. 9, 7 AM - 1 PM PT / 10 AM - 4 PM ET</li><li dir="ltr">Nov. 15, 12-6 AM PT / 3-9 AM ET</li><li dir="ltr">Nov. 15, 4-10 PM PT / 7 PM - 1 AM ET</li><li dir="ltr">Nov. 16, 7 AM - 1 PM PT / 10 AM - 4 PM ET</li></ul>

<p>The plan is to automate Krafton's work around Agentic AI and fully implement AI-centered management systems. This should allow its employees to focus on creative activities and complex problems rather than, presumably, being hindered by menial tasks.</p><p>Agentic AI may sound new, but it has been around for a minute. As <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/agentic-ai" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">defined by IBM</a>, it's an artificial intelligence that can accomplish tasks with little to no human intervention or supervision. Think of self-driving cars, autonomous ticketing services, and cybersecurity systems. Agentic AI isn't as ubiquitous as generative AI, but the technology is more widely used than you think.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/pattrick_36/status/1981264568711045159" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Krafton has announced through the today's press release their mid-to-long term plan to turn into a "AI First" company.<br>The "AI First" strategy is set to be centered on Agentic AI - AI that sets goals and plans and works with external tools to execute complex task automation -… <a href="https://t.co/6Q7ejGQehu" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/6Q7ejGQehu</a></p>  — Patryk (@pattrick_36) <a href="https://twitter.com/pattrick_36/status/1981264568711045159?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>What, then, does "AI-first" mean for Kraffton? As Changhan said in the Google Translated press release, this is a strategy meant to prioritize AI as the primary means of solving problems and increasing productivity while "accelerating mid- to long-term corporate value growth."</p><p>In addition to pouring nearly $70 million into AI as the de facto problem-solver for every aspect of the business going forward, Krafton intends to invest 30 billion KRW (or roughly $21 million) annually starting in 2026 to support its employees' use of various AI tools for their work. While that's a future commitment, Krafton intends to fully integrate this "AI-first" strategy this year.</p><p>This hard pivot toward AI comes at a troubling time for the technology sector. A smattering of companies and developers--like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wants-devs-to-view-ai-as-thought-partners-report/1100-6535589/" data-ref-id="1100-6535589">EA</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">Hideo Kojima</a>--are embracing AI, while spending on the technology is expected to hit $375 billion this year and forecasted to reach $500 billion in 2026. Some analysts believe <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/21/are-we-in-an-ai-bubble.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the AI bubble is about the burst</a>, but none of that seems to be stopping megacorporations from opening their coffers wide.</p>

Today GDC, which is owned by Game Developer parent company Informa, unveiled the new "reimagined" conference known as "GDC Festival of Gaming," bringing with it a shift in event structure designed to "meet today's broader, interconnected games industry."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A major component of this transformation is a simplified pass structure that offers equal access to sessions and networking events to all attendees. The new event pass starts at $649, though indies, start-ups, and academics can apply for discounts that lower the price by another $200-$300.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this new form, the event aims to serve game makers "across every stage of a game's life cycle," and debuts with a particular focus on providing game industry professionals with new networking opportunities, redesigned conference content, improved pass pricing, and more.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Conference organizers state that these changes are "informed and inspired by feedback from the community." In a statement, GDC executive director of innovation and growth Mark DeLoura commented that this transformation is taking place during "a time of great change" in the video game industry.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/remedy-ceo-tero-virtala-steps-down-with-immediate-effect" target="_self" data-discover="true">Remedy CEO Tero Virtala steps down with immediate effect</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We can build walls or build bridges—and the game industry has always thrived by coming together," says DeLoura.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="An &quot;All Access&quot; GDC now costs 45 percent less">An "All Access" GDC now costs 45 percent less</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As mentioned above, the event's new "Festival Pass" replaces the All-Access pass from prior years and costs 45 percent less than its predecessor, starting as low as $649 and granting access to the entirety of the event's main content programming.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This means that all attendees with a Festival Pass in hand will have equal access to the GDC expo hall (now named "Festival Hall") and content programming throughout the week, a departure from previous GDC events where access to main conference content was segmented by pass type, track, or day of the week.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to the announcement, GDC also plans to offer support to early-stage indies, start-ups, and members of the academic community through programs that further reduce the Festival Pass pricetag by $200-$300.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The new Festival Pass is one of only three overall pass types unveiled by GDC today. One, a new "Digital Pass", allows developers not making the trek to San Francisco to access online-only networking during GDC and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="http://gdcvault.com/">GDC Vault</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> content for $799.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The other new pass type, the "Game Changer Pass", starts at $1,699 and brings all that the Festival Pass has to offer in addition access to all new show features and more. Those include the "GamePlan" facilitated meetings program, an invite-only arrangement promising pre-scheduled meetings with key industry stakeholders, and the all new "Luminaries Speaker Series", an executive-level content program held at the Blue Shield of California Theater at YBCA near the Moscone Center.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-massive-initiates-voluntary-buyouts" target="_self" data-discover="true">Ubisoft Massive initiates voluntary buyouts</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Meeting &quot;today's broader, interconnected&quot; industry">Meeting "today's broader, interconnected" industry</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Going beyond just pricing, today's Festival of Gaming announcement gives developers a closer look at what to expect from an overhauled event.

This "Unified Content Program" spans all five days of GDC and is available to any attendee with a Festival Pass. Event staples like postmortems and technical sessions are now joined by "interactive content" that aims to bridge the gap between industry disciplines.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/outerloop-games-lays-off-multiple-employees" target="_self" data-discover="true">Outerloop Games lays off multiple employees</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A similar spirit fuels the return of GDC Nights and the redesigned Expo Hall, now known as the "Festival Hall."

He joined in 2018, and after a two-year stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Razer is launching the Raiju V3 Pro, a $219.99 wireless controller made for the PlayStation 5 and PC. It’s an alternative to Sony’s $199.99 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23564531/sony-dualsense-edge-wireless-controller-ps5-features-review">DualSense Edge</a>, which it shares many traits in common with, like adjustable trigger pull distances, swappable rear paddles, extra stick nubs, and a hard carrying case. Plus, it comes with a 2-meter-long USB-C cable that lodges snugly into its charging port to make it better suited for unpredictable tournament play.</p><p>The Raiju V3 Pro seems about as good as a third-party PS5 wireless controller can be, despite a few omissions. It lacks adaptive triggers and rumble. Also, Sony doesn’t allow Razer access to the DualSense Edge’s suite of software customization features on PS5, and it connects via a 2.4GHz USB-A dongle instead of pairing directly to the console.</p><p>However, the Raiju V3 Pro is the superior controller by one very important criterion (and a few others below, depending on taste): TMR joysticks. They are resistant to developing stick drift, and they draw less power from the battery when in use. By comparison, Sony’s high-end controller uses ALPS stick modules that are $20 each to replace when they inevitably suffer from drift after extended use. Add in the cost of two stick replacements, and the DualSense Edge costs more than Razer’s new controller.</p><p>The Raiju V3 Pro’s other design elements don’t necessarily make it a better choice over Sony’s, but they might tip the scale in Razer’s favor for you. Its bulky grips fill my hands better than the DualSense. I also like its eight-way directional pad that makes executing combos easier than with the four-way one on Sony’s gamepad. Its mecha-tactile face buttons are made from PBT, a material used in high-end keyboard keycaps, and I like the bouncy, clicky feel of the button switches. Razer’s tinker-friendly approach to its rear paddles is novel; if you don’t want to use the four rear customizable buttons, they can be swapped with a cap that almost seamlessly fills the gap.</p><p>There aren’t nearly as many high-end wireless controllers for the PS5 as there are for the Xbox, so Razer’s Raiju V3 Pro is a welcome competitor. You’ll be able to buy it… sometime. Razer spokesperson Janine Warner told <em>The Verge</em> a day before this story went live that the release is on hold, and that it isn’t available to purchase in the US, pending regulatory clearance. Razer didn’t respond to a question about what clearance it was awaiting.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/804365/razer-raiju-v3-pro-ps5-dualsense-edge-features-price]]></content:encoded>

By comparison, <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/93375/xbox-profits-revealed-in-new-ftc-leak/index.html">leaked documents</a> show that Xbox hit a 12 percent margin for the first nine months of the 2022 fiscal year, prior to these latest targets.</p><p>Cost-cutting is always a fairly obvious motivation for slashing jobs and raising the price of products or services, but Microsoft’s lofty profit targets would explain why its gaming division has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/697125/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-2025">been so extensively gutted</a>. During an investor call in July, Hood said that the Xbox division’s operating income had increased by 34 percent in its <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q4/press-release-webcast">most recent quarter</a> due to “continued prioritization of higher margin opportunities.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTU="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/805280/microsoft-xbox-gaming-profit-targets-layoffs]]></content:encoded>
