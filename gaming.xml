Additionally, an exclusive from <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-milo-ventimiglia-kiernan-shipka-1236422511/" rel="nofollow ">Variety</a> has revealed two more major cast members who will star in the upcoming Black Ops game.</p><p dir="ltr">Developed by Treyarch and Raven Software, Black Ops 7 is set in the year 2035, which is more than four decades after the events of Black Ops 6. Originally introduced in Black Ops 2, David Mason returns in Black Ops 7 to lead a team against "a manipulative enemy who weaponizes fear above all else." David will look a bit different to fans, as he is now more recognizable as his new voice and motion-capture actor, Milo Ventimiglia, who is known for his roles in This Is Us and Gilmore Girls.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Activision marketing chief Tyler Bahl described the casting of Ventimiglia to Variety as being as the right fit for "an iconic character from the franchise and one of the fan favorites" from Black Ops 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Variety also revealed Kiernan Shipka and Michael Rooker have also been cast. Kiernan Shipka, who is most notable from Mad Men, plays the character Emma Kagan, and she seems to be a newcomer to the Call of Duty universe. Michael Rooker of Guardians of the Galaxy fame will be reprising his role as Mike Harper from Black Ops 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Yesterday's announcement trailer was just the beginning of what will be a huge marketing campaign for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. We'll likely get more cast announcements or details in the coming weeks. Activision also didn't reveal a release date but confirmed the game is coming this year to Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, and PC (via the Xbox PC app, Steam, and Battle.net). While not yet confirmed, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-is-still-coming-to-switch-apparently/1100-6532276/">Black Ops 7 is likely coming to Switch 2</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/possible-new-call-of-duty-warzone-map-teased-in-black-ops-7-trailer/1100-6532265/">Black Ops 7 cinematic reveal trailer</a> already has fans speculating about the next potential battle royale map for Warzone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/konami-announces-press-start-event-for-june-12-with-mgs-delta-silent-hill-f-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Japanese game developer and publisher KONAMI announced an upcoming event titled 'Press Start' that will take place on June 12 at 6:00 AM Pacific Time / 9:00 AM Eastern Time / 3:00 PM Central European Time. The live stream will be watchable via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXaDgU72gRI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a>, <a href="http://twitch.tv/KONAMI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a>, and <a href="http://facebook.com/konami/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook</a>.&nbsp;KONAMI already said that it will last around 37 minutes. Subtitles will be available in 13 languages.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, the studio confirmed that Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater and Silent Hill f will be prominently featured in the broadcast. Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is the remake of 2004's Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater. Developed in Unreal Engine 5 with the help of Virtuos, the game features modern controls (with the option to stick to legacy controls) and an upgraded battle damage system that reflects the wear and tear to Snake's clothes and the bruises and bullet wounds on his body in real time. These injuries will leave permanent marks on Snake's body, telling the story of each player's unique journey through the game. The game's official PC system requirements are available <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-gets-pc-requirements-and-new-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>; Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on August 28.</p>
<p>Silent Hill f is a new entry in KONAMI's prized horror franchise. It's being developed by NeoBards Entertainment, a Hong Kong team that previously worked on games like Resident Evil: Resistance, Resident Evil Re:Verse, Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Marvel's Avengers, and Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. During last week's State of Play, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-launches-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-september-2025-new-gameplay-showcased/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that the game, set in a secluded town in 1960s Japan, will be released on September 25 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<p>But that's not all we're getting in the Press Start event, as KONAMI teased that 'more' will be shown. Of course, whether that's something significant or perhaps just an update for eFootball remains to be seen.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/discussing-magic-the-gathering-x-final-fantasy-with-daniel-holt-design-lead-for-commander-decks.1213263/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/discussing-magic-gathering-x-final-fantasy-with-daniel-holt-game-design-lead-for<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <em>Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy</em> set is now available in pre-release with the full release only days away. As someone hooked into both the <em>MTG</em> and <em>FF</em> spaces, it's been incredible seeing the reaction, on par with the release of a <em>Final Fantasy</em> game. At Summer Game Fest, I got to sit down with Daniel Holt, Senior Game Designer for <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> and the lead designer behind the pre-con Commander decks featuring Terra, Cloud, Tidus, and Y'shtola.</p>

<h2>But First, A Duel</h2>

<p>Prior to sitting down to discuss the collaboration, Holt and I engaged in a quick game of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> using the Cloud and Sephiroth decks that come in the starter set. Cloud's deck features equipment cards lending to the JRPG root,s while Sephiroth's deck is built around tokens and powering up Sephiroth, Planet's Heir.</p>

<p>Being my first time really getting hands-on with these cards, I was continuously distracted while playing, spotting favorite characters, locations, and events from the history of <em>FF</em>. I couldn't help but comment in excitement seeing the Sunstones of the Giza Plains from <em>Final Fantasy XII</em> glowing on the Plains card.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-x-final-fantasy-starter-deck.jpg?itok=Pl6q5a71 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-x-final-fantasy-starter-deck.jpg?itok=MRbiUFFP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>After competently defeating him (absolute blind luck top-decking a card that let me create a 13/13 monstrosity with Haste and Trample, there was no skill on my part whatsoever) we moved over to an interview space to continue talking.</p>

<h2>Picking And Choosing Moments</h2>

<p>Knowing how much history there was to <em>Final Fantasy</em>, I first wanted to understand how, even in a large set such as this, they were able to pick and choose the different characters and moments to highlight.</p>

<p>Holt told me that Gavin Berry, who led the main set, developed a tiered system. "Tier One was made up of the character and story moments that every character knows; Sephiroth and Cloud, etc. Tier Two is like, if you played the game, you'd probably know. Tier Three is those deeper facts, like this is probably your favorite game."</p>

<p>On the topic of favorite games, Holt revealed that his favorite numbered <em>Final Fantasy</em> title was <em>Final Fantasy X</em>, which is why he was even more excited that he got to create a Tidus and <em>Final Fantasy X</em> themed pre-con.</p>

<p>I quickly paused to ask him whether he pronounces it Tidus (Tee-dus) or Tidus (Tie-dus), and he very quickly and confidently said the correct answer, Tidus (Tee-dus).</p>

<p>At the interview space, Holt directed me to editions of each of the Commander Pre-Con decks, explaining that each of these Pre-Con decks doesn't just feature a hero, but is completely themed after the game that they're from.</p>

<p>"When you buy the <em>Final Fantasy X</em> deck, every card in here is <em>Final Fantasy X</em>, except the lands. So we had 63-ish cards to all be from <em>Final Fantasy X</em>. So we got to go in those deep moments."</p>

<p>"One of my favorites from this one is the reprint Endless Detour. We've got to show Riku where she's scared of lightning. She's with the whole party inside the hotel, and she doesn't want to go back out."</p>

<p>I asked if there were any moments that a fan of <em>FFX</em> like himself put his foot down to say they needed to be included, and Holt revealed a bit of the behind-the-scenes for Commander deck creation. "The way we approached all these decks is that I had an Excel sheet where I looked at the reprint I'm considering, and a possible story moment."</p>

<p>He talked about the discussion he had with Dylan Davini, the head of creative for the set, "I'll ping him and ask 'hey, can we do this?' and [Davini] will say 'yeah, that's fine' and for every card we have one sentence what it could be. I had this sheet already filled out for <em>Final Fantasy X</em> before coming to Davini. He looked at it and said 'This pretty much works' and we were already kind of done."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Every character is somebody's favorite Character"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While <em>Final Fantasy X</em> had a lot of easy moments to pull from the Commander deck, <em>Final Fantasy VI</em> was more difficult. "VI was the last of the pixel games, so some of our references weren't great for capturing the game. Some of the items in the game are just a sphere, it's not enough for a reference."</p>

<p>Holt talked about having to drop certain ideas when there just wasn't any possible option, and seek out a different reference for those cards.</p>

<p>Holt did speak very highly of the team at Square Enix that they worked with while putting this set together. He talked of the benefit of so many on the <em>MTG </em>team being fans of Square Enix and <em>Final Fantasy</em>, and likewise, a lot of those at Square Enix were fans of <em>MTG</em>.</p>

<p>If they reached out to Square Enix and there wasn't a great reference to be use,d the team would be very helpful and provide alternate references.</p>

On top of that, Sagas have been altered to provide a basis for Summons. Powerful while on the field, but only temporary.</p>

<h2>Turning Gameplay Mechanics Into Card Mechanics</h2>

<p>Explaining more about how they adapted game systems to <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Holt again referenced the <em>Final Fantasy X</em> deck. "Tidus has a Cheer ability and he moves counters around. Just like you are on the sphere grid."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We've got some fan favorite moments like the Cloud in a dress scene, the train suplex, and the laughing scene from <em>Final Fantasy X</em>"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Knowing that there's so much excitement around the <em>Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy</em> Cards I wondered how he and the team were reacting to it.</p>

<p>"It's still amazing. Even now that it's out like, I hear somebody say Sephiroth over in the corner and I'm like 'do people know about Sephiroth already?' because we've been working on this for four to five years. [...] Everyone on the team understands these games, loves them so it was a true passion project."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/neverwinter-nights-2-enhanced-edition-announced<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Aspyr has revealed&nbsp;<em>Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition</em>, a remastered version of the 2006 CRPG classic that comes with all-new enhancements and improvements, as well as all of the game's expansions.</p>

<p>Revealed during yesterday's PC Gaming Show (along with the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paralives-december-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow"><em>Paralives&nbsp;</em>release date</a> and more),&nbsp;<em>Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition&nbsp;</em>promises to do for the nearly twenty-year-old RPG what the enhanced editions of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate&nbsp;</em>and its sequel did for their respective originals.</p>

<p>According to the game's brand new Steam page, <i>Neverwinter Nights 2</i>'s new enhanced re-release will feature "smoother gameplay", as well as "refined camera controls, polished mechanics, enhanced textures, and full controller support", together with a brand new "controller-specific UI".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/neverwinter-nights-2-enhanced-edition-combat.jpg?itok=n4aHR9dl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/neverwinter-nights-2-enhanced-edition-combat.jpg?itok=1Q2nZbzZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Neverwinter Nights 2&nbsp;</em>is coming back, in enhanced form.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the fact this is an enhanced re-release of a classic CRPG, usual suspect Beamdog is nowhere to be seen in the credits for the game. The studio was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/beamdog-acquired-by-porting-and-remake-specialists-aspyr" rel="nofollow">acquired by Aspyr back in 2022</a>, but it still remains a distinct entity and hasn't been renamed, so it looks like Aspyr is the one handling this remaster.</p>

<p>Other than the aforementioned improvements, it looks as though&nbsp;<em>Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition&nbsp;</em>will largely be the same game you may or may not already be familiar with; there's no mention of restoring cut content.</p>

<p>What that means is the package will contain the base&nbsp;<em>Neverwinter Nights 2&nbsp;</em>game, plus its three major expansions:&nbsp;<em>Mask of the Betrayer</em>,&nbsp;<em>Storm of Zehir</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Mysteries of Westgate</em>.</p>




<p>It's all go in the world of&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>video games right now. As well as this remaster, it was revealed last week that&nbsp;<em>Star Wars Jedi&nbsp;</em>director Stig Asmussen's new studio Giant Skull is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/giant-skull-wizards-of-the-coast-dungeons-and-dragons" rel="nofollow">working on a&nbsp;<em>D&amp;D&nbsp;</em>game</a> alongside Wizards of the Coast.</p>

<p>That's in addition to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-dnd-game-2026" rel="nofollow">live-service multiplayer title</a> currently in development at Starbreeze Studios, about which we admittedly know very little at present. Hopefully, Starbreeze's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starbreeze-financials-2024-payday-3" rel="nofollow">current difficulties</a> don't impact the development of that project too much.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition&nbsp;</em>launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2738630/Dungeons__Dragons_Neverwinter_Nights_2_Enhanced_Edition/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1032-PPSA20783_00-NWN2ENHANCED0000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/dungeons-dragons-neverwinter-nights-2-enhanced-edition/9NS7KLP387H6" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dungeons-and-dragons-neverwinter-nights-2-enhanced-edition-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> (and not Switch 2, oddly enough) on July 15th.</p>

<p>It also includes three story expansions. If that's simply not enough <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neverwinter-nights">Neverwinter Nights</a> for you, there's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2738630/Dungeons__Dragons_Neverwinter_Nights_2_Enhanced_Edition/">bundle on Steam currently</a> where you can buy both this and the original NN - also in Enhanced Edition form - for 10% off. This would require pre-ordering, however. It's like I always say: if someone has to bribe you into doing something, it's surely a brilliant idea. Here's Steam on the matter of the affairs of the particulars of the videogame at hand:</p>
<blockquote><p>Return to the city of Neverwinter in Dungeons &amp; Dragons Neverwinter Nights 2: Enhanced Edition. A dark force sweeps over Faerûn, ravaging everything in its path as though searching for something – something that you now find in your possession. As the Shard-Bearer, only you can stop the King of Shadows and his army from desecrating the land you call home. Will you save Faerûn, or fall victim to the temptation of absolute power? When your actions dictate the fate of the Realms, there are no small choices.</p></blockquote>
<p>I bet there are <em>some</em> small choices, really. That's just good writing. How do you make the big choices seem big otherwise? Please, consider your hyperbole for one second, advertising blurb.</p>
<p>The previous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neverwinter-nights-enhanced-edition">Neverwinter Nights: Enhanced Edition</a> was handled by Beamdog. They've since been gobbled up by Aspyr, themselves a gobbling appendage of chief gobblers Embracer, and it's Aspyr on both enhancing and publishing duties this time around. Being long in the tooth by now, the Neverwinter Nights games have built up a decent modding community over the years, and the minimal amount of research I've done suggests that mods for the original NN worked fine with the 2018 EE. Assuming that's the case for this new one, it means you'll be able do things like play the entire <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/neverwinter2/mods/794">Baldur's Gate 1 campaign inside of it</a>.</p>
<p>Here's John's (RPS in peace) diary series <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-bastard-in-neverwinter-part-one-bastardly-beginnings">A Bastard In Neverwinter</a> if you're curious to learn how Neverwinter Nights 2 reacts to proto-Dark Urge shenanigans, and also just find the word 'bastard' inherently funny enough to force at least once into most articles you write, like some sort of marauding crambastard.</p></div>

                <p>Activision says it's changing things up this year with respect to how it markets and promotes the year's new Call of Duty game, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>.</p><p>Activision marketing chief Tyler Bahl told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-milo-ventimiglia-kiernan-shipka-1236422511/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> that by early June, Activision normally would have already "teased everything that's coming out" for a new Call of Duty game. But with Black Ops 7, Activision is intentionally holding back information to create a Beyonce-like effect, he said, referencing the singer Beyonce's surprise-release of her self-titled album in 2013.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Official Cinematic Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>"I think in a lot of ways we're setting this up more like a Beyonce album dropping; nobody's going to know about it, or nobody's going to see it coming," Bahl said.</p><p>Of course, Bahl is exaggerating here. Millions of people already know about Black Ops 7 and are awaiting its release later this year. A Call of Duty game coming to market annually is one of the safest bets a person could make in gaming. Since 2004, Activision has released a new Call of Duty game every year.</p><p>Whatever the case, Bahl said the aim with Black Ops 7's marketing was to "really do something different, and for us to zag and show up in a unique way."</p><p>"One way of doing that is almost not doing any pre-promotion and giving it to players in a really unexpected way," Bahl said.</p><p>The Black Ops 7 announcement trailer capped off Microsoft's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a> on June 8. The game is set in the year 2035 and aims to be the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-announced-marks-first-back-to-back-black-ops-release-eve/1100-6532238/" data-ref-id="1100-6532238">"most mind-bending" Black Ops game yet</a>. Black Ops 7 is also notable because this is the first time Activision is releasing Black Ops games in back-to-back years.</p><p>The Black Ops 7 trailer concluded with a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/possible-new-call-of-duty-warzone-map-teased-in-black-ops-7-trailer/1100-6532265/" data-ref-id="1100-6532265">possible tease for a new Warzone map</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/absolum-preview-very-promising-beat-em-up<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some of my fondest gaming memories involve playing beat 'em ups with my brothers. <i>Castle Crashers&nbsp;</i>comes to mind, in particular, a game I could play over and over again.&nbsp;<em>Absolum&nbsp;</em>feels the same way; it's the type of game that encourages repeat playthroughs with your best buds.</p>

<p>Really,&nbsp;<em>Absolum&nbsp;</em>ticks all the right boxes for me. A compelling fantasy universe with fleshed out lore, weighty beat 'em up gameplay, and a killer soundtrack to boot. My time with&nbsp;<em>Absolum</em>&nbsp;at Summer Game Fest 2025 left me very eager to try more.</p>



<h2>Fantastic(al) Fights Await&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The art style for&nbsp;<em>Absolum</em>&nbsp;really draws you in. It's this comic book-like aesthetic in this whimsical, high fantasy universe. It's a world where mages are feared for their use of magic. Non-magic users are scared of them, and monsters want to kill the wizards too.</p>

<p>Most of the demo comprised gameplay rather than story, but I'm very interested in seeing the narrative unfold. It actually reminds me a bit of&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>, with crucial NPCs in your hub with their own stories and motivations.</p>

<p>But the&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>&nbsp;similarities don't end there. The roguelite elements seem to take inspiration from that title. Gameplay involves progressing to new areas, while collecting boons every few rooms or so.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These boons empower your wizard's attacks. These upgrades are usually elemental in nature, so your special attack might shoot tidal waves when you activate it.</p>

<p>You're able to choose from several characters in&nbsp;<em>Absolum;&nbsp;</em>for example, one is a dwarf, and another an elf, so on and so forth. They're all visually distinct from one another and have different styles of attacking.</p>



<h2>Fighting to the End</h2>

<p>The core of&nbsp;<em>Absolum</em>'s gameplay, outside of its roguelite mechanics, is the beat 'em up combat. These aren't your ordinary wizards. The dwarf mainly uses his magically powered fists. His punches are powerful, and each hit is accompanied by a satisfying sound.</p>

<p><em>Absolum</em>&nbsp;has branching paths for each run, so my partner and I took a northern route along the coast. We're met with dog-like creatures and hermit crabs that hide in their shells. We made short work of them, and went on our way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Eventually we reached a village under attack by goblins. Now, you'd think the villagers would accept our aid, but in fact, they started to attack us! Surrounded on both sides, we fought through goblin and human foes. Just another example of&nbsp;<em>Absolum</em>'s very intriguing narrative.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><i>Absolum&nbsp;</i>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Eventually we reached a boss at the end of the demo. It's your typical tanky boss that takes a lot of hits, so my partner and I dodged and weaved around him. This boss had a giant shield, so we'd go on either side of him and harass the guy until he lowered his guard.</p>

<p><em>Absolum</em>&nbsp;is genuinely a lot of fun, and words don't do it justice. It oozes quality, from its art design and soundtrack, to its gameplay. The rougelite elements really make me want to try and try again even in the face of failure. Although there's no release date yet, I shall eagerly wait.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/relooted-is-unique-heist-game-for-2d-platforming-speedrun-fans<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's always fun to come across games that are truly unique, and I got to experience one of them at Summer Game Fest this week. <em>Relooted</em>, by Nyamakop, is a unique game where you play as Nomali, a woman dragged into working to reclaim <s>stolen</s> obtained artifacts from collectors or museums across the world.</p>

<p>The premise of the game is that due to the wording of a new law, any ancient artifacts that were on public display at museums would need to be returned to their country of origin. The loophole in this that these locations found though, was that if an item was only shown in private, then the artifacts no longer needed to be returned.</p>

<h2>Accessory To A Heist</h2>

<p>With knowledge of these artifacts, Nomali and her team, consisting of a group of people skilled in acrobatics and hacking, and more as the game progresses. With this team it is your goal to get into these locations, scope out the most ideal way to 'reloot' these items with intent to return them to their homes, and then get out as quickly as possible.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/relooted-on-the-ground.jpg?itok=eGARCR8V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/relooted-on-the-ground.jpg?itok=50JNoa4w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The gameplay loop is that you'll start your mission outside, scope out the locations of the different artifacts within the building, and then plan the heist to recover as many items as possible. The game takes place from a sidescrolling view, you'll run left to right through each location but you'll also need to find ways to climb up to higher levels or return to the ground floor to obtain all of your items.</p>

<p>In the first level that I got to play, a private collector had two primary artifacts to collect, and a further two (one of which I missed, hidden in a safe). Reviewing the world was like looking at an equation where you have all of the pieces and you needed to get as close to the final answer as possible in order to succeed.</p>

<p>You could pre-emptively place your hackers by door, move desks into security doorways to keep them open, and have your acrobat in strategic places to get you to upper floors with ease. Once everything is in place it’s time to snag the first artifact, that kicks off the alarm, and starts the timer for you to get everything and get out.</p>

<p>From there the game is a mix of platforming and speedrunning and you maintain your line, pick up all of the artifacts and getting out. As you begin to get low on your escape timer a drone enemy will appear, with nothing to do to defend yourself you’ll have to just keep heading towards the exit.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/relooted-heist-setup.jpg?itok=lqcR9cn9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/relooted-heist-setup.jpg?itok=guS08brl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Inspiration For <em>Relooted</em></h2>

<p>Speaking with Ben Myres, CEO at Nyamakop and Creative Director for <em>Relooted </em>he told me that the inspiration behind the game came from a trip that he took to London with his family. While he spent time meeting people in gamedev, his parents went to the British Museum. Once the family got back together he learned of how enraged his family had been about the entire front of a building that had been taken from somewhere in the world and placed in the museum.</p>

<p>From there it was suggested to make a game about returning these items that have been taken or ‘looted’ and while you can’t get away from a museum with a whole wall research was done into different artifacts that could be reclaimed.</p>

<p>Myres told me another story of the Ngadji Drum, important to the Pokomo people in Kenya. This sacred relic was thought to have been destroyed over 100 years ago turned up in the storage of the British Museum too.</p>

<p>Stepping away from the gam,e I was excited to have gotten my hands on such a unique game that consists of puzzle solving and speedrunning-like gameplay with such a unique story to tell.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/atomfall-wicked-isle-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Atomfall</em>&nbsp;let you explore a small slice of alternate history Britain in the late 1950s, and the new&nbsp;<em>Wicked Isle</em>&nbsp;DLC introduces a brand-new zone for you to trudge through. In our&nbsp;<em>Atomfall Wicked Isle</em>&nbsp;review, we'll break down what's good about this new story DLC — and what isn't.</p>

<p>Previously,&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e4b71db8-6fe2-4eba-a250-84f5aee68760" href="https://techraptor.net/games/atomfall" rel="nofollow"><em>Atomfall</em></a>&nbsp;confined you to a walled-off "Quarantine Zone" with four distinct regions and a bunker called "The Interchange" that allowed you to travel between them fairly easily. This DLC introduces Midsummer Isle, a small island that is packed with a lot of history, some new sights to see, and a few too many familiar enemies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atomfall-wicked-isle-review-speaking-with-bill-anderson-in-his-cellar-hideout-on-midsummer-isle-in-atomfall.jpg?itok=bfRyqSFV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atomfall-wicked-isle-review-speaking-with-bill-anderson-in-his-cellar-hideout-on-midsummer-isle-in-atomfall.jpg?itok=WsDVasv4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bill Anderson is a boatman who takes you to Midsummer Isle, but he doesn't stick around for very long, sadly.</figcaption></figure><h2>Sailing to a New Zone</h2>

<p>Players can make their way to Midsummer Isle by way of Bill Anderson, a boat captain hanging out on the docks of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="31cd99b9-3546-4649-9d23-bc8c26a689f1" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/atomfall-wyndham-village-map-and-locations" rel="nofollow">Wyndham Village</a>. Bill wants your help in retrieving something important, and it's later revealed to be a special kind of mead only made on the island. What starts out as the world's strangest beer run soon evolves into a compelling story.</p>

<p>Midsummer Isle is roughly the size of the other zones in&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>, and it's about as dense as you'd expect it to be. There are a few points of interest to see on <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="316a5a7c-d4dd-4be9-9961-4a2a7cd46e7c" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/atomfall-midsummer-isle-map-and-locations-guide" rel="nofollow">the map</a>, a couple of merchants, and an abandoned B.A.R.D. bunker for you to explore. There's even a new set of garden gnomes for you to smash for an achievement!</p>

<p>There are plenty of interesting overworld locations to visit and several indoor locations with a lot to explore, two of which — the Chemical Testing Bunker and the Abbey Crypt — have mildly interesting puzzles for you to work out.</p>

<p>While there is some novelty to be had in these new places, there's nothing particularly exciting about them. I kept waiting for the&nbsp;<em>Wicked Isle</em>&nbsp;DLC to surprise me with some new mechanic or an interesting story twist and it never quite delivered.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/atomfall-wicked-isle-review-trading-with-the-merchant-jenny-goggins-on-midsummer-isle-in-atomfall.jpg?itok=XwoFtOjs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/atomfall-wicked-isle-review-trading-with-the-merchant-jenny-goggins-on-midsummer-isle-in-atomfall.jpg?itok=yF1O7SOx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The lack of buyable ammo in useful quantities continues to be a problem on Midsummer Isle.</figcaption></figure><h2>Supply Shortages</h2>

<p>I was fortunate enough to be able to jump right into the&nbsp;<em>Atomfall Wicked Isle</em>&nbsp;DLC via one of my old saves, so I had the advantage of having a healthy supply of ammo and all of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="31c385f2-951f-4d8a-b398-b10ec49aaf22" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/atomfall-weapons-guide-how-to-upgrade-guns" rel="nofollow">the best guns</a> that could be found in the base game. Unfortunately, some of the same problems I dealt with in the main game continued to rear their ugly heads in this DLC.</p>

<p>The storage space in the Pneumatic Tube remains at a paltry 100 items which was a disappointment, to say the least — especially since the&nbsp;<em>Wicked Isle</em>&nbsp;DLC introduces a bunch of new items you might want to hold onto just in case. I would have liked to see at least a small expansion in storage capacity for the hoarder types like myself out there.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It's all too easy to burn through most of your bullets exploring one of the tougher locations on the map.</p>

<p>A relatively low amount of storage space is really a symptom of another problem: the merchants rarely carry enough of the items you might need. If you want to stock up on any one particular item, you'll have to spend an hour or more running around the various regions of the map, hoping against hope that you can find everything you need.</p>

<p>Sadly, the new merchants also fail to carry much in the way of ammunition. It's all too easy to burn through most of your bullets exploring one of the tougher locations on the map, like the Harvesting Caves or the <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="695edafc-20b3-44a7-a100-e925fc5cda71" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/atomfall-chemical-testing-bunker-solution-open-vault" rel="nofollow">Chemical Testing Bunker</a>, and then you'll have to spend another hour running all over the map to buy more for your next serious fight.</p>

<p>Story DLCs will often introduce something new, and the&nbsp;<em>Wicked Isle</em>&nbsp;DLC delivers just that with a few new crafting items, a handful of new consumables, and half a dozen new weapons for you to get your hands on. Unfortunately, all of this new stuff boils down to being more of the same kind of content you'd experience in the main game.</p>

<p>Let's start with the enemies. There are three basic types of foes to fight: Abbey Druids, Lake Bandits, and Aquatic Ferals. These enemies are all essentially palette swaps of the standard enemy archetypes you'll encounter in the base game, sans the Protocol soldiers. There are no new mechanics or tactics used by the bad guys.</p>

<p>The fight against the Beekeeper miniboss was truly a new experience that required a different kind of strategy to win.</p>

<p>The new DLC weapons don't have anything particularly special about them, either. You can get three kinds of knives, a slightly better bow that is a true upgrade to the standard bow, a massive club with a poison effect, and a Blunderbuss, which can't be upgraded. All of these weapons (save for the Midsummer Bow) are sidegrades at best.</p>

<p>That's not to say it was all samey; the Beekeeper miniboss fight was truly a new experience that required a different kind of strategy to win. I also enjoyed learning about the island's monks through the visions brought on by drinking the Angel's Essence; it added to the feeling that you were tapping into the collective consciousness of the "Angel."</p>

<p>By and large, the&nbsp;<em>Atomfall Wicked Isle</em>&nbsp;DLC is more of the same. It doesn't introduce any new mechanics of any consequence, nor does it introduce any shocking story hooks. It is simply a new zone with some new characters and a lot of the same great&nbsp;<em>Atomfall</em>&nbsp;gameplay that you've experienced in the base game.</p>

<p>The worst part of this DLC, though, was the moments that felt like padding. One set of Leads requires you to run to the far edges of three of the mainland's regions to retrieve keys to open a door, and opening this door is required for both of the new endings introduced in the DLC. All of this running around felt a bit like padding.</p>

<p>Even the new endings weren't particularly innovative. Spoilers ahead — one ending is effectively a remix of the "steal a piece of the spooky alien meteorite and escape" ending, and the other new ending is a play on the "join the collective consciousness of the alien fungus" ending. This was a missed opportunity to try a new sort of end to the narrative.</p>

<p>All in all, the&nbsp;<em>Atomfall Wicked Isle</em>&nbsp;DLC was serviceable at best. It's worth it if you really loved running around the mid-20th century British countryside and you're anxious for more places to explore; otherwise, I'd recommend waiting to pick it up until you feel like giving the game a new playthrough sometime down the line.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paralives-december-early-access-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie&nbsp;<em>Sims</em>-like&nbsp;<em>Paralives&nbsp;</em>finally has an Early Access release date, and while it's a way away, at least you know when you'll get to check this one out.</p>

<p>As revealed during yesterday's PC Gaming Show,&nbsp;<em>Paralives&nbsp;</em>will launch into Early Access via Steam on December 8th. It's one of very few games around right now that are willing to challenge EA's&nbsp;<em>The Sims&nbsp;</em>for its life sim crown.</p>

<p><em>Paralives&nbsp;</em>has been in development for quite some time. The game was first announced in June 2019, and since then, we've gotten <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sims-competitor-paralives-shows-off-its-characters" rel="nofollow">multiple glimpses</a> of features like its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paralives-character-creator-shows-substantial-improvements" rel="nofollow">character creator</a> and simulation gameplay.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/paralives-early-access-release-date-bloom.jpg?itok=ryZW0E3L 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/paralives-early-access-release-date-bloom.jpg?itok=idQRVV2X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Paralives&nbsp;</em>is finally on the verge of being released in Early Access.</figcaption></figure><p>Developer Alex Massé's game may sport a more stylized aesthetic, but make no mistake: it's out here gunning for&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>' throne, and given the way the landscape of&nbsp;<em>Sims&nbsp;</em>competitors looks right now, I'd wager it stands a solid chance.</p>

<p>Of course, there's Krafton's&nbsp;<em>inZoi</em>, which was released back in March, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inzoi-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">racking up a million sales</a> within its first week. Other than that, though, the field for&nbsp;<em>Sims</em>-esque games is looking pretty thin, especially since Paradox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled" rel="nofollow">canceled&nbsp;<em>Life by You&nbsp;</em>last year</a>.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Paralives&nbsp;</em>is, it's a life sim in which you can create characters (known as "Parafolk") and manage their lives as you see fit. You can build their homes, oversee how they interact with one another, and even control their relationships.</p>




<p><em>Paralives&nbsp;</em>also takes place in an open-world environment where you can see your Parafolk interacting with each other in locations outside of their homes. Massé promises locations like parks, beaches, shops, and more for your Parafolk to frolic in.</p>

<p>If you're interested in checking out&nbsp;<em>Paralives</em>, you'll be able to do so when it launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1118520/Paralives/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on December 8th. There's no word of any console ports yet, unfortunately.</p>

It’s the first time the company has introduced a new capacity since <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738266/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-512gb-2tb-storage-expansion-cards-release-date-pricing">launching 2TB and 512GB versions</a> of the expansion card in late 2021.</p><p>The 4TB card is available starting today through Seagate’s online store and Best Buy for $499.99, but is discounted to $429.99 as part of a limited-time launch promotion. For comparison, the Xbox Series S starts at $379.99, while the Xbox Series X starts at $599.99. </p><p>But, the added storage may be required by folks with large libraries of games. Depending on the options and expansions you install, games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283801/comcast-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-large-downloads"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/26/22593883/microsoft-flight-simulator-xbox-series-x-s-review"><em>Microsoft Flight Simulator</em></a> can easily gobble up hundreds of gigs of storage each. You can increase the Xbox’s storage capacity using an external drive connected over USB, but to play games directly from an SSD, without having to move files around, requires the storage expansion cards.</p><p>You may want to wait for a price drop, though. The 2TB version of the card was originally priced at $399.99, but is now listed on <a href="https://www.seagate.com/products/gaming-drives/xbox-gaming/storage-expansion-for-xbox-series-x/?sku=STJR1000400">Seagate’s online store for $249.99</a>, with a current promotion bringing it down to $219.99. </p><p>For nearly three years, Seagate was the only company offering expandable storage cards for the Xbox Series X and S, but in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/6/23750797/western-digital-xbox-storage-expansion-card-price-release-date">mid-2023 Western Digital</a> introduced its own. Its current pricing and capacities are comparable to Seagate’s offerings. Western Digital hasn’t yet introduced a 4TB option.</p><p>Although the added competition did help bring the price of Seagate’s expansion cards down, they’re still more expensive than storage expansions for the PlayStation 5, which allows you to use any SSD as long as it meets certain performance requirements. Not only does <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdirect.playstation.com%2Fen-us%2Fbuy-accessories%2F4tb-wd-black-sn850p-nvme-ssd-for-ps5-consoles" rel="sponsored">Western Digital already sell a PS5-compatible 4TB SSD</a> for $339.99, it also offers an 8TB option, although that will set you back a steep $699.99.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Indie Sims-like Paralives has landed itself an early access release date.</p>
<p>It will be making its debut on 8th December, developer Alex Massé and team revealed last night.</p>
<p>"We are so excited to share the game with you all and can't wait to collect all your feedback to keep on improving the game," the Paralives crew shared along with a new trailer (see below). Here, we see some of the game's building techniques, and its world activities.</p>

<p>For those unfamiliar with Paralives already, it's a very promising looking Sims-like. The developer has promised a single player game which does not require an internet connection to enjoy, complete with dogs, cats, horses, cars, bikes and boats. <a href="https://www.paralives.com/faq">That includes boat houses</a>.</p>
<p>"Even if there will be bugs and some important features missing," the Paralives team explained last year, in the game's announcement post. "We think Paralives' Early Access will be quite enjoyable. Players who like to create characters and build houses will have a lot of tools and content to get creative with and the live mode will have its core features established which will allow people to create great stories for their Parafolks."</p>

<p>At this same time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-sims-like-paralives-gets-seven-minute-gameplay-video-hitting-early-access-next-year">the developer added that it will have no paid DLC</a>. "As a small team without any shareholders to please," it said, "we believe the money we make from selling the game alone will be enough to support us and the development of free updates in the long run."</p>
<p>Well, colour me interested!</p>
<p>Paralives follows another Sims-like release <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inzoi">InZoi</a>, which debuted at the end of March. This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/early-access-life-sim-inzoi-breaks-krafton-sales-record">particular release broke records for publisher Krafton</a>. </p>
<p>Other games playing with this genre, however, have not fared as well. Last year, Paradox shut down ambitious Sims-like Life by You, before also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-shuts-down-life-by-you-studio-following-sims-likes-sudden-cancellation">closing the internal studio behind the project, Paradox Tectonic</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/survival-kids<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<p>A treasure map: a voyage. The ocean sploshing happily at your makeshift raft. Then a ferocious storm! Shipwrecked, alone, starving, surely doomed.</p>
<p>Well, not exactly. The happy sploshing part, yes — and technically a shipwreck — but then you’re in for a calypso-tinged, cosy hangout with friends. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/survival-kids">Survival Kids</a> offers a gentle change of pace in the fervour of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> launch, and a jolly fun jaunt it is, too.</p>
<p>Developed by Unity — as in the game engine company, in its first foray into end-to-end game development — this is an update of a dormant Konami IP that goes right back to the Game Boy in 1999. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/survival_kids">That game</a>, made available recently on Nintendo’s Game Boy app on Switch, was an early example of survival mechanics, including stabbing animals to death in a you-or-them scrap, before cooking up the flesh to eke out another day without starving to death. Over the years, through half a dozen or so sequels and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/lost_in_blue">spin-offs</a> and a lengthy hiatus, the edges have softened, culminating in this gentle, cooperative exploration and puzzle game.</p>
<figure><a title="Survival Kids Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/155193/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>The setup is lighthearted. Yes, stranded in a shipwreck – but on the back of a giant turtle called a 'whurtle'. Your mission is to fix up your raft and set off back home. However, each new voyage leads to another wreck on another whurtle – another level with the same mission to repair and escape. If that sounds repetitive, well, <em>it really is</em> – it’s whurtles all the way down. But, although solo play is available, this is fundamentally a multiplayer game, and cooperating and collaborating to complete the simple errands on the to-do list keeps everything fresh.</p>
<p>As for getting multiplayer set up, you have a few options: splitscreen for two players, online up to four, and an early example of Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-gameshare-guide-how-to-share-games-locally-and-online">GameShare</a> feature, where up to three players can play with a single copy of the game. For this last option, however, you are limited to a local configuration, where all the Switches are in the same room. Since the Switch 2 streams the game to the other consoles (including the original Switch if you’ve held on to one), <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/konamis-switch-2-launch-title-will-have-3-player-local-co-op-via-gameshare">the frame rate drops to 30fps</a>, and some latency creeps in. Add to this the big black border around the play area on each device and it’s not an ideal way to play, but it’s passable.</p>
<p>In my testing, splitscreen on the telly was the way to go. Online with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-gamechat-guide-how-does-it-work">GameChat</a> could probably be a good laugh, but I don’t have any friends (<em>with this game</em>, thank you) to test that. Even if you are set up for GameChat, I doubt it could compete with couch co-op, particularly because your ideal co-survivor is probably about 5-10 years old – more on that in a minute.</p>
<figure><a title="Survival Kids Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156661/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Anyway, however you recruit them, once your crew is ready to set sail with the game, the process of repairing your raft boils down to gathering scattered items and carrying them to the wreckage. Reaching those items requires a bit of light puzzling, such as casting a fishing line to grab a distant piece of machinery or blowing items into place with a leafy fan. Said fishing line and fan also need to be constructed by gathering items and bringing them to base camp. All in all, it’s a game about searching and fetching.</p>
<p>Experienced gamers may find the very basic actions a bit tedious after the first couple of islands. However, put Survival Kids in front of a newer gamer — in my testing, a six-year-old — and the novelty doesn’t wear off so promptly. In fact, it was a gleeful time through to the end of the game and beyond.</p>
<p>And the enduring fun wasn’t just because the ideas were new to my fellow strandee; more than that, he was able to enjoy them thanks to the very dependable and generous controls. Chopping trees, for example, sends wood flying about, and those little bits all need to be gathered and lugged around. Larger items need to be dragged, and everything bobbles about for some physics-based fun. It’s a recipe for disaster, really, since repetition plus fidgetiness equals agonising gameplay. But not to fear: a quick and reliable push of the 'A' button grabs whatever’s nearby with a delightful pop, and since you can only stack alike items in your hands, mashing 'A' will always gather the right resource from a pile as long as you start with the one you’re after.</p>
<figure><a title="Survival Kids Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/155196/large.jpg"></a></figure>
<p>The same holds for some simple platforming. The kids’ yelping bounds are a bit floaty and inelegant as jumps go, but the island parkour was clear and easy to execute, with a quick reset just in case, and no real punishment if you miss the target.</p>
<p>'No real punishment' could be the game’s motto, in fact. Working together completes tasks faster, but it’s not too slow on your own. You need to eat to increase your strength, but you won’t really suffer for running out. The simple fishing can be messed up, snapping your line, but there are always plenty more fish in the sea, so to speak.</p>
<p>Overall, there’s little resistance to completion, even if your partner doesn’t feel like doing anything constructive. Mine appointed himself the cook every time — whether food was needed or not — but we always got our raft sorted in the end.</p>

<p>Our rather dilly-dallying approach to island life made the game last about 12 hours for us. I’m confident experienced gamers could finish it off in half that time. There are star rewards to go back for on each level — for time gates and hidden items — but replaying the same level only amplified the tedium for me. We reached the last level to find it gated behind a 25-star requirement. We called it a day, and I spent an hour grinding stars on my own after bedtime so we could finish the game in the morning. That was the least fun part of the experience by a nautical mile.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Survival Kids is a thoroughly competent, cosy game of cooperative gathering and crafting. It’s not much of a looker, and its ideas aren’t mind-blowing, but it’s all good stuff thanks to its robust controls and easy-to-grasp loop. I’m not sure I’d want to be stuck with it on a desert island, but it’s good company for several happy hours with a friend – especially a less experienced gamer. If you plan to get shipwrecked with a little one and giggle your way through it, go ahead and add a point to the score.</p></section>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-devkit-ndk-core-ounce-first-look-highlights-differences-with-retail-unit.1213176/</guid>

			<p>The first look at the Nintendo Switch 2 devkit has arrived today, thanks to some images that also highlight the differences with the retail unit that finally launched last week.</p>
<p>The new images of the NDK Core Ounce devkit were shared on X earlier today by <a href="https://x.com/Nintendeal" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendeal</a>, and provide a rather good look at the system. Contrary to the usual, the Nintendo Switch 2 devkit doesn't look that different from the retail, and the only notable differences are the double USB-C ports at the bottom, and the all-black color scheme, which some may prefer to the color schemes used for the launch retail units.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Switch 2 dev kits use some kind of custom cable to connect on the bottom (USB-C and something else? double USB-C?) <a href="https://t.co/LSxefZuwth">pic.twitter.com/LSxefZuwth</a></p>
<p>— Nintendeal (@Nintendeal) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nintendeal/status/1931840515156349195?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>As mentioned above, the Nintendo Switch 2 finally launched worldwide last week, with a few exceptions, alongside a few titles, including Mario Kart World, the highly anticipated new entry in the series, and a selection of third-party ports, which include Cyberpunk 2077, Hogwarts Legacy, and a few others. While the system is the first one from Nintendo to support features that have become standard since the launch of the original Switch, the implementation sometimes leaves something to be desired. HDR support, for example, is disappointing, especially in handheld mode due to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-below-average-hdr/">below-average display.</a> It's not all doom and gloom from a technical perspective, however, as the system seems to<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-seems-to-have-native-keyboard-and-mouse-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;natively support mouse and keyboard controls</a>, which can be a game-changer for first-person games or strategy games like Civilization VII, another of the system's launch titles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/clockwork-revolution-features-truly-evil-conversation-options-and-multi-person-dialogues/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>inXile Entertainment <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-clockwork-revolution-trailer-revealed-during-xbox-games-showcase-will-launch-on-pc-and-consoles-in-due-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed</a> its next big project, the first-person steampunk RPG Clockwork Revolution, with a new trailer at the Xbox Games Showcase 2025. The developers were also <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/08/clockwork-revolution-gameplay-interview-xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> by the official Xbox Wire blog, revealing more details about the game. For instance, we learned that multi-person dialogues are very important in Clockwork Revolution, and the game will even include some 'truly evil' options during conversations.</p>
<p><em><strong>Brian Fargo (inXile founder and producer on the game):</strong> It was important for us to speak directly to core roleplaying fans and show what this game really is. We slow things down for a moment, let the conversation breathe, and show the systems at work. That scene with Alfie isn’t just dramatic, it sets the tone. This is a game that can be brutal. Not just in combat, but in the choices you make and how the world responds. It’s not just about cinematics, it’s about the kind of deep, reactive RPG we love to build, and that our players expect.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Chad Moore (game director on Clockwork Revolution and programmer on the steampunk RPG classic Arcanum: Of Steamworks &amp; Magick Obscura):</strong> It also highlights our multi-person conversations. Some conversations will have multiple people involved, and who you choose to speak to can send you down different dialogue branches. This can wildly change where a conversation ends up going. In the case of the trailer, Morgan chose to speak to Errol instead of Alfie, despite obvious warnings, and that resulted in poor Errol’s death. So, if you choose to go down that path, Errol is then a character that won’t be in the rest of the game.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Brian Fargo:</strong> Conversations have meaningful consequences, and I think it’s worth mentioning we have truly evil conversation options. You see a few of those play out in the trailer. If you’re offering evil options, they need to actually pay off and have meaningful consequences in order for the good choices to feel good. Otherwise, you’re not truly playing the way you want to play.</em></p>
<p>Clockwork Revolution was first <a href="https://wccftech.com/clockwork-revolution-is-inxiles-first-person-steampunk-rpg-game-is-still-early-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shown</a> at the Xbox Games Showcase in 2023. At the time, the studio said it was in 'early development'. Now, it's saying that the game will launch in 'due time'. Phil Spencer didn't mention it among the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-2026-first-party-lineup-includes-forza-fable-gears-and-possibly-halo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">games that will be part of the 2026 Xbox lineup</a>, so there's a chance it might launch even later. So far, the game is only confirmed for PC and Xbox Series S|X, but with Microsoft's new multiplatform policy, it's only a matter of time before it eventually reaches other consoles, too.</p>

            <link>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-worry-confused-skongers-hollow-knight-silksongs-release-definitely-isnt-tied-to-that-xbox-handheld</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dont-worry-confused-skongers-hollow-knight-silksongs-release-definitely-isnt-tied-to-that-xbox-handheld.1213170/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-worry-confused-skongers-hollow-knight-silksongs-release-definitely-isnt-tied-to-that-xbox-handheld<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="main-content" data-component="article-header">
  

        <p>Team Cherry's sliced through any confusion</p>

    </div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The collective desperation for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> has evolved. Rather than people getting all up a height about the prospect of getting any news about it, they've now been left up a height due to confusion around some news they have gotten about the game. Cue Team Cherry having to step in to offer a bit of clarification about Silksong's Xbox Showcase cameo yesterday.</p>
<p>In case you were washing your hair, Silksong popped up during the bit that saw Microsoft introduce its handheld, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/xboxs-handheld-is-coming-this-year-is-also-really-a-new-asus-rog-ally">the ROG Xbox Ally</a>. There was the usual hardware spinning around and looking cool, plus Xbox's Sarah Bond saying when Silksong popped up on the handheld's screen that the game'll be "available at launch and in Game Pass when the Ally releases later this year".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Enter confusion from some fans as to whether Silksong's release was tied to the handheld's release in "holiday 2025". Don't worry, it isn't.</p>
<p>Team Cherry marketing and publishing manager Matthew 'Leth' Griffin has made as much very clear via the long-suffering fan hive that is the Silksong Discord server. "I confirmed BEFORE Holiday," he wrote of the game's release date, "we are not tied to a console release." He then added that Christmas was what he meant by holiday, just to make totally sure there was no room for misinterpretation.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To give you an idea of the confusion that had followed the Xbox showcase appearance, these posts came in response to a Discord user with the wonderful handle fleetwood_bigmac asking Griffin for confirmation that Silksong was still on track to release before 2026. The dev replied "wait...what?" to that, likely realising that even if it was trolling, making things clear to the hardcore skongers beyond all doubt was probably a good shout.</p>
<p>So, to reiterate, Hollow Knight: Silksong is coming before Christmas 2025, possibly before September given a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-may-release-before-september-given-that-itll-be-publicly-playable-by-then">certain confirmed cameo</a> down under, and its release isn't tied to Xbox's new game playing box.</p>
<p>To be fair, we learned the date that Silksong will be playable as part of an Australian museum exhibit before we got a full release date for it, so you can't really blame fans for not knowing whether they're coming or going at this point. They've spent part of the last few years doing stuff like trying to read into comments on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unless-this-cake-is-lying-to-you-silksong-will-reappear-in-april">cake recipes</a> and their brains are just begging for straight, indisputable answers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And the debut trailer, below, gave fans little to go on beyond a story tease and confirmation of the year in which the game is set (2035) and its protagonist: David Mason.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It turns out, this is all part of Activision’s marketing strategy for Black Ops 7, which is all about not revealing much at all before the game comes out later in 2025. To what end? Activision wants Black Ops 7’s launch to feel like a surprise Beyonce album drop.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-milo-ventimiglia-kiernan-shipka-1236422511/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a>, Activision marketing chief Tyler Bahl explained what the company is trying to achieve with Black Ops 7:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Usually at this point in time, we would have teased everything that’s coming out. And I think in a lot of ways we’re setting this up more like a Beyonce album dropping; nobody’s going to know about it, or nobody’s going to see it coming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The whole goal was to really do something different, and for us to zag and show up in a unique way. And one way of doing that is almost not doing any pre-promotion and giving it to players in a really unexpected way.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Activision promised a bigger reveal for some point in the summer, perhaps it won’t reveal much at all, and fans will have to wait until the release date to get a real sense of what Black Ops 7 is all about.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/09/black-ops-7-keyart-16x9-1-1749464745523.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Black Ops 7 is out later in 2025. Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what do we know? Black Ops 7 is set in 2035, more than 40 years after the events of Black Ops 6, at a time when the world is on the brink of chaos following the events of Black Ops 2 and last year’s Black Ops 6. Co-op campaign returns for Black Ops 7 after 6 skipped it (you can still play the campaign solo). Expect to use near-future weaponry in Multiplayer, with brand-new maps. Meanwhile, there’s the next chapter of Round-Based Zombies in the heart of the Dark Aether.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Wielding cutting-edge technology, David Mason and his team must fight back against a manipulative enemy who weaponizes fear above all else.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Variety, Black Ops 7 sees This Is Us star Milo Ventimiglia play David Mason (the character is recast with a new face), Kiernan Shipka as a new character called Emma Kagen (CEO of The Guild), and Michael Rooker, who reprises his role as Mike Harper from Black Ops 2.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/09/gettyimages-2031351968-1749464589972.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Milo Ventimiglia plays David Mason in Black Ops 7. Photo by Gilbert Flores/Variety via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Also confirmed is that Activision is sticking with last-gen consoles for Black Ops 7, which is due out across Xbox Series X and S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC via “Xbox PC,” Battle.net, and Steam. As you’d expect, you can play day-one on Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass. There was no mention of Nintendo Switch 2 in the announcement. It’s a co-development between Treyarch and Raven Software.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 7 marks the first time the Black Ops sub-series has seen back-to-back releases, and comes just a year after Black Ops 6’s launch. Some fans are already saying this makes Black Ops 7 feel like a stop-gap, as 2023’s Modern Warfare 3 was considered by some within the community given it followed 2022’s Modern Warfare 2 just a year later. Activision, however, has insisted Black Ops 7 “delivers the full Call of Duty package for our players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The expectation is Infinity Ward will return with a new Modern Warfare game in 2026, resetting the Call of Duty cycle once again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-2025-everything-announced-so-far">everything announced at Xbox Games Showcase June 2025</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo by Gilbert Flores/Variety via Getty Images.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>The launch of Nintendo's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a> has finally brought GameCube games to Nintendo Switch Online subscribers, but there's also a secret startup sound.</p>
<p>Once downloaded, the GameCube collection features three games so far: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/f-zero-gx">F-Zero GX</a>, Soul Calibur 2, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-wind-waker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>. Open the collection and it works just like others for the N64, SNES and more.</p>
<p>But! If you hold the Switch 2's left stick in any direction as the collection loads, you'll be treated to the iconic GameCube startup screen with its plinky-plonky sound effects and rolling cube. Cute!</p>

<p>YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dwKgKoSGHQ">Spawn Wave</a> shared a video of the screen over the weekend. I then had to try it myself for that hit of nostalgia.</p>
<p>I tested it with other buttons too - the face buttons and the shoulder buttons - but only the left stick works for this little Easter Egg.</p>
<p>If you're planning on playing F-Zero GX - and you should be, it's great - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/f-zero-gx-on-switch-2-is-virtually-unplayable-without-remapping-the-controls">note the default controls mean the game is virtually unplayable</a>. You'll need to enter the suspend menu to remap the controls, specifically moving boost to a more easily accessible button.</p>
<p>So far <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/classic-gamecube-games-coming-to-switch-2-via-switch-online-along-with-purchasable-gamecube-inspired-controller">only three games are available in the collection</a>, though you can buy a GameCube controller too. Other games on the way include <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fire-emblem-path-radiance">Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</a>, Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness, Mario Smash Football, Chibi Robo, Luigi's Mansion, and Pokémon Colosseum.</p>
<p>What other GameCube games are you hoping to see added to the collection? Personally, after splashing around in Mario Kart World over the weekend, I am hopeful Nintendo will whip out Wave Race: Blue Storm from its vault.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<blockquote>
<p>"...we are also preparing patches for a few of our older games, but this may take some time as we also plan to add some Switch 2 exclusive features in games like Clock Tower."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>New features for Clock Tower...but what could they be? Of course, Clock Tower: Rewind on Switch 1 added a whole bunch of new stuff, such as a new opening movie, new songs, save states, interviews and comics — amongst other things — so it'll be interesting to see what could possibly be jammed this time.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/clock-tower-rewind">We gave Clock Tower: Rewind a 7/10 in our review on Switch</a>, saying that "we feel comfortable recommending to survival horror enthusiasts who wish to experience absolutely everything the genre has to offer." However, our review does point out that the game looks fairly archaic at this stage, so maybe we are in for a nice lick of paint? Seems ambitious, but let us dream. We'll be sure to let you know of any further announcements.</p>

			<p><a href="https://press.necrosoftgames.com/demonschool/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demonschool</a>, the Persona series-inspired role-playing game in development by Necrosoft Games, is launching this summer after having been delayed last year.</p>
<p>The game's new release window on PC and consoles was confirmed in a new trailer shown during yesterday's PC Gaming Show which also provided a quick look at one week in the life of a Demonschool student, which doesn't exclusively involve hunting demons. The available activities look varied enough, so it definitely looks like the experience will have no trouble staying fresh for its entire duration.</p>

<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/demonschool-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last year</a>, I had the chance to try out a Demonschool demo before its public release, and really enjoyed what I played, despite the available in-game week not being as varied as the one showcased in the latest trailer. The combat system is probably what I liked best about the demo, together with its aesthetics, and what sets the game apart the most from the latest entries in the series.</p>
<p><em>A few rather unique quirks make the Demonschool combat system intriguing. For starters, units can only move in straight lines and must use a special maneuver called Sidestep, which doesn't cost AP to adjust their movement range. Attacking enemies requires positioning characters in the correct range, and each attack also pushes the attacked unit, allowing the player to plan things out so that it will become possible to attack an enemy out of range at the start of the Planning Phase. Additionally, just defeating enemies is not enough to win, as not only players must defeat a required number of demons, but they also have to reach the opposite side of the combat arena with any character to seal a portal. Add in different roles for playable characters, frequent demon respawns, and special attacks with different properties, and you get a uniquely challenging battle system that could take some time to understand, but it offers a lot of strategic depth, making battles extremely fun.</em></p>
<p>Demonschool launches this summer on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

			<p>Beast of Reincarnation, an action RPG set in post-apocalyptic Japan and developed by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gamefreak/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pokémon series developer</a>, has been announced for a 2026 release.</p>
<p>The game was revealed with a new trailer shared during yesterday's Xbox Games Showcase, which provided a first look at the game's setting, main character Emma, an outcast cursed as a Blighted One, her canine companion Koo, and the many dangerous enemies they will have to face. While the trailer has also proved how Game Freak and performance drops go hand in hand, no matter the platform, Beast of Reincarnation looks quite interesting in its first showing.</p>
