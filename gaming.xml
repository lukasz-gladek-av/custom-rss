Herald of Glory adds new items and society trait which adds as a regal way to take over the Astral Sea. There are three more DLC packs planned as part of this expansion pass for Age of Wonders 4.</p>
<p><iframe title="Age of Wonders 4: New Content Reveal" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y0lS6RXYJ2Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The second piece of DLC in this expansion pass for&nbsp; Age of Wonders 4 is Ways of War. This content adds the Oathsworn culture in which you can swear three different oaths. The Oath of Righteousness is to focus on taking on and destroying evil, the Oath of Strife to wage war against the most powerful, and<br>
the Oath of Harmony to lead a peaceful life. On top of that are intrigue events that will centre around assassinations and betrayals. Within Ways of War there are new forms called the Simians and Ogrekins, and there are four Tomes that focus on discipline, shade, calamity, and prosperity. This DLC will be out on November 5th.</p>
<p>Then in 2025 the other two DLCs will be released with these being Giant Kings and Archon Prophecy. Giants Kings will feature a new Giant ruler and add new items, including ancient traffic and crystal based magic from a fallen empire. Archon Prophecy will be the last pack as part of the expansion pass which will include a new culture, new prophecies, and new story. The expansion pass costs $49.99/£41.99/€49.99, but each DLC pack will be available separately too. Ways of War will cost $14.99/£12.79/€14.99, whole Giant Kings and Archon Prophecy will be priced individually at $19.99/£16.99/€19.99.</p>

While Max has gone on to have his own successful career in the video game industry, working on titles like <em>Assassin’s Creed Unity</em> and <em>Battlefield 1</em>, it’s impossible to completely escape his father’s shadow.  However, as he told <em>MinnMax</em>, it was actually <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steven-spielberg-star-wars-arcade-colbert-interview-1850185237&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steven-spielberg-star-wars-arcade-colbert-interview-1850185237">Steven Spielberg and his love of video games</a></span> that got Max interested in the medium and the industry. </p><p> “He loves gaming. He’s the one that got me into it. He plays games.

He plays the campaign,” said Max. </p><p>Interestingly, Max explained that his father, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-steven-spielbergs-ambitious-video-game-failed-to-ta-452572284&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/how-steven-spielbergs-ambitious-video-game-failed-to-ta-452572284">who loves story-focused games</a></span>, never learned how to play games using a controller and is more comfortable using a keyboard and mouse.

I can only do keyboard and mouse.’”</p><p> As mentioned in the MinnMax interview, Max’s father doesn’t come up much at work as people are usually professional and not looking dig for info or stories. But Max Spielberg has shown his upcoming game, <em>Lynked: Banner of the Spark,</em> to his dad for feedback. His father said that the co-op hack-and-slash game that also features town-building and roguelike elements looks great. And while Max’s father doesn’t usually come up during development, Lynked’s art director Eric Kozlowsky pointed out, “You can’t help but feel like [your] doing something right” when Steven Spielberg likes your artwork or designs. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.playlynked.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.playlynked.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Lynked: Banner of the Spark </em>arrives on Steam via early access on October 22</a></span>. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

With a total of five characters and eight unique class options (not counting each character’s default classes), you’ll have a total of <em>40</em> possible classes to use in your active party. That’s a lot of choices, especially since you can only use three of them at once!</p><p>Truthfully, it’s hard to say what the “best class” or the “best team” is in <em>Visions of Mana</em>. Each character can fulfill different party roles depending on their class, ranging from pure damage dealers to dedicated supporters. In the end, how you synergize your active team’s abilities and exploit your enemies’ weaknesses will matter more than the specific classes you choose. But if you’d like a little nudge to figure out how you should build your team into the awesome monster slayers you know they can be, consider using the classes we’ve picked here.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Evaluations are based on how each class performs throughout the game, not just their endgame potential. For this reason, skills each class learns in the first two tiers of their Elemental Plot will be typically weighed much higher than tier three and tier four skills.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="536f297973550f2ba50d14c0452be81f" data-recommend-id="image://536f297973550f2ba50d14c0452be81f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rune Knight" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rune Knight" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="536f297973550f2ba50d14c0452be81f" data-recommend-id="image://536f297973550f2ba50d14c0452be81f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rune Knight" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h142906"><a id=""></a><strong>Key Stats</strong></h3><p>Strength, Stamina<br></p><h3 id="h142907"><a id=""></a>Val: Rune Knight Details</h3><p><strong>Rune Knight is your best damage dealer in the early game of <em>Visions of Mana</em></strong>. It’s the first character class you can unlock, and comes right out of the box with two elemental imbuement skills and a great 20 percent attack boost when Val uses said imbuements. Exploiting elemental weaknesses can skyrocket your outgoing damage, so this class will help you tear down even the bulkiest of foes. Val can learn more imbuement skills as he unlocks new classes too, which lets Rune Knight scale well into the mid and late game.</p><p>Once Morley can use his first Chalice to unlock the second tier of his Elemental Plot, Val may fall behind as a main damage dealer for reasons that will become apparent later. Still, <strong>Rune Knight Val</strong> performs incredibly well as a support DPS, and you’ll be happy to have him on your team.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9775f2c6fb328573d4ea95d434d897d9" data-recommend-id="image://9775f2c6fb328573d4ea95d434d897d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Edelfrei " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Edelfrei " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9775f2c6fb328573d4ea95d434d897d9" data-recommend-id="image://9775f2c6fb328573d4ea95d434d897d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Edelfrei " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h142908"><a id=""></a><strong>Key Stat</strong></h3><p>Stamina<br></p><h3 id="h142909"><a id=""></a>Val: Edelfrei Details</h3><p>f you’re playing on Hard mode, or you’re fighting monsters that are way higher level than you are, designating a party member to draw the enemy’s attention can seriously take the heat off your team. <strong>No other character is better equipped to fulfill the Tank role than Val, and Edelfrei lets Val fill multiple party roles at once</strong>. This class gives Val knockback resistance, a damage boost for hitting elemental weaknesses (which we’ve established Val is good at), and a built-in healing option thanks to Dryad’s Elemental Vessel. Equip Val with Ability Seeds that boost his defenses and you’ll have a reliable wall to send to your front lines.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="66107dc16251a62469d2bcb91fd9c0fe" data-recommend-id="image://66107dc16251a62469d2bcb91fd9c0fe" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Divine Fist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Divine Fist." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="66107dc16251a62469d2bcb91fd9c0fe" data-recommend-id="image://66107dc16251a62469d2bcb91fd9c0fe" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Divine Fist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h142910"><a id=""></a><strong>Key Stats</strong></h3><p>Strength, Luck</p><h3 id="h142911"><a id=""></a>Careena: Divine Fist Details</h3><p>Class Strikes are comically powerful in <em>Visions of Mana</em>. These attacks can defeat entire groups of enemies in a single hit, and <strong>Careena’s Divine Fist class is all about making your Class Strikes even better</strong>. Not only can Careena ignore a chunk of her foes’ defense stats thanks to the Fighting Spirit ability, she can also fill the Class Strike gauge faster and even give herself an attack buff after each Class Strike. You can also equip her with all those buff and debuff moves from her other class options, letting her fulfill a supporting role as well!</p><p>Careena as a Divine Fist will help you tear through common enemies and obliterate boss health bars alike. What’s more, since Class Strikes stop the clock in Elemental Aerie battles, she’ll help you clear battle arenas above your current level too. Careena might not look like a fighter, but her fists are not to be trifled with.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7eb86dce2d92112d2be1d2e771a7efe8" data-recommend-id="image://7eb86dce2d92112d2be1d2e771a7efe8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Nightblade." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nightblade." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7eb86dce2d92112d2be1d2e771a7efe8" data-recommend-id="image://7eb86dce2d92112d2be1d2e771a7efe8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Nightblade." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h142912"><a id=""></a><strong>Key Stats</strong></h3><p>Strength, Luck</p><h3 id="h142913"><a id=""></a>Morley: Nightblade Details</h3><p>Morley may look like a cat, but make no mistake, this boy is the G.O.A.T. Nightblade is one of Morley’s strongest classes from the minute you recruit him, but it’s not terribly impressive at first. However, once you access the second tier of skills in his Elemental Plot, everything changes. A 20 percent critical hit damage increase <em>and</em> an absurd 70 percent critical hit rate buff increases his damage potential to ludicrous heights. Augment his critical hit rate and damage further via Ability Seeds, and all of the sudden you have a lightning-fast attacker who can stack dozens of guaranteed critical hits in a handful of seconds.</p><p><strong>I strongly recommend using Morley as your main damage dealer</strong>. The only downside is that, unless you’re playing on hard mode, a well-optimized Morley might make the game too easy. Even Luna’s Elemental Vessel ability works well with this class, since it can stop enemies in their tracks while Morley unleashes a flurry of powerful attacks. Between great damage and the ability to stunlock several enemies in the game, what more could you ask for?</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6eb1549ed76be5918b8b0a9409679fd4" data-recommend-id="image://6eb1549ed76be5918b8b0a9409679fd4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Grand Diviner" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Grand Diviner" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6eb1549ed76be5918b8b0a9409679fd4" data-recommend-id="image://6eb1549ed76be5918b8b0a9409679fd4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Grand Diviner" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h142914"><a id=""></a><strong>Key Stat</strong></h3><p>Intellect<br></p><h3 id="h142915"><a id=""></a>Palamena: Grand Diviner Details</h3><p><strong>Nobody uses magic like Palamena, and the Grand Diviner class lets her do what she does best</strong>. While Grand Diviner gives Palamena a healthy Intellect stat to work with, she can restore half her MP bar after every battle for free with the Fluid Flourish skill. This means you can set Palamena to “All-Out Attack” and “Go Wild” in her battle AI and she’ll almost never run out of magic throughout a dungeon. Make sure to learn spells from the other classes on her Elemental Plot to help her exploit enemy weaknesses whenever she can!</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="71b52b9b08a11f2e6718af3225ff699e" data-recommend-id="image://71b52b9b08a11f2e6718af3225ff699e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Magus." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Magus." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="71b52b9b08a11f2e6718af3225ff699e" data-recommend-id="image://71b52b9b08a11f2e6718af3225ff699e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Magus." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h142916"><a id=""></a><strong>Key Stat</strong></h3><p>Intellect<br></p><h3 id="h142917"><a id=""></a>Palamena: Magus Details</h3><p>While Val had two best class options that fulfill different roles, Palamena’s Magus class is a different flavor of her magic casting niche. Magus has an even <em>higher</em> magic stat than Grand Diviner, and it sports valuable knockback immunity while Palamena is casting. Palamena does lose that handy MP regeneration after every battle, but by the time you unlock this class, you should have the cash to afford all the magic recovery items Palamena needs to sustain herself.</p><p>You may prefer Grand Diviner if you mostly use Palamena against random enemy mobs, but bosses and other big bads will melt faster if you use Magus instead.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ef2e15572185945644758a61bbd12230" data-recommend-id="image://ef2e15572185945644758a61bbd12230" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="High Cleric" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="High Cleric" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ef2e15572185945644758a61bbd12230" data-recommend-id="image://ef2e15572185945644758a61bbd12230" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="High Cleric" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h142918"><a id=""></a><strong>Key Stats</strong></h3><p>Spirit, Stamina<br></p><h3 id="h142919"><a id=""></a>Julei: High Cleric Details</h3><p>As the last character to join your party, Julei fills a niche that your gang has likely struggled to fill until now: Healing. And of all the classes Julei can pick, High Cleric is the healer-est of them all. With a sky-high Spirit stat and a buff that doubles the healing potential of Julei’s moves, the little sproutling will become easily capable of topping off a party member’s HP with a single spell. But really, because High Cleric gives Julei his most foundational healing and status recovery spells, you’ll want to invest in this class no matter how you build Julei.</p><p>Once Julei does unlock his third tier of skills in his Elemental Plot, the Healing Light + spell massively elevates his usefulness. The ability to functionally heal the entire party’s HP in a single cast is borderline essential for the game’s hardest challenges, and the Strong Roots skill will help him survive one fatal blow per battle. I highly recommend giving Julei resistance to status ailments and strong defenses so he can always bring your party back from the brink.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7bdd9d070fb3ad2acb1abdb36b69d662" data-recommend-id="image://7bdd9d070fb3ad2acb1abdb36b69d662" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Necromancer" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Necromancer" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7bdd9d070fb3ad2acb1abdb36b69d662" data-recommend-id="image://7bdd9d070fb3ad2acb1abdb36b69d662" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Necromancer" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h142920"><a id=""></a><strong>Key Stats</strong></h3><p>Spirit, Stamina<br></p><h3 id="h142921"><a id=""></a>Julei: Necromancer Details</h3><p>Julei’s Necromancer is incredible on paper, but the game provides precious few opportunities for it to really excel.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/smite-developer-hi-rez-studios-holding-layoffs/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Hi-Rez Studios, the developers of Smite and Smite 2, is the next studio holding layoffs during a year full of them. </p>



<p>The announcement came via a Twitter post by Hi-Rez CEO Stewart Chisam. In his <a href="https://x.com/schisam/status/1841072179028324382" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lengthy message</a>, he said that the decision to layoff “some team members” comes with a “focus on positioning SMITE 2 for a long and sustainable future.”</p>



<p>“Today, we’re making some difficult but necessary changes to ensure Hi-Rez’s long-term success, with a specific focus on positioning SMITE 2 for a long and sustainable future,” Chisam said.</p>



<p>While there was no mention of just how many people would be let go due to the “internal reorganization and reprioritization”, Chisam says that it will “disproportionately” involve people in marketing and publishing positions. He added that it will impact people from Evil  Mojo, G&amp;A, and Titan Forge divisions of the company.</p>



<p>He also said that the layoffs show a “failure” in his leadership at the company.</p>



<p>“This news has a real human impact at a tough time for workers in this industry,” he said. “Each impacted individual is a talented and dedicated professional who has poured their heart and soul into our games. Letting them go is a heartbreaking decision, reflects a failure in my leadership, and one for which I take personal accountability.”</p>



<h2 id="h-why-the-hi-rez-layoffs-now">Why The Hi-Rez Layoffs Now?</h2>



<p>Chisam says that the layoffs come after a “comprehensive review” of the company’s strategy. The decision was made to put full efforts into Smite 2 moving forward with small teams remaining to support the original Smite and Paladins. He then says that the development team on Smite 2 remains larger than the first game.</p>



<p>“Notably, the core dev team currently working on Smite 2 after these changes is still a significant size: Larger than the Smite 1 team was throughout most of its lifecycle (outside of a period during and shortly after the pandemic),” he said. “The team working on gods and gameplay features (versus skins and monetization/progression/system features) is larger than the SMITE 1 team ever was for such features.”</p>



<p>Chisam closed his statement saying that that he believed the changes were necessary albeit difficult, and that the company will “emerge stronger from them”.</p>



<p>Through the first nine months of 2024, the gaming industry as seen <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 13,000 known</a> positions lost across nearly 150 companies.</p>

This version of Shadow is based on his very first appearance in Sonic Adventure 2, a 2001 game for the Sega Dreamcast.</p><p>Shadow has starred in several other video games over the decades--including that one 2005 game where he had a cool motorcycle and lots of guns--and he'll be appearing on the big screen in Sonic the Hedgehog 3. Making a switch from hitman to hedgehog, Keanu Reeves will voice Shadow in the threequel, and video game fans can also look forward to seeing Shadow pop up in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-preorder-guide/1100-6524060/">Sonic X Generations</a> on October 25.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-fortnite-sets-now-available-to-preorder-includes-a-terrifying-peely-bone/1100-6525218/">Lego Fortnite sets</a> also released today, October 1, and if you're a fan of the battle royale series, you can pick up some fun kits like the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D13923%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fbattle-bus-77073&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flego-fortnite-sets-now-available-to-preorder-includes-a-terrifying-peely-bone%2F1100-6525218%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;trx-iid=iid1721751553098ecb" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fortnite Battle Bus</a>, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D13923%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fdurrr-burger-77070&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flego-fortnite-sets-now-available-to-preorder-includes-a-terrifying-peely-bone%2F1100-6525218%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;trx-iid=iid1721751553098ecb" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Durr Burger</a>, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D13923%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fsupply-llama-77071&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flego-fortnite-sets-now-available-to-preorder-includes-a-terrifying-peely-bone%2F1100-6525218%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;trx-iid=iid1721751553098ecb" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Supply Llama</a>, and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fclick.linksynergy.com%2Fdeeplink%3Fid%3DVZfI20jEa0c%26mid%3D13923%26u1%3Dsubid_value%26murl%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Fproduct%2Fpeely-bone-77072&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flego-fortnite-sets-now-available-to-preorder-includes-a-terrifying-peely-bone%2F1100-6525218%2F&amp;event_type=click&amp;trx-iid=iid1721751553098ecb" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Peely Bone</a>.

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater celebrated its 25-year anniversary on September 29, 2024. Below, we look back at how it began, and its influence as an unconventional platformer.<br></em></p><p dir="ltr">The 1990s were a wild time for skateboarding. Professionals like Tony Hawk were pushing the limits of what seemed possible by nailing unbelievable stunts for the first time in history--the loop of death, a 16ft ollie between water towers, and the first 900. Little did we know that these stunts and the people behind them would become part of the foundation of one of the greatest platformers of all time: Tony Hawk's Pro Skater.</p><p dir="ltr">The 1999 classic has officially turned 25 this year. Its legacy of incredible arcade gameplay--the one that spawned eight sequels, millions in sales, and countless kickflips and heelflips--is still as prevalent today as it was when the X Games were at the height of their popularity. Tony Hawk's Pro Skater brought skateboarding to a new level of cultural significance as people of all ages, kids especially, found their way to real-world skateboarding after shredding through the digital remains of an old abandoned mall.</p><p dir="ltr">Tony Hawk and other skaters weren't just turning skateboarding into a phenomenon, they were turning it into an extreme sport. Skateboarders were practically superheroes while ollieing through traffic and grinding across power lines in the real world. The Birdman wanted to replicate that feeling in a game when he set out to partner with a studio. The demo from Neversoft made anyone–not just skateboarders–feel like they were superman with a skateboard.</p><p dir="ltr">"Activision called me and I knew right away that was exactly what I wanted to work on," he said in a 2017 interview with <a href="https://www.jenkemmag.com/home/2017/01/13/the-oral-history-of-the-tony-hawks-pro-skater/" rel="nofollow ">Jenkem</a>. "It was already fun to play, you didn't have to know how to skate, and the controls were easier to understand."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4376708-thps1%2B2_ss_launch_screenshots_thawk_108_4k_final.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376708" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4376708-thps1%2B2_ss_launch_screenshots_thawk_108_4k_final.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376708"></a><figcaption>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 remastered the classics</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4376708-thps1%2B2_ss_launch_screenshots_thawk_108_4k_final.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Birdman's romp from a Warehouse in California to a secret military facility in Roswell, New Mexico is seen as one of the best skateboarding games of all time for how it captured the culture of skating with its music and style, but another reason Tony Hawk's Pro Skater became such a sensation was because its exploration and platforming are some of the most invigorating in the genre. The simple movement, especially for a release that came just years after Super Mario 64, was as sharp as any other platformer out there.</p><p dir="ltr">"We never wanted you to accidentally do something you didn't want to do. Even if that was cool. We wanted it to do exactly what you were telling it to do," said Tony Hawk's Pro Skater producer Scott Pease in a 2019 <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2019/8/30/20838769/oral-history-tony-hawk-pro-skater-soundtrack-les-claypool-neversoft-activision" rel="nofollow ">interview</a> with The Ringer. "When you actually physically push that button and then you get snapped into that rail, it feels like you're doing something, versus the game kind of playing itself."</p><p dir="ltr">Sure, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is a sports game, and a skateboarding game if you'd categorize that as a whole genre, but its core mechanics set Tony Hawk besides the likes of Mario, Astro Bot, and the Fall Guys. Like any great platformer, the core of the game is about navigating tricky jumps with precision timing, and chaining your movements together into one impeccably smooth line. Like those heroes and their catalog of wild adventures, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater had its fair share of arcade zaniness.</p><p dir="ltr">Grinding across the top of a movie theater's showtime display in Minneapolis and doing an ollie over a cable car in San Francisco were just a couple of things that you'd never see in the real world unless Red Bull set up a stunt for it. Those were simply challenges and fun things to do while riding around in an open space.</p><p dir="ltr">Each of those early parks was a seamless combination of exploration, platforming, and eventually style-themed challenges where each two minute long run provided a different kind of fun. First you'd just explore to get the lay of the land, then you'd try and find all the secrets, and finally you'd find the fastest and most efficient way to collect everything and earn the most points in a level. It was a recipe for replayability.</p><p dir="ltr">Each following game did a little to make their parks feel more alive. Pro Skater 3 brought pedestrians, Pro Skater 4 brought animals, and Underground actually let you get off your board to explore things up close.</p><p dir="ltr">The original <em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</em>, built on the framework of Neversoft's earlier project <em>Apocalypse</em>--which featured Bruce Willis blowing things up--had straightforward movement mechanics. There was a limited set of tricks and the primary way to combine tricks was to grind and wall ride. Later games would improve on this, bringing in the manual, natural ways to combine tricks, and better game development technology that made riding a skateboard in a digital space tighter.</p><p dir="ltr">The combination of fantastic movement and open playgrounds was widely appealing. It made Tony Hawk's Pro Skater a game that almost anyone could jump into. The tricks were important, but the ability to go your own way was the real attraction.</p><p dir="ltr">"A lot of people did say, 'You can't really do that. You can't just make a game that's pure tricks. It's not going to work, no one's done that. It's not real, man, you'd run out of speed.' So we had this big internal debate," Pease said in a separate <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/7/22/5926545/neversoft-tony-hawk-guitar-hero-close" rel="nofollow ">interview</a> with Polygon. "We just started to lean into the natural act of skating in a real environment, going anywhere, exploring, finding your own lines and being creative.”</p><p dir="ltr">The history behind the studios that have made the Tony Hawk Pro Skater series--including the games that would eventually drop the Pro Skater title and the eventual 2020 remaster--have disbanded. Neversoft, the studio behind the 1999 hit, disbanded in 2014. Vicarious Visions, the team behind the 2020 remaster, was folded into other Activision Blizzard teams.</p><p dir="ltr">Even though the team that is behind it is no longer working on the series, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 was a gigantic success. It sold more than a <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/-i-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-1-2-i-sells-1-million-copies-in-less-than-two-weeks" rel="nofollow ">million copies</a> in the span of two weeks. Players have continued to dig into the games create-a-park mode, despite little support for the remasters online modes.</p><p dir="ltr">The love that players--not just skateboarding fans--have for the simple joy of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater gameplay is incredible. They were devastated when reports that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-remake-was-reportedly-rejected-in-favor-of-more-call-of-duty-content/1100-6523189/#:~:text=Tony%20Hawk's%20Pro%20Skater%203,Call%20Of%20Duty%20Content%20-%20GameSpot">remake</a> of the second and third game in the series was rejected in favor of Call of Duty development.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4376709-thps1%2B2_ss_launch_screenshots_thawk_82_4k_final.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376709" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4376709-thps1%2B2_ss_launch_screenshots_thawk_82_4k_final.png" data-ref-id="1300-4376709"></a><figcaption>Hawk grabbing some serious air</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4376709-thps1%2B2_ss_launch_screenshots_thawk_82_4k_final.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Activision has said that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is an "<a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/tony-hawks-pro-skate-25th-anniversary-interview-save-state/" rel="nofollow ">important core</a>" franchise for it today, sparking some hope that more remakes and new games could be in the future. Under new ownership at Microsoft, perhaps it's a franchise that will be revisited. It would be fantastic to see a new game continue to evolve the incredible premise of a skateboarding platformer, but the legacy of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater will forever live alongside Mario.</p><p dir="ltr">"Thanks to Activision, Neversoft (RIP) and all of you that played THPS in those formative years," Tony Hawk said in an Instagram <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DAgXDa1PI8a/" rel="nofollow ">post</a> to commemorate the games 25th anniversary. "I'm not supposed to tease anything else about the future of the series, but there will be a future."</p><p dir="ltr">There is as much demand for fantastic platformers today as there was in 1999 as Astro Bot, Super Mario Odyssey, and even Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2 have shown us. Players, both new and old, would immediately feel right at home on the digital concrete of a new Tony Hawk game, especially if The Birdman is still making sure the game experience lives up to the hype of real-world skateboarding.</p>

I’m dead serious. Games are a form of art—and, in my opinion, one of the most impactful. But if your goal is to create timeless, undying art for future generations to discover, skip this article.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The AI era is here. While doomsday scenarios and tech singularity make for interesting conversations, the real story is how AI is changing the way we create content—just like the Industrial Revolution did for manufacturing. Content is now cheaper, faster, and easier to produce.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this landscape, you have two choices:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Try to produce pixels faster and cheaper than robots.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Become someone who defines what pixels need to be produced, and most importantly, why.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The global entertainment industry is entering a phase where, to maintain at least some control, you must own a cross-media franchise—a fictional universe that can be adapted into commercial entertainment products across multiple media types.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Only 0.1% of companies own cross-media franchises. Another 0.1% can buy them. The remaining 99.8% will have to figure out how to create New IPs with cross-media franchise potential.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Investing in New IP is risky, yes. But the concept of “New IP” itself is often unclear. As a result, we don’t invest in it often enough for patterns to emerge, and when we do, we’re doing it wrong.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">IP stands for Intellectual Property, meaning your tweet, a poem for a loved one, a fantasy book series, a photo, sports performance stats, a video game, a brand mascot, or even a drilling rig design—all fall under this category. However, in the video game and narrative-driven entertainment industries, we often give IP a very specific meaning. Yet, when asked, even industry experts may fumble, mentioning a brand, a cool story, or a bloated production budget with uncertainty. So let me put it straight for you: New IP is a commercial entertainment product designed with the intention to become a cross-media franchise. And that’s what we’ll be talking about here.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s a monumental task to pull off something like a New IP. You and your team will learn a lot and transform along the way. There’s no playbook, but let’s look at the key do’s and don’ts to help navigate your New IP development journey.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>1. In the very beginning, ask yourself what you’ll do if this IP is a success</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. When you develop a new game, you have the odds stacked against you. About 80% of games don’t make it to release. About 19 out of 20 that do release fail or underperform for various reasons. You’ll have to figure that out, but don’t lose sight of the bigger picture. The question that will get you in the right mindset is, what if you succeed? Let me give you an example. You all know the game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Journey</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—a beautiful, iconic indie project that sold millions of copies on multiple platforms. But then what? As a visual commercial entertainment product and as an IP, it’s nothing more than two black triangles over a yellow background. You can’t make a movie or TV series out of that; no comics, books, action figures, or even stickers for messengers. So, don’t find yourself in a situation where all the odds played in your favor, but now you're left with one option: get your act together and make another game—with all the risks associated with it. To avoid that, you need an IP-first mindset. The easiest way to achieve this is to ask yourself from the very beginning: What will I do with it if it succeeds?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>2. Franchise architecture before picking a setting</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Before you start writing lore and going deep into characters, locations, and artifacts, and even before you pick a setting, you need to clearly define the franchise architecture. You need to design the amusement park layout before you pick a theme and start building attractions. If I asked you what the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game of Thrones</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> franchise architecture is, you might say fantasy, dark fantasy, political strategy, episodic structure, or even zombie apocalypse—but those are just the surface. George R.R. Martin used archetypal individual traits like courage, greed, lust, and intellect and applied several modifications to each. For example, courage could be justice-seeking (Starks), bloodthirsty recklessness (Dothraki), or personal gain (Bronn). He then turned these traits into factions represented by characters, creating a system that works like a kaleidoscope: for every instance (scene, chapter, episode, season, storyline), you pick 3-5 of these characters/factions and see how their traits play out. He also applied a constant pressure on the system, called a "main conflict"—for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>GoT</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it was the ancient threat of extinction. This pressure created a perfect "content treadmill." The setting here helps unlock the system’s potential. If you understand franchise architecture, you’ll know exactly what went wrong with Season 8 of the TV adaptation. So start with franchise architecture:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Unit of action</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>GoT</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, this would be character traits. You could use archetypes, species, political systems, galaxies, etc.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Rules of interaction</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>GoT</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, this would be character motivations and capabilities. Define what’s possible in your world.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pressure</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>GoT</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it was a global existential threat. Use the highest-stakes conflict or paradox that cannot be ever resolved.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Experiment with these components. You’ll notice you don’t even need a setting at this stage.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>3. The setting is the reason why people will come</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. When building a New IP, the setting is a strategic choice that helps you unlock your franchise architecture. Some systems work best in realism, others in fantasy, alternative history, or the distant future. The goal is to make your world believable and avoid unconscious disbelief. Hundreds of fantasy blockbusters have taught audiences that dragons are real, while sci-fi has trained them to accept teleportation and time travel. The setting also defines who will be attracted to your IP and what they will expect. If you think, "Everyone uses elves in fantasy, but I’m special so I won’t," read the first paragraph and think again.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The most lucrative segment for cross-media franchises is Geeks. They have literally funded the success of 100 titles from IMDb’s Top 250, 194 of the top 250 Metacritic games, and 138 of the top 200 box office titles. Twelve high-demand settings resonate with this audience: Fantasy, Dark Fantasy, Sci-Fi &amp; Multiverse, Cyberpunk, Heroic Adventure, Urban Legend, Post-Apocalypse, Noir/Dark Detective, Action Blockbuster, Myth-Legend-History, Alternative History, and Anti-Utopia &amp; Social Satire. Pick one, but remember that by doing so, you’ll attract people educated by hundreds of successful titles in that setting. They have a mental bookshelf with the setting’s name, packed with the best examples. Your task is to embed what they love most and add innovation on top.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>4. Experience is the reason why people will stay</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. To get your IP to the market, you need a product. In this case, a game. But before thinking about features or your favorite genre, consider your audience. Look at your franchise architecture and chosen setting, and ask: What’s the best way for people to experience what I’ve envisioned? What do you want them to do and feel? Answering these questions will make choosing a genre a conscious decision and may even inspire meaningful innovation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>5. 1-800-WHO-CARES. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">In 2015, Justin Guarini’s viral tweet said: “Starlord: Galaxy.

The point is, the scale of your world and the problems it addresses are key predictors of adoption and commercial potential. Think of the difference between Lord of the Rings and A Wizard of Earthsea. Both have much in common, but LotR focuses on a larger-than-life struggle between good and evil, while Earthsea is a personal psychological journey. Saving the universe from an evil overlord will always outshine overcoming childhood trauma in Boring, Oregon.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Decision finally made following Star Wars Outlaws disappointment.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft staff asked bosses over the course of several months to delay <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, a new report has claimed, as the need for further time became clear. 
</p>
<p>
"While the announcement was somewhat of a shock publicly, internally, it was expected and desperately needed," <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-context-around-the-assassins-creed-shadows-delay/">Insider Gaming</a> writes, based on the accounts of seven developers working on the project. 
</p>
<p>
The report cites a need for Shadows' developers to be given additional development time to address bugs and better incorporate recent "tweaks" to gameplay mechanics based on playtests and mock reviews (a standard practice where external consultants size-up projects before copies are given to press).
</p>
<p>
Of particular note here is the mention that Ubisoft is taking time to address historical and cultural concerns that have lingered since before the game was publicly revealed and been accelerated since. This includes "changing some of Yasuke's story and how he's portrayed", as well as what sounds like more minor design decisions. 
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft did not respond to Eurogamer's request for comment on the report today. Previously, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-team-acknowledges-elements-that-have-caused-concern-among-japanese-fans">publisher apologised to Japanese fans</a> for elements "that have caused concern" and said Shadows will continue to "evolve" while in development.
</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer previously, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-developer-on-adapting-japanese-culture-social-media-pressures-and-ubisofts-controversial-apology">Assassin's Creed Shadows art director Thierry Dansereau defended the game's creative choices</a>. "It's a video game in the end, so we want to make the best experience as possible for our players," he said.</p>
<p>
Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">ultimately agreed to delay Shadows last month after seeing "softer than expected" sales for Star Wars Outlaws</a>, which has now reportedly just passed the 1m sales mark after launching on 30th August. (<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a> notched up 1.8 million players in a week back in November 2020.)
</p>
<p>
The publisher has also embarked on a bid to improve Shadows - which currently sits with a middling user score on Metacritic and which failed to impress in Eurogamer's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">Star Wars Outlaws</a> review - before its arrival to a wider audience on Steam.
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows will now arrive for PC (including Steam), PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 14th February 2025.

            <p>Development on a follow-up to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lords-of-the-fallen">Lords of the Fallen</a> is fully underway from developer Hexworks, according to the latest <a href="https://cigames.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CI-Games-Strategy-Update-and-Product-Roadmap-2025-2028.pdf">financial report</a> from publisher CI Games.</p>
<p>A few details have been shared in the report, including the game's PC exclusivity with Epic thanks to a major investment - last year's game was one of the earliest to use its Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>The sequel promises gameplay improvements, more game mode options, a "more commercial" art style and narrative, and "elevated production values".</p>

<p>It will also include full shared-progression co-operative multiplayer as well as a single player campaign.</p>
<p>Hexworks is targeting a 2026 release for the game, with more details expected to be revealed next year.</p>
<p>That's not all. CI Games is working on a further two projects over the next few years, both currently in pre-production.</p>
<p>The first, is Project SGW Evolved, the next in the Sniper Ghost Warrior series. It has a targeted release of 2027 and will have strong appeal to both core and wider audiences though its first-person shooter and survival gameplay.</p>
<p>The second is Project H from Underdog Studio, a new action-RPG with shared systems and development architecture with both Lords of the Fallen and its follow-up. It's targeting a 2028 release.</p>
<p>Overall, CI Games is taking a "player-first development approach", focusing on quality over quantity.</p>
<p>Lords of the Fallen has been a success for CI Games, with 72 percent of company revenue in the first half of 2024 generated from that game. By the end of 2023 (the game released in October), it had sold over 1.3m copies.</p>
<p>However, the game launched in a poor state with plenty of performance issues, as outlined in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lords-of-the-fallen-2023-review">Eurogamer's Lords of the Fallen review</a>.</p>
<p>Since then, Hexworks has made myriad improvements, reaching the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lords-of-the-fallen-final-update-introduces-modifiers-for-rogue-lite-challenge">final stage of its free content roadmap</a> in April this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-stabilize-fps-mod-performance-improvements/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom mod brings significant performance improvements even on native hardware capable of running modded games.</p>
<p>The Stabilize FPS mod, which can be downloaded by going <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yuzu/comments/1frejyx/the_legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom_stabilize/">here</a>, comes in two different versions. The first one, aptly called Potato Version, is best used for low-end hardware like the Steam Deck and the actual Nintendo Switch, caps the game's resolution at 576p, allowing the game to run at a smoother framerate. According to the modder, overclocking can lead to a more stable 60 FPS experience. The mod's second version, on the other hand, is best used on powerful machines to achieve smoother and more stable framerates. It can also be used in conjunction with resolution mods to achieve better-looking visuals with smoother performance.</p>
<p>It is a shame that only a few Nintendo Switch users will be able to take advantage of The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Stabilize FPS mod, as a hacked console is required to run mods, but still, it's definitely good to know that some users will be able to enjoy the game on native hardware without the performance issues it is plagued by. While it is more about modernizing the series 2D formula rather than revolutionizing it, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is still a very solid game that all fans of the series will surely enjoy. You can learn more about it by checking out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom brings some new ideas to the table, but in the end, the game is more about modernizing the classic 2D Zelda experience. The attention-grabbing echo copying mechanic has its pros and cons, but where Echoes of Wisdom consistently hits is in the tried-and-true design of its world and dungeons, which are as good as any the franchise has delivered in the past. This may be Zelda's first starring adventure, but past Legends still echo strongly here.</em></p>

<p>Microsoft is sunsetting the production of its HoloLens 2 mixed-reality headset. First reported by <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/microsoft-discontinuing-hololens-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">UploadVR</a>, Microsoft is discontinuing the HoloLens 2, five years after it launched in 2019.</p>



<p>For those that own the headset, it will still receive “update to address critical security issues and software regressions” until December 31, 2027. At that time, all support for the device will stop. </p>



<p>For those with an original HoloLens headset, support for that device ends on December 10, 2024.</p>



<p>As far as the future goes, there are no plans at this time for another HoloLens headset. In 2022, it was first reported by <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-hololens-3-metaverse-mixed-reality-strategy-confusion-rivalries-2022-2?ref=uploadvr.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Business Insider</a> that the HoloLens 3 was cancelled at Microsoft. That was followed by multiple rounds of layoffs in the mixed-reality division of Microsoft in the following years.</p>



<p>Instead, Microsoft will focus on supporting the current device for three more years while also focusing more on software and partnerships. Microsoft has brought its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/meta-quest-adds-xbox-cloud-gaming-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Cloud Gaming service</a> over to Meta’s Quest headsets.</p>



<p>Do you own a HoloLens headset? Let us know your thoughts on the HoloLens 2 being discontinued in the comments below, or in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/francis-coppola-megalopolis-aubrey-plaza<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Francis Ford Coppola’s strange film <em>Megalopolis</em>, which premiered in theaters this weekend, has been extremely divisive. Even if you think you’ll hate it, I think it’s worth seeing. It’s a spectacle that might be the last of its kind.</p><p>I truly don’t think that <em>Megalopolis </em>is all that difficult to understand, but the promotional materials are also not very explanatory, and the film sort of dumps you in without much of an explanation. This is a story about Cesar Catilina (Adam Driver), the head of the city of New Rome’s “Design Authority” and an architect who has recently won a Nobel Prize and gained the power to stop time. The fact that he can stop time is not that big of a deal. As the inventor of the new building material called Megalon, he’s been battling Franklin Cicero (Giancarlo Esposito), the mayor of New Rome, to build his Megalopolis, which he envisions as a utopia, in the middle of New Rome. Their relationship continues to degrade as Cicero’s daughter, Julia Cicero (Nathalie Emmanuel), becomes Catilina’s apprentice.</p><p>Further dragging Catilina down are the Pulcher siblings, Clodio (Shia LaBeouf) and his sisters Clodia, Claudette and Claudine, who are wealthy socialites whom the film repeatedly emphasizes are sleeping with each other. Clodio, Catilina’s cousin, sees him as a rival for the inheritance of their banker uncle, Hamilton Crassus III (Jon Voight). Crassus has also recently married Catilino’s former mistress, Wow Platinum (Aubrey Plaza), who is desperately scrabbling for some form of power.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Megalopolis (2024) Official Trailer - Adam Driver, Giancarlo Esposito, Nathalie Emmanuel" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pq6mvHZU0fc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The movie does have a pretty straightforward plot, but it is mostly about Caesar and Cicero’s circular arguments about what makes a utopia and whether it is worth striving for. But there’s also many tangents: There’s a thirty minute subplot about a pop star embroiled in a sex scandal that features two full songs and is totally irrelevant to the plot. For every twenty minute sequence where Caesar and Julia talk about art and society and fall in love, there was a plot development that made me mutter “what the fuck is happening.” There's a gladiatorial carriage race in Madison Square Garden.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s baffling to watch, but I admire its earnestness and its ambition. If nothing else, it’s a movie worth seeing for an absolutely committed performance from Aubrey Plaza, who plays Wow Platinum like a caged lion. This movie made me truly believe that Plaza is one of the best actresses of her generation.</p><p>This is clearly an old man’s last great message to the world (it ends with a pledge of allegiance to humanity; it is not a subtle film). It’s a kind of big budget movie that hardly gets made anymore, and for reasons that are obvious: Coppola self financed <em>Megalopolis</em> to the tune of $120 million, and it earned $4 million over the weekend. Even while budgets for blockbuster films balloon—<em>Deadpool and Wolverine</em> had a budget of $200 million—the money available for anything outside the mainstream has shrunk. While I’m lucky enough to live in New York, where everything hits theaters for at least a couple of days, even crowd pleasers like Best Picture winner <em>Everything, Everywhere, All At Once</em> <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/everyone-is-seeing-everything-everywhere-all-at-once/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had to scrape its way into a wide release</a>.</p><figure><figcaption>Megalopolis. Photo Credit: Courtesy of Lionsgate</figcaption></figure><p>In a move that has made the fandom-brained mad at him for years, Martin Scorsese pointed out the unfortunate dwindling landscape for movies in an op-ed for the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/04/opinion/martin-scorsese-marvel.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">New York Times</a> in 2019.</p><p>“Why not just let superhero films and other franchise films be? The reason is simple. In many places around this country and around the world, franchise films are now your primary choice if you want to see something on the big screen. It’s a perilous time in film exhibition, and there are fewer independent theaters than ever,” he wrote. “The equation has flipped and streaming has become the primary delivery system. Still, I don’t know a single filmmaker who doesn’t want to design films for the big screen, to be projected before audiences in theaters.”</p><p>Francis Ford Coppola comes from the same cohort as Scorsese, and is from a generation of filmmakers for whom showing their movies in a theater was a foregone conclusion. While Scorsese has had a few of his films financed by Netflix—films I wish I could have seen in a theater—Coppola has been disillusioned by the studio system entirely, opting instead to sell a portion of his vineyard to self finance this bizarre film.</p><figure><figcaption>Aubrey Plaza as Wow Platinum in Megalopolis. Photo Credit: Courtesy of Lionsgate</figcaption></figure><p>Like Catilina, Coppola is someone who experienced a lot of success early. While Catilina ends <em>Megalopolis</em> empowered to make his utopia a reality, Coppola has lived in the shadow of his explosive early works like <em>The Godfather</em> and <em>Apocalypse Now</em>. As his work got more personal and more experimental, audiences recoiled. The only reason why <em>The Godfather III</em> exists is because Coppola’s passion project <em>One From the Heart</em> tanked, leaving Coppola in debt. As the years went on, he became less and less interested in making movies in order to make money; instead, he’s been grasping towards some ideal of cinema itself, a process that involves telling Aubrey Plaza “<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/29/movies/aubrey-plaza-megalopolis-my-old-ass-agatha-all-along.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In the next take, you’re a spider</a>.” He is a kind of filmmaker who comes to set without fully formed ideas, asking his actors to improvise the movie along with him as he goes. At this point in time, studios seem especially unwilling to finance a hundred million dollar experiment. In order to get <em>Megalopolis </em>made and shown in a theater as it was intended to be seen, you kind of just have to be Francis Ford Coppola, and there’s only one of him.</p><p>It’s probably really good that we no longer let young men go to <a href="https://variety.com/2019/vintage/features/apocalypse-now-production-1203309358/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">warzones to shoot movies in grueling productions that last over a year</a>; one of the flaws of auteur theory is that it valorizes the idea of a “great man” who is enabled to hurt other people in the name of great art. I’m glad that that style of filmmaking is widely extinct, but I also long for the kind of art that level of freedom over a production creates. If <em>Megalopolis</em> is the last peek into the mind of this weird crank, then it’s a lovely send off. I doubt I’ll ever see anything like it ever again.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>We are in a golden age for indie horror right now. Titles like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/03/crow-country-review-scream-park-fun/">Crow Country</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/04/signalis-review/">Signalis</a>, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/12/hollowbody-review/">HollowBody</a> have taken the genre into new directions whilst clearly showing reverence for the games that inspired them. In an era of flashy remakes and increasing focus on graphical fidelity it is nice to have games that concentrate on the looks and feel of the PS1 classics. The latest entry in this field is Becrowned, a true retro survival horror that more than borrows from Konami’s Silent Hill series.</p>
<p><iframe title="Becrowned – Official First Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Er73I15tbls?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The central protagonist is a man named Richard Torrance, but with he demo starting <em>in media res</em> rather than being the opening section of the game, there’s not much more to say about him than that. The Steam page describes him as a ‘man of strong will and unbreakable character’ which sounds like the beginning of a hubristic journey to me. There seems to be some kind of Dante-esque story with definite themes of punishment and regret which has always worked for the more psychologically infused Silent Hill over the action focus of Resident Evil.</p>


<p>That being said, there is plenty of combat included in the Becrowned demo, including a familiar feeling boss fight. The sense of familiarity is exacerbated by the demo being set in a hospital, further bringing it into direct comparison with its predecessors. The staccato movement of the enemies and their inhuman appearances are straight out of the Masahiro Ito playbook and fit right into the dark and grimy environments. You find both melee weapons and guns to fight off these foes but ammo is limited – although not as severely so as in some other games.</p>


<p>There doesn’t seem to be inventory management at play here, which seems to be a common shift in the current generation of indie horror. I can see the generic appeal of juggling items but it isn’t something I miss when games remove the limitation. Puzzles involve finding items and unlocking blocked areas with a couple of really well designed examples in the demo. One puzzle in particular requires you to interpret a poem in order to rearrange a bookshelf filled with Gothic classics – not surprisingly, as an English Literature lecturer this felt laser targeted to my interests.</p>
<p>Graphically, Becrowned looks suitably dingy and hellish, although the devs have shared some more expansive and open environments on social media, so there may be a welcome variety in the full game. Most of the demo takes place in very tight corridors but it is possible to dodge enemies in traditional survival horror fashion. The retro aesthetic is further achieved through a VHS-esque filter that gives the grainy effect that we know and love. Sound effects are creepy and atmospheric with unpleasant slapping footsteps and inhuman screams.</p>

<p>While my experience with the game was a positive one, there are some notes of caution to raise. Rather than being loosely inspired by Silent Hill, Becrowned currently needs to find more of an identity of its own. HollowBody managed this through the futuristic British urban setting and I’m keen to find out how 13th Street Studio will push this incredibly solid foundation into something that stands on its own merits. The reliance on radio static and the hospital setting feels like an overzealous tribute to Konami’s series. Running felt a little clumsy at times and there seems to be an overly punishing stamina system in place which makes dodging through groups of enemies a little hit and miss. There are also some balancing issues to work through, especially with one enemy having a spit attack with an overpowered range and damage, whilst the boss fight could benefit from a little more signposting (and possibly not being a one-hit kill).</p>
<p>I enjoyed my time playing through the demo a couple times. The first time I took my time to fully explore and think through the puzzles whilst trying to collect every item I could, whilst the second was more of a speed run. The latter is helped by the puzzle solutions being static rather than randomised so you can sequence break to some extent by opening coded doors out of order – doing so too liberally will result in you not gaining the essential firepower you’ll need for the boss fight though.</p>
<p>Becrowned truly captures the essence of classic Silent Hill and will make for a really interesting comparison to the Bloober Team remake coming out soon. With a little more confidence in finding its own identity it could even look to compete with these classics.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/this-was-one-of-the-rare-opportunities-says-krafton-regarding-tango-gameworks-acquistion/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's been a short time since the South Korean publisher Krafton decided to save Tango Gameworks, acquiring the studio in August after Microsoft decided to shutter it just a few months prior. While Krafton has acquired Tango Gameworks, the only IP they acquired along with it was Hi-Fi Rush, which happened to be a BAFTA-winning rhythm game that reached three million players. The decision to shutter Tango Gameworks came as a huge surprise to many, especially after making a game as successful as Hi-Fi Rush. Tango Gameworks is also responsible for The Evil Within and Ghostwire: Tokyo, but unfortunately, those IPs were not acquired by Krafton.</p>
<p>Krafton now has a dozen studios under its belt, which includes Bluehole Studio, Neon Giant, PUBG Studios and now, Tango Gameworks as it's 13th acquisition. However, they aren't planning to stop there with acquisitions, and want to continue to expand their library.</p>
<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/we-dont-want-to-just-replicate-successful-games-behind-kraftons-acquisition-of-tango-gameworks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussion with GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Maria Park, the head of Corporate Development over at Krafton it was explained how the acquisition came to be and what it meant for Krafton as well as for Tango Gameworks.&nbsp; Park explains that in an attempt to diversify their portfolio, they have met with 200 to 300 studios in the last quarter alone in an attempt to find new developers to invest in. As a result, this led to the acquisition of Tango Gameworks, where they immediately flew over to Tokyo to meet with Tango.</p>
<p>While with most acquisitions, a lot of the staff are either axed or left of their own free will, Krafton has made efforts to keep on as many of the pre-existing staff from the company as possible. Out of 100 Tango employees, at least 70 to 80 are moving over to work at Krafton, with some of the positions being backfilled. However, they expect that the numbers will end up at around 100 by the end of the year or the beginning of 2025.</p>
<p>In the interview, it's stated that Tango was <a href="https://wccftech.com/we-dont-think-hi-fi-rush-2-is-going-to-make-us-money-says-krafton-ceo/">already working on Hi-Fi Rush 2</a> by the time Krafton started talking with them. When it came to getting the IP from Microsoft, they were surprised that they were lucky enough to obtain it. "We spoke with Phil Spencer directly, and we have their direct support. He has been incredibly accommodating to the needs of the Tango team."</p>
<p>Park states that they have been doing thorough research into the Japanese market for a year. "It was hard to find small to medium-sized studios who are in pursuit of their own titles. a lot of them were work-for-hire studios. This was one of the rare opportunities."</p>
<p>As a result, acquiring Tango is the first significant investment in the Japanese video game market, and they are making sure to be cautious. "We'll continue to pursue opportunities in the Japanese market for sure, but it's not like we'll be actively investing in a high number of studios over a short period. Yes, there'll be more to come for sure."</p>
<p>While the acquisition has taken a while, most of the team from Tango was onboarded in early August, and Krafton were talking to Microsoft once or twice a week during August to make sure that the acquisition went smoothly.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/devolver-big-fan-games-licensed-indies<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Devolver Digital has announced a brand new publishing wing called Big Fan Games, which is dedicated to publishing indie games based on existing licenses.</p>
<p>In a press release, Big Fan says that it thinks there's "room for a new approach" when it comes to licensed games. The studio says its goal is to give indie studios the chance to "make the call", take risks, and explore unique game ideas that "aren't dictated by spreadsheets".</p>
<p>The publishing label will be staffed by a "small but passionate team of industry veterans" with experience working with intellectual properties like&nbsp;<em>Dune</em>,&nbsp;<em>Hellboy</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Lord of the Rings</em>, and&nbsp;<em>John Wick</em>, among others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hellboy-web-of-wyrd-big-fan-games.jpg?itok=UR11cj8P 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hellboy-web-of-wyrd-big-fan-games.jpg?itok=-ypaxQHH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Big Fan Games is now the retroactive publisher for&nbsp;<em>Hellboy: Web of Wyrd</em>, among other games.</figcaption></figure><p>Per <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/devolver-launches-big-fan-games-a-publishing-label-dedicated-to-movie-tv-and-comic-book-adaptations" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an interview with GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Big Fan currently has "six active projects in development", although the studio is tight-lipped about what those projects are and what they're based on.</p>
<p>The studio says its aim is to release around four or five games a year, and it's also taking suggestions from indie developers and studios regarding licensed projects they might be working on.</p>
<p>Retroactively, the publishing label has also claimed a number of games previously published by fellow Devolver subsidiary Good Shepherd, including&nbsp;<em>Hellboy: Web of Wyrd</em>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/john-wick-hex"><em>John Wick Hex</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em>Reigns: Game of Thrones</em>.</p>
<p>Judging by a <a href="https://www.bigfangames.com/news/big-fan-working-in-partnership-with-rebellion-to-create-games-based-on-the-iconic-2000-ad-universe-copy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">rather strange official announcement</a>, it's also apparent that Big Fan is now the publishing label that will be working alongside Rebellion to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/good-shepherd-rebellion-2000-ad">create a game based in the&nbsp;<em>2000 AD&nbsp;</em>universe</a>, best known for authoritarian anti-hero Judge Dredd.</p>

<p>Given that we don't currently know what projects are in the works at the studio (except for the aforementioned <em>2000 AD&nbsp;</em>game, of course), it's difficult to guess whether or not that's true, but stay tuned to find out more about what Big Fan is up to.</p>

Even so, through some magical mumbo jumbo, Basim ends up alive in the game’s modern-day segments, and his plans are one of the major cliffhangers at the end of the game. <em>Mirage </em>was originally going to be an expansion for <em>Valhalla</em>, but after Ubisoft spun it out into its own game, Basim got to be the star of a mainline <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>title.</p><p>While the <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>series has turned into an open-world RPG series, <em>Mirage </em>is considered a “back to basics” for the franchise.

Developer Saber Interactive worked closely with Games Workshop over Space Marine 2’s four-year development to ensure it was as authentic as possible, right down to the nuts and bolts of a Space Marine’s armor.</p><p>Speaking to IGN, Saber Interactive Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits discussed its working relationship with Games Workshop, and some of the challenges it faced ensuring Space Marine 2 passed all those lore checks.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2 Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>“Let me give you an example,” Willits began, “the ankle armor we had, the ankle armor was the wrong size and they told us that the ankle armor was wrong.”</p><p>It’s a funny problem to fix, but building a virtual Space Marine was no mean feat. After all, Space Marines were introduced in 1987 with nary a thought for how they might be made to work on a video game battlefield.</p><p>“45 years ago when the guy that made the little Space Marine that sat on the table, he probably was not imagining them animating in a video game 45 years later,” Willits said. “And let me tell you, that was hard to make it. I mean, when you walk and run and fight as Titus, it feels so good. But you've seen people cosplay as a Space Marine, right? They can't even walk down a hallway without falling.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We had to adjust things and we pushed them a little bit.</p></div><p>Digging into the details of the process of working with Games Workshop, Willits revealed the Warhammer 40,000 custodian has a system that runs content and assets created by licensees through an approval process, then dedicated staff at Games Workshop work with those licensees to offer feedback.</p><p>“They will help steer,” Willits explained. “And even when we're coming up with Tyranid attacks, they're like, oh, that Tyranid doesn't really attack like that, or that Chaos Marine, you can't really have him do that.

Willits said he understood why Games Workshop is so protective over Warhammer 40,000, even if it can sometimes cause a slight headache for other companies working with the license. </p><p>“They are very protective,” he said. “But you have to be. When you have a universe as big as Games Workshop has with Warhammer, you have to protect it like it's your baby, because it is.

To many, he <em>is</em> Nintendo. But on the eve of Tokyo Game Show, he’s talking about the most “un-Nintendo-like” thing the company has ever created. </p><p>“You could say that we’re sort of doing something that we are not supposed to do,” Miyamoto reveals. “If [ex-president of Nintendo Hiroshi] Yamauchi would hear this, I think he would tell us to stop immediately!”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/01/img-3704-m2va-1727783597767.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Surprisingly, he is talking about the newly opened Nintendo Museum, a two-storey interactive celebration of everything Nintendo, situated in Kyoto, Japan, where the company was founded. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-museum-in-person-preview"><u>IGN visited the museum recently</u></a> and, just like Nintendo, it’s a place where fun is at the heart of everything.</p><p>“We wanted to do something appropriate to our identity,” says Miyamoto, talking about how Nintendo always has a certain way of doing things. Previously, the company always shied away from talking about its past. With the gaming landscape constantly changing, though, it decided now was the time to celebrate all of its achievements… but only if it felt authentically Nintendo.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Nintendo Museum Slideshow</h3></div></output><p>“Nintendo is a company that connects with its consumers through products,” Miyamoto explains. “We do not promote the company itself, only the products. We might be talking about how old Mario has turned but we don’t talk about how many units a certain game has sold. That’s what Nintendo has traditionally been doing, but the environment has changed and we started to revisit that thought.”</p><p>That’s not to say the Nintendo Museum is a mecca that only celebrates Nintendo’s commercial success. In fact it’s nothing like that. But from the decades of history on display, it’s clear to see that only one thing really matters to Nintendo – the games.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/01/img-9640-1727782315234.JPG" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Who doesn't want a giant, cuddly N64 controller?!</figcaption></figure></output><p>“I feel that the only way to connect and communicate with the consumer is through the product,” Miyamoto says. It’s a position that echoes the thoughts of the ex-Nintendo president Horishi Yamauchi, who ran the company for over 50 years and was responsible for turning it into the global entertainment success it is today. “Yamauchi used to say that a lot of companies put a lot of effort and resources into sales to make sure that the product is advertised well so that it reaches greater sales”, says Miyamoto. “However, Yamauchi’s own philosophy was the opposite. He believed that if you need to over-advertise something to sell, not selling it at all is better.”</p><p>A museum that showcases the story of the company behind the games and consoles is almost antithetical to this philosophy of ‘show not tell’, so it’s no wonder Miyamoto thinks his old boss might not be in favor of the project if he were still alive today. But since its founding in 1889, Nintendo’s century old history has begun to pile up. Perhaps sensing its own age, the idea came to turn an old Nintendo factory into its first ever museum. “Nintendo has a lot of material that we have accumulated over the years. Some of that is deteriorating and some of it has been thrown away,” Miyamoto explains. “Over the years, we started to realize the importance of preserving these materials.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A lot of companies put a lot of effort into sales to make sure a product is advertised well so it reaches greater sales. But [ex-Nintendo president Horishi] Yamauchi's own philosophy was that if you need to over-advertise something to sell, not selling it at all is better</p></div><p>The preservation extends to the building itself, too, and Miyamoto “thought that it would be very Nintendo-like to not have a flashy museum but to simply repurpose this building and this land that we had as an effort to store and preserve the products that we have made in the past.”</p><p>Rather than simply tell a straight historical story that stretches from 1889 to today, Nintendo enlisted the help of its various technicians, employees “with various knowledge and interests that go beyond just video games,” to create a museum that only Nintendo could imagine.</p><p>The result is an experience unlike any other. During our tour we saw exhibitions that tell the story of Nintendo through interactive experiences, like large-scale Nintendo game controllers that can be used to play games with a friend, or a station where guests can create their own Hanafuda cards, the Japanese playing cards etched into Nintendo lore. It has more in common with a theme park than a traditional museum, and just as interactivity is central to Nintendo’s history as an entertainment company, it’s also central to the Nintendo Museum.</p><p>“I had never created a museum so it was quite a different experience for me,” Miyamoto recalls. “But from the midway point we were constantly making iterations and fixes, which felt very similar to making video games.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Nintendo Museum Merch</h3></div></output><p>One of the takeaways we had following our visit to the museum is that, ironically, there’s very little history in this celebration of the past. While the interactive exhibits highlight Nintendo’s ability to inject fun and gameplay into anything from amusement parks and movies to LEGO toys, there were too few exhibits that peeled back the curtain on how Nintendo created some of our favorite games or consoles. Miyamoto says this is partly by design, but also something that will change in the future.</p><p>“Every year we have about a hundred or two hundred new employees that join our company and I have a talk of over two hours with them to explain what kind of company we are,” Miyamoto says. “However, after 20 years, I don’t really look forward to doing that same talk again next year anymore.”</p><p>The museum, therefore, is meant to give employees – and visitors – a version of Miyamoto’s talk, designed to be accessible by everyone: “If we were going to tell our employees what kind of company Nintendo is, we thought it might be good to share that with the public as well.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Like Nintendo itself, the museum is something that will evolve over time. What it looks like next year might be very different from what it is today. “We are currently in the process of planning next steps in what to include for the future,” Miyamoto reveals. “Initially the museum was based on the fact that we were only going to exhibit products. But when I put myself in the customer’s perspective, I do want to see at least a little bit of stuff from behind the curtains.”</p><p>Miyamoto points out that the Nintendo Museum currently has prototypes for controllers and consoles that have never been seen before, nor can they be seen anywhere else. There are also plans to exhibit artworks and rarities from its games, and Miyamoto suggests that, after making 10 movies or so, maybe Nintendo could even add a movie theater to the museum.</p><p> Nintendo currently has no plans to set up other museums around the world, so if you want to experience “the most un-Nintendo-like” creation the company has ever made, you’ll need to visit the Nintendo Museum in Kyoto. When asked if he has a particular favorite exhibit, Miyamoto says it’s the section dedicated to the Nintendo Wii, the company’s 2006 motion controller-based console: “The Wii is special to me. At the time, I and [former Nintendo president Satoru] Iwata felt that games were becoming something specifically for gamers and we wanted to change that by creating something that could be experienced by anybody. That was the driving force behind the Wii, and it was something that we were kind of able to actually accomplish. Looking at the photos of families playing together, it makes me happy to think that the population of people that play games increased because of the Wii.”</p><p><em>Matt Kim is IGN's Senior Features Editor.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/poppy-playtime">Poppy Playtime</a> Chapter 4 will arrive in January and promises to be the most terrifying chapter yet, obviously.</p>
<p>Though previous chapters are available on consoles too, this fourth chapter has so far only been announced for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3008670/Poppy_Playtime__Chapter_4/">Steam</a> where pre-orders are now live.</p>
<p>The third chapter was the largest to date, but developer Mob Entertainment is making Chapter Four the darkest and most intense yet, with new levels and characters and "unexpected twists" to expand on franchise lore.</p>

<p>"As we continue the epic story of Poppy Playtime, our lore goes deeper, introducing both helpful and harmful characters, greater risks as players uncover more of Playtime Co., and more extreme horror elements that create new scenarios players must survive making Chapter Four the scariest of the franchise," said Seth Belanger co-founder and CCO of Mob Entertainment.</p>
<p>"We've really pushed the boundaries with this chapter in terms of making the lore even darker and the environments more dangerous. Simply exploring these locations will give you goosebumps.</p>
<p>"Our team has poured a lot into crafting an experience that is as terrifying as it is engaging, and we can't wait for players to get their hands on it."</p>
<p>Co-founder Zach Belanger added: "We're excited to introduce new, spine-chilling characters and environments that expand on our ever-evolving story, while also delivering the biggest shocks and thrills in the series yet."</p>
<p>Last month, Mob Entertainment released the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtimes-second-and-third-chapters-will-arrive-on-xbox-later-this-month">second and third chapters of Poppy Playtime on Xbox</a>, matching the PC release.</p>
<p>The first chapter is available on PS4, PS5, and Switch, with the remaining two yet to follow.</p>
<p>Collectively, Poppy Playtime has become a hugely successful horror franchise, following the antics of scary toys like Huggy Wuggy, Mommy Long Legs, and CatNap.</p>
<p>Further, earlier this year the studio announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/poppy-playtime-the-cult-horror-game-is-getting-a-film-adaptation">Poppy Playtime film adaptation is in the works</a> with Legendary Entertainment and Angry Films.</p>
<p>"This movie deal is a great logical next step in the growth of our transmedia entertainment company," said the co-founders at the time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
