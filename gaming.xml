			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a> cracked the top 10 list of the most-played games in the US during its launch week, according to Circana's executive director and video game industry analyst Mat Piscatella.</p>
<p>Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lnd7qpxrns27">reported</a> the list of the top 15 games in terms of player engagement for the week of April 12, 2025, which is the week that South of Midnight officially launched. The top 10, even top 15 games regarding player engagement, are usually a very predictable list.</p>
<p>Just think of the most popular live service titles; you'll see most of them on the list. So, for a brand-new single-player game, not based on any existing series, to crack the top 10 is a strong showing.</p>
<p>It didn't crack the top sales list, but with South of Midnight launching into Xbox Game Pass, player engagement was always going to be the more important metric to look at. For Compulsion Games, it's great that so many players were willing to take a chance on South of Midnight and check it out.</p>
<p>The rest of the list includes Marvel Rivals, Call of Duty, Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox, Grand Theft Auto V, EA Sports College Football 25, NBA 2K25 and Rainbow Six Siege. All of them are major live service titles you'll commonly see on lists tracking player engagement.</p>
<p>Of the top 15, the only other single-player game included is Assassin's Creed: Shadows, which came in at number 11, while South of Midnight eked into the top 10 at number 9.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see how Xbox responds now, because Hi-Fi Rush also launched with strong engagement and positive responses from players and critics. <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/">Tango Gameworks</a> was still shuttered by Xbox before being brought back to life by <a href="https://wccftech.com/tango-gameworks-lives-again-thanks-to-krafton/">Krafton</a>. Hopefully, Compulsion will continue to get strong support from Xbox instead of suffering the same fate as Tango.</p>

That was just one example of the nightmares <em>Psychonauts—</em>Double Fine’s magnum opus—went through on its path to becoming one of the most beloved games of all time. It’s now 20 years since its official U.S. release, and that deserves celebration.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195891" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Alan Wake 2" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="156" data-playlist="195891,196307,196470" data-current="195891"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Alan Wake 2</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195891/195891_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21406.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>You can immediately see why <em>Psychonauts</em> might have struggled to convince a publisher. This was Double Fine, a company that was only famous for being the place where Tim Schafer—the guy who wrote the adventure game classics <em>Full Throttle</em> and <em>Grim Fandango—</em>worked after leaving LucasArts. Obviously everyone was expecting DF to be an adventure game studio, and somehow their first project was...a third-person platformer? But one where you had to solve puzzles, and it was story-led, and it was also a collectathon, but there were psychic abilities, and missions about dealing with complex trauma, and half the game wasn’t platforming but chatting with other characters...Microsoft, originally intended to be the publisher for an Xbox exclusive, never got it. </p><p>Microsoft’s feedback after focus group testing described the game’s storyline as “unoriginal, childish and overly complicated,” which are quite the most extraordinary descriptions of a game that was defiantly unique and surprisingly mature. The document went on to say, “Humor should be simplified and made immediately apparent.” And then it suggested the game set in a summer camp where hero Raz helps the staff and inhabitants of the summer camp, in a summer-camp-themed story, not be set in a summer camp.</p><p>Later entirely dropped by Microsoft, it was eventually picked up by publisher Majesco, with some stealth funding from <em>SimCity</em> legend Will Wright, and did manage to be completed. (It’s worth adding here that there’s a lot of romanticizing of this period and its triumphant tale of the plucky indie developer making good, but the reality is a swathe of people were fired, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/classic-postmortem-double-fine-s-i-psychonauts-i-&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/classic-postmortem-double-fine-s-i-psychonauts-i-" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the remaining employees were crunched for months</a></span>.)</p><p>International publishing was another matter, and entirely lost in these various post-mortems is how THQ screwed things up even further. At the time in the UK, a full-blown advertising campaign was launched, review code sent out to magazines and websites, and then the game pulled at the eleventh hour. As I mentioned at the start, back in 2005 <em>PC Gamer</em> had run a large, very positive review, and had it not been the same issue that reviewed <em>GTA San Andreas</em>, it could have been on the cover. And then...it didn’t come out.</p><p>In fact, it wouldn’t come out for over half a year, then with no advertising or promotion at all, and stores I visited spoke of not being able to get stock. It just couldn’t catch a break. Majesco went on to take a loss in its year of release, and the game didn’t manage to sell 100,000 copies by the end of 2005. It was a flop.</p><figure id="" data-id="02c6ac35a5fb06f81b9763d825444483" data-recommend-id="image://02c6ac35a5fb06f81b9763d825444483" data-format="jpg" data-width="1274" data-height="717" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Raz on the game board in the Napoleon level." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Raz on the game board in the Napoleon level." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Double Fine / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="02c6ac35a5fb06f81b9763d825444483" data-recommend-id="image://02c6ac35a5fb06f81b9763d825444483" data-format="jpg" data-width="1274" data-height="717" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Raz on the game board in the Napoleon level." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Except, it wasn’t. Not after a bit. In 2015, Double Fine pulled out all the stops to celebrate the ten-year anniversary of <em>Psychonauts</em>, releasing yet another documentary, this time just about its development (you can see the first episode above), at which time Schafer revealed that the game had sold 1.7 million copies. More extraordinarily, 1.2 million of those copies were sold after Double Fine had managed to secure back the rights to the game in 2011. It was a game that would see a new burst of sales with each milestone in PC gaming, from the opening up of Steam to external publishers to the phenomenon of Humble Bundles.</p><p>And, importantly, it’s a game that absolutely merits all this attention and love. <em>Psychonauts</em> absolutely captured the wit and personality that had made LucasArts adventure games so great, and applied them to a very different setting. I stood by (and stand by) holding back from giving <em>Psychonauts</em> a 90+ percent score (even when the review was re-printed eight months later when it finally came out in the UK, by which time I received a lot of flak), because its platforming fell short of tipping over into that esteemed territory, but it’s a game that I wish everyone would play.</p><figure id="" data-id="739d28d153ae4d3b3247230151959e66" data-recommend-id="image://739d28d153ae4d3b3247230151959e66" data-format="jpg" data-width="1272" data-height="716" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ford Cruller looks at Raz, his finger on his cheek." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ford Cruller looks at Raz, his finger on his cheek." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Double Fine / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="739d28d153ae4d3b3247230151959e66" data-recommend-id="image://739d28d153ae4d3b3247230151959e66" data-format="jpg" data-width="1272" data-height="716" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Ford Cruller looks at Raz, his finger on his cheek." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Ask anyone who has, and they’ll immediately want to describe to you their favorite level (which is to say, their favorite brain into which they ventured). Many will say the Milkman Conspiracy level, which explored a character’s psychosis with the most incredible combination of wit and tenderness. Others will bring up the bull running sequence, with its amazing use of paintings and its equally amazing, unique art style. I will tell you it’s the guy with the Napoleon complex, because oh my goodness, there is so much that’s so smart in there.</p><p>But honestly, my favorite parts are between the levels, roaming the camp and talking to the other characters, finding the little secrets, or overhearing the gossip. So much of it is so loving, so respectful of its bonkers little people, and I managed to appreciate all this despite living in a country where summer camps aren’t a thing. Take <em>that</em>, 2003 Microsoft. (It’s certainly of some irony that Microsoft now entirely owns Double Fine.) It’s one of those games where you want to seek out every tiny detail so you can discover every single line written by Schafer and Erik Wolpaw.</p><figure id="" data-id="7faee3e3f47e5ed0654fdbaecfdf930b" data-recommend-id="image://7faee3e3f47e5ed0654fdbaecfdf930b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's a little Napoleon, standing on a chair, holding a sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="It's a little Napoleon, standing on a chair, holding a sword." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Double Fine / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7faee3e3f47e5ed0654fdbaecfdf930b" data-recommend-id="image://7faee3e3f47e5ed0654fdbaecfdf930b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's a little Napoleon, standing on a chair, holding a sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For the rest of this week, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3830/Psychonauts/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3830/Psychonauts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can pick up a copy of <em>Psychonauts</em> on Steam for a wildly tiny 89c</a></span>, and if you never have, or haven’t since you played it on Xbox 20 years ago, I really recommend that you do. Few games have this much heart, and deliver so much fun. (It’s also good to see the massively expensive, four-year-old sequel <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/607080/Psychonauts_2/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/607080/Psychonauts_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Psychonauts 2</em> is available this week at a price games that old should be: $15</a></span>.)</p><p>Double Fine seems to have dug its arms far down the backs of its couches to find even more nuggets and unrevealed details about <em>Psychonauts</em> for the rest of the week, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.doublefine.com/news/20-psychedelic-years&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.doublefine.com/news/20-psychedelic-years" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which will be appearing here</a></span>. I’m just going to sit back and reminisce, trying not to sniffle when I remember that moment of absolute gut-punching horror and sadness hidden within Agent Milla’s memories.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The trailer also shows off some of the story for the game, which serves as a prequel to 2016's Doom.</p><p>One of the fascinating things about Doom is that its protagonist has remained the same throughout the original trilogy of Doom games through to the 2016 game and its sequel, Doom Eternal, but there is a period of his history that has remained unexplored. Doom: The Dark Ages looks like it'll fill in the gaps, as the trailer provides a glimpse of Argent D'Nur and how the Doom Slayer--who was enslaved by the Maykrs after his trip to Hell--becomes a living legend on that world.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1746371816" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-10-2025-steam-confirmed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Battlestate Games has announced that its extraction shooter&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>will hit its 1.0 release sometime this year, and that a Steam version of the game is also planned, although we don't know when that's coming.</p>

<p>In a livestream held over the weekend (with a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-2025-roadmap-1-0-steam-release-final-map-and-questline.1168725/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">handy summary</a> by the wonderfully-named ResetEra user Saucycarpdog), Battlestate confirms that&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>1.0 is coming in 2025, and that a Steam version is coming after that release.</p>

<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-arena-finally-revealed-by-battlestate" rel="nofollow">spinoff game</a>&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov: Arena&nbsp;</em>will also be arriving on Steam, and that one is due to land on Valve's platform before the big 1.0 release of the main game. Again, though, no concrete release dates or windows were announced.</p>

The first, in May, will bring a number of optimizations and improvements, while the second is due in June, bringing more gameplay tweaks and improvements to audio.</p>

<p>July's update will bring revamped gunshots for both players and AI opponents (that's CPU enemies, not generative AI), while August's patch will optimize the Interchange location and bring a new event with it.</p>

<p>All of this means that the 1.0 release probably won't arrive before September at the very earliest, and that's assuming it doesn't get delayed. Hopefully, though, we'll see&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>leave the murky confines of its closed beta before the year is through.</p>

<p>The PvE mode, which was the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-unheard-edition-backlash" rel="nofollow">subject</a> of some <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/escape-from-tarkov-pve-eod-free" rel="nofollow">controversy</a> back when it was first being discussed, will apparently also be coming to Steam after&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov</em>'s 1.0 release, and it'll be getting just one wipe before launch to level the playing field.</p>

Heck, even <em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>and <em>Dark Souls&nbsp;</em>developer FromSoftware is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2" rel="nofollow">getting in on the action</a>.</p>

<p>For now, though, you can pick up&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov: Arena&nbsp;</em>on PC via the games' <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official website</a>.</p>

But although the team has put out several games in just under a decade, none of them have quite felt like a collaborative effort bearing the distinct creative fingerprints of both creators, until now. <em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy </em>may not be a death game like the duo’s previous work, but the tactical RPG is still overflowing with both Kodaka and Uchikoshi’s signature twists, turns, over-the-top characters, and bold design elements that have made each of their works memorable.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196572,196411" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I’m about 30 hours into <em>The Hundred Line</em>, and for much of that time its premise is classic Kodaka, to the point where I was curious if it might turn out to be a secret <em>Danganronpa </em>game masquerading as something new. A group of teenagers living in a Tokyo complex are attacked by a strange alien invasion, and to help them face this threat, a weird little ghost-like mascot named Sirei gives each of them a blade that activates a mysterious power within them. Called hemoanima, these powers manifest as different weapon types that are an extension of each character’s personalities. The group is then trapped in the titular Last Defense Academy and told they must defend the school from the invading forces for 100 days. Only then will they be allowed to go home.</p><p>Everything about <em>Hundred Line </em>screams <em>Danganronpa </em>spin-off, even if officially it isn’t. The teenagers locked in a school by a devious mascot premise is one major similarity, but the game also features the same artist and composer as the murder mystery series. So despite its differences, it still has the same vibe. Initially I wasn’t sure what to make of this because Kodaka has made a career out of being self-referential. Each <em>Danganronpa </em>game paid homage to the previous one in ways that went beyond narrative throughlines. 2023’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/master-detective-archives-switch-review-danganronpa-1850592843&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/master-detective-archives-switch-review-danganronpa-1850592843"><em>Master Detective Archives: Rain Code</em></a></span> may have told a more noirish supernatural tale, but the underlying murder mystery structure was nearly a 1:1 recreation of <em>Danganronpa</em>, right down to the mechanics you used to solve its crimes. When nearly everything a game developer has done has been a callback to his defining work, you start to wonder if the guy only has, like, two ideas.</p><figure id="" data-id="476ba36a9e2e5701fa8f7363085fbb67" data-recommend-id="image://476ba36a9e2e5701fa8f7363085fbb67" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sirei points at something with a cane and says &quot;During your time here, you few, you happy few, you band of brothers, will be molded into the perfect Special Defense Unit&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sirei points at something with a cane and says &quot;During your time here, you few, you happy few, you band of brothers, will be molded into the perfect Special Defense Unit&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Too Kyo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="476ba36a9e2e5701fa8f7363085fbb67" data-recommend-id="image://476ba36a9e2e5701fa8f7363085fbb67" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sirei points at something with a cane and says &quot;During your time here, you few, you happy few, you band of brothers, will be molded into the perfect Special Defense Unit&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While the derivative nature of <em>Hundred Line </em>was distracting at times, I can’t deny it scratched an itch. Kodaka’s brand of high-stakes drama juxtaposed with zany dark humor is still a winning formula, and although the sci-fi mystery it tells is maybe not as immediately compelling as his previous work, it goes in some wild directions that kept me guessing. However, with all the good comes some of Kodaka’s known quirks that you may or may not find grating if you’ve followed his work. While half the cast of trapped high schoolers meaningfully drive the plot forward, the other half serve mostly to derail serious conversations with obnoxious one-liners. For most of the game I wasn’t able to really get to know them because <em>Hundred Line</em>’s social elements are severely lacking compared to those in Kodaka’s previous work, but more in-depth conversations unlocked later which I’m still chipping away at. Even without those extra conversations, however, the cast is full of standouts like the brute with a heart of gold Takemaruand the unnerving assassin Yugamu. Even the characters who initially seemed like one-note tropes wormed their way into my heart eventually.</p><p>All of those different personalities manifest in different fighting styles for the game’s tactical combat. Invading forces will periodically attack the Last Defense Academy, and over the course of the game you’ll have to convince hesitant classmates to join the war effort. As your party grows, so do the challenges you’ll face. For the most part, <em>Hundred Line</em>’s big story battles are spaced out enough that each feels significant, and there are few enough of them that even the most challenging don’t overstay their welcome. If you’re the type of person who wants a Kodaka or Uchikoshi story but doesn’t consider yourself much of a tactical RPG connoisseur, fear not: <em>Hundred Line</em>’s battles feel more like puzzles than the more demanding combat in something like <em>XCOM </em>or <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="fbe9cd5bf92251a73c1daab90f805dc5" data-recommend-id="image://fbe9cd5bf92251a73c1daab90f805dc5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A battle in The Hundred Line." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A battle in The Hundred Line." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Too Kyo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fbe9cd5bf92251a73c1daab90f805dc5" data-recommend-id="image://fbe9cd5bf92251a73c1daab90f805dc5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A battle in The Hundred Line." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The crux of <em>Hundred Line</em>’s tactical battles is its AP system. These action points are what allow you to make someone on your team cast an ability, defend an objective, or even move across the battlefield. You’ll start out with only a few of these per turn, but defeating mid-level or higher-ranking enemies on the field will grant you more. As the battle progresses your team gets access to their ultimate abilities, which typically deal high damage to a large area on the field and can take out several enemies at once. These led to the most rewarding moments of <em>Hundred Line</em>’s battles for me, as I chained different party members’ ultimates together to give the rest of my team more chances to pull off a decisive attack.</p><p>One of my favorite fights came about midway through <em>Hundred Line </em>when the school was being attacked by a powerful Commander unit. They had nearly taken down my defenses and would have won the fight if I didn’t end the battle in one turn. Luckily, when a character reaches a certain low health threshold, they’re able to cast their ultimate as a final sacrifice, dealing devastating damage to the field but taking themselves out of the fight. By this point several of my characters were a light pat from death, but in my ranks I also had Kyoshika, the katana-using samurai with a passive ability that allowed her to do extra damage to enemies who were “alone” on the field and not surrounded by any of their teammates. At this point, I knew I had to take a scorched earth approach to the battle to emerge victorious. I sacrificed several of my teammates, using their self-destructive ultimates to take out several mid-level foes and give my team more AP. After I’d lost several of my crew, I had more than enough actions saved up for Kyoshika to whale on the lone Commander, with each strike more than doubled in power because of her passive ability. Doing this meant I was just barely able to win the fight, all because I was willing to sacrifice pawns and made do with what I had left. That kind of table-turning problem-solving feels great, and it was rewarding to see my understanding of one character’s strengths win me the fight. Those kinds of plays only became more common as the game went on and I unlocked new characters with their own specialties. Sure, it’s not as deep or daunting as some of the genre’s biggest names, but it’s got the juice.</p><figure id="" data-id="6ef1980c5bbf7483a2fa34a364a10a37" data-recommend-id="image://6ef1980c5bbf7483a2fa34a364a10a37" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Takumi holds his sword above his head." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Takumi holds his sword above his head." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Too Kyo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6ef1980c5bbf7483a2fa34a364a10a37" data-recommend-id="image://6ef1980c5bbf7483a2fa34a364a10a37" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Takumi holds his sword above his head." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I’ve mentioned that <em>Hundred Line </em>feels like Kodaka’s greatest hits, for good and ill, but I haven’t touched on how <em>Zero Escape</em>’s DNA is clearly running through the game. That’s because the extent of Uchikoshi’s influence is pretty hidden for much of its run, and explaining it would rob you of some of the boldest swings the team takes. It’s why despite hitting the credits, I’m still not quite ready to dive into everything the game has to say and stamp “The <em>Kotaku </em>Review” on this write-up. I’ve been pulled away from <em>Hundred Line </em>by other obligations, but getting back to it is all I’ve been thinking about. If you’re a fan of <em>Danganronpa </em>or <em>Zero Escape</em>, know that even with the switch-up in genre, this is a true marriage of some of the best parts of both games.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Bungie is removing the NDA from the alpha and players will be able to talk about their experiences with it when it begins on April 23 to when it ends on May 4.</p><p>"As developers we believe community feedback and dialog is essential to make the best version of Marathon. Up until now, this feedback has come from closed playtest sessions," Bungie said in a statement. "In the spirit of building towards that future, we've decided to remove the NDA from our Closed Alpha Test. Everyone can share their thoughts, feedback, and footage, including streaming starting on April 23."</p><p>Bungie added that the studio is most interested in hearing feedback surrounding Marathon's gunplay, weapons, maps, runners, early-game progression, PvP engagements against other players, and PvE engagements against AI. As this isn't the full game, Bungie also clarified that the alpha will not include aspects such as final visuals, a polished user interface, a complete narrative, and ranked play.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-alpha-requirements-and-minimum-pc-specs-revealed/1100-6530908/" data-ref-id="1100-6530908">alpha test requires all players</a> to have a Bungie.net account, but not a PlayStation Plus or Xbox Live account. However, they will be when Marathon officially launches. Marathon will not have a single-player mode like the Destiny franchise does, due to the PvP experience being the foundation of it, according to its former game director.</p><p>Marathon launches on September 23 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokecology-pokemon-behavioral-science-book<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you've ever wondered how Pokemon behave out in the wild - and, indeed, why they might behave the way they do - then there's a new book called&nbsp;<em>Pokecology&nbsp;</em>that's just for you.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/new-pokemon-book-by-actual-doctor-of-animal-behavior-and-ecology-academically-explains-and-illustrates-behaviors-of-wild-pokemon/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a>, <i>Pokecology&nbsp;</i>is landing in June. The book<em>&nbsp;</em>is written by two behavioral scientists, and it's been created with a view to explaining the whys of Pokemon from a scientific and ecological perspective.</p>

<p>Topics, according to Automaton's translation of the official&nbsp;<em>Pokecology&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.shogakukan.co.jp/pr/pokecology/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, include "Pokemon eating and sleeping habits, hibernation periods, and migration patterns", among other things.</p>

This new book is for you.</figcaption></figure><p>The authors of the book are Yoshinari Yonehara and Chihiro Kinoshita, both of whom have PhDs in relevant subjects. Yonehara has worked on&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games before, while Kinoshita has worked as an illustrator for ecology-focused children's books.</p>

<p>Right now, the book has only been confirmed for Japan, and we don't yet know which Pokemon will be featured. If you want to pick it up, you'll have to import it; Automaton says it'll cost the equivalent of around $10, but of course, that doesn't factor in shipping.</p>

<p>It's a pretty busy time for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>right now. In the fall, Nintendo and&nbsp;The Pokemon Company will release&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced" rel="nofollow">latest game in the long-running franchise</a> (although not technically the next mainline entry in the series).</p>

<p>The game will take place entirely in the Kalos-based city of Lumiose, and will see the player encountering Pokemon across a number of "Wild Zones", while also taking on trainers as part of the titular Z-A Royale competition.</p>




<p>As for the tenth generation of mainline&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games, nothing has been revealed so far, but when it does land, we're expecting the games to be available exclusively for the Switch 2, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">which launches in June</a>. Pre-orders for the console <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-us-canada-april-24th" rel="nofollow">recently opened back up</a> after a tariff-induced delay.</p>

			<p>It feels like a no-brainer for a collaboration between the creators of the Zero Escape and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/09/21/danganronpa-v3-killing-harmony-review/">Danganronpa</a>&nbsp;games to just be the biggest, wildest death-game crossover imaginable. Yet, to the credit of both developers, they’ve spent the last few years instead collaborating on projects that explore refreshingly different genres and mediums while still retaining a lot of the creative charm that made their breakout works so memorable. The Hundred Line Last Defense Academy&nbsp;is by far the magnum opus of their collaborative game works as Too Kyo Games. Blending the wild flowchart-storytelling of Zero Escape with the bombastic and absurd mystery thriller antics of Danganronpa is incredible enough, but doing so within such a different frame of narrative and with such an addictive gameplay loop has resulted in one of the most memorable games I’ve played in ages.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Hundred Line -Last Defense Academy-: Story Trailer (English)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JNrgeoTWplU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Hundred Line Last Defense Academy&nbsp;reminds me so vividly of what might be my favourite game, Vanillaware’s masterpiece <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/15/13-sentinels-aegis-rim-review-ps4/">13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim</a>. Like that game, this is a story and dialogue-heavy game that almost borders on being a visual novel, but mixes in just enough environmental exploration and tactical combat sequences to keep you constantly engaged.You play as Takumi Sumino, a high-schooler born and raised in a domed city that, to him, is incredibly normal. When that normalcy is interrupted by a sudden monster attack, though, he’s whisked away to a mysterious school full of other high school kids, and is soon told by a strange talking blob in a fedora that they’ll need to become a team of blood-powered combatants to fend off monsters for the next 100 days.</p>


<p>Despite the game being set in a locked-down school full of a dozen teenagers who don’t know anything about where they are or why they’re here, this is very much not another Danganronpa. The characters, which are designed by the same artist from that series, certainly make it hard to brush that comparison away. My early favorite was Darumi Amemiya, a manic pixie emo girl who is genuinely convinced they are trapped in a death game and riles everyone up with her delusions. Her fourth-wall breaking shenanigans serve as an early and appreciated warning – the game is aware of the comparisons it’ll draw, and that self-awareness helps drive the story into a realm of true sci-fi mind-warping ridiculousness that easily eclipses almost every twist and turn from that iconic death-game franchise.</p>


<p>What I especially love is how smartly the story and our character’s circumstances fold into the gameplay with battles that play out in the style of Fire Emblem’s tactical grid encounters. In a lot of games like that, you’ll meet characters and almost immediately recruit them to your growing army. In The Hundred Line Last Defense Academy, though, none of these characters want to fight at all. They’re scared, confused, and one of them is about to throw up. Instead of meeting new characters and immediately recruiting them, you spend a large part of the game slowly connecting with the other characters in your crew until each of them, for their own reasons, finally feels ready to join the battle and become a playable character. It’s a great touch that blends every aspect of the game without making one feel more important than the other.</p>
<p>Each of your hundred days of service in The Hundred Line Last Defense Academy play out in-game, just like the days ticking by in a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/30/persona-3-reload-review/">Persona</a> title. Some days will be focused on big narrative bomb-shells or battles against monsters, while other days let you freely explore your school-prison and do activities like training your skills or bonding with your favorite characters. Some of these days will also present you with major choices, which will lead to several different endings – literally one hundred endings, according to the creators of the game. I was never able to explore all of those, but just the path I took through the game on my own was full of so many twists, unexpected developments, false credits, and more that I felt spoiled by the end of my time with the game for how massive, winding and satisfying the story ended up being.</p>

<p>The battles, though. What I love about the combat in this game is that a lot of the encounters almost feel more like puzzles rather than brute-forced tactics battles. You fight on a small field where large groups of enemies come at you in very specific patterns. Figuring out the most efficient way to clear out those patterns each turn is a blast. On top of that, the game is so smartly designed in how it encourages you to stop overthinking things and just go all-out.</p>
<p>When a character takes enough damage, they can do a massive attack at the cost of dying right after it, but since characters come back after each battle and they gain additional additional experience and attack meter when you trigger these abilities, you’re encouraged to lean into this ability. The game wants you to shoot first and ask questions later, and it helps make each encounter go by just fast enough that it never feels like they’re getting in the way of your next story revelation.</p>

<p>The Hundred Line Last Defense Academy is so ambitious, and so absurd, and I had no idea what to expect from the game up until the very end – and sometimes didn’t even know if I was truly at the very end or not. It’s an accomplishment in storytelling that doesn’t force itself to re-tread the greatest hits from the games that came before it, but still incorporates so much of the same charm, mystery, and all-star writing that will make fans of those games call this one their new favorite.</p>

The team's stated goal is to give players the ability to "reshape the environment and transform your surroundings toward a tactical advantage." The article notes that there will be visual and audio cues that let players know which environments can be destroyed. And while the demonstration only took down part of a building, it will be possible to "[take] down a building to take out an attacking squad."</p><p>Buildings and objects won't necessarily break immediately. Instead, they will "visually degrade" while taking persistent damage before starting to break down. Rubble from the destruction won't disappear from the battlefield, and players can even use it for cover during firefights.</p><p>For the current test, DICE is focused on how to let players differentiate between non-destructible and destructible environments.

The dev team <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-dev-reacts-to-games-many-leaks-i-am-not-ok-with-leaks/1100-6530040/" data-ref-id="1100-6530040">has voiced its displeasure</a> over those in part because these tests aren't necessarily representative of what the final game will be like. Earlier this month, Battlefield's lead producer David Sirland addressed the rumors about the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-dev-clarifies-use-of-sbmm-in-playtest/1100-6530889/" data-ref-id="1100-6530889">potential use of skill-based matchmaking</a> that likely originated from the play tests.</p><p>A previous report suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-battlefield-game-will-have-a-free-to-play-battle-royale-report/1100-6521440/" data-ref-id="1100-6521440">the next Battlefield game will arrive in October 2025</a>. However, EA has yet to formally set a release window for the upcoming title.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Oblivion Remastered File Size Is Reportedly Going to Be Massive]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-file-size-massive/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oblivion-remastered-file-size-is-reportedly-going-to-be-massive.1169274/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-file-size-massive/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered file size is going to be massive, a huge jump over that of the original release and the Definitive Edition, which includes all DLC content.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, X0XLEAK revealed on X that Oblivion Remastered will be 120.94 GB big. While the file size is a huge jump of over 2000% over the original game and the Definitive Edition, it isn't particularly surprising, considering plenty of other games powered by Unreal Engine 5 sport massive file sizes. The leaker also provided proof that this is the correct file size, as it is the size Steam reports.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="qme"><a href="https://t.co/aX54ouFIiE">pic.twitter.com/aX54ouFIiE</a></p>
<p>— X0XLEAK (@X0X_LEAK) <a href="https://twitter.com/X0X_LEAK/status/1914041212744433812?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Thankfully, we won't have to wait much longer to learn if Oblivion Remastered will indeed require so much storage space, as one of 2025's worst-kept gaming secrets is apparently releasing<a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-rumored-to-launch-on-april-21-at-12-pm-est/"> later today</a>. Even if the game is not launching before the end of the day, its release shouldn't be too far off in the future, as multiple insiders have been suggesting for some time that the highly anticipated remaster of the fourth entry in the series, developed by Bethesda, will make its debut <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-launch-april-21/">this week</a>. According to other rumors, Oblivion Remastered will also feature all the <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-all-dlc/">DLC packs</a> released for the original, so the remaster is really setting out to be the best way to experience one of the most beloved role-playing games of all time.</p>
<p>Besides featuring the obvious visual improvements, which have already been showcased in some leaked screenshots <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-shadowdrop/">last week</a>, Oblivion Remastered will supposedly also feature some<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/"> gameplay enhancements</a>, including an enhanced Stamina system that should make its management less frustrating, and a new blocking system inspired by modern action games.</p>

			<p>The rumored portable PlayStation 6 will be able to run PlayStation 5 games without developer intervention, although a patch may still be needed for performance.</p>
<p>On the<a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/do-you-agree-with-chatgpt-that-ps6-portable-can-match-the-power-of-ps5-in-all-parameters-by-2028.1681803/page-6#post-270341318"> NeoGAF forums</a>, known leaker KeplerL2 revealed today that, as far as they know, the portable system has shader binary compatibility, so it should be able to run previous-generation games without developer intervention. However, performance may not be great if games are left unpatched.</p>
<p>A portable edition of the PlayStation 6 is said to be in the works alongside the standard home variant. While the systems have yet to be officially announced, we already know they will be powered by <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-powered-amd/">AMD</a>, like their two immediate predecessors, although Intel reportedly bid to produce the system. According to some recent rumors, the portable edition of the next-generation system by Sony will not be able to<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-portable-edition-not-powerful-playstation-5/"> match the current generation base PlayStation 5</a>, but will be<a href="https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-more-powerful-xbox-series-s/"> more powerful than the Xbox Series S</a>, and its SoC, which will feature less than 40 CUs, has been designed to run at very low voltages.</p>
<p>The regular edition of the PlayStation 6, on the other hand, hasn't been the subject of too many rumors, but Sony is reportedly planning to make it the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-most-powerful-generation-amd/">most powerful system of its console generation</a>, expanding ray tracing and machine learning to offer advanced and innovative gameplay features.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-just-got-its-second-official-trailer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/doom-the-dark-ages-just-got-its-second-official-trailer.1169250/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-just-got-its-second-official-trailer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bethesda Softworks and id Software have published the second official DOOM: The Dark Ages trailer at a rather unusual time and date, late on Sunday night (at Easter, no less). Still, it was a nice surprise for fans, to be sure, and the official YouTube channel already shows half a million views in the span of mere hours.</p>
<p>By the way, this is a cinematic trailer, not a gameplay trailer. It's entirely focused on story bits, which reflects what id Software <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-is-the-biggest-and-best-game-weve-ever-made-says-id-story-is-out-of-the-codex/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told the press</a> when they first discussed the game a couple of months ago: the plot will be more important than ever in a DOOM game. Of course, there's a lot more to DOOM: The Dark Ages, which they described as the most expansive franchise installment yet:</p>
<p><em><strong>Marty Stratton:&nbsp;</strong>It's definitely not an open world game, but it is the most expansive world we've ever built. You really feel like you're on a battlefield. It goes from the typical linear DOOM to these large sandboxes where the exploration opens up, and you get multiple objectives that can be tackled in any order. Exploration is also tied to power in that you can find and unlock several upgrades for your character.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Hugo Martin:&nbsp;</strong>There's a much greater focus on progression items. We've really streamlined the economy and the currencies. I think that's another thing we learned from DOOM Eternal. If you have too many currencies and skill trees, you confuse the player. But speaking of the level design, we're very proud of it. It's some of the best work we've ever done.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="DOOM: The Dark Ages | Official Trailer 2 (4K) | Available May 15, 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s1i3YfGl5ag?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Last month, Wccftech's Chris Wray <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">went hands-on with the game at a press event</a>, and his take was very positive:</p>
<p><em>This massive battlefield was far more open than what you generally get in a DOOM title. Some trappings remained, in that you have arenas to encounter and loads of secrets to find via some exploration, but it never felt constrained by the usual corridors you come to expect. While still somewhat driven, it offered a bit of an open feel, where you could maybe find yourself at odds in one area, decide to tackle somewhere else and rearm before coming back.</em></p>
<p><em>Combine this more open approach with the excellent fast-paced combat from DOOM Eternal, where you will be finishing off enemies to have extra life and ammo fall out of their bodies, combos and well-timed attacks being rewarded with more to keep you going, and you have a recipe for greatness.</em></p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages will launch on May 15 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. The PC version <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-features-dlss-4-path-tracing-at-launch-indiana-jones-alan-wake-2-updated-with-new-rtx-technologies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Frame Generation and path tracing</a>. There are also <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-rumored-for-nintendo-switch-2-as-phil-spencer-teases-more-multiplatform-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors of a Nintendo Switch 2 version</a>, which wouldn't be at all surprising considering that both previous games were released for the original Switch console.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/interview-how-delta-force-is-looking-to-blow-up-mobile-shooter-market<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Delta Force made its return with a launch on PC last year, reigniting interest in the legendary tactical shooter franchise. Now, it is bringing its definitive free-to-play, modern, team-based tactical action to a whole new audience on mobile. Anticipation for the mobile release has been huge, with over 20 million players pre-registering across Android and iOS platforms ahead of launch on April 21st. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We spoke to Leo Yao, Head of Studio and Shadow Guo, Game Director at Team Jade about the development of Delta Force Mobile, the game’s content , graphics and optimization along with technical ambitions, and its play-to-win, not pay-to-win, philosophy.   </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Capturing epic battles on the small screen</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Delta Force features realistic battlegrounds, class-based Operators, a deep weapons arsenal and multiple game modes; all designed to blend nostalgia from the original series with modern gameplay elements. Game modes cater to both solo-player and team-up experiences, including the world’s first 24v24 battlefield with vehicles and an extraction-based PvPvE mode. Parity of experience was a central part of the design ethos for this title.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our goal was to build a truly uncompromised AAA shooter experience for mobile players which feels just as thrilling and immersive as its PC counterpart,” said Guo. “We wanted to provide players with the opportunity to experience an array of modes and maps which they haven't ever experienced before, promising tons of action and fun. That’s why we’re especially proud of introducing groundbreaking features like our world-first 24v24 large-scale battlefield, which pushes the boundaries of what mobile shooters can achieve.” </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Keep the fight going, wherever you are</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Delta Force Mobile was designed to both introduce the game to new, mobile-first audiences, while also giving PC players a way to bring the game anywhere. Integral to this is Delta Force’s cross progression with PC which includes support of Google Play Games on PC, allowing players to progress and play across both platforms. Synced content between PC and mobile currently includes 7 maps for Warfare, 4 maps for Operations, 10 Operators, 12 vehicles and 55 weapons sets, with more to come. Player’s individual progression, including their inventory will also be synced.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/17/new-operator-nox-1744894241204.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><em>Image credit: Team Jade</em></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We wanted to make sure that Delta Force provided players with exciting cross-platform experiences”, said Yao. “Whether players are jumping into a quick match on their phones during a commute or settling in for a longer session with friends on PC, we wanted to ensure the game is both accessible and fun for everyone. That’s why we focused on offering a wide range of engaging content across all platforms for the mobile launch.” </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>“No One Gets Left Behind” </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Delta Force motto rings true in their approach to device optimisation as well. The developers worked hard to make sure that its launch on mobile is optimal for players across the world with system requirements that are accessible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We wanted to make sure players wouldn't have to worry about whether their phones could handle game play, so we have made sure system requirements are as accessible as possible. For example, an iPhone 7, which is around 10 years old, will be sufficient for players to experience everything Delta Force has to offer,” said Yao. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Delta Force brings its high-resolution visuals to mobile, complete with global illumination systems, so players  feel truly immersed in the world that has been created. Central to its design are lifelike operators, detailed weapon cosmetics, vast and detailed maps, and distinctive in-game effects.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/17/mobile-spec-requirement-1744894280092.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><em><strong>Image credit: Team Jade</strong></em></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of shooters demand high frames per second (FPS) for a great experience, which is why it was vital for the developers to ensure 120 native FPS through cutting edge technology like Vulkan and Metal when building the mobile version. The team has achieved around 50% higher efficiency than most industry leading mobile shooters, making Delta Force an industry leader in terms of performance. Coupled with low input-latency, the game has been built from the ground up to be one of the smoothest mobile shooters on the market.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Play To Win </strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Delta Force’s progression is based on a play-to-win system which allows new and ongoing players to earn exclusive rewards. On launch, mobile players are eligible for several different rewards by signing in and playing the game. There will be $500 worth of rewards to obtain across PC &amp; mobile, including 148 weapon appearances, 21 vehicle appearances and 270+ other rewards. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/17/delta-force-freebies-1744894309901.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><em><strong>Image credit: Team Jade</strong></em></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are truly committed to a no-pay-to-win system, with the development of our game driven by our passionate players.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Man, It’s great to have Fatal Fury back. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The OG SNK fighting game series, and the one that went toe-to-toe with Street Fighter 2 back in the 90s, Fatal Fury has been dormant for more than 25 years. SNK has been quite active in that time with the King of Fighters series and even a Samurai Shodown revival, but those offer two very different styles of fighting game, leaving Street Fighter without its most comparable SNK competition for far too long. And that’s what Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves brings to the table: A more direct alternative to Street Fighter 6 — one that is similar in its gameplay structure, but without neutral skipping system mechanics, Drive Impacts, and throw loops. It’s missing a few modern-day fighting game features that should be standard at this point and its UI is lacking to say the least, but in all of the areas that matter most, City of the Wolves hits like a Buster Wolf to the face.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Like its 90s predecessors, City of the Wolves is a four-button fighter that gives you a light punch, heavy punch, light kick, and heavy kick. There’s also a close and far version of each of these buttons, with the close versions typically leading to bigger damage and better situations, while the far versions are used more for pokes and whiff punishes. One big thing that separates City of the Wolves from Street Fighter 6 and several other modern fighting games is that there are no universal ways to easily get in on an opponent. There are no shared high speed dash-ups that let you keep your turn even if they’re blocked, no universal vanishing teleports, and no projectile-invulnerable quick steps. Characters still have plenty of options to approach, but none that are shared among the whole cast, and all of which carry significant risk.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There are no shared high speed dash-ups that let you keep your turn even if they're blocked.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While I personally don’t mind a good neutral skip, I still greatly enjoy that larger focus on the mental chess game of each of us trying to get a feel for how the other will try and approach, and reacting accordingly. It also makes the characters that do have the ability to cover ground very quickly and safely feel a lot more unique among the rest of the cast.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New to City of the Wolves is the Rev Meter, which works very similarly to how the Drive Meter functions in Street Fighter 6, only you’re actually building this meter up instead of depleting it. You begin every round at 0%, and you’ll increase that percentage by blocking enemy attacks or using special Rev techniques – those include EX special moves, a Rev Guard that adds substantial pushback to your guard and avoids chip damage, and armored attacks called Rev Blows. Once you hit 100%, you’ll overheat and the meter will slowly start to deplete, but until it gets back to zero (which takes a <em>really </em>long time) you can’t use any Rev techniques, and your guard gauge will deplete every time you block an attack. Once that’s gone, your guard will be broken and you’ll be open to a free combo from your foe.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mitchell's Favorite Fighting Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a great system that has me making very important meter management decisions on the fly. Since you can chain EX Special moves into each other in order to squeeze out more damage from a combo, that gauge can rise very high very quickly over the course of just a single combo. That pushed me to ask myself whether it was worth fully cashing out on a big combo and risk either overheating or being close to overheating, or whether I should end the combo early and save some of the gauge for the rest of the round. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Rev Blows are the only part of the equation I'm not fully on board with.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Rev Blows are the only part of the equation that I’m not fully on board with. These armored attacks may initially bring to mind Drive Impacts from Street Fighter 6, but there are some very important distinctions. Like Drive Impacts, they can be used to power through an enemy flurry to deliver a big attack of your own, but unlike Drive Impacts, they only result in a full combo if they hit as a counter, not just if they absorb an attack. Still, even without countering, they do a sizable chunk of damage, are safe on block, and only cost 17% of your Rev Meter, meaning they can be used pretty liberally without much consequence – that’s especially true if the other player doesn’t know how to deal with them, which would be understandable as City of the Wolves doesn’t tell you that in any of the in-game tutorials.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, these hits are not unbeatable. Like Drive Impacts, the best way to counter them is with a Rev Blow of your own, which will turn the tide and give you a free combo opportunity. Unlike Drive Impacts, though, Rev Blows can only be used during SPG (Selective Potential Gear), which is a special buff that is only active while in your choice of either the start, middle, or end portion of your health bar. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You decide where you want your SPG buff to kick in before each fight, and there are advantages to each position – but if someone starts a match with their SPG at the beginning of their health bar, and I have it set anywhere else, I just straight up don’t have my best defense against this technique until I lose either half or the majority of my life. There are other defenses, like throws, supers, and dodge attacks, but none that really match the ease and reward of the attacker just throwing a Rev Blow out there. At higher levels, you’ll see people canceling their dodge attack with a feint and getting full combos off that, but the timing window for this is very tight, and it feels like there’s no good answer for this move at low-to-mid level play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of that one relatively small issue, however, the actual fighting in City of the Wolves is excellent. There’s a great flexibility in the combo design that lets you go for either reliable and easy damage just by stringing a couple of EX special moves together, with the option to end with a super, or a more execution heavy combo that incorporates techniques like special move braking and feints, both of which require fast fingers and much greater precision. That lets you weigh the potential of an increased reward against a much higher chance of dropping the combo however you want.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There's a great balance of both offensive and defensive options.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a great balance of both offensive and defensive options as well that make it hard to just fall into a rhythm of doing the same things over and over again. On wake up you can roll forward and backwards, there are a couple of frames of throw invulnerability to prevent throw loops, and well-timed just defenses or hyper defenses are rewarded with an opportunity to guard cancel and punish attacks that aren’t normally heavily punishable. It all just feels really good. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Between a Rock and a Bogard Place</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The City of the Wolves roster is a respectable 17 strong at launch, and it is a mechanically diverse cast that covers most of the original Mark of the Wolves roster along with four newcomers. Two of those newcomers, Preecha and Vox Reaper, are excellent without any caveats. Preecha is an easy to pick-up-and-play Muay Thai scientist with flashy and satisfying combos and a well-rounded skill set; while Vox Reaper is just rushdown personified. He’s one of the few characters on the roster without a projectile, but he more than makes up for it with lightning fast speed, tricky divekicks, and by being one of the few characters with one of those aforementioned plus-on-block neutral skipping dashing attacks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I have been spending the most time with Terry and Hokutomaru. Terry because of the familiarity I have with him from other games, and Hokutomaru for the sheer variety of approach options he has. He can double jump, teleport while in the air, and use Akuma-like air projectiles to both threaten from afar and alter his jump arc to bait out anti-airs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there are the guest characters: Real-world soccer pro Cristiano Ronaldo and real-world DJ Salvatore Ganacci. To get the good out of the way first, they are at least cool characters mechanically. Ronaldo’s main gimmick is that all of his normal attacks are soccer techniques that can not only damage the opponent on their own, but also be used to hit a soccer ball that can be summoned with one of his special moves. This can lead to some truly wild set ups that force you to block the ball and then guess or predict where Ronaldo is going to hit you from. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Ronaldo and Ganacci are at least cool characters mechanically.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Salvatore on the other hand is largely a gag character, with moves taken directly from his music videos and performances as a DJ, but at least they’re very entertaining to look at. I still find myself chuckling when he looks dead into the camera as he pounds an enemy’s face to the beat, and while many of his moves are slow and awkward, he surprisingly hits extremely hard even without having to spend a ton of meter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But here’s the thing: Very little was done to make these characters feel like they belong in Fatal Fury, especially Ronaldo. Salvatore at least has his own story in the Arcade and Episodes of South Town single-player modes, but Ronaldo is completely absent from both. Not to mention, their visual designs are boring and too ordinary to match the flash and flair of someone like B. Jenet or Kain. It’s hard not to feel like these characters would have been better suited as optional DLC like most guest characters tend to be, which would’ve freed up more spots for characters that actually belong in South Town. </p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Greetings From South Town</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">As far as the rest of the package goes, the single-player options in City of the Wolves are pretty fun, even if they are pretty basic. The first is the classic Arcade mode that works as you’d expect: Each character has an intro establishing who they are and what their goal is, a rival battle, and an ending. As far as Arcade modes go, it’s actually pretty solid, even if it is very ordinary. I’ve only beaten a handful of them, but each one has had some really nice character building moments and long awaited pay offs for anyone who’s been following Fatal Fury lore for a while. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves B. Jenet Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The marquee single-player option is Episodes of South Town, which is an RPG-inspired mode that lets you play through a more substantial version of a character’s story by selecting battles on a map screen. You’ll gain experience with each battle that then lets you level up and become stronger, increasing your stats and giving you access to new skills and abilities as you progress. It’s a solid diversion that adds some very welcome light progression and RPG elements while giving each character’s story a more satisfying beginning, middle, and end than what Arcade mode offers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the battles in this mode have unique conditions too, such as having to fight multiple enemies in a gauntlet, enemies always being in SPG mode, or (in one of the more frustrating conditions) your opponent being immune to every attack with the exception of a 1/66 chance that you’ll land a one-hit kill. Outside of that last one, which is a miserable time, the additional conditions do a pretty good job of adding some variety to each match without overcomplicating them or taking away from what’s fun about the combat in the first place. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One area City of the Wolves could have used some extra attention is in its teaching tools. There is a passable tutorial that covers all of the mechanics, but it doesn’t do a great job of explaining the context or usage of many of its more advanced techniques. Defending against the aforementioned Rev Blow is one example, but it also doesn’t do a great job of explaining the uses of things like Feints or Brakes. In fact, the tutorial section for Brakes basically just tells you how to do them, explains that they can be used in combos, then says that it’s a lesson for another time – but it doesn’t actually have another lesson for it!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the online side of things, the most important question to ask when it comes to a modern fighting game is “does it have rollback netcode?” The second most important question is then “is it <em>good </em>rollback netcode.” For City of the Wolves the answer to those two questions are “yes!” and “ehhhh.” For the most part, during my experience with both the betas and a handful of matches on the full game’s pre-launch servers, online felt pretty good. That said, the best netcodes are able to make a bad connection still feel playable, and that definitely wasn’t the case during the worst of what I saw. I had one match with eight frames of delay that felt like I was moving through sludge, and another where my button inputs just occasionally wouldn’t go through.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>For the most part, online play felt pretty good. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the usual suite of options are otherwise here and accounted for. There are ranked matches, casual matches, room matches, and a replay theater to watch both your own replays and public ones (though there’s no way to filter or search for replays featuring a specific character). Unfortunately, the UI to navigate through these menus is some of the worst I’ve seen in a fighting game, with the biggest offender being the room match menu that for some reason needs to be controlled with a slow moving mouse cursor and has the look of an excel document or powerpoint presentation. In the grand scheme of things, it’s not a huge deal, and the lobby itself is functional in all of the ways I’d expect – but still, it’s surprising to see in a game that otherwise drips with style once you’re in a match. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>When SNK was bought by the Saudi Arabian Electronic Gaming Development Company back in 2022, they reassured the general public that this would not affect the content of their games at all. It happened during a pretty tumultuous period of foreign investment funds and corporations buying their way into several gaming companies, so people were rightfully pretty concerned about how it would affect the legendary fighting game developer. After playing Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, it feels like that promise from 2022 has been broken, draining away any chance of this game having a cohesive aesthetic or style. Beyond some interesting combat mechanics and a handful of promising new character designs, there isn’t a whole lot to this game that would make it feel like a standout hit, anyway.</p>
<p><iframe title="FATAL FURY: CotW｜RONALDO vs. GANACCI ｜Round 1" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CmLzs2kkz94?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The most memorable fighting games are often tied together not just by their tight gameplay or number of characters, but by a cohesive vibe that flows through every level of the game. The striking style of games like Skullgirls or Tekken speak volumes, but there’s very little of that in Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves. Instead, each piece of the package feels plucked from an entirely different source. Some menus are sleek and stylish, while others are barebones and basic. Characters occupy such a wide spread of tropes and styles that there’s no way to understand what or where or when this game is unless you’re knee-deep in SNK universe lore. Plus, two of these characters are real life dudes – soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo, who currently playing in the Saudi Pro League and with a cloud of controversies that still hang over him, and DJ Salvatore Ganacci, whose links to the country can be seen with him being tied in with another of Saudi Arabia’s big sporting ventures, LIV Golf.</p>


<p>Fighting games have thrived on wild guest characters for ages now, but I can’t understand any of the reasoning behind these two picks. You would generally see a guest character dip into a fanbase or piece of media that is either tied closely to the game they’re cameo-ing in, or appeals to a fanbase that would be likely to pick up a new fighting game just for that character, but I can’t imagine that the fandom of these two men correlates at all to the competitive, nostalgia-driven fanbase of gamers who would care about a new Fatal Fury game. Even the soundtrack for the game is questionably convoluted – every stage song has been created by a variety of English and European DJs, but almost every song falls into an identical snooze-worthy beat that not only fails to match the vibe of their stages, but fails to sound good whatsoever.</p>


<p>There’s so much of this sort of uninspired or cameo-fueled content sprinkled throughout Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves that it’s hard to appreciate the game on its own merits. Which is a shame, because there is some interesting stuff here. Much like the original game that this is a decades-in-the-waiting sequel to, Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves is a intricate fighter made exclusively for the freaks. The biggest example of that is the new REV system, giving each fighter an additional meter that fills and empties throughout battles depending on how offensive or defensive you behave. Rather than spending the meter to perform stronger actions, you can perform a variety of techniques like Rev Arts, Rev Blow, Rev Accel, and Rev Guard freely. The catch is that they all increase your Rev meter when you perform them and going over 100% into Overheat disables Rev actions entirely and makes you susceptible to guard breaks.</p>
<p>The REV system is arguably the one universally approachable element of combat in this game – it’s easy to wrap your head around managing the meter, and it adds an extra layer of push-and-pull to combat that plays out like a way less convoluted version of the Grind Grid from Under Night-in Birth.</p>

<p>The unfortunate thing about Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, though, is that it relies so much on these advanced techniques and systems that casual players and newcomers will likely struggle to tap into. Even with the Smart controls system that gives you auto-combos and easy one-button presses for a few techniques, there are so many other minute systems like feinting and braking and the numerous defence mechanics that will remain out of reach. The game thrives when it’s played at it’s highest skill ceiling, but when it’s being played at it’s lowest, it doesn’t spark nearly as much joy compared to flashier and more approachable contemporaries like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/23/tekken-8-review/">Tekken 8</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/30/street-fighter-6-review/">Street Fighter 6</a>.</p>
<p>There are some single-player modes in Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves that help add some casually-approachable content to the game. Arcade mode is a pretty simple piece of the pie, but Episodes of South Town is a much meatier single-player campaign experience. Each character gets their own story that plays out through textbox dialogue and a variety of fights you pick from via a map of the city. It’s nothing special in terms of writing, and a lot of the fights are against random non-playable mob characters. Still, it’s enough of a consistent loop that it does give you a more engaging reason to do a bunch of casual battling in the game beyond just endlessly hopping into online play.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/fatal-fury-city-of-wolves-review-nothing-but-hands-and-feet</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fatal-fury-city-of-the-wolves-review-nothing-but-hands-and-feet.1169220/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/fatal-fury-city-of-wolves-review-nothing-but-hands-and-feet<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I was two years old when the last mainline <em>Fatal Fury</em> game came out. So, needless to say, I missed the train on that one altogether. When I heard that <em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em> was coming out, I was extremely curious because I now had an excuse to dive into the series. Thankfully, the game doesn't disappoint, with a rich cast of fighters, a unique art style, and engaging music. There's something for everyone, no matter your skill level in the genre. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Before getting into what the game does right, I want to highlight some of the game's weaker points. One of the first weak points lies within the campaign mode. Throughout recent years, many games that take place in space have created compelling stories that get you attached to the fighters in one way or another. But sadly, that wasn't the case for Episodes of South Town, which serves as the main story within <em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Roughly 90 percent of it consists of you moving a cursor through a map layout and clicking on who you want to fight next. This led to me feeling a lack of excitement for the gameplay and more like I was going through a checklist, hoping to come across something that would regain my interest. In addition to that, most of the cutscenes in it are pure text, and it can become extremely easy to skip all of the dialogue and move on to the next fight, which I've found myself doing most of the time.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/unknown-2025_04_18-21_28_56-1-1.jpg?itok=-EQ_1fcG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/unknown-2025_04_18-21_28_56-1-1.jpg?itok=AROL6BHx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here is a city of the map</figcaption></figure><p><br>
Since this is the game's story mode, there is somewhat of a progressive system, but often it falls flat. Throughout the story, you'll level up, and fighting other people is the only way to do this. As you level up, your character will unlock more HP, abilities, and more. But it does feel a bit odd because a lot of the features you unlock are basic core mechanics of the game, and the power-ups you do get are nothing less than slight buffs that can help you in the next fight.</p>

<p>Another key issue with <em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em> was the inclusion of its star guest fighter, Cristiano Ronaldo. In the past, Ronaldo has been the center of sexual assault allegations, and providing a platform for him to have a face in the gaming community incites unjust tolerance for the negative and harmful behavior that is tied to his name and reputation.</p>

<p>Even though <em>City of the Wolves</em> does shoot itself in the foot with some of its issues, the game still excels in other places that are worth highlighting. The first aspect of the game that caught my eye was its art style. Rather than taking a realist approach like other games in space, it leans heavily into the comic book and anime aesthetic. Whenever players are performing power moves, it's hard not to be impressed by how colorful they are and to see the drastic change in</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/unknown-2025_04_18-21_36_50-1.jpg?itok=ppQkuuFS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/unknown-2025_04_18-21_36_50-1.jpg?itok=Q-eCmXha 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>He really has that fit on</figcaption></figure><p>On top of that, the music absolutely slaps. Right off the bat, players are greeted with smooth jazz on the main menu, and each battle arena is complemented by a fantastic score. It's hard not to get a little dance going in real life as you're watching your character throw hands with someone else. But in addition to having great music, it also serves as a nice centerpiece to the fights, too, because, at times, it'll add that level of intensity that's needed when you're on the verge of winning/losing a fight.</p>

<p>Another pleasant surprise was the customization that's possible with the Color Edit menu. Now, it's not like other games in the space that essentially allow you to turn someone into Goku or Leon from the <em>Resident Evil</em> series. But it was still enough to allow me to express myself uniquely. Even though the only things I was able to change were their clothes and items, it was still enough for me to make some of my mains pop out in a special way.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/unknown-2025_04_17-21_00_23.jpg?itok=FV-gaiTY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/unknown-2025_04_17-21_00_23.jpg?itok=PFl0ZB4q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>He's just like me</figcaption></figure><p>One of the ways <em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves </em>separates itself from its competitors is how it deals with its power-up system. In most fighting games, there's always some kind of X-Factor that players can enable, and once it's started, it'll give them some sort of buff for a brief moment. But oftentimes, it's enough to turn the tide of that battle. <em>City of the Wolves</em> is no different in that regard, but how it goes about it is what separates it from others.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Here, that feature is called S.P.G. This allows players to perform stronger attacks and encourages them to be on the offensive. At the beginning of each game, players have the option to select where they want the S.P.G. to activate; this can range from starting right off the bat when they're at full, half, or a quarter of HP.</p>

<p>There's another twist to this. The S.P.G. will be active as long as your HP matches the bar, so theoretically, a player can have it the whole game from the beginning. This creates a fun dynamic on how aggressive one should be. On top of that, whenever the S.P.G., you'll have access to a hidden move that does significant damage.&nbsp; So, knowing where to place the S.P.G. can make all the difference.</p>

The power moves in <em>City of the Wolves </em>are called Rev actions, and these can be used as much as I want as long as I don't fill up the Rev Meter. Rev actions are beneficial because they allow you to perform power chain combos and make stronger moves overall. But if I allowed the meter to reach 100 percent, this would come back and bite me because I'll begin to overheat. This will prevent me from doing any Rev actions and reduce my blocking gauge.</p>

<p>Of course, I could prevent my character from overheating by performing successful blocks or landing hits on my opponent. This is just another added layer to the game's intricate combat system.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/akw6u-xoyu7-1.jpg?itok=LEsFtemR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/akw6u-xoyu7-1.jpg?itok=SlJpWc9J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>He did indeed win that match too.</figcaption></figure><p>On the flip side, players are also rewarded for playing more defensively. Whenever a perfectly timed block is performed, not only does it cool down my Rev, but it also gives me just a little bit of lost health, which was nice because often, the HP was something that I desperately needed. This, paired with the sheer number of counterattacks I could do, really shook things up for each fight. Because I wasn't always going in with the mindset of sending a flurry of blows, sometimes I opted for being more conservative in the fight and waiting for an opening that I could use that would almost guarantee me the game.</p>

<p>Even if all of this sounds a bit complicated, Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves has a great tutorial system that explains a lot of the core mechanics. Although this isn't new, it's nice to see more games include a Smart control scheme that makes it significantly easier for players to perform various combos and attacks.</p>

<p><em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em> does many great things right. It's been a game that I was looking forward to. The combat system is a well-oiled machine with many layers. On top of that, it's gorgeous and has a fantastic soundtrack. But it does shoot itself in the foot with a story mode that isn't worth your time, and the addition of Cristiano Ronaldo handicaps it.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-2-tv-show-vs-game-comparison.1169205/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-episode-2-tv-show-vs-game-comparison<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>The following article contains </em><em><strong>spoilers </strong></em><em>for The Last of Us season 2, episode 2. </em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">If the first episode of The Last of Us season 2 was the scene setter, then episode 2 is the catalyst for everything that comes next. It features – SPOILERS! – the death of Joel Miller, and it takes place in pretty much the exact same way as it did in the game. The devil is in the details, though, and not everything about that scene is a 1:1 recreation. That’s where our TV show vs game comparison comes in. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve taken the major scenes of episode 2 that are taken from the game and compared them against the original source material, analysing what’s changed and what’s stayed the same. You can see both versions in the video above, or read on below for our written explanations. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Joel’s Death</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/21/death-1745206149352.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As the instigating incident of the game and the big main event of the season’s second episode, Joel’s death was naturally going to be a meticulously recreated sequence. Both the broad strokes and many of the small details are all here; Abby blasts his leg with a shotgun and then proceeds to lay into him with a golf club. Kaityn Dever delivers the “You don’t get to rush this” line exactly as her game counterpart did. When Ellie arrives on the scene, the direction largely follows in the footsteps of the original cutscene, using the same floor-level camera angles and high-pitched sound break as Abby deals the final blow. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lurking between the many game-accurate details are several changes, though. First and foremost is that Joel is with Dina for this scene, not Tommy. Furthermore, Dina is drugged for the whole event, which means Ellie is the only Jackson resident to witness Joel’s murder. Abby’s behaviour is also slightly different; in the show she reveals to Joel who she is and why she’s about to kill him. In the game there’s no such scene, and we’re left to believe that Joel died without truly knowing why Abby hated him so much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, and then there’s the matter of Abby’s hole in… well, not quite one. The game depicts the blow that finally kills Joel as a horrible bit of blunt force trauma to the skull, using the actual head of the golf club. In the show, the club is broken in Abby’s assault, and so all that’s left is the sharp broken end. Abby uses this as a shiv, stabbing it into Joel’s neck.     </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Abby’s Flashback</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/21/hospital-1745206166977.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Episode two features a sequence in which a young Abby searches the Fireflies’ hospital for her dad. It’s a recreation of the end of Tracking Lessons, the chapter of the game where the perspective shifts from Ellie to Abby. While the setting of this scene remains the same – the hospital corridor bathed in red emergency lighting – the actual events are rather different. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the show, older Abby confronts her younger self, cementing that this is a dream sequence rather than a flashback. Abby tells herself not to look inside the operating room, as she’ll have to see her dead father. Younger Abby does go into the operating room, but the camera does not follow, and so we’re left with just the older Abby’s restrained tears to relay the horror found inside. In the game, since you are in control of Abby, you get to see the inside of the room and Abby’s reaction to finding her father.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This reframing of the scene is likely due to its shifted position; in the game, this is the moment you learn that Abby’s father was killed in Joel’s attack on the Fireflies, and so the raw emotion of seeing Abby cry on the operating room flaw is necessary to humanise a character who has been portrayed as a villain for the prior 10 or so hours. The show reveals Abby’s motive from the very start and moves this sequence to much earlier in the story, and so it serves a different purpose.   </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Ellie’s Awkward Morning</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/21/jesse-1745206188367.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The most faithful scene recreation of episode two arrives when Jesse comes knocking at Ellie’s door to go out on patrol. What follows is an awkward exchange regarding Ellie and Dina’s kiss the previous night at the barn dance – Dina, of course, had only recently split up with Jesse. The dialogue here is a 95% match to the game’s script, and the camera work also does its best to recreate the conversation in exact detail. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The main difference here is context. In the game, the barn dance isn’t shown until right near the end of the campaign, and so when playing this sequence you’re using the information provided by the characters to piece together an event you’ve not witnessed. In the show, you know exactly what Jesse and Ellie are talking about, as you watched it happen in the previous episode.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bigot Sandwiches</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/21/sandwich-1745206205850.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Similar to Ellie’s conversation with Jesse, her encounter with Seth the morning after the dance is largely a 1:1 replication of the same scene in the game. Seth has once again prepared steak sandwiches as an apology, and much of the dialogue around this awkward exchange is taken straight from the game’s script. The main difference here is that Jesse is now part of the scene, and he thanks Seth for the sandwiches rather than Maria. Additionally, the building itself is visually very different to that in the game, looking more like a canteen than a timber-constructed bar.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Eugene’s Weed Farm</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/21/eugene-1745206220638.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The show sees Jesse and Ellie head out on a patrol that recreates the middle section of the game’s first chapter. Fans of the game will instantly notice a key difference, as Ellie’s discovery of Eugene’s weed farm actually takes place during the same patrol depicted in episode one where Ellie and Dina explore the supermarket. These events have been split up and changed, as it’s now Jesse, not Dina who accompanies Ellie. That means the show removes the sequence in which Ellie and Dina smoke weed and are implied to have sex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite this, there are still several key elements of the sequence that are kept intact. Ellie still discovers Eugene’s Firefly pendant, as well as his once-impressive marijuana operation (which is far less well hidden in the show.) Among the belongings scattered about, Ellie finds Eugene’s bong gas mask, which can also be found in the game. Jesse, however, is much less impressed with Eugene’s ingenuity than Dina was. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Abby’s Escape</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/21/fence-1745206236829.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Abby’s fateful encounter with the infected horde plays out much like it does in the game’s first chapter. A chase sequence results in Abby becoming trapped behind a chainlink fence that begins to collapse under the weight of the clawing runners. If anything, this sequence is even nastier than it was in the game thanks to a shot of a hand being pushed through the fence, the wire cutting through the flesh. Aside from that, the broad direction of this scene is very close to the framing of the game, right up to the way Joel’s revolver appears from the side of the shot to blast the infected that pins Abby to the ground. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more from The Last of Us, check out our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-spoiler-free">spoiler-free season two review</a> and our spoiler-filled review of the second episode.
