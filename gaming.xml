            <p>A new game was released yesterday on Steam depicting Russia's invasion of Ukraine, claiming to be "officially recommended by the Russian Military".</p>
<p>The free-to-play Squad 22: ZOV is a tactical shooter from developer SPN Studio and publisher Zarobana Entertainment and is the only release from either company.</p>
<p>The game has been widely reported as Russian propaganda, raising questions on how it's been allowed on Valve's Steam platform.</p>
<p>According to the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3573040/Squad_22_ZOV/">Steam description</a>, it allows players to experience the "complexities of the 2014 and 2022-2024 events through compelling campaigns". In 2014, President Putin signed the Crimea annexation, while 2022-2024 refers to the country's invasion of Ukraine.</p>
<p>While the game purports to be historically accurate through its basis on "people's experience and opinions during specific historical conflicts", it has also been "officially recommended by the Russian Military for use as a basic infantry tactic manual for cadet and Yunarmy training".</p>
<p>The modern Yunarmy, or the Young Army Cadets National Movement, was set up in 2015 by Putin to encourage young people to join the military. Now it appears officially recommending video games is part of this process. As shared on the game's website, Squad 22: ZOV was <a href="https://squad22.online/army2024/">exhibited at the Army 2024 event</a>.</p>
<p>The game's website also <a href="https://squad22.online/gameteam/">boasts special military consultants</a>, including "Hero of the Russian Federation" Vlad Golovin who commanded a platoon in the siege of Mariupol. This is included as a playable mission in the game, as well as the Russian Spring of 2014.</p>
<p>The ZOV in the title refers to the use of these letters on military equipment to show support for the invasion.</p>
<p>The game also allows players to "rescue hostages" and "capture prisoners", presumably from a Russian perspective, as well as "encounter and interact with civilians".</p>
<p>Incidentally, the developer has also admitted on the Steam page to using AI "as a base for work of our 2D artists and later drawn-over in order to make them genuine art".</p>
<p>Sources told Eurogamer the game presents players as Russian soldiers "liberating" real-life Ukrainian territories, adding the free-to-play game also includes paid content for specific campaigns. That means Valve is financially enabling a military-affiliated project, though it's unclear if the Russian Military is being indirectly funded through the developer's affiliation with the organisation.</p>
<p>The Steam page itself has become a hub for coordinated propaganda and hate speech. The game has a "mixed" reaction on the platform and recent reviews are predominantly negative, but older positive reviews include pro-Russian sentiment and disturbing comments.</p>
<p>A social media account linked on Steam to the game's developer includes a post suggesting Ukraine's refusal to surrender will provide "a lot of content to make more missions in our game" (thanks <a href="https://simulationdaily.com/news/steam-russian-military-propaganda-game/">Simulation Daily</a>).</p>
<p>Further, as spotted by <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2025/05/27/russian-army-backed-military-propaganda-game-squad-22-zov-listed-on-steam">Game Informer</a>, the <a href="https://cpd.gov.ua/en/results/how-russia-militarizes-society-through-computer-games/">Ukrainian Centre for Countering Disinformation</a> has already had its eye on Squad 22: ZOV, describing it as "a key element in brainwashing the population, reflecting the Russian government's version of events regarding the invasion of Ukraine and glorifying military service".</p>
<p>Back in 2018, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/1666776116200553082">Steam stated</a> its approach to content on its platform was "to allow everything onto the Steam Store, except for things that we decide are illegal, or straight up trolling". Instead, its focus is on giving users "control over what kinds of content they see".</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Valve for details on what moderation checks were taken ahead of Squad 22: ZOV's release, and whether the game will remain on the platform.</p>
<p>Valve has recently removed some controversial games from its Steam platform, including a game which described itself as "address[ing] the Israel x Palestine conflict from a Palestinian perspective" that was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/uk-counter-terrorism-unit-demands-steam-withdraw-controversial-shooter-from-sale">removed from sale in the UK following demands by the UK's counter-terrorism unit</a>.</p>
<p>More recently, the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-quietly-removes-explicit-game-featuring-extreme-sexual-violence-from-steam-in-uk">No Mercy was removed following widespread criticism</a> of its content depicting explicit sexual violence.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>I love Idea Factory, but the long-running Japanese game developer has had far more misses than hits lately. While a couple truly incredible JRPGs make up part of their lengthy list of releases, a majority of their output consists of half-baked spinoffs and undercooked genre shifts that even the most diehard of fans have struggled to enjoy. Amongst all that, though, I’ve always been impressed by the newly blossoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/08/14/death-end-request-2-review/">Death end re;Quest&nbsp;series</a>. Two releases in, these grim, gruesome JRPGs come with a unique gameplay twist and a focus on layered world-building that always kept me intrigued. I was excited to see Death end re;Quest: Code Z continue that streak of success, but unfortunately the third time is not the charm.</p>
<p><iframe title="Death end re;Quest: Code Z - Official Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1cvAuFb4Mds?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Instead of being a full-on sequel, Death end re;Quest: Code Z is a spinoff story laying down some potential groundwork for where a third full entry might go, but it expects you to be exhaustively familiar with the two prior games from the get-go. I can only barely remember the events of the last two games, leaving me with far more questions than I was comfortable with when hopping into this one.</p>


<p>In a way, the game is built to parallel that lack of knowledge – new protagoninst Sayaka is a blank slate in a strange alternate version of Earth that runs on binary code, the powers of mysterious entities known as Ludens, and the whims of a seemingly all-powerful cyber goddess named Iris. Unfortunately, instead of using our uninformed hero as a way to deliver helpful info to the player, characters hint at important things yet dodge Sayaka’s questions repeatedly. On top of that, the game incorporates a frequent fourth-wall break where the cast regularly acknowledges and talks to the player directly. It only serves to muddy the agency of Sayaka even more, and makes it clear that this game is more focused on delivering callbacks and easter eggs to well-informed fans than it is in crafting a cohesive story experience. It’s a huge departure from the approach to storytelling that the prior games had – two JRPGs that start out as standalone horror experiences before slowly unraveling into wild scifi narratives of AI-sentience and parallel worlds.</p>


<p>There isn’t just a major shift in the approach to storytelling, but in gameplay as well. Rather than the Hyperdimension Neptunia&nbsp;inspired turn-based combat of yore, this game plays out as a top-down grid-based dungeon crawler in the vein of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/05/pokemon-mystery-dungeon-rescue-team-dx-review/">Pokémon Mystery Dungeon</a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/23/shiren-the-wanderer-the-mystery-dungeon-of-serpentcoil-island-review/">Shiren The Wanderer</a>.&nbsp;I was honestly so excited about this switch-up, as I’ve been itching for more mystery dungeon experiences after loving the latest Shiren The Wandered.</p>
<p>For the most part, the mystery dungeon gameplay in Death end re;Quest: Code Z is… fine. Your build options and item variety are pretty limited, but there’s still enough going on that makes running through dungeons pretty engaging. The default difficulty option strips away the item and money loss on death, which neuters the roguelike risk-reward that is kind of necessary in a game like this.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, two specific gameplay mechanics bring the entire experience down from “just fine” to borderline unplayable. The first are Death Ends – these gruesome death scenes typically come with unique art CGs and visceral writing, but they are also your primary source of upgrade points in Death end re;Quest: Code Z.&nbsp;A pretty cool idea at first, but eventually you’ll be forced to grind out missing Death Ends by purposefully dying to fodder enemies or replaying dungeons far more times than I would have liked.</p>

<p>There’s also the Sanity meter – every action you take or damage you suffer lowers this meter, and at zero you can’t see anything and your character begins attacking themself. The only way to restore Sanity is through a healing item you have very rare and random odds of encountering. If you’re trying to die to a specific lower-level enemy for a Death End, you’ll almost constantly die from Sanity self-harm before the enemy can actually land the killing blow. It’s an absurd mix of clashing underbaked systems that soured the entire experience for me.</p>
<p>I’m so into the idea of a sci-fi horror mystery dungeon game, but Death end re;Quest: Code Z just isn’t it. Diehard fans will probably enjoy the focus on character interaction and deeper worldbuilding in this game, but the amount of frustrating gameplay hurdles you need to jump through to experience it all just doesn’t feel worthwhile. I would love to see this gameplay improved and expanded on for a sequel, but knowing Idea Factory’s track record, we likely never will.</p>

		Death end re;Quest: Code Z is a major fumble for what has so far been Idea Factory's most promising franchise yet. The idea of a sci-fi horror mystery dungeon adventure is right up my alley, but confusing writing and frustrating gameplay mechanics hold this one back and make it one of the most frustrating games I've played all year.	</p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-no-dlc-plans/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Kojima Productions currently has no plans to release episodic DLC content for Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, as Hideo Kojima thinks releasing this type of content is no longer a trend.</p>
<p>Speaking during the 19th episode of his KOJI10 radio show, as reported on X by <a href="https://x.com/naven0m" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NV</a>, the legendary game designer discussed the possibility of the second entry in the series getting paid DLC expansions after launch, confirming that there are currently no plans for this sort of content, as he thinks it is no longer a trend to release this sort of content. Plans, however, may change in the future in this regard. For now, Kojima-san revealed that the studio plans to support the game after launch with bug fixes and improvements, possibly adding something that didn't exist in the first entry in the series.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of the KOJI10 radio show, Hideo Kojima also revealed that Death Stranding 2: On the Beach originally featured some sort of hair system. This system involved Sam cutting his hair and shaving his beard, which would both grow back as time passed. Players could trim the beard, dye the hair, and so on by standing in front of a dedicated mirror. The system, however, eventually ended up getting scrapped as Sam isn't just a customizable, player-created avatar.</p>
<p>During the radio show, Hideo Kojima also discussed the original concept of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, which he confirmed <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-gaming-hardware-will-ultimately-vanish-death-stranding-2-was-rewritten-to-resonate-more-with-players/">a few years back</a> to have changed following the COVID pandemic in 2020. Initially, he planned on releasing a 1.5 expansion of the original that would be centered around exploring the other continents in a world where flight is impossible. As the idea of DLC became outdated, however, the plan was scrapped, and he began working on a full-fledged sequel that was also scrapped due to the pandemic, and the only thing that has been kept of the original concept is the opening, which was originally meant to be something like a post-credits scene for Death Stranding Director's Cut to bridge the gap between the first and the second entry in the series.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/persona-4-remake-is-on-the-way-according-to-one-annoyed-voice-actor<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A voice actor who featured in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/persona-4-golden">Persona 4</a> has let slip that a remake of the school days <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-11-best-jrpgs-on-pc-in-2024">JRPG</a> is in the works, mostly because he's frustrated the developers don't want him back to perform as his original character. Yuri Lowenthal, who played clumsy bicycle crasher Yosuke in the original 2008 game, expressed some revealing annoyance with developers Atlus in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/yurilowenthal.bsky.social/post/3lqad6pjmrs2r">a post</a> on social media that has since been deleted.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"And for those who keep asking, no, I will not be returning as Yosuke for the Persona 4 remake," he said. "I asked. Maybe I even begged, but they don’t want me to come back."</p>
<p>That's not an undeniable signal fire proving the remake's existence, but it is some very billowy smoke. Lowenthal has appeared in the Persona series before, and he was the voice of Eiichiro in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/persona-3-reload">Persona 3 Reload</a>, the recent remake of that entry. So he's close enough to the studio to maybe know a thing or two about what's going on. He's also voiced a certain neighbourhood webslinger in various Spider-Man games over the years, as well as Mylo from Arcane, and absolute sidequest liability <a href="https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Johnny_(Final_Fantasy_VII)">Johnny</a> in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy VII</a> remakes. </p>
<p>He's not the only one seemingly snubbed by Atlus. Erin Fitzgerald, the voice of Chie, has also complained of the developers' reluctance to have her return, as noticed by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/persona/former-persona-4-actors-seemingly-keep-revealing-a-new-jrpg-remake-from-atlus-by-confirming-they-wont-be-in-it-i-have-not-been-asked-to-reprise-my-role/">Gamesradar</a>. 

</p><p>"For those asking, I have not been asked to reprise my role as Chie Satonaka in the Persona 4 remake," she said in <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/erinfitzgerald.bsky.social/post/3lqbi6257w22d">her own post</a>. "I am blessed to have recorded as many Persona 4 games as I did playing her."</p>
<p>Hopes for a Persona 4 remake have persisted among fans, I'm told, since the third game got its makeover. Meanwhile, many folks are doubtless frothing at the mouth for a Persona 6 announcement, which has yet to materialise, with Atlus instead announcing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yet-another-persona-5-spinoff-is-launching-next-month-this-time-a-gacha-game-with-a-new-group-of-phantom-thieves">yet another Persona 5 spinoff</a> earlier this month. </p>
<p>Whether a remake is strictly necessary is another thing. A PC remaster of Persona 4 came out in 2020 in the form of Persona 4 Golden, which our Edwin called "a twisting tale of dreams gone rogue in a town sapped of purpose" in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/persona-4-golden-review">his review</a>. If you want a second opinion, my cousin - who just phoned me to chat and who delayed this article from being written by at least one hour - instructed me to review all Persona games with the following single-sentence summary: "Too much text." And you know what? I might agree. 100 hours to complete a game? Please. I barely think I have 100 hours left to live.</p>

                <p>Earlier this week, CD Projekt Red confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2-is-officially-the-2077-sequels-name-at-least-for-now/1100-6531871/" data-ref-id="1100-6531871">the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel is now in pre-production</a>. For the moment, the project is also being internally called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6526333/">Cyberpunk 2</a>. However, the newfound foreword momentum doesn't mean that Cyberpunk 2 will be arriving anytime soon. CDPR co-CEO Michał Nowakowski has indicated that the sequel may be years away from release.</p><p>"Our journey from the pre-production to the final release date takes four to five years on average," Nowakowski said during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/-nOVGBRC3N0?si=MjhFgWy8svAGR2X4&amp;t=1268" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CD Projekt Red's investor presentation</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/cyberpunk/asked-about-cyberpunk-2-release-date-cdpr-boss-reiterates-our-journey-from-the-pre-production-to-the-final-release-takes-4-to-5-years-on-average-but-each-project-is-unique/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>). "Having said that, and keeping in mind that each project is unique and there are many variables that influence the final outcome, I will not lead you into specific years."</p><p>If that leads Cyberpunk 2 to a 2030 or 2031 release date, that means it would arrive a decade or longer after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-review/1900-6417622/" data-ref-id="1900-6417622">Cyberpunk 2077</a> was released. It's also likely to fall in the next generation of consoles, presumably on PlayStation 6 and whatever comes after Xbox Series X|S.</p><p>The bulk of CDPR's resources currently appears to be focused on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a>, which only started pre-production late last year. CD Projekt Red North America is working on Cyberpunk 2, and a recent job posting for the game suggested that the developer wants the sequel to have "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cd-projekt-red-wants-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-to-have-most-realistic-crowds-ever/1100-6529613/" data-ref-id="1100-6529613">the most-realistic crowds ever</a>."</p><p>Mike Pondsmith--the creator of the Cyberpunk franchise--isn't directly working on Cyberpunk 2.

			<p>The rumored Persona 4 remake will likely feature an entirely new voice cast, as another actress won't be returning to voice one of the main characters.</p>
<p>Speaking on Bluesky, Erin Fitzgerald, who voiced Chie Satonaka in every Persona 4 game except the original PlayStation 2 release, confirmed they were not asked to reprise the role. With Yuri Lowenthal also <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-seemingly-confirmed-by-spider-man/">confirmed</a> not to play Yosuke in the remake, it's looking more and more like the remake will have a brand new voice cast, which wouldn't be surprising, considering the same happened in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/persona-3-reload-review/">Persona 3 Reload,</a> the remake of the third entry in the series developed by ATLUS released last year.</p>

<p>A Persona 4 remake has been rumored to be in the works for a while, but an official announcement has yet to be made. If the game is launching before Persona 6, however, it will likely be announced before long, possibly during any of the upcoming not-E3 summer showcases. These include the annual Summer Game Fest showcase on June 6th, of which the series' publisher SEGA is one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-has-record-setting-60-partners-for-this-years-showcase/">partners</a>, and the Xbox Games Showcase on June 8th.</p>
<p>According to rumors, the Persona 4 remake isn't the only project that will bring back older entries of the series to modern gaming platforms. A remaster of Persona 2 is <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-persona-2-remaster-development/">reportedly</a> also in the works, and it will feature not only both entries in the series, Innocent Sin and Eternal Punishment, but also a new translation. This remaster should be released on all current generation consoles, including the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, Electronic Arts (EA) <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-report-reveals-ea-canceled-black-panther-game-and-shut-down-cliffhanger-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the closure of Cliffhanger Games, a Seattle-based studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-new-studio-led-by-middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-veteran-kevin-stephens/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> six years ago by Kevin Stephens, who previously worked as Vice President and Studio Head on Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. Cliffhanger Games was working on an original Black Panther game.</p>
<p>Exactly a month ago, EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">laid off</a> around 300–400 employees at Respawn Entertainment, too, and it may not be over yet. <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1927820651370271111?t=55cOa-shSeAFKbqb3REK9A&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to the Spanish insider eXtas1s</a>, the publisher could be preparing to shut down Codemasters' central headquarters, removing another 400 developers or so.</p>
<p><em>I have learned that around 400 more layoffs are coming at EA, the total closure of Codemasters' headquarters, and that those developers will be integrated into EA Sports (F1) and a new Need For Speed that is already in development.</em></p>
<p>This would be another major blow to the games industry, which has suffered many closures and layoff rounds in the first half of 2025 after a couple of tough years.</p>
<p>EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/codemasters-might-be-actually-acquired-by-ea-instead-of-take-two-according-to-a-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed</a> Take-Two as the buyer of Codemasters on the finishing line. Take-Two had offered nearly a billion dollars, but Electronic Arts closed the deal at $1.2 billion. After the acquisition, Codemasters CEO Frank Sagnier <a href="https://wccftech.com/codemasters-ceo-ea-is-like-our-cinderella-shoe-a-perfect-fit-they-listen-but-dont-force-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claimed</a> Electronic Arts was a perfect fit.</p>
<p>However, Codemasters suffered major restructuring in the last four years at the hands of its new owner. Three years ago, the Cheshire-based team <a href="https://wccftech.com/codemasters-cheshire-will-join-criterion-to-work-on-need-for-speed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was merged with Criterion</a> to work on Need for Speed. In late 2023, EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-interactive-suffers-embracers-restructuring-codemasters-also-hit-by-layoffs-at-ea/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">performed</a> a first round of layoffs at Codemasters. Just a few weeks, we also <a href="https://wccftech.com/codemasters-shows-off-f1-25-gameplay-confirms-wrc-games-are-on-pause/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that the studio won't be making any more WRC games, as the license was reacquired by <a href="https://wccftech.com/nacon-is-once-again-publishing-wrc-games-new-wrc-series-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nacon</a>.</p>
<p>It appears that EA is positioning Codemasters to be solely focused on making new Formula 1 games. On that note, F1 25 was just released, and you can read Chris Wray's take on it <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/f1-25-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>:</p>
<p><em>F1 25 is a good game, make no mistake about that. With a near-flawless presentation, improved my team mode, and additional features, there's a lot to do. There are a few pitfalls here and there, but nothing that takes away from what is another genuinely good release by Codemasters.</em></p>

            <p>Nintendo has updated its mobile app ahead of the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s launch, including GameChat functionality and its improved screenshot upload feature.</p>
<p>Previously known as the Nintendo Switch Online mobile app, it's now named Nintendo Switch App in line with the change.</p>
<p>The Album feature is particularly welcome, as screenshots and videos taken on a Switch 2 console will be automatically uploaded to the app ready to be saved and shared.</p>

<p>Previously, players would need to scan a QR code on the console to link to their mobile device, which was a clunky process. Now it will work just like the PlayStation and Xbox equivalent apps.</p>
<p>GameChat notifications have also been added to the app. This is the new social feature on Switch 2 that allows players to voice or video chat with each other while playing.</p>
<p>Notifications for GameChat will now appear on the app, letting you know you've been invited to a call.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Nintendo / Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>

<p>Another inclusion on the app will be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/achievements-can-be-earned-in-switch-2-editions-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom">Zelda Notes feature</a>, used in both <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a>. This will include achievements, a voice navigation guide, and all-new voice memories not in the original versions.</p>
<p>Though featured on the app, Zelda Notes will be added on Switch 2 release day - 5th June.</p>
<p>Last week, we reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-gamechat-feature-requires-a-mobile-phone-number">GameChat will require users to register a phone number</a> to use. The GameChat website states as an "additional security measure" text message verification "is required to set up GameChat".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-reportedly-already-out-in-the-wild-but-needs-a-day-one-update-to-function">Some Switch 2 consoles are now out in the hands of the public</a> ahead of its release next week, with videos appearing online of the console being unboxed and its initial startup menus - though they're no longer available to view online. However, the console requires a day one update to function, meaning it's not yet playable.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>CD Projekt Red has announced that Cyberpunk 2 is entering into pre-production, ditching its ‘Project Orion’ codename that was used since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/04/a-full-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-is-planned-by-cd-projekt-red/">the project was confirmed back in 2022</a>.</p>
<p>CDPR has to give regular updates to investors, and in the latest report, the studio has now confirmed the latest progress – this follows on from a March update where Project Orion was said to be nearing the end of its concept phase and heading into pre-production “in the coming weeks”.</p>


<p>With the jump, the game’s development is now being branded as Cyberpunk 2, though that isn’t necessarily what the game will be called upon release. Speaking to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/675651/cd-projekt-red-cyberpunk-2-project-orion">The Verge</a>, this “just means it’s another game in the Cyberpunk universe.”</p>
<p>The Cyberpunk 2 team will likely start to grow pretty quickly over the coming months, as it’s now 94-strong (up from 84 earlier this year). This is the CD Projekt Red North America team, combining locations in Vancouver and Boston (which was founded in 2022/3). Separately, the 422-strong Polish team is hard at work on The Witcher 4, and there’s other smaller teams working on Project Sirius and Project Hadar.</p>
<p>Somewhere within all of that, CDPR’s also been producing the Nintendo Switch 2 port of Cyberpunk 2077 internally. That is set to launch alongside the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> next week on 5th June.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s sequel has shed its Project Orion codename and will now be known as... Cyberpunk 2. CD Projekt revealed the name change in their <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/media/news/cd-projekt-wraps-up-the-beginning-of-2025/">latest earnings results</a>, according to which the new Cyberpunk <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> has just entered pre-production - roughly defined, the point in a game's gestation when designers, artists, programmers and so forth meet to flesh out the concept, but before they've actually started making anything that's supposed to form part of the finished game. There are now 96 people working on the thing, versus 422 for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>, 49 on multiplayer Witcher spin-off Project Sirius, and 19 for an unannounced original game, Project Hadar.</p>
<p>The grousing, dilettante reader will object that this is scant material for a news post, especially given that CD Projekt are offering no guarantees that "Cyberpunk 2" will be the project's final name - as they commented to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/675651/cd-projekt-red-cyberpunk-2-project-orion">Verge</a>, Cyberpunk 2 "just means it's another game in the Cyberpunk universe." But the dextrous maven of online news-mongering will notice that "Cyberpunk 2" is, in fact, an extremely compact and subtle piece of worldbuilding.</p> <!--more-->
<p>After all, Cyberpunk 2077 is set in the year 2077 CE. By logical extrapolation, Cyberpunk 2 is set in the year 2. Combine that with a hint from Cyberpunk tabletop creator Mike Pondsmith that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-sequel-will-see-you-return-to-night-city-and-head-to-a-new-city-described-as-chicago-gone-wrong">nu-Cyberpunk will take place in Chicago</a>, and we can make deductions about Cyberpunk 2's setting by copy-pasting bits of this randomly googled <a href="http://livinghistoryofillinois.com/pdf_files/Timeline%20of%20Illinois%20History.pdf">Living History Of Illinois</a>, with its trust-inspiring emblem of a sickly and loquacious bald eagle attempting to disentangle itself from a discarded shield.</p>
<p>Here is what the nauseous avian scholars of the Living History of Illinois think occurred in the years 500 BC to 900 AD: maize agriculture, village-building, burial mounds, pottery, and the invention of the bow and arrow. That's pretty much a video game, right there. But is it a Cyberpunk game? I have now completed a forensic control+F search on that PDF several hundred times, and can disclose zero mention of "ripperdocs", "braindancing", or "taxi missions that are secretly better than the main storyline". If the indigenous peoples who lived on the banks of what would later be called the Mississippi River had access to aerodynes and quickhacking, they kept it on the down-low. Possibly instead of aerodynes they had barfing bald eagles.</p>
<p>CD Projekt have yet to explicitly confirm anything about the new Cyberpunk's setting, beyond saying that they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-project-devs-want-to-call-out-big-problems-like-homelessness-and-the-wealth-gap-in-cyberpunk-2077-sequel">want to explore problems like homelessness and the wealth gap</a>. I'd email them a link to this report, asking for a statement, but I love CD Projekt like my very own children, and do not wish to encumber them with some abject nonsense. You, on the other hand, are welcome to leave a comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The free-to-play monster hunting game has been around since 2019, but after a change in studio ownership and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fae-farm-and-dauntless-developer-lays-off-majority-of-the-studio/1100-6529054/" data-ref-id="1100-6529054">sweeping layoffs</a>, Dauntless will no longer be playable in any form after today.</p><p>Often compared to Monster Hunter, but more beginner-friendly, Dauntless was generally well-reviewed when it first released in 2019 after just over a year in early access. The game was an early adopter of cross-progression and cross-play, initially releasing across PC, PS4, and Xbox One.</p><p>In 2023, developer Phoenix Labs was quietly acquired by blockchain company Forte Labs, around the same time as the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dauntless-developer-is-the-latest-studio-to-suffer-significant-layoffs/1100-6513740/" data-ref-id="1100-6513740">laid off around 9% of its workforce</a>.

		<p>You might not have heard of Katowice. It was, for many years, the industrial heart of Poland, specialising in steel and coal mining, a place where the natural resources were tapped into, smelted, refined and shipped off across Europe. It has a reputation as being a tough, grimy, polluted area, but in 2025, that couldn’t be further from the truth.</p>
<p>In the modern day, it’s an economic, educational and industrial centre within the country. Gorgeously green and leafy in the late May sunlight, a culture hub that’s been built on the former site of a coal mine is a clear visual and ideological indication of the city’s changing outlook. Crucially, it showcases the transition that the area is undergoing, from its previous, traditional focus on heavy manufacturing and mining, to new technologies, including gaming.</p>
<p>Education lies at the centre of that step into the future. There are now 12 universities based here, 7 of which offer game industry-specific courses. Their integration into the local and national economy ensures that Katowice is a city that is focused on the future. In particular, the city’s leaders that we’re meeting with are keen to emphasise the area’s knowledge and proficiency in the sciences, and the awards and accolades that Katowice, and the wider Silesian area has accrued, including its most recent inclusion in the Top 10 Large European Cities of the Future 2025.</p>



<p>We’re here for gaming, though. We were able to spend time with the Katowice team from Keywords Studios, a global support and publishing company that’s tapping into the local talent here, and locally-based Anshar Studio, whose burgeoning publishing business sits alongside their well-established development team. There are 50 game dev and esports companies in the Silesian area, with 22 of those based in Katowice itself, making up around 10% of the entire country’s gaming industry.</p>

<p>Lukasz Szewczyk, QA Manager at Keywords Studios, tells us, “We work with the biggest publishers in the world, through to small companies, and we support them through the whole development process; testing, translating, and testing the localisation. There’s actually three Keywords Studios entities in Poland now.” I asked the team whether this is a good time to be in Katowice, and Michal Niechial, their QA Project Manager, was frank, telling me, “10 years ago, I wouldn’t say it was a desert for Polish game dev here, but it was definitely behind cities like Krakow and Warsaw. Once we came here, a lot of things started to gain momentum, and other local studios like Anshar started to grow as well.” When you see their brand new offices looking out across the entirety of Katowice and the surrounding countryside – there’s a slide from one floor to another, a cinema room, rows of PlayStation 5s in a shared gaming space and even rooms to take a nap in – you can see that business is good.</p>
<p>They’re tapping into local talent here as well, with many students from local universities working at Keyword part-time as QA testers. It’s clearly a great entry point into the industry, and for many gamers it sounds like it’s almost a perfect job. Lukasz laughs, “I wish that everyone knew that working in QA, testing games, is not playing games!” The whole team are very clear, though, that the collaboration between their company and the universities works both ways, with internships and visits ensuring that they’re helping to develop the games industry professionals of the future, while creating the kind of studio environment that’s perfectly in tune with Gen Z.</p>
<p>Katowice’s transformation is an ongoing project. Beginning in the 1990s, with the fall of communism in the region, and the country’s subsequent membership in the EU, Katowice’s transformation has been years in the making, but that is now being reflected in its accolades, first with its certification as a UNESCO City of Music in 2015, and continuing through to 2024’s title as Poland’s City of Science. Alexander Szlachetko calls this “Starting a new part of our story”, and it’s obvious that there’s a real sense of pride with what has been achieved, and what is still to come.</p>

<p>An all-new Gaming Technology hub is being built, once more, on the site of a former mine – Katowice had a lot of mines – and it’s due to open in 2028, with a huge, 4 stage plan to turn the 31 square kilometre area into a modern and forward-thinking zone for the gaming industry. 200 million Euros of initial investment are going into this area, and they’re already fielding interest from local, national and global partners.</p>
<p>Unknown to me, Katowice is also one of the world’s esports landmarks. ESL, the world’s #1 tournament organiser, alongside gaming platform FACEIT, lead the way globally in putting on some of the biggest tournaments and events in the world. Dreamhack is also based here, a gaming lifestyle festival that operates multiple events around the world each year.</p>
<p>ESL itself is based out of EFG Poland, a massive hub here that’s built around gaming, TV and the wider media, with 8000 m<sup>2</sup> of office space and five TV studios, that allows companies a complete esport production package, from organisation for events through to management and hosting.</p>
<p>IEM (Intel Extreme Masters) Katowice, one of the world’s biggest, most iconic events – hosted at the instantly recgonisable Spodek arena – has happened here since 2013, making Katowice the capital of esports, and a place that fans from around the world have descended on each year. Aleksander Szlachetko, Managing Director of the ESL FACEIT Group laughs, saying, “The only difference is that the tickets to the arena sell out quicker each year!”.</p>

<p>It’s clear that Katowice, and the larger Silesian area, is of huge importance to Poland’s position within the global gaming market. It’s investing, building and tailoring the area to make it as attractive as possible for companies and startups looking for a progressive and technologically and economically supportive area. That’s further helped by the region’s position as a Special Economic Zone, and one which has been ranked in first place within Europe multiple times in the past decade.</p>
<p>It feels as though Poland is ready to become a true leader in the global gaming industry. Proven successes from the country, such as The Witcher 3, Cyberpunk, Dying Light and Frostpunk, are showcasing the talent and creativity that’s here, while also attracting developers and publishers from around the world. Katowice may not be a name that everybody in the industry knows in this moment, but it feels as though that’s all about to change.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/former-sony-exec-labels-microsoft%E2%80%99s-approach-to-gaming-subscriptions-as-%E2%80%98dangerous%E2%80%99.1201332/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/former-sony-exec-labels-microsofts-approach-to-gaming-subscriptions-as-dangerous/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Former Sony executive Shuhei Yoshida was interviewed by the website <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/shuhei-yoshida-warns-subscription-services-could-become-dangerous-for-developers" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game Developer</a> during the recent Gamescom LATAM event, where he spoke, among other things, about the different approaches that Microsoft and Sony have to gaming subscriptions like Game Pass and PlayStation Plus. Yoshida, who was president of Sony's Worldwide Studios group for eleven years (2008-2019) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/shuhei-yoshida-leaving-sony-interactive-entertainment-on-january-15-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left the company in January,</a> called Microsoft's stance 'dangerous' for developers:</p>
<p><em>If the only way for people to play games is through subscriptions that's really dangerous, because what type of games can be created will be dictated by the owner of the subscription services. That's really, really risky because there always must always be fresh new ideas tried by small developers that create the next wave of development. But if the big companies dictate what games can be created, I don't think that will advance the industry.</em></p>
<p><em>I believe the way Sony approached subscriptions is healthier. You know, not to overpromise and to allow people to spend money to buy the new games. After a couple of years, there won't be many people willing to buy those games at that initial price, so they'll be added to the subscription service, and there'll be more people to try those products in time for the next game in the franchise to come out.</em></p>
<p>Of course, it's unsurprising that he would align more with Sony's policy against adding day-one first-party games to subscriptions. However, it should be noted that Microsoft has stressed on many occasions that they have absolutely no intention of ever removing the customer's ability to purchase games separately from Game Pass. It was always designed as an additive way to engage, not a complete replacement of direct purchases.</p>
<p>Following his departure from Sony, Yoshida also talked about other topics. A few months ago, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-studios-ceo-is-not-forcing-teams-to-work-on-live-service-games-shuhei-yoshida-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stressed</a> that the man who replaced him as the head of PlayStation Studios, Hermen Hulst, isn't forcing any of the first-party studios to work on live service games.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-will-be-even-better-than-tsushima-says-shuhei-yoshida/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> that he played quite a bit of Ghost of Yōtei before leaving Sony, and it's shaping up to be even better than Ghost of Tsushima. Ghost of Yōtei is now set to <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a> on October 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/debugging-hero-is-a-cute-hack-n-slash-where-you-tweak-enemy-stats-on-the-fly<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>I've never been so happy to see a spike trap as I was in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/debugging-hero">Debugging Hero</a>. At the start of each combat encounter, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3406850/Debugging_Hero/">the demo</a> for this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelite</a> hack n' slash hands you several numeric cards and lets you pause the game to view both your and your enemies' stats: health, damage, and durability. You then drag the cards on to the relevant stat to modify it, then unpause to continue real-time combat.</p>
<p>It's a cute gimmick, letting you knock down high health enemies to a manageable number, or kill weak ones outright, or heal yourself. But it felt a tad shallow to carry a whole game, even one with dodges and parries in its real-time combat. Then, I entered a room with a trap tile that thrust sharpened spikes upwards at timed intervals, and realised I could manipulate the timer. I tuned it right down, and raucously chortled like a portly racoon at the bakery bins as it pneumatically skewered my idiot attackers.</p>

<p>When I fought the first boss, I noticed I could also slow down his attack intervals, letting me poke with relative impunity for long stretches. You can also mess with projectiles like arrows, slowing them down or reducing their damage. Whether Debugging Hero stays interesting is definitely going to rely on how many new ideas it introduces past the demo - even then, I don't think it's going for something like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-baba-is-you">Baba Is You</a>'s depth. But, being the Adorno to Edwin's Benjamin in the seminal Marge Simpson School Of Potato Critique, I am compelled to award Debugging Hero our most prestigious accolade: it's neat. The game's out tomorrow, May 30th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>In 2023 EA opened a new studio named Cliffhanger Games, led by former Monolith head Kevin Stephens, and announced a new third-person, singleplayer game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-and-marvel-announce-a-black-panther-game-set-in-wakanda">starring Marvel's Black Panther</a>. They've now cancelled that game and shut down that studio, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-games">IGN report</a>.</p>
<p>According to EA Entertainment president Laura Miele, via an email sent to employees, this has been done to "sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Additionally, both EA's mobile and central teams will see an unconfirmed number of layoffs - understood by IGN to be less than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/respawn-reportedly-lay-off-staff-across-apex-legends-and-star-wars-jedi-teams-cancel-two-incubation-projects">the 300 workers laid off in April</a>. From the report:</p>
<blockquote>"These decisions are hard," Miele wrote. "They affect people we’ve worked with, learned from, and shared real moments with. We’re doing everything we can to support them — including finding opportunities within EA, where we’ve had success helping people land in new roles.</blockquote>
<p>EA are reportedly making efforts to find affected workers other roles within the company, via an internal placement programs. "Our partnership with Marvel remains strong and our multi-title, long-term collaboration continues," Miele told IGN, while also saying in the original email that EA would be focusing on Battlefield, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a>, Skate, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> going forward.</p>
<p>EA employees were left "upset and confused" at a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-employees-upset-and-confused-at-return-to-office-mandate">return to office mandate</a> earlier this month. In-person work, said CEO Andrew Wilson in an email to employees, leads to "a kinetic energy that fuels creativity, innovation, and connection, often resulting in unexpected breakthroughs that lead to incredible experiences for our players". Last year, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ceo-andrew-wilson-tells-ea-staff-5-of-them-will-be-laid-off-via-empty-and-infuriating-email">EA laid off 5% of their workforce</a>, (around 670). Despite these recent layoffs, the company now employs 800 more people than this time last year, <a href="http://www.gamefile.news/p/wait-a-minute-eas-headcount-rose">report Game File</a> (paywalled). IGN note this is likely due to EA increasing the size of core teams, which scans with Miele's stated focus on a few select game series.</p>
<p>Between them, Andrew Wilson and Laura Miele <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-execs-earned-60-million-in-2024-despite-layoffs-and-office-closures">took home around $40 million</a> in 2024.</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="https://youtu.be/EGpW3RvZP2o">good video on the EA-published Spore</a> I watched some of last night. When <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spore">Spore</a> was released, it shipped with some undisclosed dodgy DRM software named Securom that limited each copy to three device installs via a code. If you happened to upgrade your hardware during this time, there's a chance you would have been locked out of playing the game you bought. Partly as a result, Spore remains one of the most pirated games of all time, although whether you should pirate every product Andrew Wilson has a hand in from now until the end of time is the sort of question you'll have to answer yourself.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p><em>HoloParade</em> is a fan game of hololive and the first title to serve as a test case for holo Indie. Collect, nurture, and enjoy watching your favorite characters! It’s a 2D tower defense game that offers depth, strategy, and can also be enjoyed casually.</p><p>To hololive fans:</p><p>This game is designed for players who enjoy strategy and trial and error, and involves exploring various formations and play styles suited to each stage. With stages featuring a variety of characteristics and characters having their specific strengths and weaknesses, please note that you cannot easily clear all stages with just your favorite characters. With careful character development and strategic gameplay, you can clear stages up to the end credits with a favorite formation, but subsequent high-difficulty stages will require formations tailored to the enemies.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Simple Yet Deep, Lively Battles</strong><ul><li>The basic system is a classic 2D tower defense game where you summon characters from your base and march them forward to destroy the enemy’s base to win. While the controls are simple, the gameplay is profoundly deep. With over 65 characters, each possessing a variety of abilities like ally healing support and self-destruct attacks, skillful combination and flexible formation are key to enjoying the game.</li><li>Additionally, there’s an element inspired by parades called the “Symphony Effect,” where various effects are activated based on the musical instruments played by the characters in march. This adds further strategic depth to the formation of your parade squad and the order of their summoning.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Comprehensive Development Elements</strong><ul><li>In addition to leveling up and limit breaking, there is a “Skill” system that allows you to add special abilities not available through regular development. Since you can add up to three types of skills to each character and select them carefully, you can enjoy a unique development process! Furthermore, since you can reset levels and get a full refund of the coins spent, it allows for more freedom in restructuring formations and character development.</li></ul></li><li><strong>No <a title="Genres > Gacha" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/gacha">Gacha</a> Purchases, No Stamina System</strong><ul><li>The scout gacha, which allows you to acquire characters, can be used by consuming tickets obtained within the game, with no additional purchases required. Also, as there is no stamina system, you are not bound by time and can play as much as you like, whenever you like.</li><li>Moreover, the scout gacha allows you to choose from two randomly selected character candidates, enabling players to make selections based on their strategy or preference rather than leaving it entirely to chance.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Take a Break with Various Talents and Mini-Games in the Office</strong><ul><li>When you return to the office, the home screen, you’ll be greeted by newly recorded voice lines from Harusaki Nodoka, a staff member of hololive.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreigns-concept-artist-on-making-nightreign-feel-familiar-but-also-different-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">FromSoftware games have always had a very distinct visual style, So much so, that it's usually pretty easy to predict when that iconic "FromSoftware" logo is about to pop up after a sudden fade to black, even in an announced game trailer for an upcoming FromSoft game. This is thanks to the many talented artists at the studio, and during my time at their office, I got a chance to sit down with one of them, Concept and Environmental Artist Saori Mizuno, to talk about her inspirations, the art direction she was given for Elden Ring Nightreign, and how it differed from her work on previous FromSoft games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: So generally, what was different about working on Nightreign versus the base Elden Ring game, or and anything prior that you have worked on with FromSoftware?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Saori Mizuno - Concept Artist on Elden Ring: Nightreign: </strong>In general, for Nightreign, we would receive an order for a design and then if it was myself in charge of that particular concept, then I would iterate on that image that I had, that interpretation of the design and then I would align and collaborate with the other designers and eventually produce the final design. I think one aspect that changed a lot on Nightreign's design process is that we had a lot of back and forth, a lot of brainstorming in person, actually speaking about these designs rather than just getting text-based feedback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interviewer:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Can you talk a little bit about the setting of Nightreign and how you approach making it feel distinct from the base Elden Ring game, despite it being a spinoff that uses a lot of the same assets?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We didn't want to make it feel too different from Elden Ring, as it used that as a base for the design and the setting. But one specific direction we did get early on was to create something that first feels and looks familiar and gradually transforms into the unfamiliar and into the unknown. So that was a nice sort of policy or a direction that we had to approach with the design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elden Ring had this sort of very gorgeous painterly feel to a lot of the environments, but we wanted Nightreign to feel like at a glance beautiful, but if you look a little bit deeper, there's something sinister and there's something darker there. Elden Ring, maybe there's a lot of bright colors in the scenery and in the sky box and such, but we wanted there also, the player to feel a sense of darkness there as well. So that was another aspect of the design that differed slightly from Elden Ring.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We didnt want to make it feel too different from Elden Ring."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>One of the locations that really stuck out to me was the Roundtable Hold, which is such a familiar location in the base Elden Ring, and it has such an interesting twist in Nightreign. Can you talk a little bit about what went into the new design for the Roundtable Hold and what were some of the inspirations behind some of those changes?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Nightreign's new kind of speedier, high-tempo gameplay, we wanted the Roundtable this time in particular to feel like somewhere you could relax and take your time and sort of cool off after that intense three day/night cycle. So we wanted it to feel, from a design perspective, more cozy and more welcoming, more at home. One inspiration was the Fire Link Shrine from Dark Souls 1, where you feel sort of more embraced by the atmosphere. You feel like you are coming home after these hardships, after a hard fought battle, and safe more importantly than anything.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So from a design perspective, we used techniques such as gentle lighting, a feeling of the surrounding environs as well as the Roundtable Hold itself. And also while a lot of the place is in ruins, we didn't want it to feel completely destroyed and desolate. We wanted it to feel like it was a safe place to come home to and that the player could relax and take their time there.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/28/eldenring-nightreign-09-4k-1748468862562.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Another impetus for the design of the Roundtable Hold in Nightreign was this feeling of early morning, so a sort of daybreak, dawn, the player setting off on a new adventure. So that came into some of the lighting and architecture choices that changed in Nightreign, and we wanted the player to be aware of this. We wanted them to be conscious of this when setting out on this new adventure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So when the player hits day three, they're transported to this brand new location that is really unlike any other in Elden Ring. One that is predominantly white, mixed in with a very colorful sky box full of orange, blue and purple kind of all mixing together. What's the story behind this environment and what were some of the inspirations that went into that work? If you need a visual representation, I have this one.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">So one of the first requests we got from the director regarding this environment was that it should feel like a sense of finality and we should get this feeling of buildup before a storm. And that we should also feel like the impression you got from the sky box is that the sky is falling, this calamity is coming to an end. So it's the boss at the end of the third day, so we wanted the player to feel this tightness in their chest like they're getting ready to embark on something greater than themselves and hopefully this culminates and comes through in the design.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/28/nightreign-02-1748468918611.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">To add to that, looking again at the colors and the composition of the sky, we wanted it to feel like something was about to be born from that chaos, from that chaotic scene. Again, the boss culminates at the end of that third-day struggle. We wanted the player to feel this from the use of color and the use of these design elements. And some of the inspirations we took from that were from real-life cosmic events. So something we can't quite understand, something that's very distant and abstracted from regular human perception and we wanted it to feel just as abstract and just as grandiose even within the world of Nightreign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Just speaking personally, what's something that you yourself are very proud of that you've worked on in Nightreign?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally, one of my favorite areas is actually the area we just talked about, the environment that you enter just before facing that boss at the end of the third day. One of the keywords we found while exploring the design for this environment was this concept of shedding skin. And so this was something that really resonated with me and stuck with me. This idea of personifying the surroundings and the building into something that was once living and has now since been petrified or gone through these ages of time and gone through this whole process. And we wanted players to feel this sense of age, this old fantasy feel from this particular set piece.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>One of the things that surprised us about Nightreign was the environmental variety, despite it being a much smaller and more condensed kind of world. Was it difficult to achieve this kind of variety in such a small, confined space?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">So generally with these kind of emergent map changes and these kind of terrain effects and events, we wanted it to feel like something immediately fresh and exciting, just at a glance. So the player will know there's been an impactful change to the map and to the scenery and they'll have an immediate idea of what they need to do to progress. So for instance, the volcano, the crater that appears, you'd need to sort of dig deeper into it. Or for the snowfield terrain change, you'd need to sort of climb right up to the top of it, this sort of thing. We wanted this to be immediately effective and change the way the players approach and behave in the map just by changing that sense of space.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And then personally as a designer, who are some of your favorite artists, either classic or contemporary, and are there any people that you can point to as being particularly influential on your work?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of my personal favorite traditional artists, or classical artists is Zdzisław Beksiński. I took a lot of inspiration from his various expressions when designing my work. Also with the concept of Nightreign and battling the Night Lords after these repeated plays, I felt like this is inherent to the game design. And so I wanted this feeling to come through in the designs I created as well. And one sense I got from that was from watching the film Spirited Away from Hayao Miyazaki. This feeling of being unable to go home, unable to escape from a dream. This sort of feeling I wanted to kind of harness while designing these worlds and tried to get that through to the player as they play through the game.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even when designing Limveld, that initial map, that initial environment on the first day, I wanted it to feel beautiful. Like from an outward glance, it looks beautiful and inviting, but pretty quickly you feel like something's off or something's not quite right. So I think that is a part of the inspiration that we definitely got across in the design of Nightreign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So switching to video games really quick, can you just talk about what are some of your favorite video games that may have inspired your work as well?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I enjoy Diablo II and other such multiplayer games. I enjoy open world survival games where you have to sort of start from scratch and build your own house and things like that world. I like a variety of indies and I've also had a fondness for a Legend of Zelda since childhood, games like Majora's Mask, which kind of are obviously really fun to play, but they sort of have this… again, this sense of repeat play and this kind of sense of darkness to them as well. I think that's stuck with me since childhood. So yeah.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And then a final question. A lot of designers and artists like to make their own personal imprints on a game. Are there any secrets or Easter eggs that you managed to sneak in yourself into the game? Or is there maybe anything that you hope players will see and enjoy as they play?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes. I don't think you'd call this a sort of a signature as an artist, but one important thing that I paid attention to while designing Nightreign was this sort of all encompassing theme of the night and how we go about expressing that. We obviously tried various things and various methods and Limveld is ultimately a place that you keep coming back to as a player. So we thought one way we could express that was these changes throughout the three-day structure and what players can notice as their journey progresses. What keeps them coming back and what keeps them interested.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so to talk a bit more about that theme of night, we had to explore what night meant to us as designers, like as a base concept. So of course, night brings with it some negative connotations, like the dark and fear and the unknown, things like this. So we wanted at first when the player jumps into this world to feel those kind of negative feelings conveyed quite directly and have that sense of anxiety and that sense of fear of the unknown.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We had to explore what night meant to us as designers, like as a base concept."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">So we conveyed this straight up with things like the imposed time limit and the encroaching circle of rain, things like this. But we found that night is, we didn't want it to be fully negative. Again, once the players get used to that cycle and they get used to what they're seeing, we wanted it to be more than that. We wanted players to kind of begin to almost yearn for the night and sort of look forward to this encroaching darkness and maybe even feel a sense of comfort from it, from getting used to this rhythm and these aspects. So as the game progresses and the player is kind of getting used to these things, that's definitely an aspect of the design that we wanted to incorporate and be a part of that player experience.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/ea-black-panther-canceled-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Stop me if you’ve heard this one before, <a href="https://aftermath.site/electronic-arts-respawn-titanfall-layoffs-andrew-wilson-pay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">almost exactly one month ago</a>: EA, as part of an ongoing transition to <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/continuing-to-evolve-our-business-and-teams" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">focus on</a> “owned IP, sports, and massive online communities” – and, of course, a loving and committed relationship with making the line go up – has canceled a promising in-development project based on a big-name series, laying off numerous talented people in the process. Previously, <em>Titanfall </em>took a tumble. This time, it’s <em>Black Panther</em> that’s met a decidedly un-heroic end.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-closes-cliffhanger-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN reports</a> that EA has canceled a little-seen but eagerly anticipated<em> Black Panther </em>open-world action-adventure game and shut down Cliffhanger Games, a studio formed only a couple years ago in 2023. Some members of EA’s mobile and central teams are also on the chopping block. EA has not specified the exact number of people affected, but according to IGN, it’s “less than the roughly 300 roles cut last month across Respawn and EA's Fan Care teams.” In an email to staff, EA Entertainment president Laura Miele said recent shakeups are part of an effort to "sharpen our focus and put our creative energy behind the most significant growth opportunities." She added that EA is attempting to find laid-off developers new roles within the company.</p><p>It’s worth noting that as of March 2025, EA <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/wait-a-minute-eas-headcount-rose" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">employed 800 more people</a> than at the same time last year, meaning that the company is not shrinking – at least in terms of net employee count. Still, this is cold comfort to those impacted by layoffs, whose hard work now lines the wastebasket of history and who – more invisibly but no less crucially – see their teams scattered to the winds. These aren’t just talented individuals; they are rock-solid <em>teams</em>. Game making is a collective effort, honed over the course of multiple projects. It’s a process just as much as it’s an art, a daily trudge toward learning each others’ ins, outs, and idiosyncrasies.</p><p>Just to give you an idea of How Things Are Going on that front, Cliffhanger Games was made up of <em>Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor </em>vets coming from Monolith Productions. Monolith, you’ll remember, was working on a <em>Wonder Woman</em> game with WB until… that project was also canned, and Monolith, a decades-old studio, was <a href="https://aftermath.site/warner-bros-discovery-games-wonder-woman-monolith-shut-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unceremoniously sacrificed</a> at the altar of growth at all costs. In the span of just a few months, we went from multiple Monolith and Monolith-adjacent teams cooking in shared kitchens to zero. I’m sure at least a few folks will find new means of sticking together, but as long as this industry insists on viewing people as numbers – whether on a spreadsheet or as manpower to bolster a random live service game’s ceaseless maintenance machine – this will be the end result.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ushimitsu-gao-beastars"><h3>Ushimitsu Gao Is A Ghost Cuckold Romance Manga For Folks Who Defend Beastars (Me)</h3></a><p>Paru Itagaki let her freak flag fly with Beastars.

            <p>
The heroes in a half shell are back, and this time they're pressing right up against your eyeballs. That's thanks to their debut VR outing, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>: Empire City, which is coming to Meta Quest 3 and SteamVR sometime next year.
</p>
<p>
Empire City is the work of Cortopia Studios - which co-developed last year's well-received gladiatorial bludgeon-'em-up Gorn 2 - and follows Leonardo, Raphael, Donatello, and Michelangelo in an action-adventure set on (and presumably under) the Foot Clan-infested streets of New York City following Shredder's demise.
</p>
<p>
It's an adventure described as "equal parts hard-hitting combat and an exploration of the bonds of brotherhood", and there's talk of "fluid parkour" as players - and up to three friends - scale the urban landscape. Fan-favourite villains are also promised, all readying for a walloping - in battles built around strikes and blocks - with each turtle's signature weapon.

<p>
And that, apart from confirmation The Last Ronin author Tom Waltz is saving as narrative consultant, is about all we know. The teaser trailer above isn't much more informative, but you'll find a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3713650/Teenage_Mutant_Ninja_Turtles_Empire_City/">handful of screenshots over on Steam</a>. Expect more details in the run up to Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Empire City's Steam VR and Meta Quest release in 2026.
</p>
<p>
It's been busy few years for the Turtles, of course; following 2022's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shredders-revenge-is-a-reminder-of-the-richness-and-joy-of-16-bit-animations">brilliant beat-'em-up Shredder's Revenge</a> and acclaimed 2023 movie outing Mutant Mayhem, last year brought the fairly middling Mutants Unleashed and rogue-like Splintered Fate. Strange Scaffold took on the series earlier this month, nudging it into turn-based strategy territory with Tactical Takedown, and it's already been confirmed more games - including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tmnt-graphic-novel-the-last-ronin-will-become-a-dark-god-of-war-style-video-game">God of War-inspired The Last Ronin</a> - are on the way. As a scaly green youth once put it, "Totally tubular, dude!"

And you know what, after reading this 500+ word post, I do believe him. I think Pitchford really didn’t expect his short tweet to set off a firestorm. But it did, and at this point, I’m not sure posting over and over again about it is helping. If anything, it just leads to more people learning about the original comment and, as a result, more discourse happening. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/ouau9SVVrBA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/ouau9SVVrBA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">He’s like Sideshow Bob stepping on rakes</a></span>. Each post angers more people, making the situation worse. It’s time to put the phone down, walk away, and let the internet move on to something else. So, that’s my advice to you, Randy. Log off, dude. </p><p>Anyway, here’s the full post, lightly formatted so it is easier to read:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>I am sorry there was a misunderstanding. The absolute sincere truth is that I don’t want anyone to pay any more than they should or are comfortable with and I always work with the intent and hope that a customer always feels they got the better end of the deal no matter what they pay. </p><p>The actual context was that a guy replied to a post about Borderlands 4 on the Nintendo Switch 2 was warning me that if the price ends up being $80, the game will fail. What I was trying to do was explain that it wasn’t my call but that if a $10 price increase does happen (since that’s obviously where the industry is going), it will be okay and that Borderlands 4 will be okay because it’s a great game and there are a lot of fans who will see the value and want it. </p><p> I think my trying to short hand that using the phrase “real fans” triggered some people and I saw that it got inflated as if I was making some big statement (I wasn’t - I was just trying to help someone who I thought was sincerely worried about us and looking out for us) and I could see that it was being pressed into the idea that I was taking the audience for granted (which is a super shitty look, but it was not at all my intent and does not reflect at all how I feel). </p><p>The sincere truth is that I’m grateful that anyone likes our games and humbled that so many fans show up to enjoy and support what we do. </p><p>As an artist, I don’t want prices to go up because I want everyone to have access to what we create. I get that business is a thing and that the market and economy are driving prices up and sooner or later we’re going to have to all adapt to that so that the creative engine can make at least as much as it spends to provide us with amazing content. Whatever the case, I’m here to try to entertain people and my priority has always been to try to add some joy and happiness and creativity to the world. To whatever extent I succeed at that, I am grateful and honored and take on every effort with passion and humility. </p></blockquote><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> May I recommend you consider the people who create entertainment you enjoy are actual, real people who sincerely are working to try to make cool stuff. I have dedicated my life to video games as entertainment and I have made the choice to be accessible on here. I don’t want to let edge cases ruin that for the majority of people who find value in using this medium for a positive connection, but I cannot help that there’s a part of me that doesn’t want to at least try to help those that don’t get it to gain some perspective and some dignity in how they choose to interact. </p><p> I’m not claiming I’m perfect. But I don’t deserve any less latitude than anyone else. I choose to think of others with the most amount of charity and am often surprised to discover some that jump to the worst possible way to consider a thing as doing that is just counter to my nature. </p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Splatoon is celebrating its 10-year anniversary today, May 28, 2025. Below, we examine how it reached outside the realm of video games for its unique blend of inspirations.</em></p><p dir="ltr">It is easy to understand Splatoon as a riff on prior video games. It's a multiplayer shooter produced in the years after competitive shooters started to dominate online play. But it subverts type, offering something tuned for children and families, rather than teens and young adults. Its cartoon style and emphasis on objectives other than "kill" or "hold this position" set it apart from most other games of its ilk. But Splatoon's originality goes deeper. It proves that the strangest and most exciting ideas emerge when you look outside of regular avenues of video games, like wildlife, pop music and street fashion, and borrow what you can from them.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo didn't start development of Splatoon with the intention to make a family-friendly multiplayer shooter. <a href="https://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/wiiu/splatoon/0/0/" rel="nofollow ">Former CEO Satoru Iwata</a> said in an interview the developers wanted to create "a new kind of game, without worrying about trying to fit into existing game genres." From that initial seed came 70 ideas, which the team narrowed down to Splatoon. Its unique flavor comes in part from that wide-open approach. To be fair, this is an interview for promotional purposes, conducted by Nintendo employees with an active stake in making the best impression possible. Who knows how much of this is the unvarnished truth? But it is still striking how little video game terminology shows up and how many of the design questions raised are ones of intuition and common sense.</p><p dir="ltr">When you look at Splatoon's finished product, every portion of it fits together, from how its squid characters hide in ink and how its paint-splattering mechanics pair with street art aesthetics. But it took a lot of careful thinking and iteration to get it that way. The first design that captured the dev team's imagination featured characters covering a battlefield in ink, but these characters were tofu blocks, not squid. Why tofu? Well, the tofu's block shape and simple colors made it disappear into the ink, turning the straightforward shooter into a tense cat-and-mouse game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4502943-wiiu_splatoon_scrn_09_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502943" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4502943-wiiu_splatoon_scrn_09_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502943"></a><figcaption>Squid Kids gear up for Splatoon</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4502943-wiiu_splatoon_scrn_09_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But the tofu was a problem. The lack of any human features made it feel silly. How could you market a game with tofu characters? At first, the team settled on rabbits, for a number of practical reasons. Their stark color palettes would make it easy to see when they'd been inked and their ears act as a simple visual marker of the direction they were looking. There was only one problem: rabbits didn't make any sense. Co-director Yusuke Amano said, "When people asked 'Why rabbits?' and 'Why are the rabbits shooting ink?' we couldn’t give them a rational explanation." After brainstorming a number of things characters needed to have in the game--including "a motif where it makes sense for it to be squirting ink"--the team settled on squids.</p><p dir="ltr">Now the game's characters felt reasonable, but the new design also created new ideas for gameplay. The squid's ability to swim through the ink enabled traversal on the walls to flank enemies. This intuitive approach extends to the rest of the game. Splatoon can get complex, but the weapons resemble water guns, aerosol cans, buckets, paint brushes and rollers, things most of Splatoon's player base have used or have seen used in their real lives. There is an immediacy to how those tools work that makes them appealing. Even more intuitive shooters like Halo still rely on some prior knowledge of firearms. You don't need that in Splatoon.</p><p dir="ltr">Spreading ink on walls and floors also brings graffiti and, by extension, street fashion to mind. The team made that connection before they settled on squid characters. Part of what makes each of the three Splatoon games wonderful is how they draw on specific, sometimes local, subcultures. Diving into the fashion that inspired Splatoon will take you from the monochrome runway looks of designer <a href="https://www.wmagazine.com/fashion/yohji-yamamoto-y3-designer-interview-2023" rel="nofollow ">Youji Yamamoto</a> to the iconographic style of artist <a href="https://sabukaru.online/articles/sk8thing-in-the-shadows" rel="nofollow ">Sk8thing</a>. Scrolling through this brief history of <a href="https://www.yokogaomag.com/editorial/ura-harajuku-history" rel="nofollow ">Tokyo neighborhood Ura-Harajuku</a> and its streetwear will showcase looks and locations that could be found in Inkopolis. The games' Squid girl idols pull from digital pop stars like Hatsune Miku, even as they also take from the real world of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/26/17163674/nintendo-splatoon-art-design-interview-hisashi-nogami" rel="nofollow ">American Hip Hop</a>. These influences give the game a style that extends beyond its own borders. Getting into Splatoon could be, and for many players has been, a gateway to lots of other cool stuff.</p><p dir="ltr">In a strange way, Splatoon anticipated Fortnite, with its emphasis on player-chosen aesthetics, seasonal community events, and cartoonish, kid-friendly vibes. But in another sense, the difference could not be more stark. Fortnite wants to be everything to everyone: a platform for music festivals, movie trailers, and entirely new games. It eats everything from Star Wars and Marvel to Sabrina Carpenter and Ariana Grande. Meanwhile, every Splatoon game has had big, final Splatfests after which the game no longer runs events. Fortnite's malleable plastic aspirations have spread to every multiplayer game, while Splatoon remains its own thing, even with the occasional Nintendo tie-in.</p><p dir="ltr">However, Splatoon can still be craven. In Splatfests, teams of players pick sides in weekend wars between teams like "Pirates vs. Ninjas" or "Early Bird vs. Night Owl." The intention was to bring social media attention to the game by using common keyphrases and cultural debates. But that also has the effect of grounding Splatoon in subcultures outside itself. Splatfests create a normalcy and routine that each new event both affirms and disrupts. They are naked attempts to boost player numbers and generate free advertising. But when they're at their best, Splatfests feel like block parties.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4502944-vs02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502944" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="5120" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4502944-vs02.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4502944"></a><figcaption>An ink-soaked battlefield in Splatoon</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4502944-vs02.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Which brings us to Splatoon's run at social media. As you explore Inkopolis, you can find drawings and scrawlings from other players. You can still find posts like this if you walk around in Splatoon 2 or 3. Though the system draws from the interfaces of Instagram and Twitter, there is no algorithm to tailor what you see. The town square can only show you what people are saying right now. The result is something immediate and buzzy, but it can't hold your attention long-term.</p><p dir="ltr">All these pieces come together to create perhaps the most profound element of Splatoon: the feeling of a particular time and place. Splatoon’s aesthetics are not vacuous imitations, but grounded homages. Its social media and events give the feeling of a world beyond the borders of the game. Splatoon feels like a real place, albeit one that you can only ever visit. That is because it only could have been made by that team at that time in that place. In 2015, we were on the verge of a wholly different gaming ecosystem. Fortnite Battle Royale was only two years away. Splatoon’s emphasis on avatar customization and seasonal events put it in immediate conversation with what was to come. Yet it could not be more different. Splatoon’s seasonal events had a definite end-date. It lacked endless cross-media promotion (outside of the occasional Nintendo crossover). It did not chase everyone, everywhere, all of the time, but was instead content for a dedicated audience for that moment.</p><p dir="ltr">Befitting all that, Splatoon was not a well of endless entertainment. Its servers have long been down. You can't play the game that people played back in 2015. That death weirdly echoes Splatoon’s narrative of a post-apocalyptic world where humans have long been gone. The squid people wear clothes like the clothes humans wore, play games like the humans played, and make the same kind of music they made too. There are differences, but it is the same too. Perhaps that squid world will die, like the human world did, but wasn't it beautiful while it lasted?</p>

            <p>
CD Projekt's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> sequel has officially shed its Project Orion codename and will henceforth be known as Cyberpunk 2. That's as the studio provides its latest development update, confirming it's now entered the pre-production phase.
</p>
<p>
A Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, codenamed Project Orion, was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-red-announces-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-future-witcher-projects-outlined">formally announced back in 2022</a>, and CD Projekt has been providing investors with progress updates on its development since then. Most recently, back in March, it revealed Project Orion was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-shares-witcher-and-cyberpunk-project-updates-announces-partnership-with-mobile-developer-scopely">nearing the end of its concept phase</a> and would be entering pre-production "in the coming weeks". And now, as per the <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/media/news/cd-projekt-wraps-up-the-beginning-of-2025/">studio's Q1 2025 earnings results</a>, pre-production is officially underway.
</p>
<p>
Announcing its latest development milestone, CD Projekt also took the opportunity to jettison the Project Orion codename and instead begin referring to the sequel simply as Cyberpunk 2. This doesn't, however, mean the name will permanently stick; CD Projekt <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/675651/cd-projekt-red-cyberpunk-2-project-orion">told The Verge</a> Cyberpunk 2 "just means it's another game in the Cyberpunk universe."

<p>
Despite these notable developments, Cyberpunk 2's team size has only seen a modest increase since the beginning of the year, with 96 developer now confirmed to be working on the project versus 84 in February. The bulk of the studio, as expected, is currently focused on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>, with 422 employees assigned to the project. That's compared to the modest 49 developers working on multiplayer The Witcher spin-off Project Sirius, and the 19 on Project Hadar - which is planned to be the studio's first-ever original game.
</p>
<p>
All these production updates were accompanied by a number of sales milestones. Cyberpunk 2077 expansion <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty</a> has, for instance, now sold over 10m copies, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</a> - which this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-cd-projekt-red-when-the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-launched">celebrates its tenth anniversary</a> - has seen over 60m sales. 
</p>
<p>
As for what's next, CD Projekt has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-cyberpunk-2077-on-switch-2-can-the-new-nintendo-console-handle-it">priming a Switch 2 version of Cyberpunk 2077</a> to release alongside the console next week, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-is-bringing-cyberpunk-2077-to-macs-early-next-year">Mac port is also on the way</a>. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-actor-celebrates-witcher-4-protagonist-ciri-following-woke-criticism">Ciri-starring Witcher 4</a> is likely still some considerable way off, with the newly monikered Cyberpunk 2 - which will reportedly <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Eurogamer/posts/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-features-second-city-thats-like-chicago-gone-wrong-says-se/">take players to second city like "Chicago gone wrong"</a> - to follow.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-setup-and-system-settings-menu-revealed-still-only-includes-basic-white-and-black-themes/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-setup-and-system-settings-menu-revealed-still-only-includes-basic-white-and-black-themes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo Switch 2 systems are <a href="https://wccftech.com/early-nintendo-switch-2-used-day-1-update/">starting to appear out in the wild</a>, and one person who was able to get their hands on the system early has taken the liberty of showcasing what the whole setup process looks like when you first turn on your Switch 2, minus all the parts that don't work because the system doesn't have the day one patch.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-%E2%80%94-first-setup-menu-walkthrough.1200999/">Russian YouTube channel</a> took the risk of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y49k7XwfE6k&amp;t=4s">publishing a video</a> that goes through the entire setup process for the Nintendo Switch 2, with the volume maxed, so viewers can hear the intro music and everything else that goes on when setting up your Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>The video was quickly taken down, which is not surprising as Nintendo is likely trying to keep a lid on these leaks with the console's launch only days away. But not before Wccftech, and many others could check out the video and see that much hasn't changed when it comes to the console's home screen.</p>
<p>Even in the system's settings, you won't see many changes regarding the layout and the options available. Some things are new, like the option to bump resolutions on the TV that you connect your Switch 2 device to up to 4K, but much has stayed the same, including the fact that the Nintendo Switch 2 only comes with two basic themes for the console: White and Black.</p>
<p>There's always the potential that more will be added, but that's what we thought when the original Switch launched in 2017. Eight years later, we still have two basic themes available.</p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see what else has changed and what else has stayed the same with the Nintendo Switch 2 when it launches on June 5, 2025, and it can be used with the day one patch downloaded.</p>

			<p>Today, Microsoft has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/05/28/copilot-gaming-test-xbox-android-ios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> Copilot for Gaming in beta testing for mobile devices (iOS and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.xboxone.smartglass.beta&amp;hl=en-US&amp;pli=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Android</a>). The early preview can be found in the beta version of the Xbox mobile app in select countries:&nbsp;Albania, Algeria Moldova, Argentina, Australia, Bahrain, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Georgia, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong (SAR), India, Indonesia, Israel, Japan, Kuwait, Libya, Macedonia, Malaysia, Mexico, Montenegro, Morocco, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Oman, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Singapore, South Africa, Taiwan, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkiye, UAE, Ukraine, Uruguay, USA, and Vietnam.</p>
<p>In Microsoft's words, Copilot for Gaming aims to be the 'ultimate sidekick' for gamers. Users can access Copilot for Gaming on a second screen without distractions from the core gameplay experience. The AI knows which game they're playing and understands their Xbox activity, so it can answer questions about games players are interested in, provide links to further information when its response includes web sources, and answer various questions based on the player's account, play history, and achievements.</p>
<p>Example prompts include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>“Hey Copilot, can you remind me what materials I need to craft a sword in Minecraft?”</em></li>
<li><em>“(While playing South of Midnight): I’m stuck on Rougarou right now. Can you give me some tips on how to beat this boss?'”</em></li>
<li><em>“I’m looking for a new RPG. Can you recommend something that has recently been released on Xbox?”</em></li>
<li><em>“‘Hey Copilot, what’s the rarest achievement you can get in Avowed?’”</em></li>
<li><em>“I love horror movies. Any suggestions for what game I should play?”</em></li>
<li><em>“What was the last achievement I got in Starfield?”</em></li>
<li><em>“When does my Game Pass subscription renew?”</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The feature will be improved over time, just as you'd expect in this case, with better personalization, proactive tips, and more. Testers can leave feedback under “More Options” in the app's top left corner, or simply by rating the answers with thumbs up or down.</p>
