Big muchly!</p>
<p>Now, Bandai Candy Toy has announced a set of ten collectible, fully-licensed Legend of Zelda weapons, which we love the idea of because, hey, the weapons in these games deserve a whole lot of love too.</p>
<p>Currently slated for release on February 31st 2026 in Japan (cheers to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tokyogamelife.bsky.social">@TokyoGameLife</a> for the heads-up), the dinky box set recreates Link's Hylian Shield, Master Sword, bow, and a bunch of other iconic weapons from the most recent games in the series, in cute, palm-sized, miniature fashion. Heck, each one even comes with its own little stand and everything.</p>

<p>We've had a little browse around this morning, and the collection is out of stock on most hobby shops that ship worldwide already, so you may need to have a proper search if you are interested, and the price has been varying thanks to pre-order offers, between around $30 - $40 (before taxes and delivery costs) or whatever that translates to where you are.</p>
<p>Here's some more details and pics from Bandai (via <a href="https://hobby-genki.com/en/candy-toy-bandai-shokugan-bandai/63956-the-legend-of-zelda-weapon-collection-10pack-box.html">Hobby-Genki</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>・1 Pre-painted Miniature Figure (9 possible types)<br>
・1 Dedicated Display Base (engraved with title logo)<br>
・(Master Sword only) Additional support stand for pairing with Master Sword (Sheathed Ver.)<br>
・(Sheathed Master Sword only) Additional display base<br>
・1 Soda-flavored gum</p>
<p>Lineup (9 Types)<br>
1. Master Sword<br>
2. Hylian Shield<br>
3. Royal Claymore<br>
4. Zora Longsword<br>
5. Seven Jewels Dagger<br>
6. Great Eagle Bow<br>
7. Stonecrusher<br>
8. Lightscale Trident<br>
9. Rare: Master Sword (Sheathed Ver)</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>


<p>Now, to think of a target small enough to neutralise with a pocket Great Eagle Bow.</p>

            <p>An early copy of this week's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> patch notes has been accidentally leaked on the official French Borderlands 4 website, giving us a peek at a massive buff for the game's most underwhelming vault hunter.</p>
<p>The leak, <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/fr-FR/borderlands-4/update-notes/">which can be viewed here</a>, remains labelled as the 25th September's patch notes. However, scrolling down provides a substantial list of changes to each of the four playable vault hunters that'll be added to the game later this week. While we don't know when this week we can expect this patch, this leak makes clear that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-best-amon-build">Amon</a> is getting a staggering 66 buffs across all three of his skill trees.</p>
<p>These include bug fixes, so his Primal Surge passive now properly restores shields and ammo, as well as a fix for his Crucible Axes which should now properly detect nearby enemies when used. In addition, Wall of Flame has been changed so Vengeance cannot be triggered by it prior to the activation of Scourge. If this all sounds like a bunch of gibberish, in short this means Amon's kit now works like it's meant to.</p>

<p>Then comes a wave of numerical buffs to various abilities across each of Amon's skill trees. There are too many to dive into them all, but highlights include Scourge's maximum Vengeance being increased by 50 percent allowing Amon to absorb and deal more damage with the whip. The whip got a flat 27 percent damage increase too, which is chunky.</p><p>The Onslaughter action skill has earned itself a 78 percent damage boost which is massive, and it now also can hit enemies equipped with shields more consistently which is a nice bug fix. Also on the same skill tree as the Onslaughter action skill, we've seen both Fellfrost and Fulminating Fist get a 71 percent and 69 percent damage boost respectively. So in short, a good time to be an Amon player.</p>
<p>These buffs and more are expected to drop later this week, and a substantial number of the changes seem to be focused on balancing things out for endgame players. It's worth noting a lot of these changes are giant buffs and bug fixes, while the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-best-vex-build"> popular Vex knife crit build</a> currently melting bosses remains untouched.</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 is getting a steady stream of patches and updates aimed at polishing the experience post-launch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-patch-adds-fov-sliders-somehow-both-improves-and-worsens-stability-at-the-same-time">with prior patches focused largely on improving performance across all platforms</a>.

            <p>A new UK game studio has been launched by Tom Stone, former managing director of TT Games - the studio behind the Lego Star Wars, Batman, and Harry Potter games - to create a game based on Peter Pan.</p>
<p>Second Star Games, based in Manchester, comprises industry veterans (including developers from the Lego games) and is in collaboration with Great Ormond Street Hospital Charity.</p>
<p>And as you may have guessed from the studio name, it's working on a fantasy-adventure game called Neverland: A Peter Pan Adventure, with details expected soon.</p>
<p>The Neverland game is where GOSH comes in - the hospital charity owns the rights to Peter Pan, which were donated by author J.M. Barrie back in 1929.</p>
<p>As such, royalties from all sales of the game will go to GOSH Charity, raising funds to help treat seriously ill children across the UK.</p>
<p>While details of the game are yet to be revealed, some concept art has been shared.</p>

<p>"We are delighted to be working with expert partners Second Star Games to bring the magical world of Neverland to life for a generation of young gamers," said GOSH Charity's senior brand licensing manager Jenny Martin.</p>
<p>"Neverland, a place of adventure and imagination, provides an amazing backdrop to what we know will be a first-class game. What's more, every game sold will help raise funds to support seriously ill children at Great Ormond Street Hospital. We can't wait for this next chapter in our Neverland journey."</p>
<p>Grahame 'Chily' Chilton will be the lead investor in Second Star, following his investment into the first Lego Star Wars game and his previous role on the GOSH Charity fundraising board.</p>

<p>Before this one can blast onto Switch 2 on <strong>20th November</strong>, Nintendo has served up the game's pre-order goodies on <a href="https://nintendo-uk.pxf.io/c/205546/1889570/22585?u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.nintendo.co.uk%2Fen%2Fkirby-air-riders" rel="sponsored noopener">My Nintendo Store UK</a>. As standard, the listings include a small bonus for <em>all</em> pre-orders and the option to upgrade to a 'bundle' for more merch.</p>
<p>We'll start with the standard option. All My Nintendo Store Air Riders pre-orders (<strong>£58.99</strong> for digital, <strong>£66.99</strong> for physical) will come the <em>exclusive</em> Kirby Air Riders Reusable Cup. That's right, <em>it's a cup</em>. It's adorned with pictures of Kirby, Dedede, Chef Kawasaki et al, and it can hold a whopping 350ml of your hot beverage of choice.</p><div><figure data-videoid="WA6pqBIEskk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WA6pqBIEskk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4035aelukwgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<p>Is it the most mind-blowing addition out there? Absolutely not, but we suppose it's roughly on par with the usual keychains and microfibre cloths included in these sorts of things.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the bundles are a good bit cuter. Upping the price to <strong>£70.99</strong> for a digital copy and <strong>£78.99</strong> for physical, these also throw in a Kirby plushie to sweeten the deal. There are three different plushies to choose between — Warp Star Kirby, Sleepy Kirby and Ultra Sword Kirby — and all are available for the same bundle price on the MNS website.</p>

<p>Both the bonus cup and plushie bundles can now be pre-ordered from the My Nintendo Store UK website, though the extras will only be sticking around "while stocks last", so make sure to get in there quickly if you have a particular purchase in mind.</p>

            <p>Activision have just shown off a bunch of new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>-related stuff as part of a COD Next showcase, and naturally one of the biggest talking points is a simp shooting people through walls. Well, to be more accurate, a clip of a pro player called Simp using the new Gravemaker killstreak reward, which resembles the sorts of wallhacking cheats the publishers have been trying their best to give the secure boot.</p>
<!--more--> <div>

</p></div>
<p>As you can see in the couple of clips I've scattergunned into the walls of this article, Gravemaker grants those who earn it the ability to see the thermal stick figures of other players through whatever layers of brick or concrete might be in the way, before gently popping these targets out of existence with a sniper rifle. I assume you can add a 360 spin into the process too, if you fancy going full 'mother, retrieve the photographic device'. </p>
<p>Gravemaker's immediately proven as controversial as you might expect, with professional codders wondering whether they'll decide on a gentleperson's agreement not to use it in their high-stakes matches. It's also sticking in the craw of some non-pro players, who've recently been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-follows-battlefield-6s-lead-will-also-require-secure-boot-on-pc">ordered by Activision to make sure secure boot's enabled on their PC</a> if they want to be able to play Blops 7. The reason the publishers have given for that requirement is an effort to get rid of cheating, which can see offenders gain an unfair advantage by enabling the likes of aimbots or, er, the ability to see and shoot foes through walls.</p>
<p>Now, to be fair, Gravemaker isn't a permanent effect someone will have enabled every moment of a match, even if the best of the best may be able to queue a number of short nine shot-long bursts of it up to deploy in quick succession. Since it's part of the game, there's also the opportunity for the perks like cold-blooded or gear to offer built-in countermeasures that'll render you not so much of a sitting duck.</p><div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>There's also the matter of it not being realistic, but given the unlikeliness of tactical nuclear bombs being regularly lobbed at tiny squares in which two little teams are having a timed scrap, that horse arguably bolted from the killstreak stable a while ago.</p>
<p>I think my main issue is that if you're going to offer wonderfully ludicrous killstreaks, you should go all-in and own it. One of the other things shown off during COD Next was a special pickup truck in Blops 7's Zombies mode. It's dubbed Ol’ Tessie, and serves as a shuffling corpse-proof method of transport "through the malevolent fog coating the Dark Aether".</p>
<p>I know you're now deeply ashamed of being known as the Beavis and Butthead shooter, Call of Duty, but stick those two annoying goofs in a similar pickup and have them rage around the map as a killstreak, with anyone who wanders into auditory range of their sniggers starting to lose health. Have Stan from American Dad transform into a dragon and hand the enemy team bows and Dragonshouts so they're forced to go full <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> for a minute. Have a horde of Squid Game characters roam around with instakill baseball bats, and if they get five kills during one streak, the rest of the match features the audio backdrop of a helium-huffing Morgan Freeman reading the works of Jean-Jacques Rousseau backwards.</p>
<p>Embrace your calling as not-quite-Fortnite. That's all I, someone who has a comically little amount of skin in the game, ask. Anyway, here's <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/30/call-of-duty-next-2025-recap/">a full recap</a> of Cod Next's other major announcements. Blops 7's open beta kicks off this weekend, with pre-orderers and certain Game Pass subscribers able to hop in from October 2nd, while everyone else has to wait until October 5th.</p>

            <p>A stealth patch to Prototype has stoked the fires of hope surrounding a remaster of the beloved third-person gory super hero action game, thanks to some mysterious additions to the games' credits. It also broke a bunch of mods in the process, unfortunately.</p>
<p>The patch, which was introduced on the 29th September, came without prior warning nor any fanfare, with the game receiving no Steam news post to coincide with the update. Instead, Prototype's loyal community had to dig in and figure out what was going on.</p>
<p>These players discovered a real surprise when they hit the game's credits, as several new companies' now appear. This includes staff at Iron Galaxy, the Activision-owned developer that previously worked on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3 + 4</a>, as well as the Spyro Reignited Trilogy. There's also a mention of a Ubisoft Connect Version, which does not exist.</p>

<p>Further digging was done by some of the game's better known modders and dataminers, who delved into the game post-update for further discoveries. User Nixson discovered locomotion and parkour tests previously absent from the game, which indicate some degree of fresh testing being done in-game. These findings were then<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PrototypeGame/comments/1nu2oqp/prototype_remaster_might_just_be_in_the_works/"> posted on the Prototype Reddit</a>, where remaining fans gathered in excitement.</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jxhctt/upcoming_call_of_duty_black_ops_7_leaks_and/">Rumours surrounding a Prototype remaster have been circulating since earlier this year</a>, though further breadcrumbs have been absent ever since. So while this patch has reignited hype around a potential Prototype remaster, a sad side effect is that mods for the game appear to have been broken by this update. Thankfully, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/prototype/mods/52">crucial mods like PrototypeFix</a>, which resolves crashing issues on modern hardware, have been updated and now work without issue.</p>
<p>If you've not played Prototype, why not check out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prototype-review">Eurogamer's old Prototype review</a>. In it, Tom Bramwell wrote: "Prototype is a game of riotous, gore-splattering ultraviolence. That's all it wants to be, and in many respects it does a solid, and often spectacular job. The victims may be plot, atmosphere and the difficulty curve, but then great power always comes at a cost."</p>

Shortly after updating their ocean <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> story <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/soma-devs-frictional-release-video-of-something-new-aka-their-nice-hotel-game-in-which-nothing-awful-will-happen">Soma</a> with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amnesia-creators-frictional-are-teasing-what-could-be-soma-2-through-a-sinister-luxury-hotel-website">an in-game teaser</a> - an old-school marketing ARG! By gar, it's been a while - Amnesia developers Frictional have put out a brief untitled video of "something new". It's a series of perspectives of what I assume is their new game's science fiction setting. To adopt the appropriate Jungian terminology, it looks creepy as balls. I am looking forward to this soma-ch. Without further ado, that trailer.

<p>
You might recognise the setting from the <a href="https://www.hotelsamsara.com/">weirdo luxury hotel website</a> featured in the previous teaser. The website's About section describes the hotel as follows: "Since time immemorial mankind has dreamt of the stars and what lies beyond. Now LuxuryNext is prepared to deliver on that promise. Introducing, Hotel Samsara. A place like no other. A promise like no other. Exclusive. Luxurious. In Samsara, wishes will come true. Interested in investing?" 
</p>
<p>
A slapdash inventory of things seen and heard in the teaser: floating flecks, fidgeting shadows, artful flourescent ceiling lights and corner moulding, cables, barcodes, cushioned walls, folding metal shutters, biohazard symbols, blood. Also an echoing, ethereal voice that sounds like it's coming from a speaker. I can't quite make out what the voice is saying, but it sounds like the closing words are "no sense". Yes, more of this please. Sense is overrated.
</p><p>
The sci-fi stylings together with the preceding in-game teaser - which went live on Soma's tenth birthday, 22nd September - strongly suggest that this is a Soma sequel. Please see my last article for speculations about Hotel Samsara and the website. I am too frazzled to recap them. Are we going to outer space in this one?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Witcher creator Andrzej Sapkowski never really hid his utter disdain for gaming in general. This was perhaps only exacerbated by the famous dispute with Polish developer CD Projekt RED: originally, the author sold the videogaming rights for a relative pittance, thinking they would never really be that successful. </p>



<p>Following The Witcher III: Wild Hunt's immense success, however, Sapkowski <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-author-million-usd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demanded $16 million in royalty payments</a> despite the fact that the deal they had previously struck did not mention any royalty fees at all. Eventually, CD Projekt RED <a href="https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-solidifies-relationship-with-andrzej-sapkowski-creator-of-witcher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached a new agreement with the creator of The Witcher</a> that purportedly satisfied both parties.</p>



<p>Now, though, in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1nuhirk/asynchronous_ama_andrzej_sapkowski_answers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fresh Reddit AMA on the Fantasy subreddit</a>, Sapkowski returned to criticize CD Projekt's games, specifically on their 'completely unnecessary' expansion of the concept of Witcher schools. Here's the relevant quote:  </p>



<p><em>The issue of "witcher schools" requires—I apologise—a longer explanation. A single sentence about some "school of the Wolf" mysteriously made its way into The Last Wish. I later deemed it unworthy of development and narratively incorrect, even detrimental to the plot. Therefore, later I never included or referenced any Witcher Gryffindors or Slytherins again. Never. However, that one sentence was enough. Adaptors, particularly video game people, have clung to the idea with remarkable tenacity and have wonderfully multiplied these "witcher schools." Completely unnecessary.</em></p>



<p><em>I'm still uncertain about what to do with this situation. Perhaps, taking the path of least resistance, I'll erase the sentence about the "school" from future editions of The Last Wish. Or maybe I'll want to expand and clarify the matter somehow in subsequent books? Perhaps I'll shed some light on the issue of Witcher medallions, their significance, and their connection to specific individuals? There are many possibilities, and the sky is the limit.</em></p>



<p>It is quite obvious that Sapkowski never played CD Projekt's The Witcher games, as their schools are really nothing like Harry Potter's Houses. Anyway, the writer later replied to a question about adaptations in general, once again claiming the inherent superiority of the written word to images, 'animated or otherwise':</p>



<p><em>Regardless of the quality of these adaptations, there are no dependencies or points of convergence between the literary original and its adaptation. The original stands alone, and every adaptation stands alone; you can't translate words into images without losing something, and there can't be any connections here. Moreover, adaptations are mostly visualisations, which means transforming written words into images, and there is no need to prove the superiority of the written word over images, it is obvious. The written word always and decidedly triumphs over images, and no picture - animated or otherwise - can match the power of the written word.</em></p>



<p>Of course, Sapkowski is entitled to his opinion, though it clearly appears to stem from a strong bias. For its part, CD Projekt RED <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-take-some-cues-sapkowski-latest-book/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still plans to incorporate some concepts from the author's latest book</a>, Crossroads of Ravens, in the upcoming game The Witcher IV (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won't be released before 2027</a>).</p>

<figure data-uuid="bd12a019bd879"><a title="Super Mario Galaxy 1 + 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bd12a019bd879/super-mario-galaxy-1-plus-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> is out this week, and in case you missed it, it comes with all sorts of enhancements. Apart from the resolution boost on the Switch 2, the game also supports the system's Joy-Con 2 mouse mode feature, which is a welcome bonus.</p>
<p>Before you jump in and try this out, there's one thing you might want to know. This mode can only be accessed in the 'Co-Star Mode' with a second player. Here's the full rundown about this from our Nintendo Life review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Co-Star Mode’ makes a welcome return for those who wish to bring a friend on board to help gather Star Bits or defeat enemies. Player Two waggles their Joy-Con about to move the onscreen cursor, but if you’re on Switch 2, you can also use the console’s mouse functionality, and it works wonderfully. Chances are you’ll play both games solo, but it’s a nice little extra regardless."</p></blockquote><div><figure data-videoid="ws0BZJ-l_eg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ws0BZJ-l_eg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed626890gryjum&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>
</figcaption></figure></div><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So, if you were hoping to experience mouse mode on a single-player run, it seems you're out of luck. You'll need to call on a friend, family member, or someone else if you want to properly test it out. Once again, this control mode in these new versions is only accessible to Switch 2 users.</p>
<p>Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 will be made available on 2nd October, with fans also able to purchase each game separately from the Switch eShop.</p>

<p>Alongside the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> this week, Nintendo has released an update for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_world_plus_bowsers_fury">Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury</a> on the Switch.</p>
<p>According to Nintendo's official support page, Version 1.2.2 addresses "several issues" to improve the overall gameplay experience. It doesn't go into any details beyond this, but if we find out what is going on behind the scenes here, we'll provide an update.</p>
<p>Compatibility with existing versions is also noted, so be mindful of that. Here's the full rundown:</p>
<h2>Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury: Ver. 1.2.2 (Released September 30, 2025)</h2>
<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>- Several issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience.</p>
<p>Note: Does have local user compatibility with Ver. 1.2.1-1.1.0. Does not have local user compatibility with Ver. 1.0.0. Please be careful of the update version on each player’s system.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>This follows a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/12-free-switch-2-game-upgrades-are-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">major update for this same title in June</a>, which optimised the game's visuals and frame rate for the Switch 2. It also added HDR support in Bowser's Fury and a GameShare option.</p>
<p>You can find out more about the original release on Switch in our review here on Nintendo Life. Bowser's Fury is also well worth a look, if you haven't already given it a go.</p>

<figure data-uuid="d04ea720d106d"><a title="Warframe" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d04ea720d106d/warframe.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Digital Extremes (via Steam)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this month, the team at Digital Extremes provided a development update on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/warframe">Warframe</a> - confirming a Nintendo Switch 2 version of the free-to-play title was officially in the works.</p>
<p>Now, in a recent developer livestream, the team has shared the first gameplay footage from this particular build of the game, now that they've finally got their hands on some dev kits. It highlights faster load times, higher shading quality, improved frame rate, and more.</p>

<p>You can see a little <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2575538613">more gameplay footage</a> in the official stream around the 28-minute mark. Digital Extremes CEO Steve Sinclair reiterates how the load times are much shorter than the Switch counterpart, and also notes how this new version of the title will apparently target 60fps in docked mode.</p>
<p>There's no information just yet about when exactly the Switch 2 version of Warframe will be released, but when we hear more, we'll be sure to let you know. Warframe was made available for the original Switch in 2018. The port specialists at Panic Button helped out with this version of the game at the time, and we labelled it a "remarkable technical feat" for Nintendo's hybrid system.</p>
