			<p>Announced during today's Triple-I Initiative Showcase, <a href="https://wccftech.com/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault-announced-will-release-in-2025/">Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</a> has a better-defined release window for Summer 2025. Unfortunately, no specific release date has yet been set.</p>
<p>The sequel to developer Digital Sun's indie hit Moonlighter was first revealed in late 2024, and now we know to look for it on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime this summer. Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault promises to be an even deeper experience than the original, as Will works to keep his shop open alongside his new hero responsibilities.</p>
<p>Today's announcement also came with a brand-new trailer for Moonlighter 2, featuring Will's tips on 'how to be a good merchant.' Beyond the tips, the trailer also features new gameplay for Moonlighter 2, including a look at the combat, exploration, and store management.</p>
<p><iframe title="Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault | Release Window Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7Av9DJexkp8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As with the first Moonlighter, replayability looks to be a big focus for Moonlighter 2. It's been seven years since the original shopkeeping roguelike arrived on PC and consoles, and was one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-best-indie-games-2018/">best indie games for 2018</a>.</p>
<p>Moonlighter sold<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/-i-moonlighter-i-sells-500-000-copies-in-less-than-a-year">&nbsp;more than half a million copies</a> within its launch year and has since <a href="https://gamingbolt.com/11-bit-studios-celebrates-2-million-copies-of-moonlighter-and-1-million-copies-of-children-of-morta-sold">surpassed 2 million copies sold</a>. Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault looks like it's more of what players loved about the first game, hopefully with a few fun surprises to come. If that's the game we get when it launches this summer, Moonlighter 2 will likely be one of the best indie games in 2025.</p>

            <p>Excellent dwarven miner-shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deep-rock-galactic">Deep Rock Galactic</a> has been quiet for a while, but only because devs Ghost Ship Games having been putting the wrenches to its upcoming roguelite spinoff <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deep-rock-galactic-rogue-core">Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core</a>. After <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fk_oE3OFVp8">last week’s teasing</a> of some of the 'Reclaimer Tech' that Rogue Core’s bearded delvers will wield, we now have a meatier, action-heavy trailer showing how that kit can be put to use against rampaging xenobeasts.</p>
<p>The trailer, revealed during the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/the-triple-i-initiative">Triple-I Initiative</a> livestream, also end with the announcement of a closed alpha playtest, which aspiring battleminers can sign up for via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2605790/Deep_Rock_Galactic_Rogue_Core/">Rogue Core’s Steam page</a>. And that’s not the only DRG news to emerge, dusty and covered in alien bits, from the showcase, as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deep-rock-galactic-survivor">Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor</a> was confirmed to launch out of early access on September 17th.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deep-rock-galactic-survivor-early-access-review">I like Survivor a lot</a>, but Rogue Core looks to stick far more closely to the co-operative sci-fi shooterin' of DRG Classic – fully destructible caves included. The dwarf classes are all new, mind: there’s the Slicer, an aggressive melee fighter, the defence-focused Guardian, the Spotter, who can soften up beefier targets, and the Falconeer, who commands a winged attack drone. In each run you’ll be hunting upgrades and new weapons while scrapping your way towards a lost excavation site, so I guess it makes sense that you can't just take DRG’s Driller and dig your way down there in a nice neat tunnel.</p>
<p>These new Reclaimer dwarves each get their own high-tech gauntlets, which sound like souped-up takes on the original game’s support tools. The Guardian’s Stonewall Repulsor <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gauntlet">Gauntlet</a>, for instance, can not only throw up a protective shield – so far, so DRG Gunner – but also punt enemies off cliffs with a kinetic blast. The Slicer, meanwhile, gets a big old energy sword, which is a big old energy sword. Fair.</p>
<p>I was slightly worried, watching that teaser for the mostly-offensive Reclaimer Tech last week, that Rogue Core might shift aside DRG’s exploration and traversal facets in favour of a simpler killfest. This new trailer does calm those nerves by throwing in some mining and navigation bits, and I spy at least one zipline, so hopefully the pleasures of mastering your spelunking tools come through just as strongly as the thrill of exploding an interdimensional cave monster with a power fist. Also, it seems like some of the environments go heavy on abandoned mining infrastructure, and if there’s one thing I love exploring in games, it’s the decaying ruins of a once-prosperous industry that now stands only as crumbling monument to the builders' hubris.</p>

<p>As for Deep Rock Galactic: Survivor, that has a trailer of its own, running through the additions it’s made since its early access launch last year: new biomes, new bugs, mutators and suchlike. There’s obviously still some time before its 1.0 release in September, though the trailer also hints at some upcoming upgrades that could arrive before then, including a buffing can of legally distinct WD-40. Presumably it’s not as useful and powerful as real WD-40, or else spraying it would defeat all the baddies instantly while tripling the game’s framerate.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98the-alters%E2%80%99-releases-in-june-coming-to-xbox-game-pass.1160787/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-alters-releases-in-june-coming-to-xbox-game-pass/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been announced during the triple-i Initiative that ‘The Alters’ will be releasing in June 2025 and coming to Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>In an official press release about the announcement, 11-Bit said,</p>



<p>In The Alters, the upcoming science-fiction game from 11 bit studios (makers of This War of Mine and Frostpunk), where survival has never been so personal, the path to salvation begins with a question as old as humanity: What if I had chosen differently? </p>



<p>Stranded on a hostile planet and racing against a deadly sunrise, Jan Dolski’s only chance of survival is to create “alters”—alternate versions of himself shaped by roads not taken. Each Jan comes with unique skills, personalities, and memories tied to a different life choice. But they also come with conflict, doubt, and emotional baggage. </p>



<p>Managing the mission means managing yourself—literally. Players must maintain a mobile base, make time-critical decisions, build relationships with their Alters, and confront the consequences of their own past lives. </p>



<p>And as a new element the trailer leans into, The Alters reveals the hardships of exploring the planet’s unique biomes, where deadly anomalies stand in your way. Levitating rocks and eerie distortions of reality catch your attention immediately, while other singularities remain invisible to the naked eye and require special tools to uncover. In every case, without a careful approach, you risk instant death, radiation-induced injuries, or even the disintegration of time and space itself. And you may want to avoid exploring at night, as the heightened radioactivity can eat right through your suit. These dangers add yet another layer to the survival experience, turning every expedition into a high-stakes puzzle. </p>



<p>Blending survival, base-building, exploration, and emotional storytelling, The Alters is a deeply personal sci-fi experience where every decision matters—and every version of you has something to say about it.</p>



<p>You can watch the full trailer of the announcement below:</p>

<p>In October 2024, Surgent Studios unveiled Project Uso, an ambitious, choice-driven RPG with beat-’em-up vibes. That was before the studio announced a partnership with Pocketpair Publishing, with the team signing up to develop a horror game that’s yet to be revealed.</p>



<p>I bumped into Abubakar Salim, the founder of Surgent, at the BAFTA Games Awards in London. The recent news of the partnership got me thinking about Project Uso and whether the team was still working on it because it piqued my interest when it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/surgent-tales-of-kenzera-uso/">uncovered months ago</a>.</p>

<h2 id="h-the-universe-is-still-alive">‘The Universe is Still Alive’</h2>



<p>Tales of Kenzera: Project Uso is an extension of Tales of Kenzera: Zau, which was released in February 2024 to a stunning reception. I was fortunate enough back then to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tales-of-kenzera-interview-abubakar-salim/">sit down with Abubakar</a> and talk about the inspiration behind this emotional, beautiful game.</p>



<p>I learned that Surgent Studios plans to create a thriving multimedia universe around Tales of Kenzera.</p>



<p>When I was chatting with Abubakar at the BAFTA Game Awards, I dropped a question about Project Uso, asking if it was still in the pipeline:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Uso is still cooking. I think the way that I’m approaching the design and game dev process is we want to build things that all feed into the next game and then the next game and then the next game.</p>



<p>Uso is still cooking, man the universe is still alive, and that’s very exciting. There are other games as well. </p>



<p>I think one of the reasons we wanted to reveal Uso was, that was one of those games that we felt really passionate about and not many people do this, not many people share in the industry, something that they’re just cooking and seeing what happens.</p>



<p>There are still things that we need to work with and still need to conjure with that game. It’s a big game, it’s very ambitious, what we want to do with it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tuesday night at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bafta-games-awards-astro-bot-scoops/">BAFTA Games Awards</a>, Abubakar Salim took to the stage to receive the award for Game Beyond Entertainment, a prestigious trophy that perfectly highlights what Tales of Kenzera: Zau is all about.</p>



<p>I’m very excited and eagerly awaiting more news from Surgent regarding Project Uso – watch this space.</p>

Each Jan comes with unique skills, personalities, and memories tied to a different life choice. But they also come with conflict, doubt, and emotional baggage.</p><p>Managing the mission means managing yourself—literally. Players must maintain a mobile base, make time-critical decisions, build relationships with their Alters, and confront the consequences of their own past lives.</p><p>And as a new element the trailer leans into, The Alters reveals the hardships of exploring the planet’s unique biomes, where deadly anomalies stand in your way. Levitating rocks and eerie distortions of reality catch your attention immediately, while other singularities remain invisible to the naked eye and require special tools to uncover. In every case, without a careful approach, you risk instant death, radiation-induced injuries, or even the disintegration of time and space itself. And you may want to avoid exploring at night, as the heightened radioactivity can eat right through your suit. These dangers add yet another layer to the survival experience, turning every expedition into a high-stakes puzzle.</p><!-- AD: content -->

"There's always a carrot at the end of the stick to pull you along, be it an upgraded tool, a new type of building, or a thermonuclear device."</p><p>The game is described as "part virtual pet, part village manager, part strategy game, and part existential conundrum." Like most cozy-type games, it starts simple enough, where the player has to care for a fuzzy yellow little creature. Feed it, play with it, and give it a bath when it’s been rolling in the dirt. Do this well enough, and it’ll split in two. Keep everyone happy and it'll keep multiplying. Again and again. And Again.</p><p>Netflix adds that you don't even need to have watched the episode (Plaything) or have played Bandersnatch before starting up Thronglets. Players might get caught off guard when unlockable video diaries featuring Tuckersoft's creative genius Mohan Tucker (Asim Chaudhry) start popping up. The references might not hit the same way and maybe not make the most sense if you're uninitiated.</p><p>Black Mirror Season 7 is now streaming its six episodes on Netflix. The Thronglets game is now available via mobile app stores, included with Netflix.</p>

			<p>It’s been over a decade since the original release of The Talos Principle, Croteam’s massively successful and critically acclaimed first person puzzle game. While the gameplay of the original and the philosophical narrative woven around it still holds up, the game is definitely looking its age compared to current releases, including <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/01/the-talos-principle-2-review/">its sequel</a>. To remedy this, Croteam have reworked the original into a gorgeous Unreal 5 showcase, and added some new content for longterm fans.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Talos Principle: Reawakened | Become a Creator | Coming April 10 | Demo Available Now" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DQdEC6R-eAY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Alongside the original game, Reawakened also includes the expansion Road to Gehenna and a brand new chapter called In the Beginning which serves as a prologue to the events of the main game and takes you back to the very first test of the Simulation (the world in which the game takes place). With 15 hours of content in the main game, 7 for the Road to Gehenna, and 5 or 6 for the new content there is plenty of puzzling goodness to be found here, with even more playtime for completionists.</p>


<p>Newcomers to the series might well be asking, ‘Ok, but what is The Talos Principle?’ Well, what you have here is one of the most thought-provoking and philosophical gaming narratives ever written. Tom Jubert and Jonas Kyratzes took all the best aspects of serious science fiction writing and combined them with a wide range of philosophy to produce an interrogation of being and meaning that perfectly complements the immersive puzzling. You begin by waking up in a weird and paradoxical world made up of classical architectural ruins and futuristic technology. A booming voice from a being who calls themselves Elohim sends you forth to explore and discover your true purpose.</p>
<p>This narrative pushes you through more than 120 individual puzzles and is effortlessly conveyed through a combination of voiced cutscenes and datalogs found in the many computer terminals scattered around the landscape. The questioning of technological breakthroughs and their effects on the meaning of humanity feel even more topical now than they did ten years ago – as is the case with all great science fiction.</p>


<p>Graphically, Reawakened is fantastic. The sacrifice here is that it will require a far more powerful system, but still one that is in keeping with ten years of hardware progression. Unreal 5 can be a tricky engine to master, but Croteam have done a fantastic job here with no real bugs or graphical issues in my time with the game. The extra complexity in lighting and atmosphere really adds to the game’s overall effect, especially given the importance of the former to many of the puzzles.</p>
<p>The open-ended structure from the original game is maintained as you can freely choose the order in which you tackle puzzles, with progression between the main stages requiring a specific set of shapes to be collected but not necessarily all of those available. This means that getting stuck on a puzzle is rarely a game-breaking obstacle as you can go and do other ones and come back to it if necessary. This ease of progression is a real benefit and prevents the frustration that many puzzle games suffer from when you get stuck.</p>

<p>Early puzzles are very simple and revolve around you using a signal jammer to force open gateways or turn off security turrets in order to collect the Tetris-like shapes in each level. As the game progresses, however, more complex combinations of jammers, light reflectors, blocks, and more come into play. While some puzzles seem unfathomably difficult at first, the nature of the level design means that you can break them down section by section and fine-tune your ideas until you solve them. They can require a degree of timing due to moving obstacles and robotic enemies, but even these reward thought over dexterity.</p>
<p>There are some quality of life improvements bundled in, a new rewind mechanic letting you revert the last few seconds if you’ve made a small mistake, and the time recorder now having checkpoints to help with sequencing actions together.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most exciting new addition to the Reawakened package is a fully functional puzzle editor which will enable the modding community to create new worlds and puzzles, effectively ensuring that The Talos Principle becomes endless. While I’ve never been one for level design myself, I look forward to seeing what comes out of this community and it looks like Croteam are excited to see what happens too.</p>

			<p>The Talos Principle is one of video game's most well-known happy accidents. Before its release, players knew developer Croteam for their Serious Sam games. Each Serious Sam game couldn't be any further from the kind of game that The Talos Principle is.</p>
<p>That's why it was no surprise to me when I learned that development for The Talos Principle began as development for a new Serious Sam game. Basic puzzle elements featured in The Talos Principle were conceived as a way of navigating the war-torn world of Serious Sam and eventually morphed into what became the 2014 puzzle game.</p>
<p>More than a decade later and a year after a full-blown sequel, we have <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-talos-principle-reawakened-launches-on-april-10-for-playstation-5-xbox-series-pc/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened</a>, a remaster of the original game and its <a href="https://wccftech.com/talos-principle-dlc-road-gehenna-announcned/">Road to Gehenna</a> expansion, plus a new expansion called In the Beginning. This remaster is more than just a new set of levels. Everything has been given an Unreal Engine 5-style facelift, with better lighting and textures to provide you with even better-looking scenery while you blankly gaze at a puzzle you're stuck on.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/The-Talos-Principle-Reawakened-Review-1-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>There's also a new puzzle editor that lets you create your own puzzles, though admittedly, I did not get to try that out while reviewing the game on PS5. The puzzle editor is only available on the game's PC version, though Croteam has already stated on the game's Steam page that it'll try working the puzzle editor into the console versions of the game post-launch.</p>
<p>I most enjoyed the developer commentary out of all the new additions in this remaster. For context, just like how The Talos Principle was born out of a happy accident, so was my playing it. As a fan of puzzle games, it remained one of my blind spots in the genre. I'd heard plenty about it over the years and been told to play it by some friends, but I never got around to it.</p>
<p>That's why I was intrigued to review it when the opportunity came, because pretty much by accident, I got to have my first experience with The Talos Principle be the best version of the game so far, complete with the kind of developer insights I love to hear about while playing something calm and meditative. In more ways than I could have expected, The Talos Principle is precisely my kind of game, and I should have listened to my friends sooner.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/The-Talos-Principle-Reawakened-Review-3-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Playing through The Talos Principle and the Road to Gehenna expansion for the first time, I experienced many of the same feelings players had 11 years ago. Some puzzles made me feel like an absolute genius when I solved them, while others were so easy to solve that I could run through them, doing whatever came to my head first without taking my finger off the sprint button. Not a contemplative moment was had in many a puzzle, and that kind of power fantasy only gets you so far in puzzle games before you get bored.</p>
<p>Then, all at once, towards the end, plenty of puzzles had me in that blank gaze for longer than I care to admit. Re-treading steps I'd already done that didn't work the first time, to see if something would click into place. And when it finally did, I was relieved, instead of thrilled, to move on to the next puzzle, which is not the feeling you want to have when playing a puzzle game.</p>
<p>This also comes down to the lack of new mechanics in The Talos Principle. I got tired of connecting lasers much faster than, say, opening portals. But by the time I was deciding whether to climb the tower, my motivation to continue hinged more on uncovering the story than it did on solving another laser puzzle.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/The-Talos-Principle-Reawakened-Review-5-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Playing through the original game and its expansion also meant that I was experiencing the story of The Talos Principle for the first time, which also felt like its own puzzle. Discussing the meaning of life or trying to define personhood and consciousness sounds like a conversation I might have with a friend over coffee. This is another reason why The Talos Principle is my kind of game.</p>
<p>I loved the writing throughout, and tired as the trope may be, it's likely not a shock to you at this point that I love rooting through cryptic notes and audio logs to piece together a game's story. It makes my experience with a game feel all the more unique. Even if I'm acquiring every piece of the narrative in the same order another player did, there's no way for me to know that. On that note, I was disappointed that the narrative and the puzzles never weaved into one another in interesting ways.</p>
<p>The QR code notes helped make some humorous connections at times, but otherwise, my conversations with Milton felt separate from the rest of the game, which detracted from the experience. Road to Gehenna changes that, with the object of the puzzles being to free other robots from their prison. The newly added In the Beginning expansion includes more storytelling from Alexandra Drennan, which again helps to weave the storytelling a bit more into the puzzles.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/The-Talos-Principle-Reawakened-Review-2-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Speaking of the new In the Beginning expansion, for my money, these are the most difficult puzzles across the entirety of The Talos Principle: Reawakened. The fact that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2806640/view/519709875052217858?l=english">16 of the 18 puzzles</a> in this new expansion were made in collaboration with some of The Talos Principles' biggest fans again did not surprise me. Getting through these puzzles felt like Nintendo had brought on popular kaizo designers for the next 2D Super Mario game.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the difficulty of these puzzles made what should be The Talos Principle: Reawakened's shining star its biggest frustration. The bits of narrative you get from In the Beginning were just as, if not more interesting as what you can find in the base game and the Road to Gehenna DLC, but getting to them was such a struggle that I had a better time playing everything besides the In the Beginning expansion.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/The-Talos-Principle-Reawakened-Review-4-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Maybe that's because my freshness to The Talos Principle and its inner puzzle workings isn't on the same level as those who've been with this game for a decade. Still, the challenge these levels offer shouldn't stop anyone else like me, who enjoys a good puzzle game and has somehow not played The Talos Principle since its original release, from picking up The Talos Principle: Reawakened.</p>

					<h2>The Talos Principle: Reawakened</h2>
				</div>
			
						<section>
				<p>The Talos Principle and its expansion Road to Gehenna are undeniably two of the best puzzle game experiences available in video games. That unfortunately only makes the difficulty jump in the new In the Beginning expansion more frustrating, but it remains true for the base game, and both expansions that the struggle is worth it for the writing and storytelling. Especially if you're that diehard Talos Principle fan who can't wait to return to this simulated puzzle-garden paradise. The added developer commentary and amazing visuals from the Unreal Engine 5 upgrade wrap the whole collection up in a nice bow that make The Talos Principle: Reawakened a strong remaster, even more so if you're playing on PC at launch and get the bonus of the puzzle editor.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>The Unreal Engine 5 upgrade looks great
</li><li>The same excellent writing and storytelling that made the original game a gem still feel impactful a decade later
</li><li>A bevy of puzzles that are fun to solve that will make you feel like a genius once you get them</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>
							<h6>Cons</h6>
							<li>The new In the Beginning expansion is difficult beyond the point of frustration
</li><li>Puzzle editor not available to console players at launch
</li><li>Storytelling and puzzle gameplay don't feel as connected as they could be</li>						</ul>

Well, after seeing an alleged leak from the set of the upcoming comic book blockbuster, some of them have a theory that’s just wild enough to be not altogether unconvincing. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Alongside expected returns like Chris Hemsworth as Thor and Anthony Mackie as Captain America, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-x-men-patrick-stewart-ian-mckellen-1851772571?_gl=1*12v7cvo*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NDI5MzEwMi43Ny4wLjE3NDQyOTMxMDIuNjAuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-x-men-patrick-stewart-ian-mckellen-1851772571?_gl=1*12v7cvo*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NDI5MzEwMi43Ny4wLjE3NDQyOTMxMDIuNjAuMC4w">Marvel also revealed more surprising appearances</a></span> in the May 2026 <em>Avengers</em> sequel, including Patrick Stewart as Professor X, Ian McKellen as Magneto, Kelsey Grammer as Beast, Alan Cumming as Nightcrawler, Rebecca Romijn as Mystique, and James Marsden as Cyclops. It seemed like a bad Deadpool joke, but it was very, very real. It’s still anyone’s guess how all of those pieces will fit together, but after a fresh leak allegedly from the set of the upcoming blockbuster, there are some interesting ideas about what might actually be going on. </p><p><strong>Spoiler warning:</strong> <em>If you don’t want to read a description of footage that </em>might<em> be from the set of Avengers: Doomsday or read about what fans think it </em>could <em>mean for the movie, well, uh, you probably shouldn’t have clicked on this article but in either case you should definitely stop reading now.</em> </p><p>Someone uploaded apparent drone footage of what appears to be a set for <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em> to YouTube (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/apparent-avengers-doomsday-set-photo-has-mcu-fans-fearing-the-x-men-are-doomed-from-the-start&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apparent-avengers-doomsday-set-photo-has-mcu-fans-fearing-the-x-men-are-doomed-from-the-start" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via <em>IGN</em></a></span>) and it depicts what almost definitely seems to be the courtyard of the Xavier Institute for Higher Learning, aka the X-Mansion, riddled with explosions and craters. The entire thing is surrounded by a perimeter of shipping containers stacked one on top of the other, just waiting to be CGI’d over with some hyper-expensive combat set piece. It looks very much like the type of battlefield you’d set up at your favorite <em>Warhammer</em> miniatures tabletop night. </p><p>So what does it mean? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers/comments/1juka6h/new_look_at_the_doomsday_set_with_drone_footage/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelStudiosSpoilers/comments/1juka6h/new_look_at_the_doomsday_set_with_drone_footage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Well, some fans are going with the idea</a></span> that rather than being a mid-movie climax or final showdown, this fight is actually how <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em> will begin, similar to the way <em>Avengers: Infinity War</em> kicks off with Thanos fighting the Hulk. “It’d be badass if the intro of this movie was Dr. Doom beating the X-Men’s ass just like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-ultimate-alliance-coming-to-playstation-4-xbox-1784192280&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-ultimate-alliance-coming-to-playstation-4-xbox-1784192280">the first ultimate alliance game</a></span>,” user BigPaleontologist520 wrote on the Marvel spoilers subreddit. </p><p>Others took it from there. “Oh yeah! That is an easy way to establish how badass Doom is—single handily finishing off an established superhero team,” responded InnocentTailor. “And getting the geriatric cast out of the movie earlier would make it less jarring to see them as they have aged,” followed up SpiffySpacemanSpiff. It’s certainly a neat, high-impact (and no doubt expensive) way to establish some big stakes in <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em>, which for many already feels like a desperate cash grab after years of Marvel superhero burnout at the box office. Some might feel like it’s a waste to get the aughts <em>X-Men </em>cast back together again just to see them get wrecked at the start, but it would certainly stop the gimmick from descending into purely nostalgic fan service. </p><p>Of course, this might not be the case at all. Just because the X-Men are fighting at the mansion doesn’t mean it’s occurring near the beginning of the movie, or against Dr. Doom and an army of Doombot-like sentinels. With multiverse incursions seemingly at play, the writers for <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em> have the plot tools to basically do whatever they want and make it sorta make sense. Plus the X-Mansion is always under attack. As one Reddit user noted, “I wouldn’t read too much into it, the school blows up every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <div>
        
<p>There’s a new game coming from the developer of The Axis Unseen, and it’s not what you’d likely expect. Just Purkey Games, the studio operated by developer Nate Purkeypile, has announced Deedlee Doo! Carkour!, a new “racing” game where you do parkour with a car using explosions.</p>



<p>The game is currently scheduled to launch on May 12, 2025 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3582590/Deedlee_Doo_Carkour/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC via Steam</a>.</p>



<p>“Everything in the game is made out of clay in real life,” the game’s description reads. “The sound effects and music are all mouth sounds. If you screw up a jump, children laugh and make fun of you. (Just like real life!) Can you reach the top of the Meowtain?”</p>



<p>Regarding the clay art style, it was all sculpted in real life as the description reads. Some of the sculptures, however, were done by Purkeypile’s own children before they were scanned into the game. </p>



<p>In addition to the game’s announcement, a reveal trailer was also released.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wilds-nintendo-switch-2-edition-wont-include-the-dlc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">You'll have to pay up.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Amid continued frustration and confusion from fans about how much the Nintendo Switch 2 and its games are going to cost them (especially in the United States, where that seems to be perpetually in flux), we've just learned about yet another charge that may not have been obvious to everyone at first. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild's Nintendo Switch 2 edition doesn't come with the Expansion Pass, meaning you'll have to pay an additional $20 to play the DLC on the new system if you don't already own it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That might sound like a no-brainer, but let me explain. Since the announcement of the Nintendo Switch 2's games and their pricing last week, there's been no end to the confusion about how it's all going to work. What we currently know is that if you already own The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild on the Nintendo Switch, you can play that same game on your Nintendo Switch 2, including with the DLC if you've already purchased it, no problem.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">However, there's also a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-nintendo-switch-2-will-improve-switch-1-games">Nintendo Switch 2 Enhanced Edition of Breath of the Wild</a>. It comes with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition-graphical-comparison-treehouse-live">improved visuals and performance</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom-are-getting-achievements-on-nintendo-switch-2">achievements</a>, as well as support for the new "Zelda Notes" service in the Nintendo Switch Online app. If you already own Breath of the Wild on the Switch, you won't get those features automatically, but you can purchase an "upgrade pack" for $10 to get access to all that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So that leaves folks who don't own the game yet at all, but might want to purchase it on the Nintendo Switch 2. They can purchase a Nintendo Switch 2 Enhanced Edition of Breath of the Wild for $70, $10 more than the game initially retailed at (so basically the price of the original game and the pack). But it won't include the DLC Expansion Pack, so if you want access to that, it's another $20 on top of that. $90 total for the full Breath of the Wild Nintendo Switch 2 experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is according to a statement from Nintendo, who told IGN: "The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition does not include The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Expansion Pass DLC. That DLC is available as a separate purchase."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You might argue that that's only fair given that it's effectively what existing owners of the game have already paid anyway, plus the cost of the upgrade. It's not like there's a mysterious upcharge happening here. But it's worth pointing out that most other gaming publishers eventually get around to dropping the price on eight-year-old games, or offer "enhanced editions" for later systems that include the DLC bundled in to help ease the financial burden on players interested in jumping in. A whopping $90 for the most current version of a game that came out in 2017 <em>on the Wii U</em> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-nintendo-pr-managers-say-switch-2-and-mario-kart-world-price-backlash-a-true-crisis-moment-for-nintendo">feels painful</a>, especially in light of Mario Kart World retailing at an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy">unheard-of $80</a>, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive">Nintendo Switch 2 costing $450</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/industry-analysts-react-to-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-chaos-due-to-tariffs-we-are-living-in-unhinged-times">perhaps even more</a>, depending on what Nintendo decides to do about the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-sony-and-more-japanese-game-companies-suffer-stock-market-plunge-as-trumps-tariffs-hit-hard">current tariff situation</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe it won't matter, and maybe everyone who is ever going to realistically play Breath of the Wild largely already owns at least a base version of the game given how well it's already sold. But if you were waiting to pull the trigger on it (and its sequel, Tears of the Kingdom) for a new, shinier system, you'll have to keep the cost of Breath of the Wild's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/12/12/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-the-champions-ballad-dlc-review">very good Expansion Pass</a> in mind.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>Developer Bad Guitar Studio have announced that Fragpunk will launch for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S on April 29.</p><p>Fragpunk is out on PC but suffered a last-minute <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fragpunk-gets-last-minute-delay-on-console-pc-version-launching-as-planned/1100-6529914/" data-ref-id="1100-6529914">delay on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</a>. Console players will be compensated for the delayed launch and receive the rewards from exclusive time-limited events since the beginning of Season 1 until April 29. Those who purchased the Pioneer Bundle on console platforms will also be eligible to claim additional gifts after the console launch.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Umxovn2sU0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6Umxovn2sU0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Fragpunk has cross-play and cross-progression between the console and PC versions, with more details coming as the launch date nears. The console versions also have enhanced aim-assist to minimize the disparity between controller and keyboard-and-mouse inputs. This was done to ensure an equally competitive environment for all players regardless of platform.</p><p>Season 1 of Fragpunk is in full swing so be sure to check out its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fragpunk-battle-pass-season-1-all-skins-emotes-and-rewards/2900-6308/" data-ref-id="2900-6308">battle pass rewards</a>. Fragpunk is a free-to-play hero shooter that utilizes a card system with various abilities. The card selection changes every round and can be mixed and matched to create different combinations.</p><p>Bad Guitar Studio is also a subsidiary of NetEase, which earlier this year, was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-cancelation-was-considered-before-release-netease-making-changes-report/1100-6529647/" data-ref-id="1100-6529647">reportedly trying to sell off its non-Chinese studios</a>, but the company claimed that it was still committed to its overseas developers.</p>

                <p>Microsoft has released a new Xbox commercial directed by Oscar-nominated director David Fincher and Romain Chassaing that carries a message: "Wake up the human inside." </p><p>In the video, we see a person named Horatio who lives his daily life like a rat, going from task to task with little energy or excitement. That is, until he gets home and plays Xbox. Then he's happy again.</p><p>"A much-needed dose of fun transforms him into the human he always was," the ad states.</p><p>This is a sad take on existence and what it takes to be happy, but tracks with some of the material that Fincher is known for--mainly the themes of some of his movies like Fight Club, Seven, and Gone Girl.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEv-s1dWGEQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/qEv-s1dWGEQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In the ad, we see people using handheld gaming devices, and Microsoft is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-console-generation-could-include-a-handheld-report/1100-6526635/" data-ref-id="1100-6526635">working on one of its own right now</a>, but whether or not this video is teasing or referencing those plans is unknown.</p><p>An <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-branded-handheld-planned-for-later-this-year-report/1100-6530020/" data-ref-id="1100-6530020">Xbox-branded gaming handheld device is reportedly on tap for release this year</a>, but it has yet to be announced.

            <p>Xbox has roped in a famous film director for its latest brand trailer.</p>
<p>The trailer in question is titled "Wake Up" and is directed by none other than David Fincher, as in Seven and Fight Club's film director.</p>

<p>Xbox's trailer begins with a poor ol' rat by the name of Horatio waking up to start another day at his desk job with all the other overworked rats out there. Of course, he does manage to get some exercise in beforehand by running on a giant wheel, but even this healthy start isn't enough to distract from the mundanity of his job.</p>
<p>However, once Horatio finally makes it through "a day in the rat race" (oooh, I get it!), he boots up his Xbox to connect with his friends, and this "much-needed dose of fun transforms him into the human he always was", Xbox states. Ahhh.</p>
<p>Xbox isn't the only company to use gaming as an escape from the real, mundane world as a marketing beat. Who can forget <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-targets-unexpected-demographic-in-quietly-devastating-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-ad"> Nintendo's quietly devastating trailer for Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> that showed a real life, 'everyday' man going about his business in a rather subdued manner.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fragpunk-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bad Guitar Studio has announced the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S release date for&nbsp;<em>FragPunk</em>, and the console versions of the game are not too far away at all.</p>

<p>As revealed in an official announcement on the&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.fragpunk.com/news/official/20250410/40587_1226546.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">website</a>, the free-to-play 5v5 hero shooter will be coming to current-gen machines on April 29th. Unfortunately, it's not hitting last-gen consoles, nor has a Switch 2 version of the game been announced at time of writing.</p>

<p><em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>launched on Steam on March 6th as planned, but just a day or so before the game's planned console launch, it was <a href="https://x.com/PlayFragPunk/status/1897074010997035438" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">delayed</a>, with Bad Guitar citing "unexpected technical challenges in optimization and adaptation".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fragpunk-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-firing.jpg?itok=vTRuhqml 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fragpunk-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-firing.jpg?itok=tOewjM6p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bad Guitar's colorful shooter&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>is launching on consoles later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>In order to make up for that delay, Bad Guitar says it will issue "plenty of gifts" to those playing&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>on consoles, including "exclusive time-limited event rewards" from the start of the game's first season through April 29th.</p>

<p>That's slightly confusingly worded, but it sounds as though all console players will be receiving those gifts without having to do anything, which is nice. Additionally, if you bought the Pioneer Bundle on consoles, you'll get "additional gifts".</p>

<p>In case you're wondering,&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>will also support crossplay between PC and consoles, and cross-progression will also be supported, so you can take your&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>stuff from PC and enjoy it on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S if you like.</p>

<p>Bad Guitar is also promising a "smooth gameplay experience" on consoles, including aim assist for those on controllers, which is designed to "minimize the disparity between controller and keyboard/mouse input".</p>




<p>In case you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>FragPunk&nbsp;</em>is, it's a 5v5 hero shooter with a unique selling point in the form of its Shard Cards, which can be deployed to add effects like buff shots for your teammates, healing, and plenty of other extras.</p>

<p>The game is going up against the likes of Blizzard's&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2&nbsp;</em>and NetEase's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marvel-rivals-player-count-40m" rel="nofollow">hugely popular&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em></a>, and it remains to be seen whether it's got the staying power of those games or whether it'll go the way <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/2k-project-ethos-studio-head-fired-report" rel="nofollow">2K's&nbsp;<em>Project Ethos&nbsp;</em>seems to be going</a>.</p>
