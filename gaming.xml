            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24172809/steam-games-when-you-die-gog-itchio-estate-planning<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="CBSqeN">Not all <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24163569/steam-games-when-you-die-will-estate-planning">video games go to gamer heaven</a> when you die. Some will stay right here on Earth, passed along to your next of kin — as long as you put it in your will. </p>
<p id="0IFhJr">The question of what happens to your game libraries when you die is still a relatively new one, a product of the digital-only era. Not only does <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/gamesindustrybiz-presents-the-year-in-number-2023">digital make up a big portion of video game sales</a>, but some stores <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23915567/best-buy-discontinue-physical-media-dvd-blu-ray">will reportedly no longer sell physical media</a> like video games. All this is to say that you should start thinking about passing your library on — otherwise, it might end up languishing on your password-protected Steam account.</p>
<p id="BDiE2w">A Steam customer service agent told ResetEra forum user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/to-anyone-who-is-curious-no-you-cannot-transfer-your-steam-account-via-a-will-you-can-only-take-your-games-to-your-graves.875634/">delete12345</a> that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24163569/steam-games-when-you-die-will-estate-planning">you <em>can’t</em> pass down your Steam library to another person</a>. (That is, unless you give them your account information and password, which is technically against Valve’s terms of service.) When you purchase a game on Steam, you’re purchasing a license to use that game — you don’t actually own a copy of it.</p>

<p id="J1EmAc">But Steam is not the only platform that sells video games. Polygon reached out to Valve, Nintendo, Microsoft, Sony Interactive Entertainment, GOG, Itch.io, and Epic Games Store to ask about their policies. Distribution platforms GOG and Itch.io responded: With the right legal permissions — i.e., proof of legal transfer in a will — both stores will try to honor these requests.</p>
<p id="NysWRY">A GOG spokesperson told Polygon that, with a court order, the company is “willing to handle such a situation and preserve your GOG library — but currently [it] can only do it with the help of the justice system.” That’s because GOG doesn’t collect a ton of personal information, making it hard to establish a relationship between someone claiming an account and the original account owner.</p>
<p id="poxZdE">Here’s GOG’s full statement, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamernews/comments/1d5zxqo/what_happens_to_your_gog_account_if_you_die_gog/">which it drafted after receiving several queries from users</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p id="XFpXoB">As this is a particularly delicate matter with little to no existing legal guidance on the issue of video games preservation, we’d like to address it properly, so that you, and every other GOG community member, can be sure what can happen to your games in case of unexpected events, such as death. </p>
<p id="4l5nnN">As you may know, GOG does not collect information sufficient to truly identify a particular person (such as name and surname) or their family or marital status. For this reason, we are not able to establish that someone is related to a particular user or that a particular user has passed away.</p>
<p id="UrDa0W">In general, your GOG account and GOG content is not transferable. However, if you can obtain a copy of a court order that specifically entitles someone to your GOG personal account, the digital content attached to it taking into account the EULAs of specific games within it, and that specifically refers to your GOG username or at least email address used to create such an account, we’d do our best to make it happen.</p>
<p id="3liUvA">We’re willing to handle such a situation and preserve your GOG library — but currently we can only do it with the help of the justice system.</p>
</blockquote>
<p id="mt3qLJ">GOG doesn’t use any digital rights management (DRM) technology, though, meaning you can store your purchased games on an external hard drive and pass that along easily.</p>
<p id="u8ueSb">When it comes to indie distribution platform Itch.io, there’s no formal policy, according to founder Leaf Corcoran. Itch.io accounts are tied to email addresses, he said, so if a next of kin has the account’s password, that’s fine. Itch.io won’t revoke access. But if that person <em>doesn’t</em> have access to the email address, that’s a security problem — unless there is “conclusive evidence” that it’s theirs. </p>
<p id="6l2DCf">Corcoran doesn’t believe any Itch.io user has ever reached out to the company’s support line about recovering an account from someone who’s died, but he said he would try to help if the person could prove they should have access: “I think that’s a pretty unique case though so it’s possible we may go out of our way to help the requester prove that they should have access to the account.”</p>
<p id="6YZoUW">Again, that proof would likely have to be via a legal document, like a will.</p>
<p id="nQNuoV"><a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/usage-rules-for-digital-goods-rules-83812b1f-1ecd-9a46-d3a7-ad1eadce49d1">Microsoft</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/legal/sie-application-end-user-license-agreement/">Sony</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/sg/support/switch/eula/usage_policy.html">Nintendo</a>, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/subscriber_agreement/">Valve</a>, and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/eula">Epic Games Store</a> did not respond to Polygon’s request for comment, so we looked to their respective terms of service for answers. All of these companies have similar policies: The games licensed to you are not transferable. Transferring your games to another person via a will is, seemingly, still a unique situation that plenty of companies have not yet had to deal with — they may be willing to make exceptions with legal proof of bequeathment, or if they were compelled to by a court. GOG’s end user agreement states, too, that you can’t share or transfer your GOG account or content, but in practice, it’s willing to do so under the right circumstances.</p>
<p id="ETShLr">One potential way around this is writing the devices your games are stored on into your will. Lawyer Claudine Wong <a href="https://digitalcommons.law.scu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1573&amp;context=chtlj">wrote in the Santa Clara High Technology Law Journal in 2013</a> that “digital content is transferable to a deceased user’s survivors if legal copies of that content are located on physical devices, such as iPods or Kindle e-readers.” Presumably, this would extend to your laptop or video game console, should you stay logged on or have the password. “So far there is no dispute that the devices, and the works fixed to them, can be passed on,” Wong wrote. Still, Wong’s research is more than 10 years old at this point — technology and companies have changed a ton, and information about digital estate planning is still limited.</p>
<p id="7KFX63">Wong suggested that regardless of the legality of it all, you should still write this stuff into your will. “[An] estate plan is an expression of what he desires should happen after his death, and knowing what he wanted provides his family with compelling arguments against the service providers,” Wong said.</p>
<p id="wXdV7V">It may all sound like a joke — writing your video games into your will — but it’s a problem that will continue to pop up as things keep going more and more online. What happens to your TikTok account, for instance? Your email address? Your Steam or GOG or Epic Games Store accounts likely have more value than both: Just 20 AAA video games cost more than $1,000 in total. And your game library is also a personal thing that someone else might cherish. Beyond how this plays out personally, digital-only video games — and their copyrights and licenses — <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/01/12/video-game-preservation-emulation/">are a huge challenge for preservationists</a>.</p>
<p id="qGfOtE">Regardless, 100 years from now, I hope my descendants like my gaming laptop. </p>

His understanding is that while while games like <em>Starfield</em>, <em>Hellblade 2</em>, and <em>Age of Empires II </em>are “under consideration” when it comes to getting PS5 ports, games like <em>Gears 6</em> and <em>Fable</em> are unlikely to go multiplatform. That suggests that franchises considered core to the Xbox brand might still be off limits. </p><p>What does that mean for <em>Halo</em>? While it’s unclear if a future sequel would ever come to PS5, Warren reports that a new remaster of <em>Halo: Combat Evolved </em>is in early development and being considered for Sony’s platform. You might be wondering why Microsoft is working on another remaster when the original game in the hit sci-fi shooter series is available with online multiplayer and improved graphics via the <em>Master Chief Collection</em>. </p><p>Well that game is basically running the original code with a fresh coat of paint on top. It’s possible a new remaster might offer a deeper overhaul, while still being short of a full blown remake. Microsoft <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/mr_rebs_/status/1765832892804919595?s=46&amp;t=WocbT9i_LzihDyCxIlphpQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/mr_rebs_/status/1765832892804919595?s=46&amp;t=WocbT9i_LzihDyCxIlphpQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly stopped ongoing development</a></span> on <em>MCC </em>at the start of this year, and a new remaster might serve as a perfect test case for how <em>Halo</em> performs on PS5 and what the backlash is from existing Xbox fans. We might have a better idea of Microsoft’s thinking on exclusivity coming out of the June 9 showcase on Sunday. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Instilling joy and wonder, they provide a unique bond that enables you to utilize their skills for traversing the planet and solving environmental challenges. Once peaceful creatures, they now succumb to an unknown infection driving them to behave aggressively, which makes your mission to save them an urgent necessity.</p><p><strong>Exploration-Driven Gameplay</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The gameplay encourages curiosity-driven exploration of its distinct ecosystems—such as the colorful Nari jungle or mysterious Mâruba swamp—creating an interconnected world. With non-aggressive combat mechanics designed for healing rather than defeating and indigenous Flute melodies that you play to tame creatures, the game further highlights the creature-saver nature of the experience.</p><p><strong>Meaningful Narrative</strong></p><p>Step into the shoes of Vic, a 22-year-old nature adventurer as she navigates through the immersive expedition alongside Tabitha, a composed and astute researcher. Together, you confront the recurring infection—called “the withering” by the local race of Naam—threatening Ava’s inhabitants. The game’s narrative, co-created by Rhianna Pratchett, is a journey of wonder and mystery but also discovery, leading to the revelation of the planet’s captivating secrets.</p><p><strong>Saving Through Understanding</strong></p><p><em>Creatures of Ava</em> is a game featuring a dense, populated world of rich ecosystems filled with creatures that play a vital role in the planet’s natural balance. It goes beyond traditional creature-related genres, offering a deeper understanding and connection with the things you’ll encounter on Ava. Once you come to understand the true meaning of the infection, you will be challenged to step out of the human-centric point of view and learn about the real toll it takes to preserve the primal beauty at the very roots of Ava.</p><p>After all, can you save something you don’t understand?</p></blockquote><p><em>Creatures of Ava</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,424 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a> and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2304440/Creatures_of_Ava/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/creatures-of-ava-cacd2c" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/creatures-of-ava/9NV5LTSPHQD2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/creatures_of_ava" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GOG</a> in 2024.

<p data-characters="144" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>EA FC 24</em> Suni Chhetri End of an Era SBC is now live in Ultimate Team, and this will be a moment of huge pride for all Indian football fans. </p> <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="291" data-injectable="false">Chhetri called it a day for the country after registering himself as the nation’s highest goal-scorer, and to celebrate his efforts over the years, EA Sports has released a special SBC. To get the item, you’ll need to complete the challenge before it expires from Ultimate Team. </p> <h2 id="h-all-ea-fc-24-suni-chhetri-end-of-an-era-sbc-tasks" data-injectable="false">All EA FC 24 Suni Chhetri End of an Era SBC tasks</h2> <p data-characters="237" data-current-count="528" data-injectable="true">Thankfully, EA Sports has made it very easy for all players to complete the <em>EA FC 24</em> Suni Chhetri End of an Era SBC. The new challenge has only one task, and it neither requires a TOTS nor a TOTW item, which makes it easier for everyone.</p>
 <p data-characters="28" data-current-count="28" data-injectable="false"><strong>Task 1 – Sunil Chhetri</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="68" data-injectable="false"> <li>Minimum Team Rating: 87</li> </ul> <figure data-current-count="368" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-ea-fc-24-suni-chhetri-end-of-an-era-sbc-cheapest-solutions" data-injectable="false">EA FC 24 Suni Chhetri End of an Era SBC cheapest solutions</h2> <p data-characters="218" data-current-count="586" data-injectable="true">Completing the <em>EA FC 24</em> Suni Chhetri End of an Era SBC shouldn’t be an expensive affair. There’s just one task, and most players should have the fodder required to complete this challenge in Ultimate Team. </p>
 <p data-characters="28" data-current-count="28" data-injectable="false"><strong>Task 1 – Sunil Chhetri</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="11" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true"> <li>Fabinho 84</li> <li>Wendie Renard 88</li> <li>Bernardo Silva 88</li> <li>Koen Casteels 84</li> <li>Bruno Fernandes 88</li> <li>Christina Endler 88</li> <li>Alexandra Popp 88</li> <li>Stanislav Lobotka 84</li> <li>Lena Oberdorf 87</li> <li>Martin Odegaard 87</li> <li>Laura Freigang 83</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="278" data-current-count="278" data-injectable="false">After completing the challenge, you’ll get a 96-rated ST item with three playstyle+. This SBC has amazing value even if it might be hard to fit this card (due to squad chemistry). However, Chhetri’s End of an Era item could be an exceptional super sub off the bench.</p> <p data-characters="248" data-current-count="526" data-injectable="false">The item can also operate in different positions and offers 5* Weak Foot as well. He’s also a great fit in beginner squads. In many ways, tonight’s SBC is a great bargain challenge like yesterday’s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-how-to-complete-iker-muniain-end-of-an-era-sbc/">Iker Muniain End of an Era SBC</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172905/suicide-squad-kill-justice-league-200-million-loss-wbd-rocksteady<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warner Bros. Discovery took a $200 million hit after the launch of <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice</em> <em>League</em>, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24062243/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review-ps5-xbox-pc">troubled looter shooter</a> released in February — and now we have a sense of what went wrong. A new <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-06-06/-suicide-squad-warner-bros-s-200-million-flop-haunts-the-gaming-industry">report from <em>Bloomberg</em></a> details some of the studio’s struggles behind the scenes, including inexperience with the multiplayer genre and a “constantly changing vision.”</p><p>Rocksteady, the UK-based studio owned by Warner Bros. Discovery, was tasked with developing a <em>Suicide Squad</em> game in 2016. At this time, new Rocksteady employees were reportedly unaware that the studio was developing a multiplayer game, as Rocksteady is known for its single-player action-adventure games like <em>Batman: Arkham Knight</em>. This caused many employees to leave, <em>Bloomberg</em> reports.</p><p>The game’s development didn’t go smoothly. Rocksteady’s leaders kept changing their ideas for the game, turning their focus from melee combat to heavy gunplay, <em>Bloomberg </em>reports. The studio struggled with making its battles, levels, and bosses feel less repetitive — one of the biggest issues for live-service titles, where players are asked to retread large parts of the game. The studio also wasn’t accustomed to the level of complexity required to develop such a massive map and the four playable characters, according to <em>Bloomberg</em>.</p><p>Rocksteady co-founders Sefton Hill and Jamie Walker <a href="https://www.rocksteadyltd.com/news/letter/">left the studio in 2022</a> to start a new endeavor, with continued setbacks like this pushing the game’s release date until this year. Warner Bros. Discovery revealed the game’s $200 million loss during the company’s earnings call in May, with CEO David Zaslav calling its release “disappointing.”</p><p>Financial pressure in the gaming industry only continues to mount as studios contend with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24009039/video-game-layoffs-2023">layoffs affecting thousands of workers</a>. Some major studios have <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172733/summer-game-fest-video-game-announcements-layoffs-labor-live-service-fortnite">turned to live-service games</a>, like <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em>, in an attempt to strike a constant source of revenue. But in Warner Bros. Discovery’s case, this backfired. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Rocksteady has now turned its attention to a director’s cut version of <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> and may even start working on another single-player game. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-next-helldivers-2-warbond-has-new-rewards-%E2%80%94-and-some-big-changes.891633/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24172932/helldivers-2-viper-commandos-warbond-announcement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="Au91OD">A new Warbond is on the way to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24071317/helldivers-2-starship-troopers-video-game-great"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a>, and it’s the first step in Arrowhead shaking up the game’s update schedule. The Viper Commandos Warbond is themed after jungle combat — camo prints, red berets, bare arms, throwing knives, skull masks, and everything else you can equip while CCR’s “Fortunate Son” blasts over a speaker nearby.</p>
<p id="M4R79T">Warbonds can be unlocked with 1000 Super Credits, which can be purchased with real money or collected around minor points of interest on the map. Fans have criticized Warbonds for coming a little too frequently without enough unique items to justify them, and the Viper Commandos Warbond takes that feedback into account.</p>
<p id="0xFNRz">“Based on player input, we’re changing our approach to Warbonds moving forward in a couple of ways,” <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/06/06/helldivers-ii-enlists-the-viper-commandos-warbond-on-june-13/">wrote community manager Katherine Baskin on the official Sony site</a>. “Firstly, we’re slowing down the pace at which we release Warbonds to give us a little bit more time to polish these designs before they’re released. Secondly, we are changing the arrangement of items in each Warbond to make room for new item types. It’s time to focus on quality over quantity.”</p>
<div id="M1nw9x"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jbb5ngK36x4?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="7Tw1aT">Players can unlock a new Liberator Carbine, designed for close quarters combat, as well as a new secondary weapon that packs a lot of punch in the SG-22 Bushwhacker triple-barrel sawed off shotgun. The PH-9 Predator armor is a clear reference to, well, <em>Predator</em> — and I’m tempted to unlock it just for the cute beret. For those who prefer heavy armor, the PH-202 Twigsnapper keeps similar aesthetics with a little more protection. Both armors feature bare arms and a new Peak Physique passive, which improves melee damage and weapon handling.</p>
<p id="JwtaMj">The most exciting weapon is a new utility item: a throwing knife. I’m not sure if throwing knives will pack the same punch as shotguns and orbital lasers, but it definitely scores points for being cool and stylish.</p>
<p id="1nWRyY">The Viper Commandos Warbond also features camo skins for the hellpods, Exosuits, and Pelican-1. It should be nice to be able to customize these things, adding a certain panache to the otherwise plain-looking mech suits and hellpods. A new booster, Experimental Infusion, makes stims even more of a life-saver by giving injections a boost to movement speed and damage reduction.</p>
<p id="Lqub3P">The Warbond also comes with the typical rewards of capes, player cards, and emotes.</p>
<p id="rP57DP">It’s interesting to see Arrowhead shake things up. There are some big narrative happenings right now, since players <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24170825/helldivers-2-meridia-system-major-order-black-hole">turned the super colony of Meridia into an ominous black hole</a>. If things escalate further, at least we’ll have these fun new toys to throw at our alien enemies. The Viper Commandos Warbond will release on all platforms on June 13. </p>

And to get it out of the way, no, you don’t need to play the first <em>Octopath Traveler</em>. You shouldn’t, despite it also being available on Xbox Game Pass. It’s not that it’s a bad game, it’s just that <em>Octopath Traveler II</em> is a more refined title that improves upon its predecessor in every way.</p><figure id="" data-id="8541303344c4ccd974785cf7c1e95002" data-recommend-id="image://8541303344c4ccd974785cf7c1e95002" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Partitio saying &quot;*sniff* Mmm, the scent of commerce!

You choose one to begin the game as and quickly start unraveling each party member’s story till they eventually intertwine into a grand web.<br></p><p>Each of the eight protagonists falls into a traditional archetype defined by their job. There is Throne the thief, Agnea the dancer, Hikari the warrior, and on and on. Each one’s job defines the tone of their narrative, with Throne’s, for instance, involving heists, betrayal, and revenge in Solistia’s crime world. The ability to swap between characters and pursue their narratives however you see fit leads to a wonderful balance. Some stories may be emotionally and mechanically intensive, but you can always follow it up with something silly, such as Agnea’s charming journey to become a famous performer in the big city. All these clashing tones meld together remarkably well and evoke the tonal shifts of classic <em>Final Fantasy</em> adventures.</p><p>The job archetypes of each character also inform their mechanical abilities. Inside of combat, each character will have special attacks and skills you’d expect for a thief, a mage or whatever that character’s job happens to be.

It revolves around two specific features, boosting and breaking. Combat occurs in a turn order represented on the screen. By attacking an enemy’s weakness, they can be broken, pushing them to the back of the turn order. You can also use special attacks called boosts which can be done by spending boost points that accrue every turn. This boost and break system turns into a strategic game of knowing when to build up your boost and when to unleash a strong attack in tandem with breaking the enemy to keep them from attacking as much as possible. This is best shown off during the game’s intense boss battles that require you to be at your best at all times.</p><figure id="" data-id="0aba61d68a033e3444073403b9ff9ca8" data-recommend-id="image://0aba61d68a033e3444073403b9ff9ca8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hunter breaks an enemy in combat " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A hunter breaks an enemy in combat " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0aba61d68a033e3444073403b9ff9ca8" data-recommend-id="image://0aba61d68a033e3444073403b9ff9ca8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hunter breaks an enemy in combat " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But the unique twist of <em>Octopath Traveler II </em>is that you can also use skills outside of combat. Many of the game’s quests require you to complete mechanical puzzles only specific characters can solve. That might involve using Throne’s steal ability to lift a key, or Hikari’s combat prowess to knock out guards and sneak past. With a day and night cycle, <em>Octopath Traveler II</em> also gives each character different skills for different times of day, so players need to experiment with not just their party makeup but also the time of day to solve specific problems.<br></p><p>As a vast, dozens-of-hours-long, retro-inspired RPG, there is a lot to see and get lost in while playing <em>Octopath Traveler II</em>. It’s a game best enjoyed at your own pace, which is why it’s so nice that the story is separated into chapters that are each just an hour or two long. All the while, the game’s gorgeous <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/live-a-live-switch-square-enix-dragon-quest-jrpg-1849341082&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/live-a-live-switch-square-enix-dragon-quest-jrpg-1849341082">HD-2D</a></span> visuals and phenomenal score are there to give your eyes and ears a feast.

"The thing is, Cyberpunk is very specific when it comes to its construction.</p><p>"It’s incredibly difficult to figure out a way where New Game Plus could be done in a way that doesn’t completely break the way the game is constructed."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"It’s incredibly difficult to figure out a way where New Game Plus could be done in a way that doesn’t completely break the way the game is constructed.</p></div><p>Sasko referenced Bethesda's latest RPG <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-review">Starfield</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfields-new-game-plus-is-its-most-intriguing-concept-if-you-get-lucky">its New Game Plus system</a>, which actually ties into the overall story and has a logical explanation for how and why the entire world is resetting, and seemed to suggest this was the only option for incorporating the New Game Plus mechanic.</p><p>He didn't address why Cyberpunk 2077 couldn't have a more traditional means of New Game Plus, however, that simply sees the player restart the story while keeping abilities or experience. This is how <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/the-witcher-3-the-wild-hunt-review">The Witcher 3's</a> version of the system worked, as it had no story connection or explanation for the reset whatsoever and just allowed players to experience the game again with a few extras.</p><p>Sasko even admitted Cyberpunk 2077 was designed to be replayed, which would suggest this style of New Game Plus would work well.</p><p>"It’s to be replayed. It’s to try different life paths, try different romances, try different builds," he said. "There’s so many things that you can at least, twice or three times, have a very varied experience in 2077. So this is another answer, the game was built to be replayed that way."</p><p>Fans still holding out hope for a New Game Plus mode shouldn't hold their breath, as CD Projekt announced <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/finally-35-years-after-launch-no-one-is-working-on-cyberpunk-2077-at-cd-projekt">there is no longer a dedicated Cyberpunk 2077 team</a> working at the studio as employees instead <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-gets-last-big-update-tomorrow-as-cd-projekt-moves-on-to-cyberpunk-2-witcher-4">turned their attention to its sequel</a> and, predominantly, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nearly-half-of-cd-projekt-now-working-on-the-witcher-4">the next Witcher game</a>.</p><p>That's not to say it won't receive any support in the future, however, as CD Projekt confirmed to IGN that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-will-get-fsr3-support-at-some-point">Cyberpunk 2077 will still get the long promised FidelityFX Super Resolution 3 (FSR3) support</a> at some point.</p><p>Development was wound down after the release of its first and only expansion, Phantom Liberty, in September 2023. It came after the game-changing Update 2.0, which <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/cyberpunk-2077/All_Cyberpunk_2077_2.0_Updates_and_Changes">completely revamped Cyberpunk 2077 with features such as a new perk system and improved AI</a>, and was followed by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-update-21-patch-notes-include-metro-system-romantic-hangouts-and-new-vehicles">another big update in 2.1</a> but only minor changes afterwards.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-review">In our 9/10 review</a>, IGN said: "Cyberpunk 2077 throws you into a beautiful, dense cityscape and offers a staggering amount of flexibility in how you choose to take it from there."</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

It will launch on August 6. <span id="more-886683"></span></p><p>“One of our key pillars is making new games the old-fashioned way,” said Digital Eclipse head Mike Mika in a press release. “We love and celebrate games where every pixel is hand-crafted. <em>Volgarr</em> was one of those games we couldn’t put down, no matter how hard it was. Games like this are a rare breed, and we’re happy to play a role in seeing <em>Volgarr II</em> realized.”</p><p>Crazy Viking Studios CEO and creative director Kristofor Durrschmidt added, “<em>Volgarr</em> is known for being easy to learn, hard to master. For some, that might even be an understatement. But that design philosophy guided every aspect of development for <em>Volgarr II</em>. We learned a lot from launching the original, and even with some modern updates, fans are going to love the sequel. <em>Volgarr</em> is still a game where, if you want the ultimate experience, you’ll need to really master what it asks of you.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Digital Eclipse:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>More than a decade after <em>Volgarr the Viking</em>‘s bloodbath of a debut from Crazy Viking Studios, which sold more than one million copies across PC and consoles, the barbarian king’s <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,513 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> continues in an uncompromising new form. Set against the backdrop of new and bigger-than-ever Norse-inspired worlds, <em>Volgarr the Viking II</em> ups the ante on the original’s hardcore 2D side-scrolling action in an expanded odyssey where every playthrough is grislier than the last.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The reveal trailer teases a selection of levels and enemy encounters, underscoring just how many times you’ll die (and die again)—all while progressively learning and mastering movesets, level layouts, and enemy attacks. <em>Volgarr the Viking II</em>‘s satisfyingly punishing torment will forge you into a true warrior, demanding precision, strategy, and an indomitable spirit to conquer the unforgiving world.</p><p>As the great warrior Volgarr, choose your actions wisely when entering battle, as precision is everything. One false move can spell a one-way ticket to Valhalla. Jump, duck, slide, and dodge to avoid deadly enemies while remaining cognizant of the threats posed by your environment.</p><p>While the sequel delivers the same unforgiving 1980s-arcade level of difficulty as the original, Volgarr’s a little older now, his muscles have wizened, and he graciously welcomes some new features that won’t agitate the arthritis: a practice mode, checkpoints, save profiles, and unlimited continues—but at what cost? If you can survive without these modern comforts, you’ll unlock everything the game has to offer. If not… death comes knocking.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_886710"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features Include:</strong></p><ul><li>Stave off death with new power-ups and magic items.</li><li>A roster of ruthless bosses so big and so ugly, they’re just begging to have their heads chopped off.</li><li>An epic orchestral soundtrack to carry you through battle.</li><li>Handy speedrunning tools, including an on-screen timer and no-HUD mode.</li><li>Six distinct endings based on player performance—only the masterfully skilled will unlock a hidden level to battle a secret final boss!</li><li>Modern era upgrades include a practice mode and multiple profile save options.</li><li>Buckets of blood and bone explosions.</li><li>Loincloths.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

<p>When we first received our PlayStation 5 review unit from Sony in 2020, we reacted with some bemusement to the "8K" logo on the box and its implied promise of full 7630×4320 resolution output. We then promptly forgot all about it since native 8K content <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/1294400/8k-tv-shipments-worldwide/">and 8K compatible TVs</a> have remained a relative curiosity thus far in the PS5's lifespan.</p>
<p>But on Wednesday, Digital Foundry's John Linneman discovered that Sony has quietly removed that longstanding 8K label from the PS5 box. The ultra-high-resolution promise no longer appears on <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-console-model-group-slim">the packaging shown on Sony's official PlayStation Direct store</a>, a change that appears to have happened between <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240121065345/https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-console-model-group-slim">late January</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240220195209/https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-console-model-group-slim">mid-February</a>, according to Internet Archive captures of the store page (the old "8K" box can still be seen at <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/consoles-hardware/playstation-5/consoles/products/sony-playstation-5-console/11108140.html">other online retailers</a>, though).</p>
<h2>A promise deferred</h2>
<p>This packaging change has been a long time coming since the PS5 hasn't technically been living up to its 8K promise for years now. While Sony's Mark Cerny mentioned the then-upcoming hardware's 8K support <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/sonys-ps4-successor-sports-3d-audio-tech-faster-ssd-storage/">in a 2019 interview</a>, the system eventually launched with a pretty big "coming soon" caveat for that feature. "PS5 is compatible with 8K displays at launch, and after a future system software update will be able to output resolutions up to 8K when content is available, with supported software," the company <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2020/11/09/ps5-the-ultimate-faq/">said in an FAQ</a> surrounding the console's 2020 launch.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Well over three years later, that 8K-enabling software update has yet to appear, meaning the console's <em>technical</em> ability to push 8K graphics is still a <em>practical</em> impossibility for users. Until Sony's long-promised software patch hits, even PS5 games that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-the-touryst-8k-60fps-on-ps5">render frames internally at a full 8K resolution</a> are still pushing out a downscaled 4K framebuffer through that HDMI 2.1 cable.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ppl.jpg" data-height="647" data-width="1200" alt="A slide from TV manufacturer TCL guesses at some details for the next micro-generation of high-end game consoles."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ppl.jpg" data-height="647" data-width="1200">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> A slide from TV manufacturer TCL guesses at some details for the next micro-generation of high-end game consoles.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>At this point, though, there's some reason to expect that the promised patch may never come to the standard PS5. At the moment, the ever-churning rumor mill is expecting <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/new-ps5-pro-rumors-point-to-a-monster-8k-gaming-console">an impending mid-generation PS5 Pro upgrade</a> that could offer true, native 8K resolution support right out of the box. If that comes to pass, removing the outdated "8K" promise from the original PS5 packaging could be a subtle way to highlight the additional power of the upcoming "Pro" upgrade.</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/8k4k.jpg" data-height="735" data-width="2000" alt="A slight majority of participants in a double-blind study saw no discernible difference between a 4K and 8K image video clips."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/8k4k.jpg" data-height="735" data-width="2000">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> A slight majority of participants in a double-blind study saw no discernible difference between a 4K and 8K image video clips.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>So will console gamers be missing out if they don't upgrade to an 8K-compatible display? Probably not, as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/05/does-the-world-really-need-8k-resolution-game-consoles/">studies show extremely diminishing returns</a> in the perceived quality jump from 4K to 8K visual content for most users and living room setups. Unless you are sitting extremely close to an extremely large display, it's pretty unlikely you'll even be able to tell the difference.

It's reportedly part of Microsoft's multiplatform strategy, Project Latitude, and the company is considering placing it on rival platforms. PlayStation 5 is one obvious option here, but that could potentially mean Nintendo Switch as well.</p><p>If this remaster exists, however, it's also apparently not going to be announced at Microsoft's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-airs-june-9-followed-by-mystery-event/1100-6523072/" data-ref-id="1100-6523072">upcoming showcase on June 9</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-rumors-black-ops-6-release-date-xbox-handheld-new-doom-starfield-ps5-and-more/2900-5455/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5455">Microsoft's showcase</a> will also reportedly feature a new entry in the Doom series called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/doom-the-dark-ages-will-be-revealed-at-xbox-showcase-according-to-report/1100-6523727/" data-ref-id="1100-6523727">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, as well as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gears-6-could-be-teased-this-summer-insider-claims/1100-6522398/" data-ref-id="1100-6522398">new entry in the Gears of War</a> franchise.</p><p>Microsoft has already brought some of its former <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-plans-to-launch-these-four-games-on-rival-platforms/1100-6521266/" data-ref-id="1100-6521266">Xbox exclusives to PlayStation</a> and Nintendo Switch.

                <p dir="ltr">Alongside a new location to explore, campaign to complete, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-raid-launch-time-and-everything-we-know/1100-6522790/" data-ref-id="1100-6522790">raid</a> to take on, one of the key additions in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-guides-hub/1100-6523936/" data-ref-id="1100-6523936">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a> is Prismatic. This is a new subclass, of which we've only ever had five in Destiny's history, but this one is much different in that it blends together old and new options from the existing Light and Darkness subclasses to give you an interesting blend. With so many choices comes a lot of complexity, so we're here to guide you through everything there is to know about Prismatic, including how to unlock it and all of its Supers, Aspects, Fragments, and other options, as well as recommended builds as we start to wrap our heads around what's possible.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_to_unlock_Prismatic">How to unlock Prismatic</a></li><li><a href="#How_to_get_more_Prismatic_Supers__grenades__Aspects__and_Fragments">How to get more Prismatic Supers, grenades, Aspects, and Fragments</a></li><li><a href="#Transcendence">Transcendence</a></li><li><a href="#Prismatic_tips">Prismatic tips</a></li><li><a href="#Recommended_Prismatic_builds">Recommended Prismatic builds</a><ul><li><a href="#Titan">Titan</a></li><li><a href="#Hunter">Hunter</a></li><li><a href="#Warlock">Warlock</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_unlock_Prismatic">How to unlock Prismatic</h2><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shapes-prismatic-subclass-avoids-the-mistakes-of-strand-in-lightfall/1100-6523730/" data-ref-id="1100-6523730">Unlike Strand or Stasis</a>, Prismatic is put into your hands early in the Final Shape campaign, and it isn't taken away. You'll have unrestricted access to it, although it takes time to unlock all of its customization options (more on that below). Simply fire up the campaign, and you'll be mixing Light and Darkness like never before on your path to confronting The Witness. Part of this involves unlocking an entirely new Super and Aspect, which will also be available when using the corresponding elemental's subclass, in addition to Prismatic.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_to_get_more_Prismatic_Supers__grenades__Aspects__and_Fragments">How to get more Prismatic Supers, grenades, Aspects, and Fragments</h2><p dir="ltr">What makes Prismatic so exciting and fun are all of the options you'll eventually have at your disposal. Playing through the campaign will get you a limited selection of Supers, grenades, Aspects, and Fragments, but as you can see on the customization screen, there are more that await you.</p><p dir="ltr">As soon as you're done with the campaign, you'll be able to start the <strong>Destined Heroes</strong> quest, which will eventually allow you to unlock the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-ergo-sum-the-new-exotic-sword-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/1100-6523991/" data-ref-id="1100-6523991">Ergo Sum Exotic sword</a>. But part of that extended questline involves completing several other missions, which contain some great story content but also will fill in much of your Prismatic arsenal.</p><p dir="ltr">Ghost will offer you two Transcendence quests, each aligned with either the Light or Darkness. You can complete them in either order, but completing them and their associated Adventures will each provide an additional grenade option, Aspect, and Super. Once you're done with these, you should have all of your Prismatic unlocks available, except for Fragments.</p><p dir="ltr">New Prismatic Fragments are unlocked in a different way. <strong>Hidden Prismatic chests</strong> can be discovered throughout the Pale Heart, and it's by opening these that you'll be able to round out your arsenal. We're working on tracking all of these down, and we'll have a guide to help you find these soon.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Transcendence">Transcendence</h2><p dir="ltr">Aside from the interplay that opens up from being able to mix and match elements of the different subclasses, Transcendence is perhaps the most key element of Prismatic. Two new bars will be located under your Super meter when using Prismatic. The Light bar is filled by dealing damage with Void, Solar, or Arc ability or weapon damage, while the Darkness bar is filled by Stasis or Strand abilities and weapons. (Kinetic weapons slowly build up both bars.) Once both bars are filled, you can activate Transcendence. This does a few things:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Increases weapon damage</li><li dir="ltr">Instantly refreshes grenade and melee abilities</li><li dir="ltr">Increases grenade energy regeneration when dealing melee damage</li><li dir="ltr">Increases melee ability energy regeneration when dealing grenade damage</li><li dir="ltr">Swaps your grenade to a special Prismatic version</li><li dir="ltr">Provides damage resistance</li></ul><p dir="ltr">This state only lasts for a limited time, although kills do refill your meter, allowing you to extend the duration. The meters can be filled more quickly by standing on glowing pink/purple patches on the ground, which you'll typically see in the campaign any time you encounter special types of enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">Being Transcendent is required in order to make certain foes--Bound enemies, those that you'll see with a similar sort of pinkish-purple coating around them--vulnerable to damage. Any damage dealt to these enemies while Transcendent allows you to start attacking them with any damage type, although if they're left alone for long enough, they'll become Bound again.</p><p dir="ltr">Prismatic synergizes well with the aforementioned Ergo Sum, which has a perk--Transcendent Duelist--that helps to speed up filling the Light and Darkness bars, deals increased damage while Transcendent, and further extends its duration when getting kills with the sword while Transcendent.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Prismatic_tips">Prismatic tips</h2><p dir="ltr">The nature of Prismatic means you really need to think through your build, perhaps more so than any other subclass. While you can have fun mixing any combination of abilities, Supers, Aspects, and Fragments, there are clear synergies to be had. It also opens up some other interesting possibilities that we're still discovering. Here are some tips based on our time with it so far:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Equipping a reliable Strand or Stasis weapon in addition to a Void, Solar, or Arc one can make it easier to consistently build up your bars to activate Transcendence.</li><li dir="ltr">As noted above, Bound enemies are invincible until damaged by a Transcendent player, but if necessary, you can rapidly build up your Light and Darkness bars by firing at a Bound foe, allowing you to activate Transcendence.</li><li dir="ltr">Before activating Transcendence, be sure to use your grenade and melee charges. Because they'll be automatically refreshed (and your grenade replaced with a Prismatic one), you can deal some extra damage this way.</li><li dir="ltr">Keep alternating between your grenade and melee ability. Dealing damage with either one while Transcendent will rapidly speed up energy regeneration for the other, allowing you to jump back and forth between them.</li><li dir="ltr">Transcendence does not make you invincible. It's easy to feel empowered by its increased damage resistance, but don't mistake that power for invincibility--particularly if you're in a Darkness Zone where a death can be costly.</li></ul><h2 dir="ltr" id="Recommended_Prismatic_builds">Recommended Prismatic builds</h2><p dir="ltr">We're still digging our teeth into all of the possibilities that Prismatic allows, but here are some early suggestions for builds or combos to consider. We'll continue adding more as we spend more time with the subclass, but be sure to let us know what you like using in the comments below.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Titan">Titan</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4314062-titanprismatic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314062" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4314062-titanprismatic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314062"></a><figcaption>Prismatic Titan</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4314062-titanprismatic.jpg"></figure><p>An enticing combo comes with the Consecration Aspect. While sliding, this lets you use a melee charge to launch out Solar energy to scorch targets, and then slam down to ignite them. But while the Solar subclass would normally have just one melee charge, you can opt for Frenzied Blade, which can store up to three melee charges. This way, you can potentially use Consecration multiple times in a row, or just more often in general. To make this even more powerful, you can equip the Facet of Ruin Fragment, which (among other things) increases Solar ignitions' area of effect, making these even more devastating.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Hunter">Hunter</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4314061-hunterprismatic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314061" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4314061-hunterprismatic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314061"></a><figcaption>Prismatic Hunter</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4314061-hunterprismatic.jpg"></figure><p>As a Hunter, you can leverage the ability to go invisible with other subclass perks. The Void Aspect Stylish Executioner will give you Invisibility and Truesight whenever you defeat an enemy who is weakened, suppressed, or volatile; it also weakens a target when you melee attack an enemy while invisible. Combine that with Gambler's Dodge--the Arc subclass ability--which fully recharges your melee when you dodge near an enemy, and then you have access to a melee more often. Then, equip the Combination Blow melee, which buffs your melee damage as you get kills and recharges your class ability when you get a kill (in addition to giving you health), and you have an amazing loop:</p><p dir="ltr">Void debuff an enemy, kill them with your melee to go invisible, buffing your melee damage, dodge to restore your melee, and weaken an enemy by doing a melee attack while invisible, restarting the loop and providing that Void debuff.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Warlock">Warlock</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4314060-warlockprismatic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314060" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4314060-warlockprismatic.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4314060"></a><figcaption>Prismatic Warlock</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4314060-warlockprismatic.jpg"></figure><p>Prismatic pairs very nicely with the Getaway Artist Exotic gauntlets and Bleak Watcher Aspect. You're able to keep Radiant, Devour, and Amplified activated through most combat encounters and have both multiple Bleak Watchers deployed along with an Arc Soul.</p>

<p data-characters="294" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It was unclear whether <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>, the upcoming fighting game, would include local multiplayer. Those rumors have now been seemingly laid to bed, as the local multiplayer gameplay functionality was spotted by Twitter/X user SLOplays on the updated PS Store listing of the game.</p> <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="336" data-injectable="false">The rumors about local multiplayer’s absence arose when the ​​PlayStation and Steam pages listed it as a single-player game only with no mention of offline multiplayer. It was also <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/dragon-ball-z-sparking-zero-reportedly-wont-launch-with-split-scree-mode-co-op-2-player/">reported</a> earlier that game producer Jun Furutani said that local split-screen will not be present due to “issues relating to Sony and Microsoft.”</p> <figure data-current-count="636" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">MAJOR SPARKING ZERO NEWS!

 <p data-characters="193" data-current-count="193" data-injectable="false">If the store page is believed, it looks like local multiplayer will be in the cards. Local multiplayer has been a staple mode in fighting games, and its absence would have been felt among fans.</p> <p data-characters="265" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="true"><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking!

<p data-characters="173" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Amid a wave of other titles losing Xbox exclusivity, reports suggest that Microsoft is working on a <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> remaster and is considering it for rival platforms. </p> <p data-characters="248" data-current-count="248" data-injectable="false">The Verge’s Tom Warren <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172684/microsoft-xbox-showcase-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a>, “One game that is being considered for release on PS5 is Halo. Sources tell me Microsoft is working on some form of <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> remaster that is also being considered for rival consoles.” </p> <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="522" data-injectable="true">A <em>Halo</em>-to-PS5 announcement at the upcoming <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/where-and-when-to-watch-the-xbox-games-showcase-2024-and-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a> on June 9 would steal the show, but that dream might not become a reality. “I don’t expect Microsoft to announce this during the showcase as it is early days for the remaster,” Warren claimed. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie </figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="585" data-injectable="true"><em>Halo: Combat Evolved </em>was first launched on Xbox in 2001 and served as the first title in what would become one of the most iconic franchises in history. The title would be a great entry point for new fans of the series on PlayStation and continues a trend of titles losing exclusivity.</p>
 <p data-characters="370" data-current-count="370" data-injectable="false">In February, Microsoft <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xbox-is-bringing-four-games-to-other-platforms-and-teasing-hardware-news-to-come/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that <em>Pentiment</em>, <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, <em>Grounded</em>, and <em>Sea of Thieves</em> would be leaping from Xbox to other platforms. Phil Spencer, Head of Xbox, saw this as a chance to create more revenue for the titles and open the door for future iterations and sequels. However, Microsoft’s new vision of creating more opportunities has also come at a cost.</p> <p data-characters="536" data-current-count="906" data-injectable="false">In January, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/microsoft-lays-off-1900-employees-from-activision-blizzard-and-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft laid off 1,900 employees</a> from Activision Blizzard and Xbox. Then, in May, Xbox Games Studios <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/redfall-and-hi-fi-rush-developers-shut-down-in-another-awful-wave-of-microsoft-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down</a> Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks, and Alpha Dog Games and merged a fourth studio. PlayStation players should be excited that they might finally get to experience <em>Halo</em> and everything the iconic FPS franchise has to offer on their boxes. Yet at the same time, Microsoft’s recent string of decisions has raised eyebrows and scared some long-time Xbox players about the future of their platform moving forward. </p>

<p data-characters="315" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If solo shredding isn’t enough for you, some of the former developers behind the <em>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater </em>series are here to throw 49 other players in the mix. <em>Wrekless </em>has been revealed as a skateboarding game that supports up to 50 players online, and it’s heading to Early Access later this year.</p> <p data-characters="471" data-current-count="471" data-injectable="true"><em>Wrekless </em>currently has a Q3 2024 window penciled in for its Early Access debut on Steam. According to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1931930/Wrekless/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page</a>, the team at the California-based Free Range Games—which is also behind <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/lord-of-the-rings-return-to-moria-dated-for-ps5-and-pc-xbox-comes-later/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria</a></em>—was founded by folks who worked on <em>Pro Skater </em>and “other action sports games in the 2000s.” They describe <em>Wrekless </em>as the “massively multiplayer collaborative skateboarding game we’ve always wanted to make.”&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Wrekless Reveal Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nZfUiMJ03No?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="653" data-injectable="true">In addition to skating around, mastering combos, and pulling off increasingly elaborate tricks, <em>Wrekless </em>lets you construct skate parks in real time. You can team up with friends and skate and build at the same time, from familiar warehouse parks to city-sized constructions with massive ramps, bouncy floors, lava pits, and other novel additions.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="459" data-current-count="459" data-injectable="false">Once you’ve completed a park you’ll be able to share it online with the rest of the community, so it sounds like <em>Wrekless </em>is going all in on the creative aspect. As the “Why Early Access?” portion indicates, this is an ambitious effort that’s going to take a lot of work to get to the finish line, especially with all the user-generated content to consider. We’ll see how it pans out once the wheels hit the pavement.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="277" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><a href="https://www.warframe.com/news/coming-soon-ember-heirloom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ember is going to be the third Warframe to receive a Heirloom skin</a>, gracing the Fashionframe community, Ember mains, and… certain types of internet dwellers. Fans, rejoice because so much has improved with the Heirloom Collection since it first started in the Winter of 2023.</p> <p data-characters="203" data-current-count="203" data-injectable="false">This skin was originally made as a concept by <a href="https://twitter.com/CleoNaturin" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Warframe</em> content creator Vik / Cleo Naturin</a>. Digital Extremes saw the art and immediately bought it soon after, making it a reality coming to the game.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true">This is a huge win for everyone, because the Heirloom skin looks amazing. It was a huge letdown when the Frost and Mag skins from last year were literally paywalled. They had a steep price and came with stuff that many of us didn’t want just as a way to bloat the prices.</p>
 <p data-characters="98" data-current-count="98" data-injectable="false">Since then, Digital Extremes has learned how to make the upcoming Heirloom sets consumer-friendly.</p> <figure data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 id="h-ember-heirloom-collection-details-revealed" data-injectable="false">Ember Heirloom Collection details revealed</h2> <p data-characters="190" data-current-count="588" data-injectable="true">Starting with the biggest W of them all, the Ember Heirloom collection will now be available for purchase for 24.99 USD or for 475 Platinum. Stay tuned for that when it comes out on July 20.</p>
 <p data-characters="46" data-current-count="46" data-injectable="false">Buying the collection gives you the following:</p> <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="286" data-injectable="false"> <li>Ember Heirloom Skin</li> <li>Ember Heirloom Signa</li> <li>Ember Heirloom Glyph</li> <li>Ember Heirloom Sigil</li> <li>Ember Heirloom Color Palette</li> <li>Ember Heirloom Prex Card</li> </ul> <p data-characters="139" data-current-count="425" data-injectable="true">If you buy the collection with real-world money, you will also receive 425 Platinum. You can also buy the parts individually if you choose.</p>
 <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false">This will be applicable to Ember and Ember Prime, so all of us copping this on day one will be able to use this skin despite which variant we have. Also, the Ember Prime Resurgence event will happen exactly on July 20, lining up everything so you can get her if you don’t have her yet.</p> <p data-characters="212" data-current-count="499" data-injectable="true">And then the cherry on top is that moving forward, the Heirloom skins will not be leaving. There will be no FOMO. It’ll only go away for purchasing with real-world money once the next Heirloom bundle comes out.</p>
 <p data-characters="46" data-current-count="46" data-injectable="false">Now, for the other side of the fan response…</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">The Ember Heirloom Skin has people acting up</h2> <p data-characters="191" data-current-count="237" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/ovxaYxLbUNE?si=aqXUP7nXB767URu5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Whether you were there during Devsteam 180</a>, saw the aftermath in the YouTube comments section, or on Reddit, there was a lot of praise about the Ember Heirloom skin because of her… looks.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="167" data-current-count="404" data-injectable="true">To put it bluntly, this Ember skin has a noticeable posterior. The live chat was flooded with “gyatt” responses and other meme quotes usually referring to butts.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="322" data-injectable="false">The dev team already knew what fan responses would be once the skin was shown, so they leaned in on Ember’s curvature and gave it a good inspection. In all good fun, they spun it around and danced over every possible word without outright mentioning the objectively “best” features of the frame in her Heirloom skin.</p> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="635" data-injectable="true">It took a while to actually notice that there’s an actual skin attached to this feature, and it’s great. The energy details on the body, paired with the flames on her helmet, the back of her heels, and around her neck are impeccable. The steep price isn’t going to stop any Ember fan from getting this skin.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">And finally, Ember’s viability</h2> <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="255" data-injectable="false">Butt jokes and appreciation aside, the skin is actually fantastic. This does raise another concern, though. It can be more of a hope, but with all the reworks and buffs done to other frames, it feels like Ember has sort of been left behind by power creep.</p> <figure data-current-count="555" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false">Laid out by Reddit user Leskendle45, they express a sentiment that resonates with many other people who play <em>Warframe</em>. She’s been given a lot of tweaks since her initial release, with her kit sounding good on paper. However, in later-game content, she starts to struggle in terms of survivability and damage output.</p> <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="625" data-injectable="false">Fire is one of the better elements in <em>Warframe</em>, but her abilities don’t have the output that really reflects that in the long run. Hopefully, with enough traction, she’ll get a revisit since her popularity is about to blow up with this skin. But still, we should bask in the glory that is Ember Heirloom.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/nightdive-and-ziggurat-are-restoring-a-cult-classic-with-killing-time-resurrected/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=nightdive-and-ziggurat-are-restoring-a-cult-classic-with-killing-time-resurrected<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="297" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Nightdive Studios <a href="https://youtu.be/Zkvx_2g68n4?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced their</a> next remastering project at the Guerilla Collective today. This time, they’re teaming with their fellow retro enthusiasts at Ziggurat to put the polisher on 3DO’s 1995 cult-classic FPS, <em>Killing Time</em>. <em>Killing Time: Resurrected</em> will be released later this year.</p> <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true"><em>Killing Time</em> is one of the few games I own for my 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, one of the doomed consoles of the ‘90s. While playing through the first area of the game, I stopped myself because, while the game is fine, it was obviously not the ideal way to play it. The 3DO version is rather choppy, and the controller affords little comfort. There was a PC port, and I already owned it on GOG, so I figured I might as well just play that version.</p>
 <p data-characters="16" data-current-count="16" data-injectable="false">But I never did.</p> <figure data-current-count="316" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Killing Time Announcement Trailer | Nightdive Studios" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zkvx_2g68n4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="577" data-injectable="true">Now, I definitely will. Nightdive is bringing us what will most likely be the definitive way of playing <em>Killing Time</em>. Beyond simply being ported to a modern engine, the trailer shows off completely updated sprites and textures, mouselook, and smoother movement.</p>
 <p data-characters="453" data-current-count="453" data-injectable="true">I spoke to Nightdive about the new sprites and textures. Some of the updates are drawn from original source photographs and models whereever they were able to find backups of them. Some, however, were exclusive to the PC version, and Nightdive artist Albert Marin Garau says that to remake them he “modeled, rigged, skinned and animated those exclusive PC enemies and render hi-res sprites that match the quality of the other hi-res assets.”</p>
 <p data-characters="46" data-current-count="46" data-injectable="false">I’ll write about it in more detail soon.</p> <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="412" data-injectable="true"><em>Killing Time</em> is a rather obscure FPS, but don’t get it <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-poed-definitive-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">twisted with <em>PO’ed</em></a>. While both games were initially released on the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer and both games were ambitious for their time, <em>Killing Time</em> just stuck the landing better. Rather than a series of levels, the world was more open-ish. It told a story using digitized actors and was fully voiced.</p>
 <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false">The story involves an island where an ancient Egyptian curse causes a number of high-society people to vanish. Your task is to undo that curse, but standing in your way is a number of sometimes bizarre enemies. One of the first types that you fight is ducks, which is sad. The only thing you should be firing at ducks is bread.</p> <p data-characters="116" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="false"><em>Killing Time: Resurrected</em> is coming to PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, Switch, and PC sometime later this year.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/demonschool-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/demonschool-hands-on-preview-%E2%80%93-persona-of-a-different-kind.891543/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/demonschool-preview/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/demonschool-announced-for-pc-and-consoles/">Demonschool</a> by Necrosoft Games made more than <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2024-great-months-ahead/">a few heads turn</a> when it was revealed in 2022, and for good reasons. Combining gorgeous old-school visuals with a unique atmosphere reminiscent of Italian horror movies and an evident classic Persona influence, the game looked like the one to keep track of for fans of the ATLUS series who prefer the classic first entry in the franchise as well as Persona 2 Innocent Sin and Eternal Punishment.</p>
<p>Following two years of almost complete silence, which made people fear the worst, a Demonschool playable demo is available as part of this year's Steam Next Fest, giving players the chance to experience a week in the life of Faye, the final heir of a legendary family of demon hunters, as she attempts to uncover the mystery of an island university together with some friends, an island where demons have started appearing, and the boundary between worlds, started getting thinner and thinner. While the demo drops players a few hours into the adventure and lacks all of the mechanics that will be available in the final release, I feel it does a great job showcasing some of the most unique features of the experience.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240601124113_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The story of Demonschool is probably the hardest feature to evaluate from the demo. From what can be gleaned, Faye's investigation will go hand-in-hand with university life, and an occult theme seems to permeate everything. For example, the demo begins after Faye and her companions have successfully investigated some sort of possessed VHS tape and have been rewarded for it with school credits that can be used to learn new abilities. The week that can be experienced in the demo is centered around finding a demonic paintbrush, and during the investigation, the party will meet all sorts of wacky characters, such as an amnesiac woman who thinks random people are actually her husband who seems to be the main focus of a longer subquest. Thankfully, it seems like secondary quests will be hard to miss, as the quick travel interface highlights any important event that is about to take place in a certain location. Ultimately, the week available in the demo passes by rather quickly thanks to a gripping enough story that is possibly made more enjoyable by the game's beautiful and colorful 2D visuals and the atmospheric soundtrack that gives the experience a sort of horror-noir vibe. If the entirety of the story manages to do the same, it remains to be seen, but I'm definitely hopeful.</p>
<p>The real highlight of the Demonschool demo is the combat system, which is quite unique compared to most role-playing games on the market. After encountering an enemy, the party gets transported to a combat arena where both the player and the AI-controlled enemies take turns to move their units and take action. Actions play all together at the end of the Planning Phase, where the player can take all the time needed to move their units. A single unit can be moved and attack enemies as long as enough AP is available, though multiple actions from a single unit increase their AP cost.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/20240601124811_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>A few rather unique quirks make the Demonschool combat system intriguing. For starters, units can only move in straight lines and must use a special maneuver called Sidestep, which doesn't cost AP to adjust their movement range. Attacking enemies requires positioning characters in the correct range, and each attack also pushes the attacked unit, allowing the player to plan things out so that it will become possible to attack an enemy out of range at the start of the Planning Phase. Additionally, just defeating enemies is not enough to win, as not only players must defeat a required number of demons, but they also have to reach the opposite side of the combat arena with any character to seal a portal. Add in different roles for playable characters, frequent demon respawns, and special attacks with different properties, and you get a uniquely challenging battle system that could take some time to understand, but it offers a lot of strategic depth, making battles extremely fun.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, my in-game week in the Demonschool demo flew by, and it has definitely left me hungering for more, especially as the demo hints that there will be more to do than just fight demons and progress through the main adventure. Hopefully, the wait won't be much longer, and the game will indeed be released on PC and consoles in the second quarter of the year, as currently listed on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1900250/Demonschool/">Steam Store page.</a></p>
<p><em>Demo early access provided by the publisher.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24170739/sweet-tooth-netflix-pinkie-finger-shaking-machine<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="oOdKkc"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/22517814/sweet-tooth-review-netflix"><em>Sweet Tooth</em></a>, a loose adaptation of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/22538573/sweet-tooth-comic-changes-creator-jeff-lemire-interview">Jeff Lemire’s comic series of the same name</a>, is an undersung treat of Netflix’s library. The post-apocalyptic coming-of-age quest mixes the dreamlike qualities of a fable with the factional drama of a <em>Walking Dead</em> story, in a world where all human children are born as animal hybrids and a deadly virus called the Sick whittles away at teens and adults. </p>
<p id="pvYcUe">But in filming for the final season of <em>Sweet Tooth</em>, premiering today, showrunner Jim Mickle says that if anything, his long-running actors were excited about the prospect of their characters contracting the Sick.</p>
<p id="RgXxRN">You know, because it meant they’d get to try out the pinkie-finger-wiggling machine. </p>
<p id="ZW24aD">In <em>Sweet Tooth</em>, the earliest symptom of the Sick is that the patient develops an uncontrollable twitch in their littlest fingers. It’s a great visual, a tiny detail that represents huge revelations. Characters conceal and reveal their hands depending on who they trust; other characters demand to see their hands before allowing them close. In <em>Sweet Tooth</em>, a money shot of a twitching pinkie finger can be a shocking twist. </p>
<p id="jI6uQm">But we wondered: Was shaking one’s pinkie finger in complete isolation to the rest of the hand difficult for the <em>Sweet Tooth</em> cast? </p>
<p id="6atlZZ">“Yes!” Mickle told Polygon over video chat. “But you could tell that they were excited, like, <em>I get to try</em> [the pinkie finger twitch]<em>!</em> They would always get kind of into it.”</p>
<p id="WnDZdj">Mickle’s goal for the finger shaking was to make it look like an involuntary movement. “You know sometimes your eyelid flutters, or something, you have a little movement? That was exactly what I wanted it to be: a weird, involuntary thing. [...] It has to be more than just you can do naturally or organically. It has to be a thing that feels like your body is reflexively doing that.” </p>
<p id="Ho8dFR">Achieving that effect unaided was not always easy, but for anyone who found it difficult, <em>Sweet Tooth</em>’s effects team developed a bespoke pinkie-wiggling machine using the spin of a laptop’s hard drive. “That was the motor,” Mickle said, “and they connected that, basically taped it to a wire that went up someone’s arm and they just animated the hard drive and it would actually [shake their finger].” </p>
<p id="DSc0iD">By season 3, the pinkie-wiggling machine had evolved to boast its own motor that would sit underneath the actor’s clothing on their back, “and it would run up a cable that would go on your [arm with a] bicycle brake cable, and we tape it to the pinkie.” </p>
<p id="8lHhF8">Still, the devices remained finicky and were prone to failing entirely if the actor bent their elbow. “We spent probably days of our lives on set just going, <em>OK, roll!</em> and you’d roll and be like, <em>OK, and pinkie!</em> and it would just...” Here Mickle raised his hand and twitched his pinkie a measly one time. “...do that and stop. And we would constantly do that.”</p>

<p id="Dr5uMc"><em>12 Angry Men</em> hits just as hard now as it did back in 1957. A true pressure cooker of a film, this monochrome classic proves how much you can do with a cast of 12 dudes in a single room.</p>

If this were an offline game, it would still be mine to play.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-messy-true-story-behind-the-making-of-destiny-1737556731&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-messy-true-story-behind-the-making-of-destiny-1737556731">The Messy, True Story Behind The Making Of <em>Destiny</em></a></span></p><p>That last point has been exacerbated for me during my time spent playing <em>The Final Shape</em>, which sends players to an old location not seen since <em>Destiny 2</em> launched in 2017. If I wanted to remind myself of its consequence, to relive it in its original context, I simply cannot. I don’t like that I can’t go back and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-the-final-shape-ten-years-tiktok-1851518305&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-the-final-shape-ten-years-tiktok-1851518305">play all of this story</a></span> from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-lore-catch-up-mynameisbyf-1851513216&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-lore-catch-up-mynameisbyf-1851513216">beginning to end</a></span> without massive gaps. </p><p>I get that <em>Destiny</em> didn’t have some sort of grand plan for its story to unfold over the course of a decade. You don’t need a degree in literature to see that recent developments weren’t in the minds of writers when the game first shipped in 2013. Hell, if you finished the first <em>Destiny</em> campaign, it was pretty obvious that there really wasn’t much of a story, beyond references to wizards on moons and characters literally saying they didn’t have time to explain why they didn’t have time to explain.</p><figure id="" data-id="03a95ba5f73a3d01b7e69ca1a5a8e3bc" data-recommend-id="image://03a95ba5f73a3d01b7e69ca1a5a8e3bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Guardian visits the old tower in Destiny 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Guardian visits the old tower in Destiny 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bungie / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="03a95ba5f73a3d01b7e69ca1a5a8e3bc" data-recommend-id="image://03a95ba5f73a3d01b7e69ca1a5a8e3bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Guardian visits the old tower in Destiny 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But I would still like to be able to play this solar-system-spanning adventure from beginning to end. I want to see and hear the evolution of its world-class far-future sci-fi aesthetic shift and evolve over the course of a massive campaign. Heck, right now, I want to be able to play it <em>at all</em>. I want to play it like an offline, single-player game.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-the-final-shape-ten-years-tiktok-1851518305&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-the-final-shape-ten-years-tiktok-1851518305"><em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em> Has Players Getting Emotional About The Last 10 Years</a></span></p><p>Alas, I can’t. The original <em>Destiny 2</em> campaign and the three expansions that followed are locked away. And several other events were temporary, ephemeral, only to be lived in and enjoyed in the moment. I can appreciate that conceptually, but I’m not sure if I like it in exchange for concrete experiences I can take in on my own, with the ability to go through a complete story arc, and see how this wild sci-fi story came to be what it is now.</p><p>There’s value in multiplayer experiences for sure. But as I sit here and am still looking at repeat “Error” screens that have persisted throughout my entire writing of this blog, I just really wish I could play the main story on my own, without an internet connection. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/redfall-final-update-arkane-austin-1851509877&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/redfall-final-update-arkane-austin-1851509877">Even <em>Redfall</em> now has that</a></span>.
