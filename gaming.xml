		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/splatoon-3">Splatoon 3</a> update 11.0.0 has been released, and Nintendo has made some really interesting changes to the game, adding things like Flow Aura, health bars and tweaking hit box sizes.</p>
<p>Presumably inspired by the whole “aura farming” slang, players that are doing well in battle are now granted a Flow Aura, which grants the Run Speed Up, Swim Speed Up, Ink Resistance Up and Intensify Action abilities while it lasts. You can extend the effect by defeating more enemies, or getting assists.</p>


<p>Speaking of defeating enemies, you no longer have to look to see how splattered enemies are for an indication of their health, because when people take damage, they’ll now have a health bar – this is sensibly hidden when the opponent’s body is not visible, so it won’t reveal obscured people.</p>
<p>And then there’s a bit of give and take with hit boxes. Hit boxes for squid form are getting a bit smaller, with Nintendo reasoning that players are now more skilled with motion controls than they were a decade ago. At the same time, the projectiles are being tweaked, so that shorter range weapons have larger hit box projectiles, and longer range are more like the same. It means that it’ll be harder for snipers to hit a squid form player, while encouraging the short-ranged weapon players to really get up close and personal.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that these are some pretty core changes, Nintendo has noted that they anticipate having a smaller point update in the near future to tweak this new balance. In general, I think it’s probably a good update, but I know that having health bars visible is going to annoy purists, so hopefully they’re made optional.</p>

<p>Here’s the Splatoon 3 Update 11.0.0 patch notes:</p>
<p><strong>Changes to Multiplayer</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Players will now gain a Flow Aura when they do well in battle, such as when they defeat opponents consecutively within a short period of time.
<ul>
<li>The Flow Aura lasts for a short amount of time.</li>
<li>While a player’s Flow Aura persists, its duration will be extended slightly whenever they defeat an opponent or their teammates defeat an opponent they damaged.</li>
<li>When a player gains a Flow Aura or extends the duration of their Flow Aura, the ground at that player’s feet will be inked with their colour.</li>
<li>While a Flow Aura persists, the Run Speed Up, Swim Speed Up, Ink Resistance Up and Intensify Action abilities will be applied.</li>
<li>Continuously getting assists with your allies or inking territory during battles will make it more likely to gain a Flow Aura when defeating opponents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When an ally or opponent has taken damage, that player’s approximate remaining health will now be displayed.
<ul>
<li>Opponents’ remaining health will display for approximately three seconds immediately after taking damage.</li>
<li>When the main part of an opponent’s body is not visible, such as when they are behind terrain or swimming in ink, their remaining health will not display.
<ul>
<li>When things like Thermal Ink or the Point Sensor are revealing an opponent’s position, their remaining health will display even if the player cannot see them.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Slightly decreased the collision detection size for players in swim form to make it harder for opponents’ attacks to hit.</li>
<li>Expanded the collision detection size for each main weapon’s attacks to make it easier to hit opponents with attacks. Also made it so that the shorter the weapon’s shot flight distance, the greater the increase to the collision detection size will be.</li>
<li>When attempting to jump a long distance with Super Jump while the Stealth Jump ability is equipped, increased the time required to make the jump by up to one second depending on the distance.
<ul>
<li>When jumping from near the player’s base to parts farther in, or vice versa, this will increase the jump time based on the distance.</li>
<li>The increase is applied to the time spent flying through the air. This will not change the time spent on the ground preparing for the Super Jump.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adjusted the size of the circle indicating the explosion radius for the Reefslider to the radius of the area that deals 220.0 damage instead of to the radius inked.</li>
<li>Specifications for some main weapons have changed.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Changes to SplatNet 3</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Changed the used weapon display under X Rankings to show the most frequently used weapon in X Battles for that mode during a certain period instead of the last used weapon.
<ul>
<li>Due to this change, the weapon used to determine the top players for weapons will be changed in the same way.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This update focuses on making changes to battle-related systems and multiplayer balance.</p>
<p>For information about battle system changes like the Flow Aura, displaying remaining health, collision detection adjustments and extended jump duration for Super Jumps with Stealth Jump, please see the <a title="What’s new in the Splatoon 3 – Version 11.0.0 update?" href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/News/2026/January/What-s-new-in-the-Splatoon-3-Version-11-0-0-update-3011546.html" target="nintendo" rel="noopener">news article</a>.</p>
<p>Among the balance changes, the updates for the L-3 Nozzlenose and Dynamo Roller are not simple upgrades. Rather, they are performance changes to help those weapons’ unique properties stand out.</p>
<p>For the L-3 Nozzlenose, we raised the speed of shots to make it easier to utilise the weapon’s unique property: its ability to maximise power by successfully hitting opponents with its three shots. On the other hand, we lowered its inking ability to make it more difficult to fight by lying in wait without proactively approaching opponents or fighting in ways that rely on the rate of turnover for special weapons.</p>
<p>For the Dynamo Roller, in order to make each of its swings even heavier and more powerful than before, we expanded the area of inking and the area that allows players to defeat opponents with one swing and also increased the amount of ink consumed.</p>
<p>As for the other main weapons, we have made changes to make them easier to use or to emphasise unique traits among weapons with similar properties.</p>
<p>For the Reefslider special weapon, we improved its ability to defeat opponents by expanding the area of the explosion capable of defeating opponents in one hit, as well as making it harder to avoid the explosion using a small height difference. On the other hand, we reduced the maximum distance of the charge and decreased the area inked to make it harder to rely on the strategy of taking back Splat Zones using the ink from the explosion by pointing it toward a Splat Zone from a safe area and then charging.</p>
<p>Because this update includes changes to the multiplayer system that go beyond simple multiplayer balance changes, we anticipate that it will have a bigger impact on gameplay than the average update. For that reason, the next update will be sooner than normal and will focus on changes to multiplayer balance.</p>
<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixes to Player Controls
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where, when the Undercover Brella’s canopy broke at the same time as the player switching equipment to their special weapon or the Rainmaker and defeating an opponent, sometimes the brella would enter a state where the canopy recovered immediately no matter how many times it was broken.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where, when a player in an unstable wireless environment performed a dualie Dodge Roll from swimming on a wall, sometimes the player who performed the Dodge Roll would disappear on other players’ screens.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixes to Multiplayer
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where, when landing things like ink or bombs on certain positions, sometimes the inking on the player’s screen was drastically different from the inking on other players’ screens.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in MakoMart in Clam Blitz mode where it was possible for players to linger on top of the goal.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in Bluefin Depot in Splat Zones mode and Clam Blitz mode where it was possible to climb on top of certain terrain using unintended methods.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in Urchin Underpass where the electronic bulletin board in the centre of the stage and its supporting pillars blocked things like Ink Storm and Tenta Missiles.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in Urchin Underpass where, when certain walls were hit with great momentum, the player was sometimes treated as if they had left the stage and were defeated.</li>
</ul>
</li>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Valve's lawyers won't be able to file away one of the legal legalings they've been dealing with for a little while now, at least not yet. A tribunal have ruled that the £656m lawsuit brought against the company by digital rights campaigner Vicki Shotbolt and law firm Milberg London LLP last year - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-owe-you-44-quid-according-to-a-656-lawsuit-against-the-company-for-allegedly-overcharging-uk-customers">the one</a> that could net UK dwellers who've bought stuff on Steam since early June 2018 up to £44 in compensation - can go ahead.</p>
<p>As a result, Valve's Lionel Hutzes will have to face the <a href="https://steamyouoweus.co.uk/">lawsuit's accusations</a> that the company have used Steam's "dominant position" in the PC market to behave "anti-competitively", with the end result that regular folks are "paying too much for PC games and in-game content and have lesser PC Game platform alternatives".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As reported by the <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2g1md0l23o">BBC</a>, Valve had been arguing the case shouldn't get the stamp of approval to proceed to trial. However, a competition appeal tribunal have ruled that the case will be allowed to continue.</p>
<p>Here's the <a href="https://www.catribunal.org.uk/judgments/16407724-vicki-shotbolt-class-representative-limited-v-valve-corporation-judgment-cpo">summary of the tribunal's judgement</a>, which begins by outlining three key cogs to Shotbolt's accusations. The lawsuit claims that Valve impose platform parity obligations with Steam that stop publishers from selling games on rival stores with better terms. It also accuses Valve of using anti-steering provisions to lock in-game purchases made in Steam games into using the storefront's "application programming interface", wich means payments are subject to Valve’s commission charges. Finally, the lawsuit claims Valve are "imposing excessive commission charges which amount to an unfair price which is then passed on to consumers".</p><p>Valve, meanwhile, argued at this tribunal that Shotbolt's lawsuit hadn't "put forward an adequate methodology for determining Valve’s effective commission charge" and failed to consider how Steam Keys factor in. The company also claimed the suit lacked "an adequate empirical method for determining the effect" of the alleged platform parity obligations. Valve also argued that the Shotbolt's lawsuit lacked a "workable methodology" that Steam users, including minors, could use to identify themselves as being part of the group being claimed on behalf of by the lawsuit.</p>
<p>Evaluating those three arguments from Valve, the tribunal "accepted that the effect of Steam Keys is a slightly unusual feature in calculating Valve’s effective commission charge and could result in uncertainty in the price alleged to be unfair", but judged that Shotbolt and co "would be able to make a sufficient estimate using data from a range of sources". As far as the platform parity obligations went, the tribunal ruled that the lawsuit "would not simply rely on nebulous economic theory, as claimed by Valve, but rather on a mixture of evidence to support and evaluate a harm that competition law conventionally considers to occur".</p>
<p>Last of all, the tribunal opted to reject Valve's challenge about the methods of identifying which Steam users were being claimed on behalf of. Though, this came after Shotbolt and co outlined "revisions to the proposed class definition", which "tied the class tightly to the party who has suffered the loss, reducing the potential concern of the record keeping of minors".</p>
<p>So, on rumbles the case, no doubt feeling refreshed by virtue of having had a room full of people in suits shout big words at each other in relation to it.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ankers-26250mah-power-bank-hits-its-first-low-of-the-year-as-this-300w-max-3-port-charger-starts-selling-out-fast-2000663253</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Anker Prime Power Bank is a 26,250 mAh portable power bank with three ports, a compact Phantom Gray housing, and compatibility with laptops, tablets, and phones. The Anker Prime Power Bank allows you to charge up to 300W through two USB-C ports and one USB-A port, so a notebook, phone, and additional items, such as headphones or earbuds, can charge at the same time without taking turns. It’s small enough to fit into backpacks and carry-on luggage and has a TSA-approved battery size, so you can generally fly with it. There is also a smart display screen on the front of the unit that shows charging information.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6901/">You can find the Anker Prime Power Bank on Amazon today for $171, down from its original $230, which represents a savings of $59 and 26% off the original retail price.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6901/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A hefty power bank with plenty of charging power</h2>
<p><span>The charging configuration on the Anker Prime Power Bank is optimized for rapid charging of larger items while supporting smaller items. One USB-C port delivers up to 140W with a compatible 5A cable for rapid laptop recharging, and the other two USB-C and USB-A ports recharge your phone, earbuds, or other accessories simultaneously. With a maximum of 300W, you can use the bank as a central charging station rather than just to recharge your phone.</span></p>
<p>The Anker Prime Power Bank was also optimized to charge quickly, allowing the unit to spend more time available for use rather than idling due to discharge. The dual USB-C ports will accept up to 250W of combined input and allow the bank to recharge to approximately 50% in around 13 minutes and fully recharge in approximately 1 hour if you have the correct chargers.</p>



<p>In addition to displaying how much capacity remains in the bank and the current amount of power it is supplying, a smart display will show the status of each device currently charging via a simple visual display, eliminating the need to guess whether a device is charging. When paired with Anker’s app, you can view charging activity in even greater detail and adjust your usage preferences for how you want power used.</p>
<p>The flexibility of the overall design allows users to place the Anker Prime Power Bank wherever they want to recharge their devices, including desks, bags, hotel nightstands, and many other locations. The bank’s compact frame is light enough for daily carrying but feels sturdy and substantial when placed next to a laptop with several cables plugged into it. In the box, you will receive the Anker Prime Power Bank, a 3.3-foot-long 240W USB-C to USB-C cable, a travel pouch, a welcome guide, and a 24-month limited hardware warranty. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6901/">With the entire package bundled at $171 instead of the usual $230, the Anker Prime Power Bank is an affordable source of portable power in one small unit.</a></p>

            <p>One of 2025's strangest announcements from Nintendo was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/virtual-boy-nintendo-classics-announced-for-switch-1-and-2-at-nintendo-direct">the return of the Virtual Boy</a>, a hardware (and software) failure that's been reappraised over the years. Many gamers have a soft spot for it, however, so its inclusion in Nintendo Switch Online's offerings probably was an easy decision to make as the video game giant looked to spice the subscription up. Now we have access to the full roster of games available at launch and teases of more to come.</p>
<p>Via the Nintendo Today app and later YouTube (watch the video below), Nintendo released a new trailer that runs for almost four minutes and details the games coming on 17th February, other classics arriving at a later date, and even two previously unreleased titles.</p>

<p>Teleroboxer, Galactic Pinball, RED ALARM, GOLF, Virtual Boy Wario Land, 3-D TETRIS, and The Mansion of Innsmouth lead the red charge next month, with Mario Clash, Mario's Tennis, Jack Bros, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/space-invaders">Space Invaders</a> Virtual Collection, Virtual Bowling, Vertical Force, and V-Tetris coming later. Features like different rendering colours besides red, customisable controls, and rewind are part of the rollout plans too.</p><p>The two previously unreleased games are Zero Racers, a cancelled 3D F-Zero instalment originally meant to launch in 1996, and D-Hopper (originally <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Hopper">Dragon Hopper</a>), a top-down action-adventure game that was completed but also shelved in 1996 due to Virtual Boy's commercial failure.</p>
<p>Though many have expressed disdain for Nintendo's second attempt at making the Virtual Boy happen, it appears nostalgia might make this whole endeavour a success. In any case, it's refreshing to see a major publisher actually make an effort to preserve old games which weren't financially successful.</p>
<p>If you want to check these out for yourself, you'll need, on top of a Nintendo Switch system (it doesn't matter which), a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Virtual-Boy-Nintendo-Classics-2915432.html?srsltid=AfmBOorpQ1V1e0QdEiTVPr1ZOHHD7khSuB-iyn2aiwPvKp8Q0oDEtMFX">plus one of the two accessories</a> set to launch on 17th February: the Virtual Boy replica or the cheaper cardboard model, both of which work alongside the hybrid consoles to create the original 3D effects. At the time of writing, there are no plans to make these re-releases available in 2D.</p>

<p>An Intelligent Systems top-down adventure also on the way</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We now know the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendo-announces-launch-line-up-for-switch-online-virtual-boy">launch line-up</a> for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/virtual_boy_-_nintendo_classics">Virtual Boy - Nintendo Classics</a> service, coming to Nintendo Switch Online on <strong>17th February 2026</strong>. And while it's all worth getting excited over, there are two never-before-released games coming out later in the year that Nintendo enthusiasts should be particularly excited about.</p>
<p>Right at the end of the brand new overview trailer (at around <a href="https://youtu.be/nVvaCe4esCQ?si=QQAHZqkIL2PYIKMw&amp;t=187" data-yt-videoid="nVvaCe4esCQ" data-yt-start="187">3:07</a>), Nintendo showed off footage from two cancelled Virtual Boy games that will be playable for the first time ever via Nintendo Switch Online — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/zero_racers">Zero Racers</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/d-hopper">D-Hopper</a> (also known as Dragon Hopper). Both of these will be coming to the service sometime in <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Zero Racers a pretty big deal for long-time Nintendo fans — this is a cancelled <strong>F-Zero</strong> spin-off that was apparently shown off at E3 1996, but was cancelled due to the failure of the Virtual Boy. A few years ago, a former Nintendo of America localiser said that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2022/02/mythical-virtual-boy-f-zero-spin-off-was-100percent-complete-according-to-former-noa-staffer">the game "was done"</a> (as in complete), and this release seems to confirm that.</p>

<p>The latter game, D-Hopper, is from Intelligent Systems, who we know best for developing the <strong>Fire Emblem</strong> and <strong>Paper Mario</strong> games. D-Hopper is very much its own thing, and was also playable at E3 1996 — it's a top-down adventure game where you have to adventure through maze-like maps and fight enemies in order to rescue your girlfriend. A little Zelda-esque, perhaps?</p>
<p>Both of these games are fantastic additions to the service, and we're excited to check them out for the first time ever later in the year. The Virtual Boy might not be well-loved, but it's got an eclectic library of games and spin-offs.</p>
<p>The launch line-up is pretty solid too, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/golf">Golf</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/virtual_boy_wario_land">Wario Land</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/3d_tetris">3D Tetris</a> all part of the package day-one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Valve,</strong> the studio that was once known for making world-class games like <strong>Half-Life</strong> and <strong>Left 4 Dead</strong>, but is lately simply known as the people behind <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/having-your-game-be-free-on-epic-is-great-advertising-for-steam-sales-says-indie-pub-after-blood-west-sales-spiked-while-it-was-free-on-egs/">Steam</a></strong> and hardware like the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-deck-2-is-already-planned-confirms-gabe-newell/">Steam Deck</a></strong> and the upcoming <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/it-just-works-steam-machine-verified-badge-will-have-fewer-constraints-than-steam-deck-verification-to-no-ones-surprise/">Steam Machine</a></strong>, is facing a similar ire to what <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/epic-v-apple/"><strong>Apple</strong> faced in its legal bout with <strong>Epic</strong></a><strong>.</strong> The <strong><a href="https://www.catribunal.org.uk/sites/cat/files/2026-01/16407724%20Vicki%20Shotbolt%20Class%20Representative%20Limited%20v%20Valve%20Corporation%20-%20Judgment%20%28CPO%20Application%29%20%2026%20Jan%202026.pdf">London Competition Appeal Tribunal</a></strong> has declared that Valve must face a massive <strong>£656 million class-action lawsuit</strong>, arguing that the company takes an "<em><strong>excessive</strong></em>" <strong>30% revenue cut</strong> of every transaction made on Steam.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/valve-to-face-uk-class-action-lawsuit-with-proposed-damages-of-656m">GamesIndustry.Biz</a> (via <a href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/litigation/video-game-giant-valve-facing-uk-lawsuit-over-pricing-commissions-2026-01-26/">Reuters</a>), this lawsuit initially began with <strong>Vicki Shotbolt</strong>, chief executive officer of <strong>Parent Zone</strong>, filing the suit in 2024. At the time, Shotbolt said, "<em>Valve is rigging the market and taking advantage of UK gamers</em>," and that she filed the claim in an attempt "<em>to stop this unlawful conduct and have people get back what they are owed</em>."</p>



<p>The suit represents some <strong>14 million UK gamers</strong>, as it claims that the 30% commission Valve takes on every purchase is "<em>Imposing <strong>excessive commission charges</strong> which amount to an unfair price which is then passed on to consumers</em>." It also claims that Valve utilizes "<em>anti-steering provisions</em>," which amount to tactics used by Valve to keep customers on Steam, exemplified by the fact that when you purchase a game on Steam, you must also purchase any DLC or add-on content on Steam to use said content.</p>



<p>If some of this, namely the claim that Valve's 30% cut is "<em>excessive</em>," feels familiar to you, that's because back in 2021, <strong>Wolfire Studios</strong> and <strong>Dark Catt Studios</strong> filed a similar case against Valve. <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-and-sony-sued-for-establishing-digital-monopolies-with-their-stores/">Wolfire was the first to file its suit back in April 2021</a>, which also pinned the same claim against <strong>Sony</strong> with regard to the <strong>PlayStation Store</strong>. Dark Catt Studios filed its suit months later in June 2021, with Wolfire's suit ultimately being dismissed, and only some of the claims made by Dark Catt Studios getting tossed out.</p>



<p>While Dark Catt's suit continued, Wolfire reorganized its arguments and re-filed its suit against Valve. Due to the cases being so similar, they were combined in July 2022, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfire-and-dark-catts-antitrust-lawsuit-against-valve-given-class-action-status/">then in November 2024, the combined suit was given class-action status</a>.</p>



<p>Suits like this always take a while to reach a conclusion, so don't hold your breath on this making an impact on the video game industry anytime soon. That said, the potential ramifications of Valve losing a suit like this are monumental and cannot be understated. A Valve loss might even mean that company head<a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-already-generated-sales-for-16-billion-this-year-gabe-newell-gets-superyacht/"> <strong>Gabe Newell</strong> needs to cut back on his <strong>super yacht budget</strong></a>.</p>

Racking up splats in quick succession will put you in the Flow Aura state, which will increase your speed and defense, and you can keep this state going by scoring more splats or assists.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>To help you work out how close you might be to a KO in <em>Splatoon 3</em>, the new update will also make enemy health bars visible, although the bar will only show when an enemy has just been hit. You won't be able to see it if they're in cover or if they've jumped into their ink (short of certain specials).</p><p><em>Splatoon 3</em>'s hitboxes are also being adjusted to compensate for players' increased expertise with motion controls; landing a shot on an opponent in swim form will be harder, but attacks are easier to land on enemies in kid form with certain weapons.</p><p>If you'd like to see exactly what's changing, you can check out the full patch notes for <em>Splatoon 3 </em>Update 11.0.0 <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/Game-Updates/How-to-Update-Splatoon-3-2266003.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">right here</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-art-leak-canceled-remake-2000663501</link>
            <guid>1417468</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s been less than a week since Ubisoft announced it was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-black-flag-remake-delay-2000661866"><span>cancelling several projects</span></a><span>, including the long-awaited </span><i><span>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time </span></i><span>remake. That project had apparently been struggling since its 2020 announcement, having essentially started over from scratch </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-delay-ubisoft-1850470554"><span>back in 2023</span></a><span>. But while the remake itself may never see the light of day, some concept art and screenshots from the game’s 2024 pre-alpha version have started circulating online. Ubisoft, however, is doing its best to get them taken down before anyone can see what might have been.</span></p> <p><span>The art and images are from a 2024 workshop presentation, and though they don’t show the game in motion, there’s enough here to get a sense of what the team at Ubisoft was working toward before the project was canceled. The presentation was posted to YouTube, then subsequently copyright-struck by Ubisoft. Fans still managed to grab the images, though, and have been sharing them across social media.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake – the full workshop presentation 2024 was leaked on YouTube yesterday!</p> <p>I’ve put together some of what was shown during the conference — everything looks absolutely beautiful!😩😍 </p> <p>(Pre-Alpha, Early 2024)<br>Soundtrack is from the remake! <a href="https://t.co/3BDRlFlgHJ">pic.twitter.com/3BDRlFlgHJ</a></p> <p>— Prince of Persia Universe (@princeozzyX) <a href="https://twitter.com/princeozzyX/status/2016120310559334435?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 27, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>From the sound of it, the </span><i><span>Sands of Time </span></i><span>remake was even further along by the time it was canceled earlier this month, as Eman Ayaz, an actor who has hinted she was playing a role in the game, had shot a marketing promo for the game just two months prior.</span></p> <p><span>“I pushed myself past old limits and discovered things I didn’t even know existed inside of me through the lives that I lived in this character,” Ayaz </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gY0hv4QFIak"><span>says in a YouTube video</span></a><span>. “It was something that’s completely out of the range of any character that I’ve been cast in in the past. And I got to do things I’ve never gotten to do before. And it brought out what I honestly believe is the best performance of my career. And now nobody is ever going to see that. I can’t stress enough how much I had kind of planned my life around the release of this project.”</span></p>

  <p><span>While the </span><i><span>Sands of Time </span></i><span>remake is probably the most high-profile cancellation at Ubisoft this month, the company shelved five other games and delayed seven more as part of a larger restructuring. Don’t worry though,</span><i><span> Beyond Good and Evil 2 </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-remains-a-priority-for-us-ubisoft-says-2000662321"><span>is still coming</span></a><span>. </span></p>

Rather, they are performance changes to help those weapons’ unique properties stand out.</p><p>For the L-3 Nozzlenose, we raised the speed of shots to make it easier to utilise the weapon’s unique property: its ability to maximise power by successfully hitting opponents with its three shots. On the other hand, we lowered its inking ability to make it more difficult to fight by lying in wait without proactively approaching opponents or fighting in ways that rely on the rate of turnover for special weapons.</p><p>For the Dynamo Roller, in order to make each of its swings even heavier and more powerful than before, we expanded the area of inking and the area that allows players to defeat opponents with one swing and also increased the amount of ink consumed.</p><p>As for the other main weapons, we have made changes to make them easier to use or to emphasise unique traits among weapons with similar properties.</p><p>For the Reefslider special weapon, we improved its ability to defeat opponents by expanding the area of the explosion capable of defeating opponents in one hit, as well as making it harder to avoid the explosion using a small height difference. On the other hand, we reduced the maximum distance of the charge and decreased the area inked to make it harder to rely on the strategy of taking back Splat Zones using the ink from the explosion by pointing it toward a Splat Zone from a safe area and then charging.</p><p>Because this update includes changes to the multiplayer system that go beyond simple multiplayer balance changes, we anticipate that it will have a bigger impact on gameplay than the average update. For that reason, the next update will be sooner than normal and will focus on changes to multiplayer balance.</p><p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p><ul><li>Fixes to Player Controls<ul><li>Fixed an issue where, when the Undercover Brella’s canopy broke at the same time as the player switching equipment to their special weapon or the Rainmaker and defeating an opponent, sometimes the brella would enter a state where the canopy recovered immediately no matter how many times it was broken.</li><li>Fixed an issue where, when a player in an unstable wireless environment performed a dualie <a title="Companies > Dodge Roll [7 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/devolver-digital/dodge-roll">Dodge Roll</a> from swimming on a wall, sometimes the player who performed the Dodge Roll would disappear on other players’ screens.</li></ul></li><li>Fixes to Multiplayer<ul><li>Fixed an issue where, when landing things like ink or bombs on certain positions, sometimes the inking on the player’s screen was drastically different from the inking on other players’ screens.</li><li>Fixed an issue in MakoMart in Clam Blitz mode where it was possible for players to linger on top of the goal.</li><li>Fixed an issue in Bluefin Depot in Splat Zones mode and Clam Blitz mode where it was possible to climb on top of certain terrain using unintended methods.</li><li>Fixed an issue in Urchin Underpass where the electronic bulletin board in the centre of the stage and its supporting pillars blocked things like Ink Storm and Tenta Missiles.</li><li>Fixed an issue in Urchin Underpass where, when certain walls were hit with great momentum, the player was sometimes treated as if they had left the stage and were defeated.</li></ul></li></ul></blockquote><p><em>Splatoon 3</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > Switch [18,237 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/splatoon-3-version-11-0-0-update-launches-january-29]]></content:encoded>

<p>Two previously unreleased games are also coming in 2026</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Those of you excited to relive the glory days of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/virtual_boy_-_nintendo_classics">Virtual Boy</a> only have a few more weeks to wait until you can play them on Nintendo Switch Online on Switch 1 and Switch 2. <strong>17th February</strong> is approaching fast!</p>
<p>Today, Nintendo has dropped a brand new trailer confirming the launch line-up for the new service along with a handful of features and surprises.</p>
<p>Seven games will be available from the jump, with more to be added "in the future". As per usual, then. Here's all the games you'll be able to play from 17th February:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/galactic_pinball">Galactic Pinball</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/teleroboxer">Teleroboxer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/red_alarm">Red Alarm</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/virtual_boy_wario_land">Virtual Boy Wario Land</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/3d_tetris">3-D TETRIS</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/golf">Golf</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/innsmouth_no_yakata">The Mansion of Innsmouth</a><br></li>
</ul>
<p>A pretty healthy starting line-up, if we do say so ourselves. Wario Land felt like a day-one given, as did 3-D Tetris. Of course, more are coming in the future, such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/marios_tennis">Mario's Tennis</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/jack_bros">Jack Bros.</a>, and two never-before-released games in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/zero_racers">Zero Racers</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/virtualboy/d-hopper">D(ragon)-Hopper</a>.</p>
<p>To play Virtual Boy games, you'll need to grab the Virtual Boy accessory for your console; either the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/virtual-boy-for-nintendo-switch-2-120829/">standard one</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/virtual-boy-cardboard-model-for-nintendo-switch-2-120828/">cardboard version</a> will do.</p>
<p>Other features available on the service include the ability to Rewind gameplay, make save states, check and remap controls, and — later in the year — change the colour of the screen.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-siege-breakers-warbond</link>
            <guid>1417426</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Arrowhead have announced Siege Breakers, the latest Warbond for <em>Helldivers 2</em>, and this one's all about big, loud explosions, which are, as I'm sure we can all agree, the ideal way to spread democracy throughout the galaxy.</p><p>In many ways, Siege Breakers provides the perfect counterpoint to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-redacted-regiment-warbond" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="460a9d06-01c8-4dde-8dcd-17b098a9a0f5" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">Redacted Regiment</a>, the Warbond from a couple of weeks ago, because that one focused on stealth and this one...absolutely does not.</p><p>The first major addition to <em>Helldivers 2 </em>in Siege Breakers is the LAS-16 Trident, an updated version of the beloved weapon from the original arsenal. This one fires six beams instead of three, and when it comes to annihilating enemies, that's definitely a marked improvement.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Siege Breakers brings new weapons like this laser-focused bad boy.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If you prefer to get up close and personal (well, even more up close and personal), then the new CQC-20 Breaching Hammer stratagem will allow you to do just that. It's a massive sledgehammer that can optionally also explode. I say "optionally", but that sounds pretty mandatory to me.</p><p>Joining the new hammer is the GL-28 Belt-Fed Grenade Launcher, which, as the name suggests, is an explosive weapon that lets you continuously fire grenades. It should be perfect for those pesky Terminid hives.</p><p>Should you prefer to make one very loud noise rather than a series of slightly less loud noises, you may want to check out the EAT-411 Leveller, a single-shot missile launcher with a serious kick.</p><p>Lastly, if all of this ordnance isn't working for you and you need to protect yourself, the G/SH-39 Shield should help you do just that by providing a barrier that should stop more than a few Automaton shots.</p>
<p>All of this is, of course, coming in addition to new armors, capes, and other accouterments to help your Helldiver stand out and look snazzy on the battlefield.</p><p><em>Helldivers 2</em>'s Siege Breakers Warbond launches across all platforms on February 3rd.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-adds-the-looney-tunes-sweetheart-tweety-bird-to-its-valentines-day-deal-at-a-record-low-2000663257</link>
            <guid>1417420</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The LEGO Looney Tunes Sweetheart Tweety Bird Figure is a 412-piece kit that lets you turn the iconic yellow canary into a heart-inspired display you can pose and change up. Once you have completed the figure and used the posable head, wings, tail, and feet, you can choose to either position Tweety on the pedestal, cloud, as a matchmaker, or by removing Tweety from the base, placing the bouquet under his arm, and attaching the heart above his head so he appears to be providing a gift.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6900/">You can go to Amazon and purchase the LEGO Looney Tunes Sweetheart Tweety Bird Figure for $24, which is $11 cheaper than the original retail price of $35, and a 31% discount.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6900/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A LEGO project featuring the Looney Tunes’ most iconic bird</h2>
<p>This Valentine-themed build of Tweety offers a couple of obvious options to style the figure so it continues to interest you after you finish the build. First, you can put Tweety on the pedestal cloud, place the bow and arrow within his wings, and create a fun playfulness by posing Tweety as Cupid to fit in with Valentine’s Day on a nightstand or desk. Second, when you want to tone things down a bit, you can take Tweety off the pedestal, give him the bouquet, and place the heart on top of his head so he looks like the giver.</p>
<p>The use of posable joints allows the LEGO Looney Tunes Sweetheart Tweety Bird Figure to appear more lively than a fixed decoration that never changes position. Additionally, since the model is made from LEGO elements, you can move some pieces around if you would like to slightly change how he looks or stands, without using a specialized tool or additional components.</p>



<p>The design features and functionality of this set also enable it to serve a dual purpose as a decorative item rather than simply a one-time build that you throw in storage. The pedestal is compact, so the space required for this item will be small enough to fit on a dresser corner, a bookshelf, or an office shelf.</p>
<p>The step-by-step instructions for building the model are intended to create a fun, satisfying experience as each part goes into place. The directions start by showing you how to form the body and head of Tweety, and then proceed to the pedestal and accessories so that you see the character develop in stages. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6900/">Once the figure is placed on display, you have a charming Looney Tunes figure that you can re-position as many times as you desire, and given the fact that the item is available for $24 on sale, down from the normal $35</a>, it makes for a simple and affordable little project that’s worth building.</p>

              <p><span>Not even the </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> community is safe from AI ensloppification.</span></p> <p><span>With the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-you-need-to-know-animal-crossing-kappn-update-switch-2-2000654252"><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span> 3.0 update</span></a><span> only a few weeks old, players have been hard at work sprucing up their islands and posting pictures of all their hard decorating work. But some have been using generative AI to “enhance” their photos or fabricate them altogether, and fans are getting pissed.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Sharing stylistic edits of </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> screenshots online is a foundational pillar of the game’s community. Photos are typically edited to enhance the game’s lighting and shadows, or put through filters to achieve a certain vibe. Photos with the best vibes are rewarded with likes, upvotes, or whatever the clout currency is for a particular social media website. However, </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-ai-slop-aesthetic/"><i><span>Polygon </span></i><span>reports</span></a><span> that on X and elsewhere, </span><i><span>AC </span></i><span>screenshots enhanced with AI have started trending, often without disclosure that genAI was used.</span></p>

 <p><span>“I think it’s time we talk about the AI use in </span><i><span>Animal Crossing </span></i><span>aesthetic posts that are trending,” </span><a href="https://x.com/cozyberru/status/2015462841139314792?s=20"><span>wrote user Cozyberru on X</span></a><span>. In a thread, they highlight how a number of recently trending&nbsp;<em>AC</em> screenshots were likely created with genAI, pointing out the usual suspects of funky-looking numbers and warped textures on background items. But their issue isn’t so much with using the tool itself. “All I am asking is to be honest and disclose your use of AI or editing,” they wrote.</span></p>   <p><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> has thousands of little knick-knacks, pieces of furniture, and more. Not sharing that an </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> photo has been enhanced with AI can lead to confusion in players who might want to get their hands on something they don’t know has been wholly made up.</span></p>

 <p><span>In the thread, one commenter </span><a href="https://x.com/salFreeApps/status/2015536285998625106?s=20"><span>thanked Cozyberru for their service</span></a><span>. “I’ve been sitting here thinking, ‘is there a mod or hack or glitch going around that I don’t know?’ Because there’s no way to place that item that close to the furniture as much as I want to.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Cozyberru doesn’t explicitly share their feelings about genAI, but others shared theirs in the thread’s comments and elsewhere online. Though it’s not called out specifically in the rules, it seems the </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> subreddit has a strict “No genAI policy.” In a post regarding fanart, a moderator advised community members not to report anything that wasn’t </span><span>“</span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1q4powt/please_stop_reporting_art_posts_as_low_quality/"><span>blatantly NSFW or AI.</span></a><span>”</span><span>&nbsp;In another post, a user reposted a video of their island after the original was </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1qaz4ms/nearly_3000_hours_and_35_years_later_my_island_is/"><span>taken down for using text-to-speech AI voiceover</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘We’re Next to Go’ – Why Ubisoft’s ‘Creative Network’ Employees Fear Imminent Layoffs]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-creative-network/</link>
            <guid>1417414</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s been a week since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a> announced its massive restructuring, which saw six projects cancelled, seven titles delayed, and two studios closed. The company’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-falls-to-12-year-low-amid-company-uncertainty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stock price dropped to a 15-year low</a>, a 95% decline from its peak valuation. </p>



<p>The company’s announcement revolved around its new ‘Creative Houses’ structure, which will see its IPs placed into five different categories, organized around distinct genres and franchises. As announced by Ubisoft, each Creative House will have its own leadership structure and will be responsible for brand development, content strategy, and editorial direction for that particular Creative House.</p>







<p>A ‘Creative Network’ of studios will strengthen these Creative Houses, providing technical support, QA, and other development resources. It’s a change that Ubisoft say will bring more structure, speedy game development, and the ability to deploy technical resources across its portfolio. </p>



<p>It’s yet another change enforced at the publisher that has made employees feel uneasy. Some tell me that they feel like this is just a way to eventually sell off their IPs, while others theorise it’s a means to get cash injections into creating more subsidiaries with other companies more easily. Very few think that’s a meaningful change that will make much of a difference because, at the end of the day, it’s still the same people in charge who put the company is this place in the first place.</p>



<h2 id="h-creative-network-employees-are-worried">Creative Network Employees Are Worried</h2>



<p>For the most part, and understandably so, most employees who currently work at Ubisoft are frustrated, confused, and worried about the future. Ubisoft’s third, and apparently final, cost-cutting measure will aim to save another 200 million euros by March 2028, a move that could result in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-human-cost-ubisofts-next-cost-cutting-measure-could-see-another-2000-jobs-lost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thousands of developers being laid off.</a> But the most noticeable of the worried employees come from Ubisoft’s new ‘Creative Network’, who tell me that the restructuring feels like it only applies to half of the company and suggests that they are easy targets for future layoffs.</p>



<p>That’s because, while not released to the public, Ubisoft has already outlined and assigned studios to each Creative House and the Creative Network, with around 20 studios now in the Creative Network. But internally, nothing has been set in stone or assigned regarding how they will assist the Houses.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has been sent documentation outlining which Ubisoft Studios will go to which Creative House.</p>







<h3 id="h-creative-house-1-vantage-studios">Creative House 1 (Vantage Studios)</h3>



<p><strong>Games </strong>– Assassin’s Creed, Far Cry, Rainbow Six</p>



<p><strong>Studios –</strong> Barcelona, Montreal Vantage, Quedec, Saguenay, Sherbrooke, Sofia</p>



<h3 id="h-creative-house-2">Creative House 2</h3>



<p><strong>Games –</strong> Ghost Recon, Splinter Cell, The Division, Avatar</p>



<p><strong>Studios </strong>– Paris (Ghost Recon), Massive, Montreal CH2, Toronto</p>



<p><em>Avatar was missing from the publicly released documents. When asked for comment about the future of Avatar, a Ubisoft spokesperson told Insider Gaming, “Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is a live game with internal teams working on it.”</em></p>



<h3 id="h-creative-house-3">Creative House 3</h3>



<p><strong>Games –</strong> Brawlhalla, For Honor, Riders Republic, Skull &amp; Bones, The Crew</p>



<p><strong>Studios –</strong> Blue Mammoth Games, Ivory Tower, Montreal CH3</p>



<h3 id="h-creative-house-4">Creative House 4</h3>



<p><strong>Games –</strong> Anno, Beyond Good and Evil, Might &amp; Magic, Prince of Persia, Rayman, Trackmania</p>



<p><strong>Studios – </strong>Mainz, Milan, Montepellier, Montreal CH4, Nadeo</p>



<h3 id="h-creative-house-5">Creative House 5</h3>



<div><p><strong>Games – </strong>Growtopia, Hasbro Games, Howrse, Hungry Shark, Invincible: Guarding the Glode, Just Dance, Kolibri’s portfolio, Ketchapp’s portfolio, UNO</p><p><strong>Studios –</strong> Abu Dhabi, Barcelona Mobile, Ketchapp, Kolibrio Games, Paris (Just Dance), Ubisoft Mobile Games, Ubisoft Paris Mobile</p></div>

<h2 id="h-darker-days-to-come">Darker Days to Come</h2>



<p>It’s unfortunate to say, but despite an insane amount of good IPs and games to hopefully come, it still feels like Ubisoft’s darkest days aren’t yet over. Officially, it’ll be March 2028 before the cost-cutting will stop, but it feels like Ubisoft’s rollercoaster story of twists and turns are only just beginning.</p>



<p>Just yesterday, and even before the impending announcement of more layoffs in February, Ubisoft announced it aims to cut <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-proposes-200-job-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">200 jobs at Ubisoft Paris’ headquarters</a>, a move that has seen the French <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-employees-vote-to-strike-against-recent-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft unions propose a strike from February 10-12</a>. </p>



<p>The unfortunate thing about all this is that, as always, it will be the developers who suffer the conseqeven before the impending announcement of more layoffs in February, Ubisoft announced it aims to cut 200 jobs at its Paris headquarters, a move that has prompted the French Ubisoft unions touences of years of misleadership. </p>

<p>The French Ubisoft unions have unanimously agreed to organize a strike against the company between February 10 and 12, 2026.</p>



<p>For those unaware, Ubisoft recently announced a major restructure to the organisation, which would lead to multiple studio closures and layoffs. The first set of dismissals has already been revealed, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-proposes-200-job-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">200 job cuts proposed</a> at the Paris Headquarters. The French unions have agreed to strike and are coordinating with international counterparts. </p>







<h2 id="h-ubisoft-strike-to-take-place-this-february">Ubisoft Strike to Take Place this February </h2>



<p>According to a report by the French publication <a href="https://www.lesechos.fr/tech-medias/hightech/ubisoft-les-syndicats-francais-appellent-a-une-greve-massive-du-10-au-12-fevrier-2212033" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Les Echos</a>, several unions representing Ubisoft workers—namely the Video Game Workers’ Union (STJV), Solidaires Informatique, CFE-CGC, CGT, and Printemps Écologique—have unanimously agreed to strike from February 10 to 12. The unions also plan to collaborate with their international counterparts to raise awareness of the situation on a global scale.</p>



<p>The reason for the strike is the new austerity measures aimed at reducing the company’s fixed costs by €200 million over the next two years, along with&nbsp;stricter remote working conditions. This decision is expected to result in layoffs, with the first voluntary mutual termination already proposed. The layoffs could affect 20% of Ubisoft’s headquarters workforce and 5% of its total workforce in France.</p>



<p>The Ubisoft restructure has already led to the cancellation of the highly anticipated <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia Remake</a>, along with five other games. The new operating model will focus on open-world adventures and GaaS-native experiences, featuring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-operation-model-features-5-creative-houses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5 creative houses</a>. The restructuring has already led to a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shares-crash-by-30-after-restructure-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">major decline in the company’s share price</a>. </p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splatoon-3-review-a-lot-more-of-the-brilliant-same">Splatoon 3</a> will be four years old later this year, and despite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-end-of-splatoon-3-regular-updates">Nintendo ending regular update plans</a> in late 2024 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splatoon-raiders-announced-for-switch-2-plus-a-chonky-splatoon-3-update-incoming">Splatoon Raiders</a> being deep into development, we're still getting new content and gameplay patches.</p>
<p>Last summer's 10.0.0 update enhanced the game with new weapon kits, an extra map, and plenty of tweaks and smaller additions. Moreover, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> owners got a resolution increase and rock-solid framerates. Ahead of Raiders, it felt like the perfect farewell to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon-3">Splatoon 3</a> and a way to solidify its continued online domination on Switch consoles until a fourth game hits, as it sounds like the spinoff's priorities are PvE-oriented.</p>
<p>Today, 27th January, we've been surprised by yet another major patch coming to Splatoon 3 as soon as this week. The meta-shaking <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/News/2026/January/What-s-new-in-the-Splatoon-3-Version-11-0-0-update-3011546.html">11.0.0 update</a> drops on 29th January, so plan your weekend accordingly.</p>
<p>The "meta-shaking" bit isn't a joke or an exaggeration. While it doesn't add new content to the jumbo-sized threequel, it changes and expands the gameplay significantly with tweaks and even an all-new mechanic: Flow Aura.</p>
<p>"Inklings and Octolings who splat multiple opponents in quick succession will enter a new state called Flow Aura," the official post explains. This multi-frag boost of sorts goes on for longer than 30 seconds if you splat more opponents and/or assist teammates. During this period, ink bursts around the player and speed, resistance, and "intensify actions" receive enhancements. This will no doubt encourage more aggressive play styles across the board, perhaps in an attempt by the devs to minimize the impact of campers and cheap opportunist strategies, further pushing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/splatoon">Splatoon</a> into the classical "arena shooter" space.</p><p>Another massive addition is that of a Stealth Jump gear ability which "allows players to jump to their teammates without the opposing team necessarily seeing where they will land." As a way to offset its massive potential, the developers have increased the flight time for this type of respawn jump.</p>

<p>Last but not least, health bars will now be shown above damaged players, but not when they're behind cover or diving into ink. While this has been a common bit of most online team-based shooters for years, Splatoon only indicated the damage sustained by other players with the amount of ink covering them. Coupled with smaller hit boxes for Inklings and Octolings when in "swim form" (as well as adjustments to weapons' own hit boxes), combat encounters might change in a big way come Thursday. Getting behind cover and swimming away from danger will be more important than ever before.</p>
