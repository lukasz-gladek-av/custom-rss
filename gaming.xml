		<p>Opening up Quakecon with yet another back catalogue remaster, id Software and Nightdive Studios have announced and released a collection of Heretic + Hexen, which is out now across PlayStation, Xbox, Switch and PC, and available on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a></p>
<p><iframe title="Heretic + Hexen Official Launch Trailer (4K) | Now Available" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IheADxVkpI4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Originally developed by Raven Software using a modified Doom engine and released in 1994 and 1995, the games pushed in the direction of RPGs, building in inventory systems, vertical aiming, character classes and more. While Nightdive avoid calling their releases remasters – technically I think they’re being fed into the KEX Engine to gain these new features – it’s still a handy shorthand.</p>
<p>This is an all-encompassing and even an expanded collection, that includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders</li>
<li>Hexen: Beyond Heretic</li>
<li>Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel</li>
<li>Two all-new episodes created in collaboration between individuals at id Software + Nightdive Studios:
<ul>
<li>Heretic: Faith Renewed</li>
<li>Hexen: Vestiges of Grandeur</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Beyond that, the games have been furnished with support for up to 4K and 120FPS on consoles, widescreen, modern controllers, in-game mod support, online cross-platform and local split-screen. There’s also an enhanced soundtrack from&nbsp;Andrew Hulshult, but you can stick with the originals.</p>

<p>In a great move, existing owners of <em>any</em> of the games will receive a free upgrade to the new combined game, and will still have access their previously owned versions.</p>

      <div><p>Go On Board's <em>Tekken: The Board Game</em> is a runaway success. The crowdfunding campaign for the tabletop adaptation of Bandai Namco's iconic fighting game has been topping the charts on the platform, reaching its funding goal in a short 35 minutes.</p>



<p>&nbsp;According to its campaign page, <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/go-on-board/tekken-the-board-game#/section/project-story" rel="nofollow"><em>Tekken: The Board Game</em></a> is an asymmetric fighting game set in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tekken-8" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Tekken</em></a> universe. It is a game for one to eight players, and a single game can take between 20 and 60 minutes. This is the second high-profile board game adaptation Go On Board is hosting on the platform. The other is the fantasy board game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/witcher-legacy-board-game-brings-more-narrative-monster-hunting-to-table" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>The Witcher: Legacy</em></a>.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tekken-the-board-game-display.jpg?itok=6Z8zZSlE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tekken-the-board-game-display.jpg?itok=-y8ZGk0X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Like the fighting game source material, you and your opponent duke it out in a one-on-one match in a hex-based arena. You each choose a character that comes with its miniature and deck of cards. Each card represents different moves: attack, push, defend, etc..You choose one of three areas to attack: low, mid, or high. If your opponent can predict where your attack is coming from, they can block, or worse, counter-attack.</p>

<p>Much like any high-end fighting game match, a game of <em>Tekken: The Board Game</em> becomes one of psychology and resource management. String together combos. Bluff your opponent with your next move. Know the right time to activate Heat and Rage Mode. The game even has an environmental destruction mechanic, letting you deal extra damage to your opponent.</p>

<p>Lastly, for dedicated <em>Tekken</em> fans, this board game has highly detailed miniatures of the franchise's iconic characters. These miniatures are larger than normal miniatures, ranging between 57.4 mm and 60 mm. The campaign even includes an Exclusive Box for early adopters containing Devil Kazuya, Azazel, and the Coliseum of Fate, Elegant Palace, and Fallen Destiny arenas.</p>

<p>The different pledge levels and add-ons for <em>Tekken: The Board Game</em> are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>The Core Set for $93:</strong> The base version of the board game contains Jin, Kazuya, King, Paul, Jack-8, Yoshimitsu, Asuka, and Nina. the <em>King of the Iron Fist</em> expansion featuring Devil Jin, and the Gamefound Exclusive Box</li>
	<li><strong>Starter Set for $33:</strong> A smaller version of the core game. It contains one arena and two fighters: Jin and Kazuya.</li>
	<li><strong>Expansion 1 for $41:</strong> An expansion containing Jun, Leroy, Xiaoyu, and Panda</li>
	<li><strong>Expansion 2 for $41:</strong> An expansion containing Heihachi, Reina, Lee and Kuma</li>
	<li><strong>Expansion 3 for $41:</strong> An expansion containing Azucena, Leo, Lili, and Shaheen</li>
	<li><strong>Expansion 4 for $41:</strong> An expansion containing Lidia, Eddy, Victor, and Raven</li>
	<li><strong>Expansion 5 for $41:</strong> An expansion featuring Lars, Alisa, Claudio, and Zafina</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, the campaign for <em>Tekken: The Board Game</em> has raised&nbsp;€367,529, 735% above its initial funding goal. The campaign ends August 19.</p>

<section><p>Ninja Gaiden 4 is shaping up to be a fun reunion for series veterans, as well as a great entry point for newcomers.</p></section>

                <p>Since its announcement earlier this year, Ninja Gaiden 4 has seemingly met just as much skepticism as excitement. Yes, after over a decade, we <em>finally </em>have a new Ninja Gaiden--but with Team Ninja and Platinum Games collaborating on its development and Microsoft publishing, is the series' identity at stake? It's a question that's been on many long-time fans' minds, as well as my own.</p><p dir="ltr">After all, there's no denying that some of what makes Ninja Gaiden such a beloved series are the little quirks we overlook out of affection. And, more often than not, these are the very same friction-inducing qualities that are promptly removed when a series is remade or rebooted. At the same time, does opting to retain each and every one of these qualities prevent the game from evolving, or becoming an exciting, modern entry-point? After spending around four hours with Ninja Gaiden 4 and speaking with the team behind it at Platinum Game's Tokyo office, I've come to a preliminary conclusion: Ninja Gaiden 4 is whatever style of Ninja Gaiden you want it to be.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Ninja Gaiden 4 Is Exactly The Ninja Gaiden Game You're Hoping It Will Be | Hands-On Impressions</p>
      </div>
<h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Flexible and fluid</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">More so than previous entries in the series, Ninja Gaiden 4 emphasizes flexibility. If you're a Ninja Gaiden veteran who loathes the idea of executing perfect dodges, locking on to enemies, and watching your Karma--the game's scoring system that rewards players for executing combos--rack up in the top left corner, you can either ignore or remove all of it. At the same time, these options, an impressively robust accessibility menu, and the game's beginner-friendly Hero mode--which auto-blocks most incoming damage--make the game extremely approachable for new audiences and those who might have been turned off by the series' brutal reputation.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545758-283a6bf1-d3ec-4366-83b0-26a243dfb3d5.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545758" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545758-283a6bf1-d3ec-4366-83b0-26a243dfb3d5.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545758"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545758-283a6bf1-d3ec-4366-83b0-26a243dfb3d5.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">That said, you'd be wrong to dismiss Ninja Gaiden 4 itself as easy. Much like previous titles, Master Ninja mode is brutal, with higher difficulties bringing increased enemy intelligence and toughness, as well as more challenging enemy staging. However, the existence of one mode of play doesn't negate the existence of the other, and thus Ninja Gaiden 4 feels wonderfully malleable.</p><p dir="ltr">"While it is true that Ninja Gaiden 4 does include these new parry mechanics and also just dodges, they're not necessarily required for you to overcome. You don't have to lean on them exclusively. They're just another addition to the wide toolset that you have available," Ninja Gaiden 4 co-director Masakazu Hirayama said. "Ninja Gaiden 4 isn't necessarily more of a defensive game than the past Ninja Gaiden titles. They're just a wider array of tools at your disposal and the effort to give players as much controllability and playability as possible.</p><p dir="ltr">"And while it may seem at first glance that the defensive techniques such as the parry and just dodge are very powerful, you might have noticed that there's this berserk gauge, and that gauge will actually decrease if you're being too defensive," he continued. "The combat is designed in a way for you to have to really engage with that back-and-forth, that high-speed back-and-forth between offense and defense."</p><p dir="ltr">In a way, this design choice reflects a larger theme in Ninja Gaiden 4: the merging of the old and the new. Ninja Gaiden 4 makes a very conscious effort to respect long-time fans, former protagonist Ryu Hayabusa, and Team Ninja's original vision. At the same time, the introduction of Platinum Games as co-developer, new protagonist Yakumo, and a vastly expanded tool kit highlight the fact that this is, in fact, a reinvention. And though this has always been the case with the Ninja Gaiden series, even 4's setting--which sees cyberpunk elements and traditional Japanese qualities come together to form a moody, cyber-ninja dystopia--exemplifies this dynamic.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet despite Ninja Gaiden being known for its brutality, this collision isn't violent. Instead, all these different components complement each other and ultimately highlight what each aspect brings to the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545765-f6ababd0-060f-421e-94e3-2298bdc18e51.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545765" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545765-f6ababd0-060f-421e-94e3-2298bdc18e51.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545765"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545765-f6ababd0-060f-421e-94e3-2298bdc18e51.png"></figure><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Yakumo vs. Ryu</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">This dynamic is perhaps most obvious when switching between the game's main characters, Yakumo and Ryu. During this preview, I finally got the chance to see how a slightly older Ryu controls. While he and Yakumo are similar mechanically and can even execute some of the same moves, there are clear distinctions in how they control. Yakumo feels lighter, faster, and dare I say a bit edgier, thanks to his Bloodraven form and ability to enter a berserk state. Ryu, on the other hand, packs a harder punch, feels more professional and precise, and comes with some of his classic Ninpo Arts in lieu of a new winged form, adding to the sense that he is truly a master ninja at this point.</p><p dir="ltr">"We wanted to design a character that would contrast with Ryu Hayabusa," Hirayama said. "Ryu Hayabusa is already the apex of super ninja status, and Yakumo is this young ninja prodigy who's starting to climb the ranks."</p><p dir="ltr">"If I were to distill the differences between the two characters into one word, Ryu is powerful, whereas Yakumo is clever," co-director Yuji Nakao added. "Both characters can utilize legacy abilities, whether it's the Izuna Drop or the Flying Swallow. But there are these elements that really distinguish the characters in these really subtle but very noticeable ways."</p><p dir="ltr">Another major difference between Yakumo and Ryu that reinforces these design principles is the fact that while Ryu sticks to his trusty blade, Yakumo has a handful of weapons to choose from, with some being more experimental than others. We were introduced to Yakumo's drill weapon, which allows him to plunge into enemies and, well, drill; it's silly, satisfying, and, like I said, he's certainly the edgier of the two, so it tracks. Another reason why Yakumo has multiple weapons, however, is simply because he is Ninja Gaiden 4's primary protagonist, so don't expect the same level of treatment--or number of chapters--for both characters.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545766-8a7346ea-96ce-4e17-958d-e939be93d142.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545766" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545766-8a7346ea-96ce-4e17-958d-e939be93d142.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545766"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545766-8a7346ea-96ce-4e17-958d-e939be93d142.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">"There are dedicated chapters for Ryu Hayabusa in the story of the game. In terms of the ratio, it leans more towards Yakumo since he is the protagonist," Hiriyama said. "But after you beat the game, it will unlock Chapter Challenge, where you can play all the chapters as Ryu Hayabusa. Likewise, can play as Yakumo in Hayabusa's dedicated chapters."</p><p dir="ltr">Fortunately during my preview, Platinum took the liberty of unlocking the game's Chapter Challenge mode, meaning I got to take both Yakumo and Ryu through the handful of included chapters, challenges, and boss fights. Doing so further drove home the differences between Yakumo and Ryu, as with Ryu I noticed that I completed objectives more quickly, but with Yakumo I had more combo-building fun. Both characters felt equally viable and fun to use, hopefully meaning that players won't dread playing through chapters that are initially bound to a certain character.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Bullet hell boss battles, cyberpunk cities</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">After going through the game's first chapters and completing a few challenges, I opted to face off against two of Ninja Gaiden 4's first bosses: a lightning sword-wielding commander and the Kitsune Cortesean. Though neither one was abnormally brutal, both offered up the same vital lesson: Unless you're playing on Hero mode, you cannot get through this game if you're just button-mashing. Whereas the fights your ninjas stumble into can be overwhelming thanks to the sheer number of strong and intuitive enemies tossed your way, these bosses were overwhelmingly powerful, and thus required me to pay attention, learn attack patterns, and intentionally move about the arena while utilizing my environment.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545761-abcf9828-8c95-4b82-9034-1d7b0be427d0.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545761" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545761-abcf9828-8c95-4b82-9034-1d7b0be427d0.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545761"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545761-abcf9828-8c95-4b82-9034-1d7b0be427d0.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">I had a great time with both of these enemies. Each felt appropriately challenging on normal difficulty and were immensely satisfying to take down. That said, traversing my environment while doing so was not as enjoyable. Due to Ninja Gaiden 4's arena sizes, I frequently found myself a bit annoyed as I tried to grapple to safety only to be just out of reach of one of the designated grappling areas. Granted, some of this could be attributed to user error, and large arenas are necessary considering Platinum (naturally) adds some of its iconic bullet hell-style combat moments to the game, such as in the Kitsune Cortesean fight. That said, it still felt a bit stilted and made traversal feel slightly less fluid for me.</p><p dir="ltr">The locations I explored in Ninja Gaiden 4 didn't vary too much from one another visually. All of them were set in a rain-drenched, dystopian Tokyo, and lean into cyberpunk visuals, complete with shadows, grime, and neon lights. That said--and although I would have loved to see variation in environments to help break things up--those included in the preview were striking and featured plenty of vistas, cinematic imagery, and interesting set pieces, such as the gargantuan, floating dragon skeleton that ensnares the city.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545759-62b90bec-34cb-4f9f-8fee-6faf354581b8.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545759" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545759-62b90bec-34cb-4f9f-8fee-6faf354581b8.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545759"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545759-62b90bec-34cb-4f9f-8fee-6faf354581b8.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">I was ultimately reassured by both the introduction of traditional Japanese elements as the story unfolds and the game's directors that not all of Ninja Gaiden 4 will take place in Tokyo's gritty underbelly. According to Hiriyama, Yakumo and Ryu will get the chance to dismember their enemies in more natural environments, too.</p><p dir="ltr">"The game itself takes place within the greater Tokyo area, but within that area there are also stages other than the cyberpunk aesthetic," Hiriyama said. "There are stages set in more natural environments, such as forests or caves. There's other environments as well. If you notice in Stage 1-3 of the build, you might have noticed that there's more of this traditional Japanese aesthetic in the stage environment, so you can expect that kind of variety in the full game."</p><p dir="ltr">That being the case, I'm certainly excited to see more of Ninja Gaiden 4's Tokyo. But what I'm most anticipating about its full release is something the Ninja Gaiden series' isn't typically praised for: its story and characters.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Unlikely allies--and enemies</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">It's still early days, but I am intrigued by the story Ninja Gaiden 4 is setting up. Though nothing of particular interest happens in the game's first chapter--which, it should be noted, is the same one that was revealed during this year's Summer Game Fest--Ninja Gaiden's prologue establishes several fun relationship dynamics. For starters, Yakumo is a member of the Raven Clan, a rival clan to Ryu's Hayabusa Clan. Things are further complicated when we discover that, in the seven years since Ryu essentially failed to completely kill the dragon whose corpse hangs over Tokyo and causes the city's blighted rain, he has since aligned himself with the Divine Dragon Order, the Raven Clan's enemy. As such, when Ryu and Yakumo finally might, it seems likely it will be as enemies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545768-e9e7588e-a722-411d-b150-36edc5647ffc.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545768" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545768-e9e7588e-a722-411d-b150-36edc5647ffc.png" data-ref-id="1300-4545768"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4545768-e9e7588e-a722-411d-b150-36edc5647ffc.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The prologue also introduces us to Ninja Gaiden 4's main heroine, the Dragon Priestess Seori. It took me all of one scene to completely adore her and the dynamic she has with Yakumo. Whereas Yakumo is quiet, edgy, and serious, Seori is filled with confidence, charm, and humor, making their forced pairing excruciating for him--even if she is exceptionally pretty. On the surface, their relationship feels a lot like Cloud and Aerith's from Final Fantasy 7, so naturally, I'm eager to see where things go.</p><p dir="ltr">Fortunately for me (and all you extremely patient Ninja Gaiden fans), we won't be waiting much longer to see how things play out. Ninja Gaiden 4 is scheduled to release on October 21 and will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. If you're an Xbox Game Pass subscriber, Ninja Gaiden 4 will be available to play at no additional cost on day one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Announced during QuakeCon 2025, id Software and Nightdive Studios have shadow dropped Heretic+Hexen, a remaster collection of the two magic-based FPS games built off the back of id Software's DOOM Engine originally developed by Raven Software in 1994 (Heretic) and 1995 (Hexen).</p>



<p>The collection is available right now on PC and all major console platforms, meaning you can grab it on Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch, though there's no specific Nintendo Switch 2 version. For Xbox players, it's also available on Xbox Game Pass on PC and consoles, so Game Pass subscribers can download it to their preferred device and begin reliving the mid-90's shooters.</p>



<p>It'll also soon be playable through <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-mafia-the-old-country-titan-quest-ii-stormgate/">GeForce Now</a>, though a specific date for its inclusion in the GeForce Now roster has not been confirmed.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>A nice boon for fans of the games who might've already purchased the digital versions of Heretic and Hexen available on the Xbox Store or Steam is that <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/heretic-hexen-release-notes">a free upgrade is available</a> for owners of Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders, Hexen: Beyond Heretic, and/or Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel.</p>



<p>And if you're new to both shooters and are picking up the collection to play them for the first time, you'll be able to play through the three titles mentioned above, along with two brand new episodes made by Nightdive and id Software, titled: Heretic: Faith Renewed and Hexen: Vestiges of Grandeur.</p>



<p>The remasters feature improved performance on the classic titles with both games playable at a 4K resolution and at 120FPS, a wide range of accessibility options and game balancing options, widescreen support, mod support, and a new Vault section that includes early concept art for the development of both games and some unused sprites for fans of the originals to sink their teeth into.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-spend-a-lot-of-time-in-my-real-life-trying-to-find-the-perfect-seat-so-why-not-do-it-in-a-game-too.1265130/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I relate a lot to the puzzles of <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3035120/Is_This_Seat_Taken/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is This Seat Taken?</a></em> I often do a lot of mental math to choose a suitable seat in a doctor’s waiting room or movie theater. I don’t want to sit near anyone wearing cologne or perfume, because it gives me a headache; in fact, I’ll try to avoid sitting near <em>anyone,</em> which I don’t think is particularly unique. (It’s actually quite diabolical to take a seat near someone else in a near empty room.) In a car or on a bus, I’m particularly prone to motion sickness in certain spots towards the back. And on an airplane, I always choose the aisle; I get up to pee a lot.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Is This Seat Taken? </em>is a puzzle game from developer Poti Poti Studios in which you’re tasked with creating a seating chart for people with particularities like me in cars, buses, diners, movie theaters, concerts, and elsewhere. Developers Ausiàs Dalmau and Sergi Pérez told me that <em>Is This Seat Taken?</em> is supposed to be relatable but relaxed. Spend as much time as you want on the puzzles; it’s both a game and a toy that’s meant to be played with.&nbsp;</p><p>“We want people to explore the different reactions between characters without any negative repercussions,” the developers said. “Also, there is no single way to solve the levels, allowing people to be creative and come up with their own resolutions.”</p><figure><figcaption><em>Poti Poti Studios</em></figcaption></figure><p>In a park, I start by dragging and dropping a person who hates bugs onto a picnic blanket furthest away from a streetlight attracting mosquitos. Another person wants to sit by her, so I drag her over to a nearby spot. But now someone <em>else</em> is angry: The second person is listening to loud music, and a person snoozing nearby on the bench has been rudely awoken. This means reorganizing the scene over and over again until everyone is happy.&nbsp;</p><p>In a movie theater, several patrons are inexplicably wearing massive cowboy hats. No one wants to sit behind those people, nor does anyone want to sit near people using their phones. (Unfortunately, I can’t kick those jokers out!) Others want to be able to sneak popcorn from someone nearby, while others simply want to sit in the middle of the theater.&nbsp;</p><p>You replay each little scenario a few times before moving on to the next level, as people come and go from, say, the bus or movie theater. Once you’ve got the perfect seating chart, a person who forgot to shower may come wandering in — so you’ll have to switch people around to account for those who don’t want to sit near someone smelly.</p><p>The game moves through different, increasingly complex scenarios in separate stages broken into European cities, like London, Brussels, and Barcelona. Each has a little overarching narrative to it all, about one of the humanoid shapes following an actor from city to city. But the narrative is just a little part of what makes <em>Is This Seat Taken?</em> a real delight. The animations are silly, and the increasing demands of the people you’re seating are even sillier. It’s satisfying to click around playing matchmaker, moving stuff around until suddenly something <em>clicks</em>.</p><p>There are no timers, which makes <em>Is This Seat Taken?</em> a more chill version of the logic tests you may have taken during high school exams. Poti Poti Studios told me that the original idea for <em>Is This Seat Taken?</em> was simply to create a game about sorting people. They played with ideas, including scoring systems based on the speed at which a player solved a level. “But in the end, we found the game was more fun if we simplified the entire scoring system and let the player freely experiment with the characters without restrictions,” they said.</p><p>Removing the barriers to completion — you don’t have to find the right seat for everyone in a level — means reaching a larger audience: “We believe that some puzzle games struggle to reach a general audience because they tend to make levels that are too difficult, or end up making levels with too many concepts added one after the other,” the developers said. If you can’t find the right spot for someone, you can move on. The benefit for getting an entire level completed with 100% satisfaction for the people you’ve seated means unlocking an extra level.</p><p>All five cities in <em>Is This Seat Taken?</em> should take most people a couple hours to complete. There’s a bit of repetition to the game and across its levels, but it doesn’t feel grating or like unnecessary padding. It’s one of those games that I want more of, but appreciate for being a short, contained experience; more levels just for the sake of levels runs the risk of the repetition becoming a problem.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Is This Seat Taken?</em> was previously available to play as a demo through the Steam Next Fest (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3035120/Is_This_Seat_Taken/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and it’s still available for free now, too</a>); the demo is just one city, Barcelona, but it’s a good taste of what <em>Is This Seat Taken?</em> Is. The full game was surprise released during Thursday’s Nintendo indie showcase for PC, Switch, and mobile.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/pc-desk-floor"><h3>Wait, Are We Not All Keeping Our PCs On Top Of Our Desks</h3></a><p>Why would you put one of the most expensive things you own on the floor where your feet go</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/eddington-ari-aster-covid-movie-pedro-pascal-joaquin-phoenix"><h3>Eddington Is A Compelling COVID Drama Until It Isn’t</h3></a><p>The film is neither good nor bad, but a secret third thing.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/akane-banashi-shonen-jump-manga-anime"><h3>The Best Shonen Manga Right Now Is About A Niche Performance Artist’s Fall From Grace</h3></a><p>Akane-banashi getting an anime isn't shocking because it's the best ongoing Shonen Jump manga</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/is-this-seat-taken-impressions-indie-direct]]></content:encoded>

<p>And it's out now</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>If you thought the day's surprises were over, think again, as Bethesda, id Software, and retro specialists Nightdive Studios have announced <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/heretic_plus_hexen">Heretic + Hexen</a>, the "definitive re-release" of two classic spell shooters. Oh, and it's also out <em>right now</em> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/heretic-hexen-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-ps4-xbox-one-switch-and-pc-now-available">Gematsu</a>!).</p>
<p>For just $14.99 (it's not up on the EU eShop at the time of writing this), you'll be able to pick up two of Raven Software's iconic first-person shooters which introduced inventory systems, vertical aiming, and character classes to the genre.</p>
<p>Heretic originally launched in 1994 on PC and was made in the DOOM engine; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/hexen">Hexen</a> is a direct sequel that followed in 1995 and got a Nintendo 64 release in North America in 1997.</p>
<p>This release bundles together all of the games' content — <strong>Heretic: Shadow of the Serpent Riders</strong>, <strong>Hexen: Beyond Heretic</strong>, and <strong>Hexen: Deathkings of the Dark Citadel</strong> — plus two new episodes created by Nightdive and id Software: <strong>Heretic: Faith Renewed</strong> and <strong>Hexen: Vestiges of Grandeur</strong>.</p>
<p>But, given that it's Nightdive at the helm, you probably want to see all the shiny new enhancements, right? Here they are (from the eShop page):</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>New Enhancements</strong><br>
• Online cross-platform and local split-screen deathmatch and co-op modes<br>
• Toggleable enhanced soundtrack from Andrew Hulshult<br>
• In-game mod support (Nintendo Switch™ only supports featured mods, curated by the team at id.)<br>
• An array of accessibility options, quality-of-life improvements, and engine fixes</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nightdive Studios just continue to keep impressing — we've only <em>just</em> got our mitts on the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/system_shock_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">System Shock 2: 25th Anniversary Remaster</a>, so it looks like we'll be dipping into Nightdive's seemingly endless pool of retro rereleases once again.</p>
<p><em>Have you played either Heretic or Hexen before? Will you be grabbing this on Switch? Let us know in the comments</em>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/friendslop-is-coming-for-the-switch-2.1265097/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>During today’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/719807/nintendo-switch-2-indie-world-direct-showcase-livestream">Nintendo Indie World showcase</a>, I had two epiphanies. The first was the realization that friendslop games are about to hit the Switch 2 like a falling piano in a Road Runner cartoon. The second was that I love that for me, because that means I can finally play them.</p><p>My friends love “friendslop,” the <a href="https://aftermath.site/friendslop-peak-lethal-company-social-media-discourse">initially derisive but now descriptive nickname</a> given to indie co-op games with a loose gameplay structure that permits the kind of chaos that can make games go viral on social media. And from what I’ve seen, I would love it, too. Friendslop is known for low-quality graphics (hence the “slop” part) that give a game a stylized look that’s common among other indie games. The term hasn’t become a ubiquitous genre descriptor like metroidvania or soulslike, but it’s still useful for labeling the kinds of casual co-op games that have <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24043555/lethal-company-best-entry-level-horror-game/">recently exploded in popularity</a>, primarily on Steam.</p><p>The problem is that playing them typically requires me getting off the couch, something I do not do. I’m a comfort gamer. If a game cannot be played from my couch, I don’t want it. Co-op games with a console release like <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/13/23759589/phasmophobia-console-xbox-series-s-x-ps5-psvr2-release-date">Phasmophobia</a></em> are perfectly fine, but PC-only games like <em>Peak</em> are nonstarters to me.</p><div><p>GameChat opens the door for a ton of similar games making their way to the Switch 2</p></div><div><p>Seeing the trailer for <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/754198/dont-forget-to-like-and-sub-die">Content Warning</a></em> during Indie World showed how <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642290/nintendo-switch-2-online-figuring-out-gamechat">the Switch 2’s GameChat feature can solve the problem</a> and close that gap, opening up more multiplatform releases for previously PC-only games. Before its arrival, playing co-op games like <em>Among Us</em> with your Switch-having friends required either being in the same room, time-consuming triangulation via Discord, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/8/30/20833244/nintendo-switch-voice-chat-headphones-games-app">attempting to use the Nintendo Switch App</a>.</p></div><p>GameChat sands down those spiky bits of friction, allowing you to connect with friends at the press of a button to play online together like in<em> Mario Kart World</em>, or play together separately, each person in the little four-player lobby chatting away while doing their own thing.</p><p>The Switch 2 GameChat feature eliminates my barrier to entry in these kinds of games. There’s no worry of trying to figure out my Steam Deck’s text or voice chat or playing on my Deck while I chat through a Discord call on my phone. (Remember, I’m lazy.) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">With one button on one device</a>, I can connect with my friends and yap to my heart’s content as we’re all eaten alive by underwater cryptids.</p><p><em>Content Warning</em>, for example, is a game where you and your friends explore an underwater ruin in hopes of filming supernatural phenomena to farm clout and ad revenue on social media. How you do that, and whether all your friends survive the trip, is up to you. In friendslop games, cooperation is important but not required. And in fact, working against each other can be just as fun as working together.</p><p>GameChat breaks open the door for a ton of similar games to make their way to the Switch 2. <em>Peak</em>, for example, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/peak-has-surpassed-4-5m-sales-within-a-month">sold almost 5 million copies in under a month</a> and is the exact kind of casual, indie co-op game the Switch is suited for. <em>Peak</em> and games like it on the Switch 2 have the potential to be incredibly successful. These games aren’t graphically or mechanically intensive — and even if they were, the Switch 2’s hardware upgrades can handle it. And they’re focused on partying with your friends, a key feature in some of the most popular games out there right now. People want to play with their friends on the platforms their friends play on and with GameChat, the Switch 2 can finally be that platform.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/756236/content-warning-coop-games-nintendo-switch-2-lethal-company]]></content:encoded>

                <p>In 2023, rapper and occasional actor <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-brings-eminem-to-the-game-next-week-as-skins-leak/1100-6519403/" data-ref-id="1100-6519403">Eminem lent his likeness to Fortnite</a> for three different skins based on his different personas. That was just a small blip in Eminem's two-decade-plus career as an entertainer. But the rapper was recently recognized as "the guy from Fortnite."</p><p>The Eminem Bible shared the video on X, and the rapper himself had a great response. Eminem simply cracked up at the joke, and the fan immediately admitted that he was only kidding.</p><p>Eminem returned to Fortnite last year as Epic Games debuted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnites-eminem-minigun-spits-out-bullets-and-lyrics-in-leaked-clip/1100-6527562/" data-ref-id="1100-6527562">the Mythic RG Minigun</a>. This weapon could actually shoot bullets and drop Eminem's music and lyrics in tune to the gun's rate of fire. Eminem was also featured in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-remix-finale-features-snoop-dogg-eminem-ice-spice-and-juice-wrld-tribute/1100-6527943/" data-ref-id="1100-6527943">the star-studded concert event that closed out Fortnite Remix Chapter 2</a> alongside Snoop Dogg, Ice Spice, and a tribute to the late rapper Juice WRLD.</p><p>Although Eminem hasn't made many video game appearances, his music has been used to promote titles before, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-15s-launch-trailer-brings-on-eminem/1100-6445808/" data-ref-id="1100-6445808">the launch trailer for Final Fantasy 15</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wwe-2k19-soundtrack-features-eminem-metallica-post/1100-6461867/" data-ref-id="1100-6461867">the soundtrack for WWE 2K19</a>. In 2022, Kirk Ewing shared a story about a Hollywood producer approaching Rockstar Games about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eminem-could-have-starred-in-a-gta-movie-from-top-gun-director/1100-6509155/" data-ref-id="1100-6509155">a Grand Theft Auto movie starring Eminem</a> and directed by Top Gun helmer Tony Scott. According to Ewing, Rockstar's Sam Houser turned down the pitch.</p><p>As for Fortnite, some of the game's next collaborations include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/its-morphin-time-in-fortnites-incredible-live-action-power-rangers-teaser/1100-6533692/" data-ref-id="1100-6533692">the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-might-be-getting-jason-voorhees-and-ghostface-for-halloween/1100-6533777/" data-ref-id="1100-6533777">potentially Friday the 13's Jason Voorhees and Scream's Ghostface</a>.</p>

                <p>Writer-director Hideo Kojima has revealed the two deceased Hollywood legends that he would have enjoyed working with for one of his games. Speaking to <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/death-stranding-2-hideo-kojima-interview-1235143146/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IndieWire</a>, Kojima singled out Steve McQueen (Bullitt, The Great Escape) and David Lynch (Twin Peaks).</p><p>Kojima said McQueen was his "childhood hero," and he's not giving up on the possibility of him showing up in a future project, even though the actor died 45 years ago. "If it were possible, even with CG, I would love for him to be in one of my games someday," he said.</p><p>Kojima went on to say that he had "always hoped" to cast Lynch in a video game of his. The visionary filmmaker and actor passed away earlier. Kojima was a big fan of his, saying he was "devastated" like so many others when Lynch died in January this year.</p><p>While Kojima didn't get to work with McQueen or Lynch, he has worked with numerous Hollywood directors on his projects over the years. The filmmakers Jordan Vogt-Roberts, Edgar Wright, Guillemo del Toro, and Nicolas Winding Refn all appeared in Death Stranding, for example. Looking ahead, Kojima is teaming up with Oscar-winning Jordan Peele for the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-teases-new-game-od-people-will-love-it-or-hate-it/1100-6533580/" data-ref-id="1100-6533580">OD</a>, though the exact nature of the partnership is unknown.</p><p>Kojima's latest game was Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, which was released in June on PS5. In addition to OD, Kojima is working on an espionage game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/physint/">Physint</a> with Sony--he revealed in the IndieWire interview that the game is still early in development and is in the conceptual phase where he is the only person working on it.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-od-xbox-horror-game-still-in-development/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideo-kojima%E2%80%99s-xbox-horror-game-od-is-still-in-development-amid-multiple-project-cancellations-at-microsoft.1265070/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">Microsoft laying off 9,000+ people</a> across its whole company resulted in a number of projects being cancelled, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-reportedly-loved-playing-zenimax-onlines-new-game-in-march-only-to-cancel-it-in-july/">a new MMO from ZeniMax Online</a>, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">Perfect Dark reboot</a>, Rare's <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">Everwild</a>, and as we just learned earlier today, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reportedly-stopped-contraband-development-avalanche-studios/">Contraband, from Avalanche Studios</a>. One game that isn't cancelled however, according to a Microsoft spokesperson, is Hideo Kojima's horror game he's making in collaboration with Xbox, OD.</p>



<p>That news comes from Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, who in his reporting on Contraband, asked after the status of OD, which is another project from Microsoft that was announced years ago, though we've heard very little of since. He reports that he was told by a Microsoft spokesperson that OD "<em>is still in development</em>."</p>







<p>OD was first announced during <a href="https://wccftech.com/od-hideo-kojima-horror-game-xbox-revealed-jordan-peele/">The Game Awards 2023 showcase</a>, and was such an exciting announcement at the time, that it was the one game out of everything else announced that year that <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojimas-od-topped-tga-2023-press-coverage-says-fancensus/">dominated press coverage of TGA 2023</a>.</p>



<p>Since then, however, we've heard very little about OD. Kojima has mentioned it and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-provides-update-on-death-stranding-2-and-his-many-other-productions/">work he's doing on it in passing</a>, and has also talked about how his goals with OD is to make something that players have not necessarily seen before. He's called it a <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-says-o-d-is-risky-talks-death-stranding-movie-and-physint-crossmedia-plans/">"<em>risky</em>" game</a> that will be<a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-disappointed-industry/"> "<em>divisive</em>,"</a> but at the same time it sounds like he's excited to be making something that he knows will push players, something he knows that not everyone will fall head-over-heels for.</p>



<p>Horror-director Jordan Peele is also meant to be working on OD alongside Kojima and Xbox, though what we know about Peele's involvement so far is equal to what we know about OD itself, which is very little.</p>



<p>Perhaps now that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> has launched and is on store shelves, we'll soon start to hear more about what's happening with OD, and get a more official word/sign on if it's happening at all. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/splinter-cell-enhanced-mod-pc-steam-deck-2000616399</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-incredible-splinter-cell-mod-offers-the-definitive-experience-of-a-stealth-classic.1265064/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>When the original <i>Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell</i> arrived in 2002, it threatened to dethrone <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>’s tight grip on the stealth genre. And for some purists, it likely succeeded, given its groundbreaking technical displays of light and shadow that were more than just pretty to look at. The game also pushed you to move with more caution, with enemies that, in some instances, were far more perceptive than what <i>Metal Gear Solid 2</i> offered at the time. <i>MGS3</i> would arrive shortly after to up its stealth game, perhaps having learned a thing or two from <i>Splinter Cell</i>, but the original <i>SC</i> and its two direct sequels remain incredible challenges for those of us who like to lurk around in the shadows. And if you’ve been craving a return to Sam Fisher’s first outing, then let me tell you about this incredible mod that makes it hard to go back to the original.</p> <p><i>Enhanced SC</i> is a project from modder Joshhhuaaa that you can <a href="https://github.com/Joshhhuaaa/EnhancedSC">grab on GitHub</a> right now for both Windows and Steam Deck. It introduces a suite of improvements, which include a mission statistics tracker that lets you know just how stealthy your current run is, proper widescreen support, fixes to movement speed, better controller support, maps based on original Xbox versions, the Nuclear Power Plant level from the PS2 version, and <a href="https://github.com/Joshhhuaaa/EnhancedSC/blob/main/PatchNotes.md">so much more</a>.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000616402" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616402"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616402">© Ubisoft / Joshhhuaaa / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>While many mods of this kind sometimes make for an experience that feels quite different from the original game, <i>Enhanced SC</i> feels remarkably faithful to what it was like to play <i>Splinter Cell</i> on PS2 or Xbox back in the day. There are some notable tweaks to the gameplay, such as the inclusion of whistling (which would show up in later <i>SC</i> games), and distinct commands for opening a door fully or partially to peek into the next room. These feel like very natural inclusions to the original game–in fact, until I read through the patch notes, I didn’t realize they <em>weren’t</em> in the first <i>SC</i>.</p>

 <p>Steam Deck support, however, is where this mod really shines. It runs surprisingly well for such an old game on a Linux machine. There’s also a dedicated “EnhancedSC Layout” controller scheme you can download from the community layouts that allows for precision aiming by way of the right touchpad, and a quicksave and load feature mapped to the left one (this makes quickly resetting to your last save for save-scummy playthroughs a breeze).</p> <figure id="attachment_2000616403" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616403"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616403">© Ubisoft / Joshhhuaaa / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>If it’s been a while since you’ve jumped into Sam’s sneaking suit, do yourself a favor and check out this mod. Who knows when (or if) we’re getting <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-7-canceled-games-splinter-cell-assasin-s-creed-1849976552">that damn remake anyway</a>.</p>

Instead of an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mafia-the-old-country-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open world</a> as seen in Mafia 3, the latest installment is a linear-narrative driven game. As such, the game has a similar expected run time to the first two games of the series, meaning you can expect around <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-long-to-beat-mafia-the-old-country-game-length-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10-12 hours of content</a>. </p>



<p>Some fans assumed that less content is what led to the game receiving a $50 pricetag, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mafia-the-old-country-devs-say-game-isnt-short-just-because-its-only-50/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hangar 13</a> assured players that they won’t be “disappointed” by the final package. And although Mafia: The Old Country is shorter than other Triple AAA single-player offerings, there is still a long list of trophies and achievements to earn. </p>

<p>Before reading any further, please note that the achievement and trophy list contains spoilers. If you do not want to have any of the story spoiled beforehand, do not read any more. That being said, the normal achievements and trophies mostly just cover weapon mastery and completing a few simple tasks. The secret trophies contain most of the spoilers. </p>

Releasing on September 5 for PS5, Switch, and PC, it's looking like a fresh take on the classic golf video game series, featuring simple controls, a variety of solo and multiplayer gameplay modes, and a long list of character customization options. While preorders are available on all platforms, PC players should consider <strong>preordering at Fanatical, where it's on sale for $33.59 (was $40)</strong>. This is the best price we've seen for the upcoming game, and the discount is only available before launch. Preordering the game unlocks the playable Pac-Man character early. You'll also get an additional 5% off voucher for your next Fanatical purchase.</p><p>As if that weren't enough, Everybody's Golf Hot Shots preorders are also eligible for Fanatical's Summer Bonus Drop deal, which gets you a random bonus prize when you spend $15 or more during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fanatical-summer-sale-2025/1100-6533680/" data-ref-id="1100-6533680">Fanatical's Summer Sale event</a>. The possible prizes include free game keys and bonus coupon codes. Grabbing the game at Fanatical gets you an official key redeemable via Steam.</p><p>Everybody's Golf Hot Shots is the first new game in the popular Hot Shots Golf series (known as Everybody's Gold in Japan) since 2017. It's also notable as the first game in the series to launch on PC and Nintendo platforms--all previous games in the series have been exclusive to PlayStation consoles and handhelds, and many were never localized outside of Japan. While the series features many of the core mechanics of other golf sim games--including swing strength meter, varied courses, and even weather conditions to contend with--Everybody's Golf offers a more arcadey take on the genre, with simple controls, cartoony visual style, and multiple gameplay modes, including challenge modes and high-score leaderboards.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4545933-golfpacmanbonus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545933" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4545933-golfpacmanbonus.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545933"></a><figcaption>Everybody's Golf Hot Shots preorder bonus</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4545933-golfpacmanbonus.jpg"></figure><p>As mentioned above, Everybody's Golf Hot Shots digital preorders are also available on PS5 and Switch.

<p>Hardware this week yields no change in the top ten, with the Switch 2 once again claiming the top spot. Cumulative Switch sales reach 18,637 units this week, while the PS5 has managed a total of 7,141. So yes, despite Nintendo launching a <em>brand new console</em>, mind you, the previous-gen Switch managed to outsell the PS5 by more than 2:1.</p>

However, if you don’t want to wait for what’s next, you can currently save on the <strong>Samsung Galaxy Buds FE</strong>, which are down to $46.99 ($53 off) at <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/offers/new-samsung-galaxy-buds-fe-true-wireless-bluetooth-earbuds-9" rel="sponsored">Woot</a>. That’s their best price yet and a deal that will run until September 2nd or while supplies last.</p><p>Despite being nearly two years old, the Buds FE remain a solid pair of wireless earbuds. They offer good sound and impressive noise cancellation for the price, but it’s the fit that really stands out. Unlike the pricier Galaxy Buds 3 and Buds 3 Pro, the Buds FE feature a wing tip design that provides a more comfortable, secure fit. Meanwhile, a flattened touchpad area makes pausing, playing, and skipping tracks more foolproof.</p><p>The Buds FE miss out on more advanced features, including a conversation mode and proper multipoint Bluetooth support. They also lack wireless charging and carry a meager IPX2 rating for water resistance, which means they could get damaged if dropped into a pool of water. That being said, a transparency mode ensures you stay aware of your surroundings by letting ambient noise in, and battery life is solid enough to last a full day.</p><div><p id="more-deals-to-check-out"><h2>More deals to check out</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>The <strong>second-gen Backbone One with USB-C</strong> is down to $69.99 ($30 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/BACKBONE-Mobile-Gaming-Controller-Lightning-iOS/dp/B0CCT2LWT8?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fbackbone-one-usb-c-mobile-gaming-controller-for-iphone-15-16-series-and-android-2nd-generation-black%2F6558725.p" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, and <a rel="sponsored" href="https://backbone.sjv.io/c/482924/2186621/25186?u=https%3A%2F%2Fbackbone.com%2Fproducts%2Fbackbone-one-usb-c">Backbone’s storefront</a>, matching the largest discount we’ve seen this year.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-boss-says-game-coming-to-xbox-was-all-playstation%E2%80%99s-idea.1265013/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>Sony’s massively popular third-person online sci-fi shooter <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-ps5-exclusive-1851785573"><em>Helldivers 2</em> is coming to Xbox later this month</a>. Many fans had assumed that developers Arrowhead had been the ones behind the decision, likely pushing PlayStation to let them port the game to the company’s rival console. But it turns out it was actually Sony’s idea, and that’s just more evidence that the <a href="https://kotaku.com/console-wars-are-over-ps5-xbox-forza-switch-2-sony-1851752956">console wars are over.</a></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851"><em>Helldivers 2</em> launched in early 2024</a> to <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-sony-steam-pc-ps5-players-1851268838">rave reviews and huge player counts.</a> And since then, the game has continued to receive frequent updates, growing larger in scale as it adds more enemies and its massive galactic story of war continues to evolve. But for the last year, the only way to play <em>Helldivers 2</em> was on PS5 or PC. This left Xbox players out of the loop. That changes on August 26, when Helldivers lands on Xbox Series X/S with full crossplay support. And according to Arrowhead’s CEO Shams Jorjani, the decision to port <em>Helldivers 2</em> came entirely from PlayStation.</p> <p>On August 6, as reported by <em>Windows Central,</em> when a player praised Arrowhead for bringing the <em>Helldivers</em> sequel to Xbox, Jorjani stepped in and gave Sony all the credit. “It was all PlayStation. Send them your thanks,” posted Jorjani in the game’s official Discord server. “We were all in support, of course.” The Arrowhead CEO later added, “I think it’s one of the coolest things [Sony’s] done. They’re killing it.”</p> <p>While it might at first seem odd that PlayStation would bring one of its most popular video games in years to a rival platform, the reality is that the console wars have mostly fizzled out. Thanks to crossplay, cross save, Xbox ditching the whole affair after losing last gen, and Nintendo doing their own thing, there’s just not much of a war anymore. <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-podcast-exclusivity-business-update-ps5-hi-fi-rush-1851261518?_gl=1*q9wu73*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM3MDQ1NzEkbzEyOSRnMSR0MTc1MzcwOTY4NCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">Xbox has found great success bringing its hit games like <em>Forza</em> to PlayStation 5</a>, and Sony is following in their footsteps now by bringing games like <em>Marathon</em> and <em>Helldivers 2</em> to Xbox, as well as continuing to port games like <em>Spider-Man</em> to PC. At this point, it just makes more sense to put your games on more platforms. This is especially true for big, expensive live-service games that rely on lots of players actively engaging with the game daily to make money. So I’d expect to see even more Xbox and PlayStation games hopping across platforms in the future. I mean, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-1-reloaded-remaster-ps5-xbox-pc-summer-1851779167"><em>Gears of War</em></a> is coming to PlayStation this year.&nbsp; <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-xbox-exclusivity-helldivers-spiderman-switch-2-1851787122">The walls have fallen. The console wars are over. And only Nintendo seems to care about keeping stuff exclusive</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-26-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/madden-nfl-26-review-in-progress.1265007/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I play a lot of Madden every year, gang. Like, <em>a lot</em> a lot. I’m in a 32-man league, and then I have my own Franchise mode going, and none of that includes all the work that goes into writing a review for IGN, which is… substantial. But no matter how much I play, I’ll always discover something new after that review is done – be it an obnoxious bug or just a better understanding of a system under the hood. I feel like I understand a lot more about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-review"><u>Madden NFL 25</u></a> now that I am about to put down the controller for the final time, but after spending a little time with Madden NFL 26, well… all that stuff’s out the window. Madden 26 changes a lot of what came before, and while I still have more to play before my final review, I’m liking what I see so far. I’m liking it a lot, in fact.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with one of the biggest changes: the Skills Trainer. Madden’s old Skills Trainer was a good way to learn the basics, but it’s been completely overhauled this year, and I’ve gotta say, I’m impressed. There are substantially more drills and the tutorials explaining them are much, much more detailed, to the point where I’m already learning stuff I didn’t know. For instance, if you’re kicking a field goal or an extra point, you shouldn’t hit the red zone of the kick power part of the meter, as that’s what is called an overkick, which reduces your distance. I thought it just meant “Hey, here’s the edge of the meter.” Nope! I asked one of my friends who also regularly plays if he knew that; he didn’t. But we both do now. Madden has always been uncomfortable with explaining itself, largely opting to leave the detailed stuff to YouTubers. Now, a lot more of that detail is in the game. The Skills Trainer will even mark drills as “Beginner,”  or “New to Madden,” so you can find the stuff you need more easily. It’s a huge improvement and something I’ve personally been asking for for years, so I’m ecstatic with this addition.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from that, I’ve also been playing around in Franchise, which is to say I’ve mostly been playing with Coach Creation and menus. Madden may try to convince you that it is parkour, reader, but this is a lie. It’s menus all the way down. Coach Creation is totally revamped now, with a ton of new heads that (mostly) look better than last year’s options and several that look like they were made out of Play-Doh or the “Weird and Ugly” section of the Dark Souls character creator. But hey, I appreciate the effort.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you’ve made your custom coach, you’ve got the choice of one of three archetypes built around player development, offense, and defense. The skill trees of old? Gone. Now you spend Skill Points to unlock and upgrade abilities that you equip on gameday for bonuses. Some, generally player abilities, last a few weeks; others, like the ones that allow you to hire better scouts, last all season. It’s different and I haven’t had enough time to see where it all goes yet, but I’m intrigued as it seems more interesting than “this position gets +2 Speed, the Most Important Stat in the Game,” which was how a lot of the skill tree looked last time.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The updated Skills Trainer is a huge improvement I've been wanting for years.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">On the field, things are faster, finding a balance between the zippy arcade feel of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/college-football-26-review"><u>College Football</u></a> and the Maddens of yesteryear. The Wear and Tear injury system also makes its Madden debut, though I’m concerned about it in this context; I acknowledge it’s more realistic, but I don’t necessarily like it in College Football, and I particularly don’t like the way the on-field UI has changed to accommodate it. But we’ll see.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Wear and Tear, though, comes some very welcome changes to player development. You can now choose practice intensity for each player, not just for starters and backups at each position, which is a godsend. I’m decent at Madden on the field, but what makes me good in a Franchise league is that I’m great at drafting and player development. For someone like me, this extra control is a huge deal. There’s also some nice QoL changes here, like being able to see player fatigue as a number and not just a meter on the health section of their player card. Like, yes! Finally! I don’t know if this is stuff most players will notice, but if you’re a sicko like me, it really does make a big difference.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Madden NFL Game Review Ever</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not all sunshine and roses in Menuland, though. Player cards now take more than five seconds to load, which is both substantially worse than in Madden 25 and absolutely infuriating when you really want to dig into your team’s stats. We’re pre-release, and to its credit, EA did fix menu and loading issues in previous Maddens – but man, five seconds to do something as simple as open a player card, which was snappy in Madden 25, when there are 53 players on a team? Please shoot me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of changes EA has made to anger me personally, Madden has once again reworked the name of its QB throwing motions, and introduced several new ones. This is, by my count, the second time that this has happened in the last two years, and it’s maddening (get it?) each time. Throwing motion is hugely important to how QBs play, and now I have to figure out what my favorite throwing motions are, and what draft notes correspond to those motions, all over again. I’m glad that the new names make a little more sense, but I am begging EA to leave these alone for a hot second. Please.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, though, I’m pretty impressed by the changes to this year’s game so far. I have a lot to do before I can render a verdict – I need to play Superstar, dig deeper into Franchise, get more of a feel for the on-field action, and (sigh) spend some time with Ultimate Team. But I’m <em>really</em> liking what I’ve seen of Madden 26 so far. Now I just need to put more time into it and see if that feeling holds up.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Will's Favorite Football Games</h3></p></div></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-26-review]]></content:encoded>

<p>As for the specific issues that Battlefield Studios is aware of, the developer said it knows players may be unable to ping enemies when using stationary weapons. Additionally, the animations for when characters attach to a zipline are bugged. Beyond that, the aim assist feature when players are close to smoke is a work in progress, the studio said. Another known issue is that players can sink into the ground after reviving a teammate.</p><p>Battlefield Studios added that it's aware of weapon-balancing issues specific to recoil. The studio said it knew about these issues for some time but wasn't able to address them for the open beta.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-apex-legends-switch-2-a-giant-leap-over-the-tragic-switch-1-version.1264971/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I love <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>. I feel like I have to remind myself of that sometimes, as I'm so bored off my face with shooters in general, and don't really play online competitively anymore. I just can't be bothered with the stress and/or real emotion of it all.</p>
<p>However, Apex Legends, once I get over myself and turn it on, does stuff that pleases my monkey brain quite a lot. Back in 2019 when it released, which feels like centuries ago now, I couldn't believe how clever, simple, and obvious this hero shooter's ping system was. How hadn't anyone done this before? It's a game that's built with no-fuss, unobtrusive teamwork at its core. And it makes it a blast for anyone to have fun with.</p><!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/accessibility-report/2700/embed @ 1754597391 -->
<p>The roster of hero characters, which is now enormous compared to when I last played it, is hugely varied, and they all have amplified and incredibly moreish methods of traversal. It's all very zippy, cloaky, boost-jumpy, and very, very fast. The movement and controls and shooting and zooming around collecting stuff endlessly is just as pleasing as the pings. I know you know all of this already, I'm just saying.</p>
<p>Back on Switch 1, Apex Legends managed to arrive feature-complete. However, it was laid low by terrible performance issues. Indeed, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/apex_legends">I gave it a 5/10</a>, saying it was still fun to play, but had notable frame rate issues, muddy textures, unresponsive and laggy controls...yeah, it was basically a really tragic Switch port.</p>
<p>We don't have to worry about any of this now, though. We can concentrate on having a good time with what's surely still one of the very best (if not <em>the</em> best) hero shooter, Battle Royale...eh, thingies out there. It really is that good. I've used my unlock tokens to grab all but three of the full roster, and I've fallen down the rabbit hole once more.</p>
<p>Because, much like how its ping system originally dazzled me, this Switch 2 port has dazzled me all over again by being perhaps the very first fully-fledged and functionally perfect online shooter that I've ever sat and played on my sofa on a portable console. Yes, there are other great online shooter games on Switch, like the majestic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon</a> series, but this scratches a very different shooter itch. And it's free!</p>
<p>In docked and handheld, performance feels great on Switch 2, and bar the odd hiccup as you load into a stage, this is silky smooth stuff, even during busy firefights. It looks perfectly crisp and clear at <em>all times</em>. Add in motion controls for fine-tuning your snipes, a bonus mouse-mode that's fun (I'm still using the normal controls, mind), and you've got a version of Apex Legends that, despite all of its hard-selling of Apex Points and outfits, is very, very hard to pick a hole in.</p>
<p>In fact, Apex Legends redeems itself on Switch 2. This upgraded version gives us 60fps shooting action with crisp, clear resolutions and none of that juddery, unresponsive, blurry stuff we had back in 2021. It's still the best hero shooter/Battle Royale out there for me, with amazingly fluid traversal, best-in-class gunfeel, and a ping system that puts proper teamwork and tactics front and centre. The cherry on top, of course, is that it's free to play, too, so there's no good reason for shooter fans not to dive right in.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/apex-legends]]></content:encoded>

<p>Turn 10 and Playground Games will “continue to support Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon 5.”</p>



<p>In a post on social media on Thursday, the developers said that they “appreciate the support of [their] incredible community”. They also wanted to make it clear that support for Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon 5 wasn’t ending. </p>



<p>“We wanted to assure players that Turn 10 and Playground Games will continue to support Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon 5,” <a href="https://x.com/ForzaMotorsport/status/1953508994581938364" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">they said</a>. </p>



<p>The team <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-motorsport-update-21-featured-tours#logitech" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">then linked</a> to a post going over what’s coming in the future to Forza Motorsport. Those updates include near featured tours, new cars earned through challenges, and new featured rivals. The new update is scheduled to come on September 4.</p>



<h6 id="h-more-xbox-contraband-development-stopped-at-xbox">More Xbox: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/contraband-development-stopped-at-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Contraband Development Stopped At Xbox</a></h6>



<p>While current support continuing is good news for players, what wasn’t mentioned in the statement, however, was anything regarding the future of the Forza Motorsport series. </p>



<p>After Microsoft’s latest layoffs at Xbox in July, one studio reportedly hit hard was Turn 10 games. According to reports, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/turn-10-studios-loses-nearly-half-of-its-staff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">up to 50% of the team</a> was let go and it was turned into a support studio for the Forza Horizon series with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-motorsport-canceled" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the mainline series being canceled</a>. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has made numerous efforts to get clarification on the state of the Forza Motorsport franchise but neither Microsoft or Turn 10 have responded to requests for comment.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 6 is currently in development. Playground Games, the developers of the Forza Horizon series, are also working on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fable-delayed-into-2026-by-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reboot of Fable</a>.</p>



<p>What do you think the future holds for Forza Motorsport? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>
