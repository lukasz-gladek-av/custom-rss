            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-voice-line-debunks-long-running-fan-theory-in-the-funniest-way-possible<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Overwatch 2’s 41st hero, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-reveals-newest-support-hero-and-shell-be-playable-this-weekend">Juno</a>, is playable this weekend for a limited time, and fans have already unearthed a surprising bit of lore about the purple-haired space cadet healer and Mei.</p><p>Overwatch is filled with voice lines that flesh out lore from its myriad of maps as well as relationships between heroes and villains. It’s just not every character’s death throw voice line would reveal a possible familial tie. Apparently, eliminating Mei as Juno triggers a voice-over exchange in which the Martian hero says, “Sorry, Auntie!” in response to Mei’s dying gasp. </p><p>This tidbit of gameplay lore is significant not only in that it might confirm the hero shooter’s fourth familial tie among its heroes, but it also seems to debunk a key fan theory about Juno’s identity.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="es" dir="ltr">AUNTIE?! <a href="https://t.co/LYlwwoVNCu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/LYlwwoVNCu</a></p>— Hazelet (@HazeletOW) <a href="https://twitter.com/HazeletOW/status/1814361289537495229?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 19, 2024</a></blockquote> <h2>Juno and Jiayi</h2><p>Late last year, a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/17nfh6j/space_ranger_is_99_jiayi_meis_friend_that_works/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>r/Overwatch</u></a> thread theorized that Juno—then known as Space Ranger—was a woman named Jiayi. According to the thread’s original poster, Mei had a new voice line that would trigger while at Lijiang Control Center, where she would reminisce over a friend named Jiaya, who she went to grad school with. </p><p>Seeing as how this voice line cropped up a month prior to Juno’s reveal at Blizzcon 2023, fans quickly began theorizing that Jiayi was the government name for Juno. At the time, the theory seemed solid, considering Lijiang is the location of Overwatch 2’s in-universe Chinese space station, and Juno’s whole gimmick is that she’s an astronaut hailing from Mars. </p><p>This theory took on new life a day before Juno’s limited-time release when X/Twitter user Pampurins posited that <a href="https://x.com/pampurins/status/1813975199458775106?t=yhhk2G2um7mPg7mZqKKKYQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Jiayi could actually be the name of Juno’s mother</u></a>. Pampurin’s revised theory sounds like it's right on the money thanks to the newly discovered voice line interaction.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Shroomiiee (@mushroomiiee) <a href="https://twitter.com/mushroomiiee/status/1814366135648920000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 19, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>While the voice line appears to be considered hard proof that the two are aunt and niece, there’s also a high probability that it is also just a term of endearment, seeing as how the word aunt is commonly used to address older women. IGN has reached out to Blizzard for comment. Regardless, players will likely get an earful of the special voice line interaction during Juno’s weekend of play before her full release comes Season 12 on August 20.</p><p>Isaiah Colbert is a freelance writer for IGN.

            <p>
Pleasingly bizarre four-wheeled survival game Pacific Drive has officially sold 600K copies, and its developer Ironwood Studios has announced it's celebrating that milestone with a series of content updates throughout the rest of this year. And the first of those updates is now live, offering a bunch of free additions, as well as a bit of daft cosmetic DLC.
</p>
<p>
Pacific Drive's first free update lets players document their travels across the anomaly riddled forests of the Olympic Exclusion Zone using a new photo mode. It's available right from the pause menu and gives player access to various camera settings - including depth of field, focus control, and exposure - as well as numerous aesethetic filters. It's also possible to change weather conditions and time of day while you're in there.
</p>
<p>
Photo mode arrives alongside the new Juke Jet car ability which, once mounted on your station wagon's side rack, provides a horizontal boost that should be handy for dodging and drifting. There're also two new upgrade nodes to be found in the garage's Fabrication Station, unlocking the Smart Matter Deconstructor and Vargas Auto-Pac-Vac. The first lets players toss junk into the Matter Constructor from anywhere in the garage, while the latter deposits materials into the transfer trunk before being filling the rest of the vacuum storage.

<p>
Elsewhere, there's a new performance mode specifically for the PS5 version of Pacific Drive, new points and interest and worldbuilding details in Junctions, a new Coastal Highway map, a new Believer Sticker and Golden Hood Ornament, and more - as outlined in Ironwood's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1458140/view/4370264092250152801">patch notes</a>.
</p>
<p>
The free update (officially version 1.6.2) arrives alongside a new bit of paid DLC known as the Friendly Dumpster Customisation Pack. This features a selection of trash-themed cosmetic items for decorating your station wagon, including the Re-Cycled Steering Wheel, Dumpster Devotee decal kit, Gift Shifter, Air Trashener, Dumpster Idol, and Cuddle Can.
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
As detailed in Pacific Drive's new 2024 post-launch roadmap, this selection of summer DLC will be followed by two more releases before the end of the year. This autumn, players can expect a free update featuring new difficulty modes, game customisation settings, and cosmetics, alongside another paid cosmetics pack. That'll be followed by a winter update, but details around that remain under wraps. More will be revealed "in the coming months".
</p>
<p>
And if you've not yet taken Pacific Drive and its sentient station wagon for a ride through its gorgeous weird rendition of the Pacific Northwest, it's well worth investigating. Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell called it an "exhausting, oddly lovable nightmare" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pacific-drive-review">four star review</a>, and there's currently 40 percent off, meaning you can pick it up for £14.99 on PS5 and PC.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-has-no-plans-to-delay-star-wars-outlaws/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After posting an exclusive 10-minute gameplay video of Star Wars Outlaws <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-M1Lu6iVhg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to IGN's YouTube</a>, Ubisoft has come under a tirade of negative feedback and commentary on what they have seen in the game. The video received more dislikes than likes, which is troubling. In just 24 hours of the video being uploaded to YouTube, the video received 13,000 dislikes to a ratio of 8,000 likes.</p>
<p>However, Ubisoft seems highly confident that people will love Star Wars Outlaws and has no plans to delay the game in any capacity. Despite the negativity being spread online, Star Wars Outlaws is still set for the August 30 release.</p>
<p>The negative commentary was so severe that a financial analyst from Bank of America commented on the situation and asked Ubisoft during yesterday's earnings call whether they were considering delaying the game. While the answer of a firm "no" is in place, they have assured the audience that there is more gameplay footage to come, and it will showcase the game and the wonders players have to look forward to.</p>
<p>From experience, Ubisoft has delayed games to improve them after receiving negative feedback from the audience. However, Star Wars Outlaws has already gone gold, so there is no chance of the game being delayed for further polishing or adjustments.</p>
<p>The feedback for the game seems to be mixed. While there's a general discomfort about Star Wars's fate as a franchise and how it is seeping into every part of the entertainment industry with multiple spin-offs and stories, there are also those who are incredibly excited about a new way to jump into the Star Wars universe.</p>
<p>However, judging by the feedback on YouTube, some feel that Ubisoft has recycled<a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-wont-feature-ubisofts-open-world-house-style-swears-massive/"> the typical open world experience</a> and slapped the Star Wars label onto it. Others felt that the visual effects present in the gameplay video just weren't up to scratch. For a game so close to release, the gameplay video suggests an air of unpolished environments, and the AI for the enemies is shaping up to be quite janky.</p>
<p>Granted, YouTube commentary often veers on the negative, especially against certain companies and franchises. Star Wars is one of those, particularly after the highly controversial The Acolyte Disney Plus series, which has an astoundingly low 3.8/10 score from user reviews on IMDB.</p>
<p>The final reception to the actual game has yet to be seen. While we wait for the verdict, you can find everything we know about Star Wars Outlaws <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/star-wars-outlaws-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-open-world-game-in-the-far-far-away-galaxy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in this article</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-kickstarter-head-of-games-is-former-exploding-kittens-senior-sales-manager<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new Kickstarter head of games has been named. In an attempt to remain competitive with other crowdfunding platforms, Kickstarter's newest Head of Games is one with considerable experience in tabletop marketing, specifically the anarchic card game <em>Exploding Kittens</em>.</p>

<p>According to a report by <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2024/07/19/kickstarters-new-head-of-games-is-ex-exploding-kittens-greater-than-games-sales-specialist-maggie-clayton/">Board Game Wire</a>, the new Kickstarter head of games is Maggie Clayton, replacing Jon Ritter-Roderick. Clayton spent three years as the senior sales manager and North American sales manager for Exploding Kittens Inc.. The company behind a card game so popular it spawned an <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/exploding-kittens-good-vs-evil-card-game-announced" rel="noopener" target="_blank">animated Netflix series</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/exploding-kittens-goggles-might-explode-on-you-product-recall-issued" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recalled goggles</a>, and "<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/exploding-kittens-to-produce-limited-run-printable-nfts" rel="noopener" target="_blank">printable NFTs</a>".</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kickstarter-head-of-games-maggie-clayton-linkedin-photo.jpg?itok=tjbb5DLd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kickstarter-head-of-games-maggie-clayton-linkedin-photo.jpg?itok=8huvmruM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Furthermore, Clayton spent four years in sales and marketing for tabletop publisher Greater Than Games. This is the studio behind the superhero deckbuilder <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sentinels-multiverse-learn-play-edition-launches-today" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Sentinels of the Multiverse</em></a><em> </em>and the award-winning cooperative strategy game <em>Spirit Island</em>.</p>
<p>Kickstarter's director of outreach, Nick Yulman, had this to say about Clayton's appointment.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Maggie’s deep industry experience and respected standing make her an ideal leader for our games team. Her background in marketing and sales at Exploding Kittens, and her collaborations with indie creators at Greater Than Games, give her a comprehensive understanding of what it takes to bring games to life.</p>
<p>It’s striking how beloved she is in the industry – experienced creators and former colleagues have all sung her praises. I’m excited for her to bring a fresh vision to Games at Kickstarter, build on our success, and ensure that we remain the premier platform for launching games.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The appointment of Clayton as the new Kickstarter head of games may be due to rising pressure from competing crowdfunding platforms. According to a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24054381/kickstarter-top-10-biggest-most-backed-board-games-campaigns-2023">Polygon report</a>, tabletop projects on Kickstarter have been in decline since 2022. The platform also garnered controversy regarding its policies on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/23873453/kickstarters-ai-disclosure-terraforming-mars-release-date-price">generative AI</a> and removing alleged NFT-grift <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wonders-of-first-ccg-to-be-removed-from-kickstarter" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Wonders of the First</em></a> from the platform.</p>
<p>For contrast, two other tabletop crowdfunding platforms have come into their own with major success stories. Gamefound has hosted multiple successful campaigns such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/stalker-board-game-coming-to-gamefound" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Stalker The Board Game</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/song-of-ice-fire-tactics-fully-funded-in-under-7-hours" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>A Song of Ice &amp; Fire: Tactics</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/elder-scrolls-betrayal-of-second-era-is-gamefound-hit" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Elder Scrolls: Betrayal of the Second Era</em></a>.</p>
<p>The second platform is Backerkit. While having a lower market share than Kickstarter, the platform has hosted several high-profile projects from industry staples. These include Steve Jackson Games' <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/munchkin-big-box-brings-definitive-game-to-backerkit" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Munchkin Big Box</em></a> and a reprint campaign for Monte Cook Games' cosmic fantasy TTRPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/invisible-sun-return-of-black-cube-live-now-on-backerkit" rel="noopener" target="_blank">I</a><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/invisible-sun-return-of-black-cube-live-now-on-backerkit" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>nvisible Sun: Return of the Black Cube</em></a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/19/24202067/sim-lab-formula-one-racing-gaming-mercedes-amg-petronas<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sim-Lab has just released a new <a href="https://sim-lab.eu/en-us/products/mercedes-amg-petronas-formula-one-team-sim-racing-steering-wheel-2024">$2,499 steering wheel</a> it claims is&nbsp;an “authentic as possible” replica of the wheels Lewis Hamilton uses while driving the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team’s race cars. It’s a lovely piece of hardware to just stare at but a reminder that getting really into simulators can be dangerous for your budget.</p><p>If that price tag has your jaw on the floor, don’t bother picking it up. You can’t just plug the steering wheel into your PC and hit the simulated streets of Montreal. It needs to be attached to a wheelbase, which translates the steering wheel’s turning motions and button inputs to a racing game while also providing force feedback. Those can also set you back several thousand dollars, and one isn’t included with this wheel.</p><p>What makes Sim-Lab’s new wheel so pricey? For starters, it’s officially licensed from the Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula One Team, who shared the computer-aided design (CAD) data it uses to build the steering wheels for its multimillion-dollar cars. Sim-Lab’s wheel is as close as you can get to racing with one without replacing Lewis Hamilton as the team’s driver when he moves to team Ferrari next year.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</p><div><figcaption><em>There are nine rotary dials dotting the front of the steering wheel.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Sim-Lab</cite></p></div></div><p>The steering wheel’s body is also a handmade carbon fiber shell. That not only helps it weigh 1,240 grams, but it also ensures it’s extremely rigid, so vibrations and resistance provided by a wheelbase are precisely translated to a gamer’s hands. It’s not going to creak and flex as you steer into a simulated corner at over 150mph.</p><p>Scattered across the wheel are nine rotary dials, 12 buttons, two switches, carbon fiber shifting paddles, anti-static silicone rubber grips, and 25 controllable RGB LEDs providing telemetry data at a glance. If that’s not enough data, the center of the wheel also features a 4.3-inch LCD screen with data layouts that match what Mercedes F1 drivers see.</p><p>To most of us, it might seem like an obscene splurge, but for racing sim fans striving to recreate an authentic F1 experience, the only thing seemingly missing is race engineer Bono <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thef1club/video/6978480535169420549?lang=en">telling them</a> “Okay, Lewis, it’s hammer time.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Think <em>Gears</em>&nbsp;<em>of War</em>’s horde mode with swords instead of guns and the sensibility of the PS2 classic <em>Okami</em>. One moment you’re assigning roles to your allies and ordering them around the battlefield, the next your furiously spamming combos to try to fend off tanky foes who are about to murder everyone.</p><p><strong>Buy <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess:</em></strong><em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmHENCUNlVA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmHENCUNlVA" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fkunitsugami-path-of-the-goddess%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fkunitsugami-path-of-the-goddess%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humble Bundle</a></span></p><p>Based in Japanese folklore, <em>Path of the Goddess</em> mixes history and myth to craft a beautiful and compelling journey that feels like playing through a series of poems. You control Soh, a masked warrior guarding the Maiden Yoshiro on her way to get rid of evil spirits called Festering Seethe that have taken over a mountain and corrupted its inhabitants. There’s almost no dialogue and hardly any story. Cutscenes are brief and few and far-between. Instead, <em>Path of the Goddess</em> quickly shuttles you from one level to the next, its main campaign neatly organized between escort missions, boss battles, and time spent rebuilding the places you’ve liberated from the Seethe. It feels refreshingly old-school in that regard.</p><p>Each stage begins at dawn. You run around building defenses and traps, purging the defilement from animals, plants, and villagers, and collecting translucent pink orbs left behind that serve as a key resource. These orbs are spent to carve a path forward for Yoshiro so she can slowly conduct her cleansing ritual across the map. They’re also required to upgrade villagers to various roles from melee wood cutters and long-range archers to shaman healers and tanky sumo wrestlers. Spend all the orbs on Yoshiro and you’ll be defenseless. Waste all of them on your allies and she’ll be dead in the water. </p><figure id="" data-id="e0ed667c6757125ce6edf879547cc309" data-recommend-id="image://e0ed667c6757125ce6edf879547cc309" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Maiden sits at a table where Soh can buy upgrades.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After a few minutes, night falls and the Seethe begin arriving through gates and attacking in waves. While villagers can take down small enemies no problem, bigger ones require swift attention. This is where <em>Path of the Goddess</em>’ action gameplay comes in. Soh has basic single-button-press combos that do decent damage, but adding a heavy attack to the end of each of them strings together a series of dancing sword attacks that you can steer but not cancel. It’s like winding up a toy ballerina and then watching it slash through hordes of enemies. It’s a small but novel innovation that makes combat feel fluid and rewarding even at its most simple and repetitive.<br></p><p><em>Path of the Goddess</em> doesn’t stop there, though. Soh has a dodge and guard attack complete with timed-parry mechanics that add an extra level of depth. Repeated attacks will momentarily stagger an enemy but Soh’s guard can be broken, too, if it’s used too many times in a row, leaving him frozen and vulnerable for a few seconds. Soh also has a special meter that slowly fills up, letting him unleash various ultimate attacks that can turn the tide of a fight in key moments.</p><p>It’s a tight combat loop that slowly gets more interesting over the course of the game as you unlock new abilities and find items that grant you special perks. A small skill wheel lets you invest in a couple dozen upgrades like a higher-risk, higher-reward combat stance as well as charging attacks that break more of an enemy’s stagger meter. The result is moment-to-moment combat that makes you feel strong and agile but not overpowered, built on enough customizable elements that you feel like you have some meaningful options for how to strategize around each new encounter. </p><figure id="" data-id="968f3965fd422e543c3fcb6ccf321c5f" data-recommend-id="image://968f3965fd422e543c3fcb6ccf321c5f" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Soh dances around enemies in a death trap.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The other big part of that strategy is your villagers. Every time you defeat a boss you earn a new mask that represents a different role you can assign to the villagers helping you on your journey. You start from scratch each mission, enrolling whoever you happen to find along the road in your demon-hunting crusade. Basic roles require fewer orbs but aren’t as strong. Ones like the sumo who aggro enemies or the cannoneer which has a slow rate of fire but does a lot of damage cost more.<br></p><p>All of them have different strengths, weaknesses, and use cases, and one of the many things <em>Path of the Goddess</em> gets right is not making any of them feel obsolete or redundant. My favorite by far, though, is the sorcerer. It charges up a spell that gives you a map-wide super you can use instantly if they’re still alive. It feels like getting a nuke killstreak in<em> Call of Duty</em> and it saved my ass so many times.</p><p>Boss fights, for the most part, prioritize enemy designs and animations over unique mechanics. Most of them look incredible, even if gameplay-wise they weren’t the overall highlight of the game for me. Few things feel better in <em>Path of the Goddess</em> than knocking a giant Seethe on its back and then calling in your troops to unleash hell. I’m still thinking about the giant poison toad my cannoneers all blasted at once with giant fireworks, killing it even while I was still incapacitated. </p><figure id="" data-id="219fec6e7d1ecaa3cccbe41724dd4840" data-recommend-id="image://219fec6e7d1ecaa3cccbe41724dd4840" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A ritual is performed to purge the Seethe.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s only one thing dragging <em>Path of the Goddess</em> down and it’s the settlement rebuilding section. After liberating a village you can go back and explore it free of enemies, which mostly means walking around to various sections and assigning workers to fix a house, bridge, gate, or shrine that is on a timer to complete after a set number of battles. There’s no real need to prioritize one set of repairs over another and the most helpful rewards are for finishing every repair in a particular map location, meaning you’re going to have to get it all done at some point anyway. Thus every cool battle is followed by an unwieldy and perfunctory upkeep phase that would have been easier just to manage from the main map menu.<br></p><p>It’s an undercooked system as far as strategy games go, one that stands out in part because of how well-balanced and thoughtfully crafted so much of the rest of the game is. One thing I especially love about <em>Path of the Goddess</em> is the UI, which feels folded into the very fabric of the experience. Soh’s health is shown via a scroll next to his body, the upgrade menu for his abilities is a sword hilt where you swap out the tassel and runes, and the save screen is a long sheet of folded paper that gets stamped.</p><p>They are the small bits of polish that make an already great game even better, and they remind me of the PS2 era when more games felt like they were trying to explore their own path rather than follow in the footsteps of what everyone else had already done. It’s that spirit of authenticity and unwavering commitment to a distinctive vision that makes<em> Path of the Goddess</em> so refreshing right now, especially at this level of budget, production, and quality. When so many games feel like they could have been made by anybody for nobody, <em>Path of the Goddess</em> feels like something unique made for people who never knew how much they’d love it. Creative swings like that don’t always work out. <em>Path of the Goddess</em> is one that definitely does. </p><p><strong>Buy <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmHENCUNlVA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmHENCUNlVA" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fkunitsugami-path-of-the-goddess%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fkunitsugami-path-of-the-goddess%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humble Bundle</a></span></p><p>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city-board-game-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Listen up chooms, Cyberpunk is back in analog form for a second run. I previously wrote about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-red-combat-zone-tabletop-game-review"><u>Cyberpunk Red: Combat Zone</u></a>, an excellent miniatures game where gangs of plastic figures meet in the streets to spill imaginary blood. The new hardware I’m shouting about is Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City. Yes, more gangs and more blood, but this time it’s a proper board game where factions vie for turf and street cred. It’s less about violence, although there is still some of that, and more about strategically spreading your forces to occupy territory, complete jobs, and establish dominance. </p><p>This new game comes from board game giant CMON Games, publisher of hit titles such as Zombicide (on our list of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-teens">best board games for teens</a>), Blood Rage, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dune-war-for-arrakis-board-game-review"><u>Dune: War for Arrakis</u></a>. While Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City appears shiny and new, its foundation is an iteration on the underrated 2017 title <a href="https://zdcs.link/4AZeG?object_uuid=eba58f92-25a7-4e66-91b6-4bd6e21d5663&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Godfather: Corleone’s Empire</a>. While the biological tissue shares some DNA, the many additions and tweaks layered atop function as jacked-up cybernetics that give this bad-boy a whole new visage.</p><div catalogid="ff5e2f90-fc39-4ab5-980d-d8e161cccfb6" id="198404"><div id="198404" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City Board Game</h3></p></div><p>Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City is a very fast and sleek affair. On each player’s turn they perform up to two actions by moving a token on their playerboard from its state of ready to spent. These map directly to specific actions, so if you want to build another hideout on the map or upgrade your combat deck with new weapon tech, you need to spend the appropriate token. In addition to futzing around with infrastructure, you will mostly be activating your units and moving them about to secure territory. The three unit types all perform different functions and support alternate strategic paths. Solos push people out of important spaces and start fights. Techies purchase Edgerunner mercenaries to supplement your forces, as well as complete Opportunities–elicit jobs–for points. Lastly, Netrunners jack into the network which is a straightforward mini-game where moving down a track comes with risk and escalating rewards. </p><p>The juice in the action system is in when you decide to recall and reset your action discs. This effectively passes your turn, but it’s the primary way you exploit territory and recruit new figures. This step is necessary, however, as if you’ve already performed a particular action that you want to perform again–such as activating Solos or upgrading your combat deck–you will not be able to again until you reclaim your action tokens. The tempo control here is important, as players dictate the pace and aggression of play depending on how often they reset. It’s a fascinating strategic decision that pulls in several directions and offers various tactical considerations.</p><p>While anyone with even a minor amount of experience with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy board games</a> will readily understand this game’s processes, there is a somewhat tricky learning curve. This is due to the difficulty in parsing the unit types and their associated behavior. Each figure type is denoted by the shape of its base. This isn’t difficult, but it can be confusing to pair the unit types with the action discs and the connected Points of Interest on the map. These POIs are special sub-spaces within each district on the board. Gangs will control these positions with a figure, and they function as either a requirement to purchase an Edgerunner and complete an Opportunity, or they provide bonus resources when you netrun. This confounds new players as they struggle to keep these details straight. After a play or two these quirks will be internalized, but this idiosyncratic triangulation of symbology feels a little inelegant in an otherwise smooth design.</p><p>Everything else feels well polished. Most systems are simple yet unrestrained. Upgrading your combat cards for instance has you plucking two from the deck and choosing one to keep. When you add to your deck you remove an existing card, permanently keeping your hand of combat cards at four. This results in upgrades feeling potent as they cycle relatively quickly and see continual use.</p><p>Combat likewise is fast and brutal. Each player in the area selects one card secretly and then everyone reveals simultaneously. The player with the highest strength card wins the combat, with every other player forced to lose a figure from the area. More importantly, cards trigger scoring benefits, even for the losers. This combination of simple efficiency management with a brutal and uncaring edge is the design philosophy at large. The game, much like Night City itself, is unflinching and uncaring. A bad roll netrunning and your hackers short out and end up cold on the slab. A miscalculation in combat and you lose a key space. Combat itself is almost entirely dependent on your technology and not on the meatbags present in the space. It’s a hard world and you can’t afford to be soft.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The game, much like Night City itself, is unflinching and uncaring.</p></div><p>Almost everything present is concise and not overwrought. While this is an advantage to keeping the pace of play lively even at a max player count, it’s a detriment when it comes to the fiction. It does feel as though you are commanding gangers and sowing some chaos, but the narrative threads are relatively thin. Those expecting an adventure comparable to the Cyberpunk 2077 video game will be disappointed. </p><p>The setting here mostly functions as graphic design and a background presence. Opportunities suffer the most, as these jobs of stealing contraband and performing sanctioned hits are described with vibrant titles and brief story snippets, but the fiction is irrelevant and everyone quickly learns to bypass those surface elements and just worry about the mechanical implications. It never feels as though you’re pulling off heists or wild contracts, rather, you’re just grabbing another card in a simple game of set collection.</p><p>To the design team’s credit, they sought to address this failing. One of the most interesting aspects of Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City is the story system. These are narrative scenarios that lay atop the existing game, providing new rules and entire sub-systems to engage. Often, they provide additional ways to earn victory points or unique rewards. They also feature branching story elements, allowing the scenario to veer off in one of two directions.</p><p>The story system injects a much needed element of fiction into the game and frames the action around a prescribed narrative. Like the other mechanisms, they’re not intensely detailed, so you’re not reading lengthy paragraphs. Instead, cards offer a couple sentences of context. The achievement here is in how they connect surprise and drama into the mechanical framework of the game. This system is fantastic, marred perhaps slightly by the fact that they often present situations that randomly favor certain gangs. Each gang possesses an asymmetric ability which typically pushes them towards one or two strategic pathways in the game, and sometimes these story events can inhibit or outright neuter one of those pursuits. It can be frustrating, but the unpredictability of the narrative and how it influences the game is well worth the cost.</p><p>There is also a nagging concern that some may hop into this game and then become dissuaded when they realize there is a truckload of additional content, with the majority being exclusive to the previous <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/cmon/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">crowdfunding campaign</a> and unavailable at retail. The base game is substantial and a compelling strategy game that feels complete, but there’s no shaking the agony that afflicts some consumers when they realize they can’t get all of the extra expansions that were previously available.</p><p>Cyberpunk 2077: Gangs of Night City isn’t quite the augmented behemoth that several of CMON’s best titles are, but it is a very interesting game with several qualities that are stimulating. Its greatest assets will be teased out by those familiar with the intellectual property, but the sturdy mechanical foundation certainly doesn’t hurt. There is a solid chance this ends up as one of the publisher’s most underrated titles, not garnering the respect it deserves, and that would be a shame. </p><h3>Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/dMEYp?object_uuid=eba58f92-25a7-4e66-91b6-4bd6e21d5663&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Bdxb8?object_uuid=eba58f92-25a7-4e66-91b6-4bd6e21d5663&amp;t=article" target="_blank">Get it at Asmodee</a></li></ul></div></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jul 19, 2024 7:45 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>This is a solid game of gang-on-gang warfare that is as concerned with efficiently managing actions and resources as it is in dishing out bloodshed.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Rockstar's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-warriors/" data-ref-id="5000-20017">The Warriors</a> is one of the oddest games that the GTA developer ever released, though it's quite enjoyable in its own right. According to a recent report from retro gaming site <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/07/rockstar-came-extremely-close-to-releasing-the-warriors-on-gba" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Time Extension</a>, Rockstar came extremely close to releasing a GBA port of the game around 2005, but it was ultimately canned.</p><p dir="ltr">The Time Extension piece attributes the information to an anonymous former Rockstar Games employee. That employee says that the game was essentially finished when it was canceled in 2005, and that it used tech from Rockstar Leeds' GBA port of Max Payne, including the game engine. The piece also states that there's at least one copy of the game out there, but it hasn't yet seen a release due to potential legal concerns.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aLEc6aSe8k" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-aLEc6aSe8k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">According to the source, the GBA Warriors had four-player co-op through the console's link cable, and it was "fun to play." However, it never saw the light of day because the PSP was gaining momentum, and Rockstar was decidedly on the Sony side of the platform war. The employee also cites Nintendo's apparent dislike for promoting M-rated games as a factor in the decision. Rockstar developed a number of original GTA games for the PSP, including Liberty City Stories, but also developed Chinatown Wars for the DS.</p><p dir="ltr">Later in the piece, the source says that Rockstar Leeds was set to work on a Nintendo DS port of Rockstar's classic PS2 game Bully before it was canceled due to similar reasons. However, Time Extension notes that it was not able to fully confirm this latter claim. A few years ago, we learned about Rockstar's shelved plans for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rockstars-shelved-bully-2-plans-reportedly-revealed/1100-6499266/" data-ref-id="1100-6499266">Bully 2</a>, which would've featured a map three times larger than the original game.</p>

			<p>Not only is there the pre-expansion update coming soon to World of Warcraft, but the actual expansion itself isn't far away at all. For those looking forward to the new expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-wows-most-ambitious-story-arc-to-date-launches-august-26-pre-orders-live-now/">The War Within</a> will arrive at World of Warcraft on 26 August. If you want to get stuck, this guide will tell you what to do before The War Within update comes out.</p>
<h2>Preparing for The War Within Pre-patch</h2>
<p>If you like to farm for mounts or achievements, some will be much harder to get once Dragonflight has passed and The War Within has arrived.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Complete World of Warcraft: Dragonflight's campaign.&nbsp;</strong>If you care about the story, ensuring you are all up to date on the campaign is vital. It'll help fill in the gaps about the Primalists and help you prepare for the upcoming story of The War Within.</li>
<li><strong>Run Raids and Mythic+ Dungeons.</strong> If possible, you want to be as geared up as possible when you begin to walk through the pre-patch. Some of the enemies may be overtuned, which can make brutal fights even harder. Having a good gear level will help massively with that.</li>
<li><strong>Try out some PvP.</strong> If you've never done PvP, now is a great time to get stuck. You can get PvP-specific gear, collect currencies, and exchange them for mounts and titles if you are prepared for a lengthy grind. Keep in mind that you don't have long to complete these things.</li>
<li><strong>Level up your Professions.&nbsp;</strong>While this may seem like something that isn't important, it can help boost your character. Not only can you get potions that will buff you, but you can then go on to complete Standing Orders for other people to earn some quick gold. There are plenty of professions to choose from, and many of them are highly beneficial, especially in the late game.</li>
<li><strong>Complete Non-Awakened Raids</strong>. At the moment, the three Raids in Dragonflight are classed as non-awakened. Once the patch has gone live, these raids will be permanently awakened, meaning you may find it harder to obtain the raid-specific gear and cosmetics you would have gotten from completing them while they were in a non-awakened state.</li>
<li><strong>Grind Renown levels</strong>. If you like to grind reputation levels with different factions, grinding Renown is perfect. Not only does it give you access to great cosmetics, it can also allow you to unlock mounts and other gear that you may find beneficial on your World of Warcraft journey.</li>
</ol>
<p>There is plenty still left to do in World of Warcraft, and it's entirely up to you what you choose to do with the time before The War Within<a href="https://thewarwithin.blizzard.com/en-gb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> pre-patch</a> arrives. Remember, you only have until July 23 to complete all of the time-gated content from Dragonflight before The War Within comes crashing in.</p>

In the modern age, online communities rallying around franchises are often composed of numerous splinter groups, and <em>Star Wars</em> is no exception—it’s got far-right reactionaries, original trilogy boomers, millennial prequel loyalists, Gen Z animated series lovers, and, of course, Reylos. It’s that last group—fans who ship characters Kylo Ren and Rey Skywalker of the sequel trilogy, and who are often women or queer folks—that have felt ostracized by other <em>Star Wars </em>fans in the years since 2019’s <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em>, and are just now feeling justified thanks to <em>T</em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/379647/564546/9358?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Fthe-acolyte%2F39RAA0bOYXQ0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/379647/564546/9358?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Fthe-acolyte%2F39RAA0bOYXQ0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>he Acolyte</em></a></span>. </p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sparks undeniably flew between Kylo and Rey in <em>The Last Jedi</em>, only to be briefly fanned and then snuffed out in the almost universally panned sequel, leaving Reylos convinced there was no love left in the <em>Star Wars</em> universe, and no love for them, either. But then came <em>The Acolyte</em>, the latest Disney+ <em>Star Wars</em> series, and its season finale—and with it, vindication for Reylos.<br></p><p>Former Jedi Padawan Osha (Amandla Stenberg) and dark side practitioner Qimir (Manny Jacinto) end up together, holding hands, staring out at the horizon. Romance (and specifically the kind of enemies-to-lovers romance that fanfic writers love) is back on the cantina menu, so I spoke to several self-proclaimed Reylos via email to learn how <em>The Acolyte</em> speaks directly to them.</p><figure id="" data-id="412c4ed268748cb056871d65537a71b8" data-recommend-id="image://412c4ed268748cb056871d65537a71b8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rey and Kylo reach out.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h3056"><a id=""></a><strong>The rise and fall of Reylos</strong></h2><p>“The two holding hands looking off into the sunset, rather than ending up alone. I think for a lot of Reylos, that’s really healing,” Parisi wrote. “It’s really nice to see [<em>The Acolyte</em> showrunner] Leslye Headland not shying away from the romance in interviews when it seemed like during the sequel trilogy the creators tried to be more vague and that only fueled the internet backlash.”<br></p><p>For many Reylos, the sequel trilogy’s failure to center the burgeoning romance between Kylo and Rey pointed to a franchise-wide reluctance to cater to the more feminine side of the fandom. Whereas the prequels put Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala’s love at their center, the conclusion to the sequel trilogy shied away from a full-blown romance, choosing instead to focus on Rey’s newly revealed connection to Emperor Palpatine, even though we learned Kylo and Rey are a “dyad,” a duo that shares a similar spark of the Force. The two share a single kiss near the end of <em>TRoS</em>, immediately after which Kylo dies.<br></p><p>“[<em>The Rise of Skywalker</em>] was probably the only time I have seen two characters kiss on screen and then seen fans instead of saying, ‘oh okay…it was meant to be romantic,’ you had people going, ‘oh it was a platonic kiss.’ The time after TRoS was truly wild,” author Ria Parisi explained via email. “The bad [part of their relationship] came from the final execution and unfortunate backlash. It’s very disappointing and sad to set up two characters who are supposed to be one half of each other and then leave one of them alone.”<br></p><p>“Where Reylo suffered the most was in the disconnect of ideas across the three films,” content creator Sawyer Markham wrote, referencing how the first and last films were made by J.J. Abrams while the middle was done by Rian Johnson, a decision many feel led to bizarre tonal shifts throughout the trilogy. And when the Reylos took to the internet to lament what they felt was a squandered on-screen romance, they faced widespread backlash. It’s important to note that, like all corners of <em>Star Wars</em> fandom, there was a sect of Reylos who exhibited some fairly virulent racism, swapping Kylo in for John Boyega’s Finn in fan art and fan-fic. But much of the anti-Reylo backlash felt rooted more in old-school misogyny than anything else.<br></p><p>“I think any online fandom or fandom subsect that is largely made up of people who aren’t cishet white men is inevitably treated badly. Reylos loved and connected with <em>The Last Jedi</em> in particular, whilst another small but very loud part of the fandom didn’t,” writer and director Laurie Kirwan-Ashman told me via email. “This coincided with the <em>Star Wars</em> fandom being infiltrated by the far-right off the back of Comicsgate, which then turned into a YouTube culture wars money-making grift that has created its own toxic cult.”<br></p><p>In the years since <em>The Last Jedi </em>and <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em>, Disney’s <em>Star Wars </em>stories have mostly avoided romance, but when Headland took the helm for <em>The Acolyte</em>, she made it clear that she wasn’t going to shy away from longing glances and grazing hands. </p><figure id="" data-id="dc9728826ae4a62ec03af9af9332467f" data-recommend-id="image://dc9728826ae4a62ec03af9af9332467f" data-format="jpg" data-width="916" data-height="522" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Qimir wields a saber near Osha's face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Qimir wields a saber near Osha's face." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney / Lucasfilm</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dc9728826ae4a62ec03af9af9332467f" data-recommend-id="image://dc9728826ae4a62ec03af9af9332467f" data-format="jpg" data-width="916" data-height="522" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Qimir wields a saber near Osha's face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h3057"><a id=""></a><strong>Enemies to lovers, for real this time</strong></h2><p>In stark contrast to any other official <em>Star Wars </em>media, <em>The Acolyte</em> wears its ship on its sleeve. “We went from Kylo taking off his shirt and people not getting it was meant to be the set up for a romantic relationship to this show saying, ‘Fine you didn’t get it with that? We’ll make [Qimir] fully nude’,” said Parisi. “And seeing the fans come together again in a way I haven’t seen since right after <em>The Last Jedi</em>, it just feels amazing.”</p><p>Not only did the series unabashedly lean into <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-acolyte-episode-5-qimir-master-review-1851562506&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-acolyte-episode-5-qimir-master-review-1851562506">Manny Jacinto’s sex appeal</a></span>, giving us what may be the first <em>Star Wars </em>character who’s canonically naked on-screen, but it subverted typical series tropes—Osha, raised by the Jedi, turns to the dark side, drawn there by her connection to Qimir. It’s the kind of romance plot Reylos have been dreaming of for years. “I read an interview that Leslye Headland did where she discussed how past characters talked about being seduced by the Dark Side and how we’d never actually seen that onscreen so she decided to give it to us—and she did!” author Sariah Wilson said over email.<br></p><p>“I still have to kind of pinch myself, like, am I really seeing a <em>Star Wars</em> show where a young woman abandons the institutional ‘We Have All The Answers’ club in favor of something more nuanced and complex, and is celebrated in the narrative for it, and gets to hold hands with the guy she had a connection with and look at the sunset?” Carrie, an early childhood professional, wondered. </p><p>And it’s not just about the broad strokes of a corruption courtship, it’s the manner in which that courtship is portrayed, with the kind of soft, sensual femininity that we almost never see in <em>Star Wars</em>. “It’s so slick, it’s so intentional, it’s so <em>hot</em>, it’s everything <em>Star Wars</em> could have been for the last seven years if the (overblown) reaction (from a loud minority of affirmative fans joined by right wing grifters) to <em>The Last Jedi</em> didn’t spook the higher-ups so badly,” said comic artist Para Caspari.<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-the-acolyte-qimir-osha-ship-sexy-reylo-1851576215&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-the-acolyte-qimir-osha-ship-sexy-reylo-1851576215">In <em>The Acolyte</em> episode 6</a></span>, Jacinto’s Qimir offers a not-so-subtle thesis for the “Oshamir” romance: “Below the surface of consciousness are powerful emotions—anger, fear, loss…desire.” Qimir seduces Osha, showing her that the Jedi way is draconian and severe, and even though she resists him at first, once she realizes the mistakes the Jedi made and how they resulted in the death of her mother, she sees that there’s much more nuance than they’d like her to believe. And so, she chooses Qimir, and the Dark Side.<br></p><p> “On the surface level, they’re obviously both incredibly beautiful people but, as with Reylo, what has really sparked so much investment in them is their dynamic: the push/pull tension, the way they surprise and challenge each other, the roles they’re playing and what they offer for each other’s character development,” explained Kirwan-Ashman. “There was a lot of really fun sexual subtext in <em>TLJ</em>…but it’s such a joy to have it be so explicitly explored in <em>The Acolyte</em>, and for the show to be so clearly interested in how seduction and desire play into the wider themes.”</p><figure id="" data-id="50d3d80f50df7c9c6b4f32b2d0a4d135" data-recommend-id="image://50d3d80f50df7c9c6b4f32b2d0a4d135" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Osha and Qimir look into the distance together.

But right now, Reylos are riding high after the recent finale—dare I say, they’re feeling vindicated—largely because Headland has been so open in discussing her vision for the series, and how Osha and Qimir’s dynamic is at its core.<br></p><p>“Leslye [Headland] wasn’t afraid to take risks in setting up the romantic undertones for these characters, and when asked about it in interviews she confirmed that that was her intent, which is something that was markedly missing from the Reylo era,” explained Markham. Rather than squabbling over subtext, <em>Acolyte </em>fans have concrete proof that this is a series about romance, and about blurring the lines between good and evil—as many pointed out after the season finale, Jedi Master Sol (Lee Jung-jae) maintained a lie for over a decade, insisting that Osha’s sister Mae was the reason why their entire witch coven perished. Qimir, on the other hand, gives Osha all the information she needed to make an informed decision, and space to ponder her future. By the end of the finale, she turns to him, hand outstretched, and chooses to train alongside him. To Reylos, this is a revelation.<br></p><p>“That’s why I think <em>Acolyte</em> is hitting such a chord with so many Reylo shippers: here’s a complex young woman who struggles with her darkness in a very real-feeling way onscreen, who can’t maintain her cognitive dissonance anymore, and who is learning that anger and fear and yes, desire, are all completely fine and normal emotions to feel and to harness in life,” Carrie pointed out.<br></p><p>Caspari takes it a step further, saying <em>The Acolyte</em> is “not just vindication but it specifically feels like a response to the Sequels along the lines of my aforementioned criticisms. It feels like Headland saying, ‘that sucked, here’s how I’d have done it’.” He&nbsp;continued, “Of course, if you’re a Reylo it feels like you’re finally free after being gaslit for a decade…of being told by both antis and affirmative fans alike that we were being weird, reading too much into it, projecting our own immoral fantasies, etc. it means a lot.”<br></p><p> Oshamir is also bittersweet for many Reylos, who wish they would have seen this kind of romance play out on the big screen. “In one way it’s a win because it feels like we’re finally allowing for women to be messy and complex in their characterization,” pointed out Carrie. “But on the other hand there’s definitely some bitterness because if Osha and Qimir holding hands and staring off into the sunset together was fine, why couldn’t we have had anything like that in <em>TROS</em>?”</p><p>“It also feels vindicating in the sense of being a show that includes and represents people who have been historically marginalized, both in terms of on-screen depiction in <em>Star Wars</em> and beyond,” said Kirwan-Ashman. “<em>The Acolyte </em>is created by a lesbian and all the main characters are played by women, non-binary, queer people and people of color.”<br></p><p>And though that may be what caused bad actors to review-bomb it and reactionary <em>Star Wars</em> YouTubers to declare <em>The Acolyte</em> dead in the water, Reylos have a very different outlook. As Kirwin-Ashman pointed out, “it really feels like it’s welcoming a new generation of the fandom as well as those who have loved <em>Star Wars</em> for a long time but have often felt in the past like <em>Star Wars</em> didn’t love them back.”<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<section><p>The Sims 4: Lovestruck is one of the game's most meaningful expansions, elevating relationships and player choice while also offering plenty of humor and spice.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>If you're a part of The Sims community, you know there are dozens of different kinds of "Simmers," as Maxis affectionately calls us. You have the luxury-focused "motherlode" spammers, the architects, the storytellers, the folks who find comfort in watching a simple family live out their simple life, the ladder-deleters, and more. Yet even heartbroken players executing their revenge fantasies are not the most depraved of all Sims players. No no. It's the Wicked Whims community who take that crown.</p><p dir="ltr">Wicked Whims, for the unacquainted, is a popular mod that adds graphic nudity to The Sims 4 as well as just about everything you can <em>do</em> while graphically nude. Like, <em>everything</em>. Not that I would know because <em>obviously</em> I've never installed it. That would be indecent. Obviously.</p><p dir="ltr">But if I <em>had </em>installed it, I would be able to tell you that The Sims 4's upcoming Lovestruck expansion certainly doesn't come close to being as colorful as WW. However, it does add just enough spice to put that "Rated T for Teens'' label to the test and contains some concepts we've seen in Wicked Whims' less-spicy companion: Wonderful Whims. And overall, The Sims 4 experience is made much better for it. On top of adding a healthy dose of lust to the game, Lovestruck adds a whole lot of <em>love </em>to the game. Thanks to Lovestruck, we get some much-needed complexity and clarity to relationships, a better replication of what real-life relationships can look like, and a reminder of what makes Maxis a simulation-game powerhouse.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336827-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer0-22screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4336827" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336827-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer0-22screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4336827"></a><figcaption>Two men embrace one another on a couch, looking smitten.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336827-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer0-22screenshot.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Shortly after attending a hands-off preview event offering <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sims-4-is-finally-getting-rid-of-one-of-its-most-annoying-features-with-a-free-update/1100-6524986/">an overview of Lovestruck</a>, I was given the chance to test out the expansion. Seeing as the DLC was all about romance, I decided to boot up the game and make my very own rom-com protagonist, complete with a job at a <em>very</em> important magazine, an ambitious personality, and a fear of love. I found there are a lot of fun new additions to Create-A-Sim: cute and inclusive new hair styles, plenty of sexy going-out tops, and plenty of other fun items. However, the greatest changes resided in the Simology panel. New to the game are Romantic Boundaries, Turn Ons and Turn Offs, two new personality traits (Love Bug and Romantically Reserved), two new aspirations (Romantic Explorer and Paragon Partner), and the long-awaited ability to set roommates as partners.</p><p dir="ltr">Romantic Boundaries are easily the most substantial update to the game, making it no surprise that Maxis opted to bring the system over to the base game as well. Essentially, Romantic Boundaries establish what behaviors you are okay with in a relationship. Lovestruck breaks it down with four questions: Does your sim get jealous if a partner flirts with another sim? What about if they get a bit hands-on? What if they WooHoo? And lastly, is your Sim willing to talk through their boundaries if they are broken and negotiate their relationships terms? I decided to go with no, yes, yes, yes to see how everything would play out.</p><p dir="ltr">Selecting her Turn Ons and Turn Offs was also a lot of fun. Rather than simply allow you to choose from the game's pre-established traits, the system lumps them into general ideas. For example, rather than just selecting that you like "Loner" types, you can select that you like "Homebodies," which includes Bookworm, Clumsy, Geek, Lazy, Sedentary, Socially Awkward, <em>and </em>Loner. I made her attracted to Hardworking, Career-Minded, and Wealthy Sims, then threw in a bit of a problematic trait that, in my own little headcanon, had gotten her into trouble before: Already Taken.</p><p dir="ltr">I then moved my sim, the somewhat ham-fistedly named Juliet Hart, into the expansion's new city: the also somewhat ham-fistedly named Ciudad Enamorada. The Mexico City-inspired neighborhood is gorgeous, with colorful buildings, plenty of rooftop terraces, and beautiful stone masonry buildings. I moved her into the cheapest of these lots, across from a motel that cost 40 simoleons a night.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336828-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer2-20screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4336828" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336828-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer2-20screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4336828"></a><figcaption>The neon-lit nearby motel.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336828-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer2-20screenshot.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Despite Juliet's ambitions of being an award-winning columnist, I decided I needed to try the game's newest career path: Romance Consultant. On top of being novel, I figured it also probably offers more job security. Sure, she wasn't a romantic herself, but perhaps her cynicism, which she'd argue was merely realistic, would make her an interesting choice for the position. The second thing I did was sign up for Cupid's Corner, the game's new dating app. While you can't lie about your traits or appearance on the app--sorry, aspiring catfishers--you can only select two traits to showcase on your profile, allowing sims to hide any particularly unappealing characteristics prior to going out on a date.</p><p dir="ltr">After taking a new profile picture and selecting "Ambitious" and "Outgoing" as my traits--conveniently leaving out "Romantically Reserved"--I began swiping, so to speak. In Cupid's Corner, you are presented with seven potential suitors, with the traits that you like and dislike highlighted on their profile; these can then be refreshed every 12 in-game hours. Of the seven matches, you are allowed to "like" three of them, which adds them to the saved part of the app. From there, you can choose to save their number and/or ask them to go on a date with you. The first person Juliet went on a date with was a man named Manuel, whose artsy, Lovebug personality type was a bit different for her.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336830-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer0-34screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4336830" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336830-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer0-34screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4336830"></a><figcaption>The Cupid's Corner interface, in which a woman named Zoey's profile is displayed.

On a random Thursday, Gavin called Juliet from his job and told her she was having an awful day. Juliet then told him she'd bring him lunch and set off to his work with tacos, which made their relationship grow closer. Gavin soon became the situationship she was most invested in, causing her to develop a fear that he might be seeing other sims behind her back--she then was able to have a sit-down with him in which he reassured her he was serious about her, causing the game to grant her "Fear Progress." While I don't know what conquering a fear entails--this was the only time the scenario popped up during my brief playtime--I am excited to explore the concept more.</p><p dir="ltr">A few days later, however, the obscenely wealthy Nancy Landgrab called Juliet with a strange proposition; in fact I am still <em>somewhat</em> unsure of the exact intention behind it. The lonely wife told Juliet that she was looking for some companionship and would pay Juliet a hefty sum to spend time with her at the nearby motel. Naturally I had to say yes, and met the "wealthy weirdo" as the game called her across the street. After two hours, Juliet came back with a bunch of strange objects in her inventory, including several precious stones and a rare black axolotl. Shortly after, Juliet was then invited to star on a reality dating program; the stranger told her they would set cameras all around her home and her mission would be to simply have one week's worth of hot dates. A Herculean task, but she was up for it. She soon developed a number of unique dynamics with other sims: a "Steamy" relationship with Manuel, a "Wholesome" one with Gavin, and a "Strained" one with the married Nancy.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336829-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer2-25screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4336829" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336829-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer2-25screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4336829"></a><figcaption>A couple in matching, revealing wrestling outfits sits on a bed playing the new, raunchy adult game WooWho?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4336829-thesims4lovestruck_officialgameplaytrailer2-25screenshot.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Lovestruck is full of these weird, sincere, and steamy interactions. On top of being able to perform "Back-to-Back WooHoo" in the newly resurfaced vibrating bed--a callback to The Sims 1--whilst dressed up in a variety of suggestive costumes found in the game's new costume trunk, there are several new dialogue options. You can ask about WooHoo and romantic interests, ask to attend couple's counseling, ask what they're attracted to, ask about romantic boundaries, check in on your relationship status, recap WooHoos, and reveal desires. Romantically Reserved sims are also offered a number of Mr. Darcy-esque options, like asking an "indecent question," praising beauty, and offering a "civilized remark." After several "civilized remarks," conversations about relationship boundaries, and plenty of "Back-to-Back WooHoo," Juliet and Gavin decided to become exclusive and now live together in their newly renovated Ciudad Enamorada home--and I couldn't be happier for the lil' lovebirds.</p><p>In short, Lovestruck adds a bewildering amount of relationship complexity and over-the-top drama, the likes of which I haven't seen since my favorite The Sims entry, The Sims 2. The Sims expansions can be hit or miss; while some feel like they completely change the game's dynamics and are well-worth the $40 EA charges for them, others can feel more surface-level. Suffice to say, Lovestruck is the former, and I can't quite imagine going back to a version of the game without it. While all the options might be a lot for those whose playstyle is more simplistic (though it's worth mentioning you can turn Relationship Boundaries off in the settings menu), I believe Lovestruck is one of the series' most substantial and <em>fun</em> expansions.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/we-almost-like-everything-about-longlegs.932292/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/longlegs-nic-cage-maika-monroe-oz-perkins<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Chris Person:</strong> Over the weekend, the release of Neon's latest horror movie Longlegs shocked people with a fantastic opening weekend. $22.6 million! Nicolas Cage is in it in an over the top role. It's creepy. It's retro. Gita: You and I both saw it. I have been digesting how I feel about it. What did you think of the movie?</p><p><strong>Gita Jackson:</strong> It's definitely a messy movie..... but my initial reaction was that I really, really liked it a lot. I might even love it. In particular, there's a string of performances that give the movie a lot of life, Nic Cage of course among them. I think the most complimentary thing I could say about this movie is that I want to see it a second time to really digest it—it's very dense!</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I agree it is messy! I think I initially did not enjoy it, I still don't think I really love it, but there's a ton of performances that are fantastic. Nic Cage is the big one and a topic unto itself, but Maika Monroe and Blair Underwood come to mind in particular.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Blair Underwood is really incredible in the film honestly. Everyone else is firmly rooted in this dreamy unreality except for Underwood, who is basically the film's only Normal Man who reacts to things Normally, until he really pointedly doesn't. I know this movie was billed as being exceptionally scary, but Underwood got some big laughs when I saw it in theaters.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> He's a fantastic straight man in a movie where nobody has their shit together I agree. Maika Monroe has this deeply neurotic tension that feels very period appropriate. She has a strong Winona aura.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I truly love Maika Monroe as an actress so much. I know a lot of people probably first saw her in <em>It Follows</em>, a really phenomenal film, but I thought she was just as good if not better in <em>The Guest</em>, playing against Dan Stevens. I fucking love that movie. She's definitely got a Winona-aura...... she can play confident and self assured at the same time as projecting vulnerability. Which is basically what this movie is all about!</p><figure></figure><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It's weird to see an acting style that lines up with the references the movie is making, Jodie Foster in <em>The Silence of the Lambs</em> is also in there. But the movie is also set in the 90's, you see Bill Clinton visage on the wall. It may be worth contextualizing the plot going into this if you haven't already seen it, but we will be spoiling it a bit if that's something readers are sensitive to.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Let's talk about the set up, at least, and then we can get more explicit about spoilers in a minute. I went into this totally blind, actually, and I enjoyed that experience. So if that's you, maybe tap out now!</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I did too!</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> In this movie, Maika Monroe plays Lee Harker, an FBI agent who might be a little bit psychic. She's called in by her boss, played by Blair Underwood, to help him solve the Longlegs murders. These murders are all tied together by a note, written in code, signed by someone who goes by Longlegs—but also, there is no evidence that Longlegs himself has ever been at the scene of the crime. All these crimes are committed by the father of a family, who kills the children, his wife and then himself. The only thing the families have in common is that they have a daughter who was born on the 14th of the month, and the murders are committed on or around that birthday.</p><p>Then, this being a horror movie directed by Oz Perkins with Nicolas Cage in a pivotal role, some weird stuff happens.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="LONGLEGS | Official Trailer | In Theaters July 12" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OG7wOTE8NhE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Perkins and Cage are both working through some stuff.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> A long time ago, Cage gave an interview where he described acting as being like jazz, and a lot of people made fun of him. When you watch what he does in this movie, you kinda see what he means.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Describing Cage's character is hard because it's really singular. Imagine if you gave Buffalo Bill the soul of Gary Glitter, he got tremendously early plastic surgery done, and he started living in a cellar and talking like Tiny Tim in white makeup. It's the definition of a lot. For a while I thought he had a medical condition but apparently it was supposed to be 70s-80s era plastic surgery he got done to please the devil.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> At one point in the film he sings one of his lines instead of speaking it and you CANNOT convince me that was in the script. It's like he's doing this, but for a movie that is good and not bad:&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Nicolas Cage (Deadfall Highlights)" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-nN17X-OdGQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I want to just see a compilation of all of his takes for this movie. He is just Trying Shit. The other quote about Cage I love to bring up is that Ebert said he's a great actor in a good movie, but an indispensable actor in a bad one. He will make everyone match his energy by just trying out something super fucking weird and making people react to it. While Cage's performance is getting a lot of buzz, what's most impressive to me is that the other actors match his freak, basically. I especially liked Alicia Witt as Maika Monroe's hoarder mom—I think the only other role people might know her for is Alia Atreides in Lynch's Dune.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think it's a very personal role. He based the character's mannerisms a lot on his mother,&nbsp;Joy Vogelsang, who was mentally ill to the point of being institutionalized. It is a character that hears voices. He also has stated he wanted the character to be androgynous, and <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/nicolas-cage-longlegs-serial-killer-inspiration-mother-1235941846/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cited Juliet of the Spirits as a reference</a>, which is a good pull.</p><p>I see some criticisms that the character is either a transphobic or anti-queer role and while I can see that I think it does a disservice to what Cage and Perkins are both pulling from in their lives. Perkins' dad was Anthony Perkins! Norman Bates!</p><figure></figure><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Yeah I feel like I understand where the idea of this specific role being anti-queer comes from, but given how personal this movie is to the people who made it, it just doesn't scan. Anthony Perkins died from AIDS-related complications and that's, ya know, Oz's dad. Beyond that, I think the movie really clearly sets up a framework that focuses on patriarchal violence and moral panics and when you venture outside that framing, like, <em>nothing</em> in the movie really makes sense.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah you have these really personal motivations for the movie, Cage and Perkins having very fraught relationships with their parents, and it's wedded to a movie that telegraphs what it is doing way too early and where the primary action (compelling fathers to kill their families with the power of demonic possession) does not really make sense outside of The Devil Made Them Do It. That's not how the devil works! That's the part that really pissed me off, you can't just force people to do things that are not in their hearts!</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> You see...... I think the argument he makes is that fathers do secretly hold that in their hearts. Early on in the movie, Agent Carter's daughter tells Lee Harker that she thinks that her stuffed animals are childish, but her dad makes her keep them so she "doesn't grow up too fast." The parental figures in the movie all walk this thin line between love and violence—and then eventually cross it. Weirdly it gives <em>P.T.</em></p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It gives <em>Alan Wake 2</em> too. Sorry if that's a tangent, it just looks really similar.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> No you're totally right. There's a shot where the camera is following Harker from behind and you see that big, yellow FBI logo and I just thought, I wonder if Sam Lake has seen this. Similar color palette too—a lot of the movie is greys and beiges and then there's these vibrant splashes of red.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>It's also similar in that, you're never really sure what the tone is? In <em>Alan Wake 2</em> it's because it's made in Finland, but this has this strange mixture of camp and earnestness that sometimes clashes. Like it wants to be <em>Se7en </em>and <em>Zodiac </em>and it is very much a pastiche of those. I think it being fun does make it a more palatable movie.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I love that moment where they ask the guy at the front desk of a mental health facility if they check IDs for visitors and he goes "well, you know that sounds like great idea!"</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> That guy ruled. I love a catty gay guy that is not good at his job.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Finally, representation</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think it's got the most in common with <em>M3gan</em>, like it knows what it is there to do first and foremost and it's to have a good time, and I think that's why it did so well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Absolutely. I don't know how long it was, it felt extremely breezy while I was watching it, but it reminded me of a kind of movie that we used to get a lot of in the 90s that they just don't make anymore: a thriller for adults with no ambitions of becoming an Intellectual Property.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah, just a fun one off. I think the biggest problem with it is, for me, is that it's not a really great movie (to me at least). I really wanna see what Oz Perkins does after this, but I also saw a lot of people recommend Kiyoshi Kurosawa's <em>Cure </em>after this and I agree with that sentiment because A) It's one of the best movies (period, not just horror) ever made and B) it does the same central conceit far better, to the point where I was like "Wait, are you just doing <em>Cure</em>? I've seen that! You can't do that better!"</p><figure></figure><p>That's the biggest gambit with referencing good movies so aggressively. Like there's a part where Harker's Mom slyly quotes Lilian Gish in <em>The Night of The Hunter</em> and you only get to do that if you make a perfect movie. <em>Do The Right Thing</em> gets to but it's a perfect movie!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Yeah thinking on it...... I think the worst thing about the movie is that it was marketed as a horror movie and not as a "psychological thriller," which is basically a horror movie but people don't have such weird expectations of what that means the movie will be. You can tell when you're watching it how the framework of being a horror films—something they can't escape by referencing <em>Silence of the Lambs</em> so much—forms the arc of the movie. In particular I think it undercuts the very last scene of the movie and the resolution of the murder mystery. Horror often works by making people invoke the creepy thing you're gesturing towards in their own heads, by scaring them with the implication of something rather than its actual depiction. But I feel like this movie had something it wanted to capital s Say about how fucking scary childhood is, but it doesn't actually ever come out and say it.</p><p>I think we may be...... in <strong><em>spoiler territory</em></strong>.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I am fine with that, we've come so far.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Let us proceed my friend</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Into...the darkness...</p><h2><strong>SPOILERS</strong></h2><p><strong>Gita:</strong> God, so the thing I wish they actually spent a little bit more time on is the creepy life size dolls.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I need to know how they work! Sorry to be a nerd, but the mechanics don't really make sense even if you concede that magic and the devil are real.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> YEAH that is something that I think holds the movie back. So much of the symbolism depends on the dolls, and then they kinda just yadda yadda yadda over the mechanics of them.</p><p>For those reading along—it's discovered, eventually, that Longlegs gives all his victims incredibly lifelike dolls that look exactly like the daughter in the family. And over time, you can basically put together how the symbolism here works. The dolls compel the fathers to kill, so that the only thing that remains is the doll, perfect and pristine forever. Violence being done in the name of protecting the daughter, that also kills the daughter.</p><p>And we learn that Lee Harker's mother has been the person who has been dropping these dolls off, placing her into that same structure—she murders to protect her child, but also she has a really weird relationship with her daughter who seems emotionally stunted and stuck at this moment of trauma from her childhood.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> That part is again, Perkins making it about himself. A mother protecting their child from truths but never acknowledging the elephant in the room. But the doll thing is so left field. <em>Cure </em>handles this beautifully! Most people know what hypnosis is. It doesn't need to be literally true, it just needs to feel organic. Dolls with metal balls in their head you whisper things into is a lot to load on to the audience and have them accept. That's new lore you've invented, you need to do some scene setting for it, and as it stands it just kinda barrels through.</p><p>I cannot stress how much I hate being a nerd about this, but it's really not done well.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>Gita:</strong> And it's frustrating because the pieces SHOULD all line up and then they just. don't.</p><p>Like I was able to really quickly clock that Lee's mother was in on it, and that she probably had already met Longlegs, and that the dolls make the fathers kill. Honestly maybe the part that just doesn't work is the little metal ball inside? Harker's mother says that Longlegs puts "a little of himself inside" but it's like, what does that MEAN.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Right, it's not ambiguous in a way that leaves you guessing.</p><p>And all that said? Still had a pretty OK time. It's fun! But the PARTS are all there, the parts for a better movie, and that's the part that I can't get past.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Sometimes movies are more frustrating when they're almost great.</p><p><strong>&nbsp;Chris:</strong> You were so close dude!</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I would say it's a solid good not great movie—but it really made me want to watch Perkins's other stuff. I heard that <em>The Blackcoat's Daughter</em> picks up a lot of the same themes that are in this movie.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> A friend liked <em>&nbsp;I Am The Pretty Thing That Lives In The House</em> but I have not seen it. Anyway, moral of the story to readers: Go watch <em>Cure</em>.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>If you are more of a book reading type, I would also read <em>The Gone World</em> by Tom Sweterlisch, which has a similar plot but is a fucked up time travel story with really disturbing body horror elements.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Oh I should read that.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> It slaps dude. I reread it all the time. Maybe Perkins should grab the rights!</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-annonounced-release-date-pc-ps5-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LEGO Horizon Adventures</a> is perhaps the only game based on a big PlayStation IP due to launch this year. Of course, it is also a spin-off title that mainly targets kids of around eight years old.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/making-horizon-zero-dawn-suitable-for-eight-year-olds" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to GamesIndustry</a>, James Windeler, narrative director at Guerrilla Games (which is working alongside Studio Gobo on this project), said that fans of the franchise will still recognize the main characters in LEGO Horizon Adventures, even though certain themes take on a more lighthearted note due to the different target audience.</p>
<p><em>We have tried to keep as much of the story as possible. A lot of what happens in the world, like the destruction of the old world… that's a pretty heavy theme for an eight-year-old. So we needed to find ways to keep that present in the story, because it is essential to Horizon. But it is also not something we leaned on. You won't find some of those devastating reveals from the first game, like those corporate masterminds dead around the table or anything like that.</em></p>
<p><em>There are moments from the first game that packs a really heavy emotional punch, that we've found, I think, a very good way to represent faithfully, but undercut them with comedy that keeps things light-hearted. This stuff is present, but it's certainly not surface. This is a much simpler version, but it has a lot of echoes from the original.</em></p>
<p><em>It has still got to feel like Horizon. We have definitely bent the rules a lot. But the characters remain core to who they are. I think we've found a really good balance with it. We have a lot of help. Ashley Burch is back as the voice of Aloy, and JB Blanc (as Rost). And you would have heard the exuberance to their performances. It is different to what the other games are, but they're still recognisable. They're part of it and they bought into it, and that's been a huge boon to us.</em></p>
<p>LEGO Horizon Adventures is launching this December on PC, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/guerrilla-games-provides-unconvincing-reason-as-to-why-lego-horizon-adventures-isnt-coming-to-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaving out Xbox</a> and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-horizon-adventures-switch-for-everyone-no-crossplay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cross-play multiplayer</a> among the announced platforms.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/every-final-fantasy-14-expansion-ranked-dawntrail-endwalker-shadowbringers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Final Fantasy 14 is over 10 years old and players are finishing up its newest expansion, Dawntrail. With six expansions, including A Realm Rebron, Final Fantasy 14 is one of gaming's greatest comeback stories. From a critically-panned launch to becoming one of the biggest games of all time for Square Enix, all of it was thanks to the consistently excellent work from the developers. </p><p>But which expansion reigns supreme? With so many to choose from, and each expansion with its own unique characteristics, it's hard to choose. But we've gotten together to rank every Final Fantasy 14 expansion to find out which one we loved most.</p><p>So hit the jump to see our favorite expansions in Final fantasy 14 below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>Final Fantasy 14: A Realm Reborn</h2><p>The story of Final Fantasy 14’s rise from the ashes is well-documented. Following a disastrous launch, producer Naoki Yoshida took reins on the project and rebooted the game with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/11/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn-review">A Realm Reborn</a>, which literally destroyed the world of the launch game, and built on top of it the beloved MMORPG we know and love today.</p><p>A Realm Reborn was a two-fold project that fixed the frustrating gameplay and RPG systems of the launch version while telling a story that literally incorporates the destruction of the launch version into the wider narrative. And while A Realm Reborn quite literally saved FF14, the need to reboot an entire MMO and reintroduce players to the game is its greatest weakness. Compared to later expansions, A Realm Reborn feels downright glacial when it comes to pacing, and the need to revamp the world means its story is far more bloated than it needs to be in later expansions. While A Realm Reborn will always be cherished for saving Square Enix’s MMORPG, you’ll be hard-pressed to say the later expansions aren't better. - <em>Matt Kim</em></p><h2>Final Fantasy 14: Stormblood</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/06/27/ffxiv-40-mediakit-20170501-013-1498603434827.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Square Enix</figcaption></figure></output><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/30/final-fantasy-xiv-stormblood-review">Stormblood</a> is often looked at as one of the lesser-liked expansions, which, to me, speaks to how strong the rest of them are. That’s because Stormblood is still a crucial piece to Final Fantasy 14 that worked to conclude long-standing conflicts and show you just how evil and destructive the Garlean Empire was. I vividly remember the feeling of taking back Ala Mhigo after all these years of them being under Garlean rule, and taking back Doma Castle after seeing how Domans had suffered from the occupation. There are moments in which Stormblood undercuts its own messaging and perhaps didn’t fully find the nuance necessary to elegantly tell a politically charged story. However, it gets the larger picture right, and the liberation of the peoples across the different regions was invigorating nonetheless.</p><p>Stormblood’s zones might not be the most exciting of the bunch, but there’s a tranquility I still feel when flying across the Ruby Sea, over the plains of Azim Steppe, and past the rice patties in Yangxia. I often reflect on the stories of oppression and rebellion in those moments because of the smaller stories told throughout the expansion. I also remember Yotsuyu as one of the most complex villains of FF14 – her heartbreaking story represents how sadistic and corrupting living under oppression can be, which culminated in one of the best boss fights to this day. Stormblood may not have been the best expansion, but it had peaks that make FF14 what it is today. - <em>Michael Higham</em></p><h2>Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/01/dwan-1719847877677.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Square Enix</figcaption></figure></output><p>With <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review">Dawntrail fresh in my memory</a>, it’s a bit hard to gauge its place in the Final Fantasy 14 pantheon, but even with all its implications yet to be explored, it still stands as a worthy addition to the MMO’s long history. The land of Tural opens FF14 to so many different themes and cultural influences it wasn’t able to incorporate in the past, and although it does come with some mixed results, the vibrant foundation it lays leaves even more room for growth.<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-is-like-playing-a-great-one-piece-game"> Newcomer Wuk Lamat</a> is a large focus and although she’s not the strongest character in FF14, she has the heart necessary to carry out Dawntrail’s message of finding peace through mutual respect and embracing our differences.</p><p>Dawntrail’s lasting legacy is in the second half of its story where things turn in unpredictable directions. Its fusion of references to ancient civilizations, its Latin American roots, and the old-timey American West somehow make sense when they clash with the cyberpunk-tinged sci-fi elements that eventually come to the forefront. It’s able to touch on classic Final Fantasy narrative themes from a fresh perspective. We explored the depths of the pain we feel from losing the things we love most during Shadowbringers and Endwalker, but the way Dawntrail contextualizes mortality is powerfully intimate. In its best moments, Dawntrail can be as impactful as anything else found in FF14, and for that alone, this expansion deserves its flowers. - <em>MH</em></p><h2>Final Fantasy 14: Endwalker</h2><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-xiv-endwalker-review-ffxiv">Endwalker is the culmination</a> of a 10-year long story arc for Final Fantasy 14. From the days of A Realm Reborn, players became embroiled in a celestial battle between the gods Hydaelin and Zodiark. Beset in the real-world by a global pandemic that delayed the expansion by a year, Endwalker was a reward for players who stuck with the MMORPG from its earliest days who can now see the conclusion to a long-running storyline.</p><p>The stakes were high but Endwalker is FF14’s most emotional expansion to date, reinforcing Final Fantasy 14’s core themes of how friendship and courage can overcome even the greatest challenges. And with so much of Final Fantasy 14 now playable in single-player, a new player could play from A Realm Reborn through Endwalker and feel that they’ve finished one of the best Final Fantasy games of all time.</p><p>But thankfully, Endwalker is not the end of FF14, and the newest expansion, Dawntrail, is setting the stage for the next 10 years of Square Enix’s beloved MMORPG. - <em>MK</em></p><h2>Final Fantasy 14: Heavensward</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/11/11/ffxivheavenswardbenchmark018png-a80986.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Square Enix</figcaption></figure></output><p>What a difference an expansion makes. Free from the need to fix an entire MMORPG, Final Fantasy 14’s next expansion after A Realm Reborn, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/29/final-fantasy-xiv-heavensward-review">Heavensward</a>, is able to jump right into the action. With the Warriors of Light on the run, they escape to the frozen, holy land of Ishgard which has been too busy embroiled in a war against dragons to do much in Eorzea. </p><p>What’s immediately apparent in Heavensward is that it quickly establishes the themes and storytelling the FF14 team seems to revel in: dramatic, high fantasy that harkens back to the old pixel games like Final Fantasy 6. Heavensward is such a throwback to the classic sword and sorcery fantasy of early Final Fantasy games, while also introducing the dark courtly politics that would make George R.R. Martin grin. If A Realm Reborn took a lot of time to get going, Heavensward is action-packed almost from the jump and from there sets the bar for all later FF14 expansions. </p><p>To quote FromSoftware, the real Final Fantasy 14 begins with Heavensward. - <em>MK</em></p><h2>Final Fantasy 14: Shadowbringers</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/11/19/ffxiv-pub-fanfestival-2018-lasvegas-10-1542667050150.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Square Enix</figcaption></figure></output><p>Final Fantasy 14 truly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/12/ffxiv-shadowbringers-review">found its voice in Shadowbringers</a>. Lead writer Natsuko Ishikawa stepped into the role and her poetic storytelling style gave the expansion its identity, focusing on its characters with a level of depth and emotional sincerity never before seen in FF14. From the moment you step into The First, there’s an immediate sense of urgency that sets the tone for how dire the flood of light has been on the entire realm, flipping the script on typical light versus dark stories. And in horrifying ways, leaned on showing rather than telling.</p><p>Shadowbringers captured its grand moments with a weight and excitement that few RPGs are able to pull off. It earns those moments by building characters like the Crystal Exarch, Ardbert, and Emet Selch in a complex web of heroes and villains to carry its heavier themes, and contextualize despair and tragedy in a world separate from anything we’d known in Eorzea. FF14 began to ask the big questions about loss, grief, and the lengths people will go to preserve the things that matter most to them, and did so with nuance.</p><p>And if we want to count the post-launch content, Patch 5.3 capped off what was already one of the best stories in the series with another incredible conclusion, reaching a height that I don’t think FF14 will ever be able to top. My precious crystal cat boy gave his all to save a realm, and all of my Scion friends were there to witness his greatness as he immortalized his life’s work at the Seat of Sacrifice. From its writing and narrative themes to its music and visual storytelling, Shadowbringers not only proved itself as peak FF14, it’s arguably peak Final Fantasy. - <em>MH</em></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>These are our rankings for our favorite Final Fantasy 14 expansions.
