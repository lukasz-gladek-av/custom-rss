            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-shutting-down-in-may<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Phoenix Labs has announced that multiplayer monster-hunting action RPG&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>will shut down in May, and while the studio hasn't given a concrete reason for the game shutting down, it's easy to guess why it's happening.</p>

<p>In a rather terse&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/331370/view/503943474819631342" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on Steam, Phoenix Labs simply says that&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>will shut down on May 29th and that it will receive "no additional content or updates". From May 29th, you'll no longer be able to play&nbsp;<em>Dauntless</em>.</p>

<p>It sounds like not only will there be no new content after the shutdown (naturally), but that the game won't be getting any major updates before then, either. In short,&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>is basically a dead game walking at this point.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dauntless-shutting-down-monster.jpg?itok=iWDvQy2c 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dauntless-shutting-down-monster.jpg?itok=Czum_WmI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>will shut down in May.</figcaption></figure><p>So, why is&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>shutting down? Well, while Phoenix Labs doesn't give a reason (in either the official announcement or in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dauntless/comments/1ix9232/its_finally_over/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a Discord message</a> sent to players, apparently), we can make a very strong educated guess.</p>

<p>A quick look at&nbsp;<em>Dauntless</em>' Steam numbers (via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/331370/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, as usual) shows an active player count of just 61, with 107 players checking into the game over the last 24 hours. It's clear players aren't exactly flocking to&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>right now.</p>

<p>A major reason for that is likely the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-awakening-update-apology" rel="nofollow">controversial Awakening update</a>, which was released in December and which quickly drew the ire of players.&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>fans criticized the update's approach to monetization and progression, among other things.</p>

<p>Following the Awakening update's poor reception, Phoenix Labs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-developer-phoenix-labs-more-layoffs" rel="nofollow">laid off "the majority" of its staff</a>, leaving the future of games like&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>uncertain. Now, the future of at least one of those games is a lot clearer.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm</em>, it's unclear whether support will continue for the cozy farming sim. Phoenix Labs isn't shutting down just yet, after all, although things aren't looking good for the studio.</p>

<p>In the meantime, if you need a monster hunting fix, you might want to check in with Capcom's&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, which launches later this week. Our own Tyler <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier" rel="nofollow">was impressed with the game</a>, so it might well fill that&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>hole for you.</p>

Generative AI often struggles with hands, adding extra fingers where they shouldn't be.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/09/santa-claus-1733746080205.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><strong>Black Ops 6's 'Necroclaus' loading screen. Image credit: Activision Publishing.</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another image of a gloved hand was used to show off a new Zombies community event. It contained what looked like six fingers with no thumb on-screen, suggesting up to seven digits on this hand.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/02/25/bo6-1740485655900.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The central image includes a gloved hand with some odd things going on. Image credit: Activision Publishing.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The release of the Zombie Santa image sparked a closer look at other images in Black Ops 6, which some in the Call of Duty community subsequently called into question. Redditor Shaun_LaDee highlighted three images included in paid bundles that have irregularities that could suggest the use of generative AI.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans then called on Activision to disclose the use of generative AI for art that is included in bundles that are sold, and following new <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/3862463747997849618" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>AI disclosure rules</u></a> for Steam, it has now added a vague disclosure that covers the entirety of Black Ops 6 on Valve’s platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 6’s Steam AI Generated Content Disclosure reads: “Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in game assets.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In July, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Wired</u></a> reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-reportedly-sold-an-ai-generated-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-cosmetic"><u>Activision sold an “AI-generated cosmetic” for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 last year</u></a>. The cosmetic in question was not named, but was linked to the Yokai’s Wrath bundle released in December 2023. The store did not disclose any use of generative AI for this bundle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This bundle cost 1,500 COD Points, the premium virtual currency sold for real-world money that generates hundreds of millions of dollars for Activision each year. 1,500 COD Points is approximately valued at $15.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wired pointed out that Microsoft, which owns Activision Blizzard after its $69 billion acquisition of the company last year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce"><u>cut 1,900 staff from its gaming business</u></a> just months after Activision sold this skin. The report alleged that 2D artists’ jobs were being replaced by AI at the company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A lot of 2D artists were laid off,” one anonymous Activision artist told the site. “Remaining concept artists were then forced to use AI to aid in their work.” Activision employees were allegedly “made” to sign up for AI training, with its use promoted throughout the business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Generative AI is one of the hottest topics within the video game and entertainment industries, which have both suffered massive layoffs in recent years. Generative AI thus far has drawn criticism from players and creators due to a mix of ethical issues, rights issues, and AI’s struggles to produce content audiences actually enjoy. For instance, Keywords Studios attempted to create an experimental game internally using entirely AI. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-made-purely-with-ai-failed-because-tech-was-unable-to-replace-talent"><u>The game failed</u></a>, with Keywords citing to investors that AI was “unable to replace talent.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> developer Niantic has responded to confusion over unexplained progression limits for the game's first paid event battle pass, which went on sale yesterday.
</p>
<p>
The game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-tour-pass-how-to-get-points-ranks-milestones-rewards-deluxe-price-9505">Tour Pass is a core part of this weekend's upcoming Go Tour event</a>, and rewards an encounter with Mythical creature Victini plus oodles of in-game items and bonuses. It also includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-lucky-trinket-how-to-get-9505">the first Lucky Trinket item</a>, which instantly unlocks Lucky Friend status with a player of your choice.
</p>
<p>
There's a free version of the Tour Pass without Victini and the Lucky Trinket, or alternatively you can pay £14.99 for the Deluxe version with far more rewards at each rank. For those really looking to spend, you can instead pay £19.99 for the Deluxe pass with 10 tiers unlocked straight away.
</p>
<p>
Why would you want to pay to unlock tiers? Well, the Tour Pass has 100 levels of item and Pokémon encounter rewards, and then a further 400 levels of Stardust resource dollops - making for 500 levels total. And, currently, you are restricted to only unlocking five tiers per day. 
</p>
<p>
Pokémon Go does not currently state in-game that this restriction will be lifted when this weekend's game properly begins, and yet you can start inching through the battle pass now. 
</p>
<p>"I was excited to have something to grind for and actually go out and play," one fan wrote on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1ix96z1/update_on_tour_pass_from_niantic_support/">top Pokémon Go reddit TheSilphRoad</a>. "Then I reached my cap just playing around my office and I suddenly have no interest in going out to play."</p>
<p>"I feel robbed but I guess that's the norm," wrote another fan. "Went out and did all the raids and caught all the legendries from research only to get to the same level as I could have by just catching a few pokemon in the yard."</p>

<p>
On the one hand, allowing players to get to grips with the game's first battle pass ahead of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-tour-unova-event-times-schedule-rewards-free-activities-9505">Pokémon Go Tour this weekend</a> means fans can figure out how it all works in good time. On the other, not explaining the limits, not giving players the same experience they'll get at the weekend and selling an even more expensive version of the battle pass with extra progression built in without explaining that has left some fans complaining of a cash grab.
</p>
<p>
At the very least, it's a bizarre situation that could have been better explained - something Niantic itself has seemingly now realised, as it issued a <a href="https://x.com/NianticHelp/status/1894092647981072499">clarification notice via the game's Support social media account</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Trainers, we want to clarify the Tour Pass experience during the Road to Unova event. You can earn a capped amount of Pass Points per day from Monday to Friday to get a head start on your Tour Pass," Niantic wrote. 
</p>
<p>
"During Go Tour Global weekend, the Pass Point limits will be removed and you will have the opportunity to obtain an unlimited amount of points during the event."
</p>
<p>
The forthcoming event is one of Niantic's most heavily-monetised in-game weekends ever, with the following tickets available:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-masterwork-research-a-dazzling-aria-quest-steps-rewards-how-to-get-shiny-meloetta-9505">Masterwork quest for Shiny Meloetta</a> - £4.99</li>
<li>Tour Pass Deluxe - £14.99</li>
<li>Tour Pass Deluxe + 10 Levels - £19.99</li>
<li>Road to Unova: Raids Ticket - £4.99</li>
<li>Road to Unova: Hatch Ticket - £4.99</li>
</ul>

<p>
Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-developer-close-to-selling-games-for-35bn-to-saudi-owned-monopoly-go-maker-report">it was reported that Niantic was in negotiations with the Saudi-backed mobile giant Scopely</a>, developer of Monopoly Go and Marvel Strike Force, over a sale of the still hugely lucrative Pokémon Go. 
</p>
<p>
The news was met with shock by members of the Pokémon Go community, based on the aggressive monetisation added by Scopely to other games it has acquired. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-fans-launch-campaign-to-protect-games-future-as-concerns-mount-over-sale">Fans have since begun contacting the overall owner of the Pokémon franchise to share their concerns</a>.

			<p>A new Final Fantasy VII Rebirth mod released today introduces a new handy feature that allows players to add more characters to their active combat party, including those not normally available and that never actually join the party during the course of the game.</p>
<p>The Party Mod Menu, developed by Braklinath and now available for download on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/530?tab=description">Nexus Mods</a>, adds an in-game menu to change the party members that participate in battle, making it possible to make every available character an active combat character, change the party leader and add characters that do not join the party during the course of the game, including Sephiroth, Zack, Cid, and Vincent. Having any of these four characters in the party, however, can lead to issues outside of combat, and even in combat, as the game even locks up if either Cid or Vincent are in the active combat party, which is not surprising since the two characters were never meant to be playable in Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. In case you want to check out how the mod works before downloading it, you can watch a video showcase provided by the mod's developer below.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/618709/steam-deck-3-year-anniversary-handheld-gaming-shipments-idc<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Today is the third anniversary of Valve’s Steam Deck, the handheld gaming PC that all but created the market for handheld gaming PCs. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22950371/valve-steam-deck-review">It was a mess to start</a>! But three years later, <em>The Verge </em>has data showing how it has dominated the nascent market. While Valve told us in November 2023 that it had<a href="http://its competitors have stacked up"> sold “multiple millions”</a> of the AMD-powered handheld, we’ve never had a good glimpse at how big it is or how Windows competitors stack up… till now. It seems the Steam Deck, so far, has been bigger than all its competitors combined.</p><p>Market research firm IDC uses supply chains to estimate just how many handheld gaming systems have shipped around the world, and creates <a href="https://www.idc.com/getdoc.jsp?containerId=US50814724">spending forecasts</a>. When I asked IDC market research analyst Lewis Ward if he’d be willing to isolate SteamOS and Windows gaming handhelds from that data, he said yes.</p><p>So here are the estimated combined shipments of the Steam Deck, and the Windows-based Asus ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go, and MSI Claw from 2022 through 2024, and an estimate for 2025:</p><div><table><thead><tr><th><h3>2022</h3></th><th><h3>2023</h3></th><th><h3>2024</h3></th><th><h3>2025 (Estimate)</h3></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1,620,000</td><td>2,867,000</td><td>1,485,000</td><td>1,926,000</td></tr></tbody></table><div><p><cite><em>Combined Valve Steam Deck, Asus ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go, and MSI Claw. Figures include all SKUs in associated hardware families.</em></cite></p></div></div><p>Add it up, and that’s just under 6 million shipments in three years. One way to view that: it’s small and it’s not really growing. IDC’s forecasting under 2 million shipments in 2025, rather than any major expansion.</p><p>Another is that it’s simply early days for the category: Meta’s Ray-Bans only <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/613292/meta-ray-ban-2-million-10-million-capacity-subscription-essilor-luxottica-earnings">sold 2 million pairs</a> between October 2023 and February 2025, but its maker is taking that as a sign it could soon sell 10 million <em>each</em> year.</p><p>“I think it’s amazing,” AMD gaming marketing boss Frank Azor tells me, discussing IDC’s numbers for handheld gaming PCs. “This didn’t exist three years ago; we went from nothing, zero, to incremental category creation in the millions of units.”</p><p>But out of those 6 million shipments, the lion’s share have been the Steam Deck itself, according to IDC’s estimates. All of the 2022 shipments are the Steam Deck, and Ward tells me upwards of 50 percent of the 2023 shipments and 48 percent of the 2024 shipments are the Deck as well. Doing the math, Valve has now shipped upwards of 3.7 million Steam Decks and has quite possibly crossed 4 million by now.</p><p>(Note: IDC’s numbers do not currently include Chinese handhelds from companies like GPD, Ayaneo and OneXPlayer, though it seems possible they are small players based on their public backer numbers on Indiegogo.)</p><p>With as few as 2 million Windows handhelds shipping in two years, it’s not a <em>huge</em> surprise <a href="http://The Z2 line is similarly a set of tweaked laptop chips">that AMD and Intel aren’t spending big on more custom chips</a> like the one that’s still working perfectly well for the Steam Deck — particularly if the rumors are true that early Windows handheld buyers returned their purchases at unusually high rates. (Anecdotally, I’ve seen lots of open-box stock of the Asus ROG Ally when I’ve looked at Best Buy online and in-person.)</p><p>But I hope AMD will invest in making that Steam Deck lightning strike again. Because when every other low-power gaming chip is originally aimed at laptops rather than handhelds, we get disappointments like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/617613/lenovo-legion-go-s-review-feels-good-plays-bad#comments">the new Lenovo Legion Go S</a>, which couldn’t stand up to the three-year-old Steam Deck’s one-year-old OLED revision in my review, or the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24105991/msi-claw-review">original MSI Claw</a>. Or, we get pretty good handhelds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">like the ROG Ally X </a>that offset power hungry chips with a bigass battery, but cost $800 or more.</p><p>Not that chips are the <em>only</em> reason the Steam Deck has come this far, not by a long shot! It’s the combination of Valve’s pick-up-and-play SteamOS — which lets you simply press a button to easily sleep and resume — and its Proton compatibility layer and precompiled shaders that, incredibly, often make Windows games run on Linux better than they run on Windows. Then there’s its infinitely customizable and comfortable controls that make decades of older games playable.</p><p>It’s also the price — think console, not gaming laptop — and how incredibly easy Valve makes it to temporarily tweak performance in exchange for more battery life, and how many additional things you can do with a Steam Deck if you try. (Epic Games Store and Ubisoft and even Blizzard games are playable if you jump through a couple hoops; it can easily stream your PlayStation with the Chiaki app you can find in the Linux desktop app browser, letting the handheld double as a PlayStation Portal.)</p><div><p>No other shipping handheld has come close, and while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/30/24329005/bazzite-asus-rog-ally-x-steam-os-editorial">a combination of the Asus ROG Ally X and the SteamOS not-quite-a-fork Bazzite</a> can feel like the best of both worlds, you’ll pay twice the price of an entry level Steam Deck to get it.</p></div><p>I mistakenly thought the most important handheld at CES 2025 was the Lenovo Legion Go S, because Valve’s Steam Deck designers had given it their blessing to become <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338028/lenovo-legion-go-s-steam-windows">the first authorized third-party SteamOS handheld</a>, but I was wrong. Here’s how I ended my Legion Go S review: “If you’re waiting for a $499 Legion Go S with SteamOS, here’s my advice: just buy <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">a $530 Steam Deck OLED</a> instead.”</p><div><p>While it’s true that new triple-A PC games now require more power than the Steam Deck can comfortably give you, Valve has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/21/24275604/dont-expect-a-new-steam-deck-to-drop-each-year">consistently said</a> that it will <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23884863/valve-steam-deck-2-refresh-upgrade-cpu-2025">wait until it can provide a “leap”</a> in performance without sacrificing battery life before it introduces a Steam Deck 2, and that it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24337300/amd-ryzen-z2-z2-extreme-z2-go">won’t be using this year’s AMD Z2 chips.</a></p></div><p>Between that promise, the many excellent new games that <em>do</em> target Steam Deck, the high prices of new Nvidia GPUs, and the idea that new Microsoft and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/25/24305337/sony-handheld-gaming-console-playstation-nintendo-microsoft">Sony handhelds</a> are<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295461/dont-expect-an-xbox-handheld-any-time-soon"> likely a few years away</a>, I don’t think there are all that many reasons to wait to buy today’s Steam Deck — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24351383/handheld-pcs-challenge-switch-2-editorial">unless the Nintendo Switch 2</a> somehow supplants the Steam Deck as the handheld that game developers prefer to target with games.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Activision has confirmed some in-game content in Call of Duty has been created using generative AI.</p>
<p>As spotted by Call of Duty account CharlieIntel, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1938090/Call_of_Duty/">Steam page</a> for the game's launcher (incorporating <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a>, Modern Warfare 3, and Warzone) has been updated with a new AI notice, as per the rules of Steam.</p>
<p>"Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in-game assets," it reads.</p>

<p>No further details are specified, but fans are already speculating where AI has been used.</p>
<p>"We could tell lmao this loading screen had six fingers," reads one reply, referring to the zombie artwork used last Christmas (above). <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-block-ops-6-players-accuse-activision-of-using-ai-slop">Players accused Activision at the time</a> of using "AI slop".</p>

But as <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/">Wired reported in 2024</a>, the rise in using generative AI for in-game assets has followed the loss of jobs across the games industry.</p>

            <p>A new story trailer for the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lies-of-p">Lies Of P</a> Overture expansion shows us more of the "legendary stalker" the player will be following through the snowy surroundings of Krat. The lore is served up raw with a heavy garnishing of opaque chatter that explains absolutely nothing. But I hear that's how you cook a soulslike story. Come watch and see if you can understand more of the stalker's words than I do. You probably will if you recognise the classical tune playing underneath it all.</p>

<p>The track that plays during the trailer is a classical cover of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FRdRx1OMpJQ">"Feel"</a> from the base game, which you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzlQlUtlQ40">play on gramophone in-game</a>. It's described in lore-ish item notes as a "a song that quietly comforts the dark." I haven't played Lies Of P, so I don't know if the song is significant to the game's story in any other way, or if this is just the developers capitalising on a fan favourite from the original soundtrack (let me know). Either way, it's a nice tune.</p>
<p>The DLC will see you following and fighting alongside a swordswoman dressed in what looks like an officer's cavalry uniform of the era. This stalker and the puppety protagonist seem to be out of sync in one part of the trailer, but come together at the end to stand in front of a manor that might be the Rose Estate - a charity house for orphans that was teased in the base game. It's possible this prequel expansion will investigate the <a href="https://lies-of-p.fandom.com/wiki/Rose_Estate_Incident,_Left_As_A_Mystery">shady goings-on</a> of that building.</p>
<p>The expansion was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-the-absence-of-bloodborne-on-pc-we-get-a-snowy-expansion-for-lies-of-p">announced a couple of weeks ago with a boss-dripping trailer</a> during PlayStation's State of Play event. It's due to be released some time in summer this year, we're told. I like to think that Ed (RPS in peace) is out there somewhere, looking at this and wondering if it's worth dipping back into the world of Belle Époque marionettes. He liked the game a lot <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lies-of-p-review">when he reviewed it</a>. Alas, I cannot know his feelings. We cannot cross the bounds of time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<div><p>Taking to LinkedIn, Quantic Dream CEO Guillaume de Fondaumière made a statement on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-studio-closures-dozen-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent layoffs and studio closures</a> from NetEase saying,</p><p>“We were deeply saddened to learn about the recent layoffs and studio closures affecting some of the NetEase group’s divisions. Our thoughts are with everyone impacted, and we sincerely hope that they quickly find new opportunities.</p><p>David Cage and I would like to express our gratitude to the fans and friends who have reached out to us in recent days regarding QUANTIC DREAM. We want to reassure everyone that our studios in Paris and Montreal remain unaffected. We are continuing to develop our projects at full pace, with several open positions available in both locations (please visit <a href="https://lnkd.in/e_AJFbUa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">https://lnkd.in/e_AJFbUa</a> for more details).</p><p>Founded 28 years ago, QUANTIC DREAM remains committed to the strategy outlined by David and I in 2019, when NetEase initially acquired a minority stake in our company. Over the past six years, NetEase has been a dedicated partner, providing us with creative freedom and the financial resources necessary for our studio to grow and strive. In 2022, QUANTIC DREAM became a wholly owned subsidiary of NetEase, aligning with our shared vision for the future.</p><p>In 2024, we achieved the highest revenue in our history, driven by the exceptional performance of our back-catalogue titles. Notably, Detroit: Become Human reached 11 million units in global sales across PlayStation and PC last year, a remarkable 2 million increase year-on-year, demonstrating the lasting appeal and quality of our titles. The developments of our current projects are progressing as planned, and we are fully committed to delivering and launching these innovative, high-quality titles in the future.”</p></div>



<p>Quantic Dream is currently developing several new games, it’s biggest of which is Star Wars Eclipse. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-eclipse-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming reported earlier this year</a>&nbsp;that Star Wars Eclipse was targeting a 2026 release date, but was struggling to find to hire staff following allegations of workplace issues, including&nbsp;sexual harassment, crunch, and toxic work culture.</p>



<p>Star Wars Eclipse is described as, “a new action-adventure, multiple-character branching narrative game set in the&nbsp;High Republic era&nbsp;of the iconic<em>&nbsp;Star Wars</em>™ galaxy.” In September 2023, Quantic Dream’s Vice President of development said that the game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-eclipse-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“simmering” in development</a>.</p>

			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds comes on consoles with some evident technical issues, and it seems like even on PlayStation 5 Pro, the game's performance and image quality are disappointing, with bad PSSR implementation to boot.</p>
<p>French outlet <a href="https://www.gamersyde.com/news_gsy_preview_monster_hunter_wilds_sur_ps5_pro-23907_fr.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamerSyde</a> recently posted an early analysis of the PlayStation 5 Pro version of the game, highlighting how the game on the premium Sony hardware still forces players to choose between different display modes and how Resolution mode still targets 30 FPS without any option to disable ray tracing for additional performance without providing a true 4K experience, as this mode uses PSSR to upscale a native resolution of 3072 x 1728p to 4K. Even with the additional raw power offered by the PlayStation 5 Pro, Resolution mode still cannot keep a steady 30 FPS, with frequent drops that the outlet thinks are caused by incorrect frame pacing.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds Balanced and Performance modes on PlayStation 5 Pro are also quite disappointing. The former targets a slightly lower resolution than Resolution mode, 2496 x 1404p, with again no option to disable ray tracing, which makes the framerate jump way too much, resulting in a far from optimal experience even on a VRR display and uneven image quality. Performance mode, on the other hand, manages to hit its 60 FPS target, but at a huge cost in terms of image quality, as PSSR struggles to upscale to 4K resolution properly from the mode's 1080p resolution, delivering unstable image quality, especially in areas with a lot of vegetation, bad texture quality and more. As such, it definitely looks like the game is a few patches away from delivering a solid experience on PlayStation 5 Pro.</p>
<p>It is a shame that Monster Hunter Wilds doesn't seem to run well on <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-720p-ps5-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">any format</a>, as the game is a more than worthy new entry in the series thanks to its new combat mechanics and a more streamlined experience that makes it easier than ever to remain on the field going from hunt to hunt without having to return to base camp too often. You can learn more about the game in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-delta-force-platforms%E2%80%94black-hawk-down-playstation-xbox-and-pc-status-explained.1118103/</guid>

<p>Delta Force is back with a full-scale release in 2025. Its platforms are the big topic of conversation with eager gun-toting, first-person shooter enthusiasts eager to satisfy their trigger finger.</p>



<p>Developer Team Jade has been working hard to ensure 2025’s Delta Force is up to the task. It’s part of the less-heralded shooter series but demands the same respect. The title has been through rigorous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-into-the-delta-force-hawk-ops-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alpha</a> and beta testing. It was finally released on January 20 to acclaim—with many fans loving the shooter’s tough and gritty feel.</p>



<p>Delta Force is officially out, but we’re here to let you know which platforms it’s on.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-delta-force-on-pc-can-you-play-black-hawk-down">Is Delta Force on PC? Can You Play Black Hawk Down?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Time to go loud. Credit to Team Jade</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Delta Force is available to buy on PC through Steam and the Epic Games Store. You can play the free-to-play Black Hawk Down Campaign.</strong></p>



<p>All of the early testing for <a href="https://www.playdeltaforce.com/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delta Force</a> was conducted through PC. It’s only fitting the full release arrived on PC too. It seems likely any content—at the very least—is coming to PC before anywhere else.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delta Force Black Hawk Down Campaign</a> is the perfect example of this.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-delta-force-on-playstation-can-you-play-black-hawk-down">Is Delta Force on PlayStation? Can You Play Black Hawk Down?</h2>



<p><strong>Delta Force is coming to PlayStation at some point in the future, unfortunately, it’s not available to play on either PlayStation 4 or PlayStation 5 for the time being—which means no Black Hawk Down Campaign for now.</strong></p>



<p>The first quarter of 2025 is when Delta Force was supposed to be released on PlayStation. However, complications have arisen in the game’s development, causing the developer to delay the console launch.</p>



<p>A new release period hasn’t been confirmed as yet. One of the Team Jade staff declared in a <a href="https://x.com/ZeeUltra_/status/1892589196952359064" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">video</a> that “input fairness” on console was one of the key factors in the postponement. It remains to be seen how much longer PlayStation users need to wait for an update on a Delta Force platform update.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-delta-force-on-xbox-can-you-play-black-hawk-down">Is Delta Force on Xbox? Can You Play Black Hawk Down?</h2>



<p><strong>Like PlayStation, a Delta Force Xbox release is assured, but development constraints have forced its release date—and subsequently Black Hawk Down Campaign content—to be postponed.</strong></p>



<p>It’s an identical situation for Xbox users. The issue relating to inputs and aiming equally applies to Xbox as it’s also a console issue—breaking things down as simply as I can. Keep checking back to this guide as we will update once we hear when Delta Force is finally coming to Xbox consoles.</p>



<hr>



<p>Does Delta Force have the pedigree to compete with other military shooters such as Call of Duty or the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Battlefield</a> game? Are you downloading it for consoles on day one when the time comes? Let us know.</p>



<p>The game has undergone significant changes for sure. Not only is it no longer called <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-hawk-ops-name-change/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hawk Ops</a>, but its Black Hawk Down Campaign means business—even if it is considered “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-black-hawk-down-mostly-negative/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Too difficult</a>.”</p>

Bloober said Konami will continue as both the publisher and rights holder of the mystery game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb from Bloober CEO Piotr Babieno:</p><blockquote>Konami, a legendary name in the gaming industry, sought a partner who could breathe new life into one of its most iconic franchises — Silent Hill. Bloober Team was selected for their expertise in horror and atmospheric storytelling, and in 2021, both companies signed a partnership agreement. In October 2022, during the official Silent Hill Transmission livestream, it was announced that Bloober Team was working on a remake of Silent Hill 2, widely regarded as one of the best psychological horror games in history. </blockquote><blockquote>The success of the remake proved that Bloober Team had perfectly captured the atmosphere and depth of the original while introducing crucial innovations. The game was well-received by players, earning an 86/100 rating on Metacritic and an 88/100 on OpenCritic, along with numerous awards, including Game of the Year 2024 from IGN Japan and Best Horror Game of the Year from the IGN Community Awards.</blockquote><blockquote>The trust built upon the success of Silent Hill 2 laid the foundation for signing another agreement for a new project. The deal aligns with Bloober Team’s strategic plan to expand its internal development division within a first-party framework. </blockquote><blockquote>Our collaboration with Konami has been incredibly fruitful, and the success of Silent Hill 2 speaks for itself. By sharing knowledge and experience, we have been able to create high-quality production together. Of course, we can't reveal too many details at this time, but we are confident that fans will be just as excited about our collaboration as we are. We can't wait to share something truly special with players when the time is right.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill 2 remake went on sale on PlayStation 5 and PC via Steam on October 8, 2024 (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-console-exclusive-to-ps5-for-1-year"><u>there’s no word on an Xbox Series X and S version</u></a> yet), and just a few days later <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-sells-1-million-copies-in-less-than-a-week"><u>had sold one million copies</u></a>.

            <p>Activision is continuing to tease the return of Tony Hawk and the Pro Skater series.</p>
<p>A new social media post from the official game account reads: "Loading... new parks. 3/4/25".</p>
<p>The date matches a countdown on the <a href="https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/">game's website</a>, but it's the "new parks" reference that has fans speculating. Does this mean a brand new game is on the way? Is it an expansion to the existing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2</a> remake? Or is a remake combining <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</a> and 4 on the way? The latter would certainly match the date.</p>

<p>The social post also includes an image of Tony Hawk, and another with skaters Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Tony Hawk, Rodney Mullen, and Eric Koston.</p>

<p>The news follows other hints from Activision last week. Along with the website countdown, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-announcement-teased-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-latest-map">tease for a new Tony Hawk game was included in Call of Duty</a>.</p>
<p>Specifically, a remastered version of Black Ops 2's skatepark-themed multiplayer map, Grind, was added in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>'s Season 02 Reloaded update.</p>
<p>And along with the skatepark theme is a TV screen showing the date 03.04.25. This refers to the 4th March, in US date styling.</p>
<p>Before that, professional skateboarder <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mystery-tony-hawk-remaster-now-mentioned-by-pro-skater-involved-in-the-game-even-though-activision-hasnt-announced-it-yet">Tyshawn Jones let slip he's included in a forthcoming, unannounced Tony Hawk game</a>.</p>
<p>In short, it's only six days until we find out exactly what Activision is teasing. What are you hoping for?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Bloober Team, the development studio behind the excellent Silent Hill 2 remake, confirmed its collaboration with Konami will continue with a new game that is currently in development.</p>
<p>In a new message shared on its<a href="https://blooberteam.prowly.com/383560-bloober-team-and-konami-continue-their-collaboration" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> official website</a>, the Polish development team confirmed they are continuing their partnership with Konami, announcing the signing of a new agreement for a joint project. This new project is based on an unspecified Konami IP. Like with the Silent Hill 2 remake, Konami will once again be the new game's publisher and rights holder.</p>
<p>While neither the Silent Hill 2 remake developer nor Konami has added any hint as to which IP the new project will be based on, as Bloober Team is known to be a horror games developer, there's a very good chance the Polish studio will be working on the series again. While a remake of the iconic first entry in the series would be quite welcome by many, myself included, it would also be interesting to see what Bloober would do with the franchise if given the freedom to develop a new entry in the series.</p>
<p>No matter what Bloober Team will do, the studio has proved it has what it takes to create an extremely compelling horror experience with the Silent Hill 2 remake.

They're also going to develop "a more granular set of classification criteria" for games that reference gambling, to distinguish jingling parodies of rentier capitalism from the one arm bandits found in actual casinos.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
To catch you up, Balatro was pulled from certain digital stores in March last year after it was recategorised as an 18+ game. In a <a href="https://x.com/PlaystackGames/status/1763614758043795909">statement</a>, the publishers attributed this to an unspecified rating's board "mistaken belief that the game 'contains prominent gambling imagery and materials that instructs about gambling'". In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1bdtmlg/ama_i_am_localthunk_developer_and_artist_for/">comments on Reddit</a> shortly after, the game's developer Localthunk confirmed that the ratings board in question was PEGI. "I still believe that the rating is unwarranted, but there is some grey area for interpretation from PEGI and at this point it is what it is," he wrote. "I think the one thing I am most disappointed by is the fact that other games with actual gambling mechanics aren't rated the same way because of their appearance/theme."</p>
<p>Luck Be A Landlord, meanwhile, was <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/googles-inconsistent-app-store-stance-on-gambling-comes-under-fire/">banned from Google Play in 13 countries</a> in August 2023 after the game was found to be in violation of the platform's policies about gambling. In January this year, Google <a href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-luck-landlord-google-play-store-gambling-mobile-1851731303">threatened to ban the game globally</a> unless developers TrampolineTales updated its listing to specify that it "contains gambling".
</p>
<p>
All of which may seem ridiculous if you've played either game. To draw some basic distinctions, Balatro features poker cards and poker-style mechanics, but does not involve the wagering of real money, and is fundamentally a deckbuilding roguelike featuring Tarot cards and bizarre Joker modifiers. Luck Be A Landlord, meanwhile, uses a slot machine format for the purposes of satire, and again doesn't involve the wagering of real money.</p>
<p>I can, however, see the case for being suspicious of either game, both because there are superficial correspondences with casino machines and so forth, and because video game reward and randomisation systems at large have a certain kinship with gambling. Games like EA's football trading card sim Ultimate Team thrive on microtransaction and lootbox mechanics that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/meet-the-men-hiding-their-fifa-ultimate-team-addiction-from-their-families">may lead to addiction</a>, but you don't have to be pouring in hard cash to get hooked.
</p>
<p>
PEGI now <a href="https://pegi.info/news/pegi-complaints-board-amends-classifications-balatro-and-luck-be-landlord-pegi-12">agree</a> with the criticism of each game's 18 rating. Regarding Balatro, the complaints board have "concluded that, although the game explains the various hands of poker, the roguelike deck-building game contained mitigating fantastical elements that warranted a PEGI 12 rating." As for Luck Be A Landlord, they've similarly reasoned that "although the game features a slot machine mechanic, there were no specific transferable gambling skills and the game can therefore be rated PEGI 12."
</p>
<p>
They're also planning to revise their rating system a little to make finer distinctions between, say, games that depict poker and games in which you actually play poker for cash rewards. "The PEGI system continuously evolves in line with cultural expectations and the guidance of independent experts who support our assessment process," the statement continues. "PEGI strives to apply ratings criteria fairly, consistently, and transparently to ensure that audiences understand the type of content that is present in games.
</p>
<p>
"At this moment, any teaching or glamorisation of simulated gambling automatically leads to a PEGI 18 rating," it goes on. "On the basis of these appeals, the PEGI Experts Group will develop a more granular set of classification criteria to handle gambling themes and the simulation, teaching and glamorisation of gambling in different age categories, which will now include 12 but also keep 18 as an age category for games that simulate gambling typically played in casinos and betting halls."
</p>
<p>
I like that Balatro and Luck Be A Landlord are no longer being filed alongside the sweaty fruit machines that line the toilet queue at Weatherspoons. That said, I am naturally a little wary of the possibility that PEGI might compromise too much with companies who attempt to split hairs between "simulation, teaching and glamorisation". As Nic put it in Slack just now, it's easy to imagine less scrupulous publishers "trying to ludonarrative the fuck out of their lootboxes" and piling on "mitigating" elements so as to get their gambling experiences into the hands of kiddies. I'm interested to read a breakdown of PEGI's new criteria, once they've finalised it.

		<p>Tron: Catalyst, the new game from Bithell Games, publisher Big Fan and Disney, has a release date, this digital world thriller coming to Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch and PC on 17th June 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="TRON: Catalyst - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IDRwx2qK-74?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The new trailer gave us a closer look at Exo, the game’s protagonist, who’s found herself with the cursed gift of being able to perceive the glitch that is affecting the Arq Grid, letting her loop time back around on itself, and lending her unique abilities in combat. Glitches will allow you the ability to roll back time, rewinding events and using time loops that only you can see to uncover secret areas and shortcuts, as well as manipulate the factions in the game’s story.</p>
<p>It’s a Bithell game, so you know that one of the strengths is going to be the narrative – the studio previously explored the setting with the well-received Tron: Identity visual novel – though they’re getting back to creating something a bit more action-oriented. There’s various factions looking to hunt Exo down, such as the Peacekeepers and the malevolent prgram Conn, both of which are hot on Exo’s heels throughout.</p>

<p>And it wouldn’t be a Tron game without a bit of Light Cycle action, would it? The demo shows off some Light Cycle exploration in the city of Vertical Slice.</p>

<p>I’ve been trying the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2977620/Squirreled_Away/">demo</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/squirreled-away">Squirreled Away</a>, and for some reason it keeps wanting me to play it as some kinda 2024-as-heck <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> crafting game. At this, I make several rapid sniffing-like movements, then scarper adeptly yet dismissively up the nearest tree. It’s just far more fun to treat this as a casual squirrel sim, or, at the very least, a platformer where you occasionally need to steal some strawberries.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Look, I’ve played enough <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a> to appreciate the pleasures of hewing a home together from Mother Gaia’s offcuts. But Squirreled Away’s scavenging and building don’t really do anything to explore beyond familiar stick-to-plank-to-hut tropes, even with the briefly amusing sight of your fluffy protagonist lugging a tiny rock axe on his back. It’s not like you’re crafting to survive anything, either: there are no elements to endure and the only consequence of letting your stamina run out is an inability to swing your tools. No enemies to be scared of either, unless you’re that American cop who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MZPplp7wGso">magdumped an acorn</a>.</p>

<p>Instead, I recommend using what the demo gives you for gathering purposes – a roamable forest, freeform climbing abilities, zero fall damage – to engage in a spot of chilled-out tree rat parkour. Now <em>this</em> is a good time. There’s a perfectly judged stickiness to how you latch on to bark and branches, and many of the latter look like they were placed specifically for daring cross-canopy leaps. Screenshots for the full game present the tantalising possibility of eventually gaining a dinky hang glider, which might be the one thing in all of existence that could get me back to crafting. You will believe a squirrel can fly.</p>
<p>Down on the ground, the capacity for hijinks is diminished, though I did a smile at my expectedly terrible attempts to strum a guitar, and at how readily I could destroy camping equipment in pursuit of rare golden nuts. Squirreled Away definitely leans further towards cosiness than chaos – it’s not exactly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/squirrel-with-a-gun">Squirrel With a Gun</a>, with or without the gun – but it also has a mischievous side that’s at least passingly fun to explore. When, again, you’re not filling a recipe checklist of twigs and pebbles.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The project will be a "new game based on Konami's IP" - the specifics are unknown, but considering Bloober's horror pedigree and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-tops-one-million-copies-sold-in-less-than-a-week">Silent Hill 2 success</a>, a new game in that franchise seems like a safe bet.</p>
<p>"Our collaboration with Konami has been incredibly fruitful, and the success of Silent Hill 2 speaks for itself," said Piotr Babieno, CEO of Bloober Team. "By sharing knowledge and experience, we have been able to create high-quality production together. Of course, we can't reveal too many details at this time, but we are confident that fans will be just as excited about our collaboration as we are. We can't wait to share something truly special with players when the time is right."</p>

<p>Reads a press release on the news: "The trust built upon the success of Silent Hill 2 laid the foundation for signing another agreement for a new project. The deal aligns with Bloober Team's strategic plan to expand its internal development division within a first-party framework."</p>
<p>Konami's IP includes the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a>, Castlevania, eFootball, Bomberman, and Suikoden, though Silent Hill does seem the most likely candidate for Bloober.</p>
<p>The Polish studio's next game has already been announced, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-bloober-is-following-silent-hill-2-with-its-first-original-survival-horror-cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn being the company's first original survival horror game</a>.</p>
<p>"We are super happy for the [Silent Hill] team, for the accomplishments, and I do believe that they paved the path for us," Cronos co-director Wojciech Piejko told Eurogamer. "They dramatically changed the reception of our company on the internet from 'Bloober should not touch Silent Hill' to 'new great game from Bloober!'</p>
<p>"I'm super thankful for them and I know it wasn't easy to survive all these critics on the internet. You always have to remember there are people behind every game. It doesn't make your work easier. So kudos for [the team], because they made the impossible possible with making Silent Hill."</p>
<p>Konami announced a number of Silent Hill games back in 2022, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-f-announced-from-resident-evil-reverse-developer">Silent Hill f</a> perhaps the most anticipated.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Digital Sun dropped a new trailer and a new announcement for Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault last night, showing off more of the game, and confirming that it will launch day one into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> when it arrives for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault | A New Journey Unfolds" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/slC6c8E40-A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Moonlighter 2, players will once again step into Will’s shoes to explore, collect treasure, and run a shop to make some money selling his finds. Will will be joined by companions to rebuild the village of Tresna, along with his shop, to make it a thriving place again. Where is Tresna, though? Well, it’s where Will and his companions have found themselves trapped in a dimension far from home. The ultimate goal of the game is to find a way to get back.</p>
<p>Moonlighter 2 builds on the same two-sided game design of the original, managing and curating a shop during the day and then adventuring at night. It jumps beyond the original game with a new full 3D isometric look, with the new trailer showing both the new hometown and shop that you’ll need to keep stocked with sellable goodies.</p>
<p>There’s an exapnded arsenal of weapons and gear to use when adventuring, as well as a fresh batch of biomes to battle through and enemies to overcome.</p>

<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/28/moonlighter-review/">Moonlighter review</a> from back in 2018 – it’s been that long?! – Jason said, “Moonlighter is an incredibly enjoyable jaunt through some interesting ideas and some fun fights. While the combat gets a little easy as you progress, the fun of watching money pour in as you play is immensely satisfying. It would be nice if there was more reason to play after completion as is normally the case with roguelites, but equally having an actual conclusion is a breath of fresh air for the genre. It is a lot of fun and one that will keep you entertained for a fair while if you want to sink your time into it.”</p>

<p>As you can see, the lady in red has returned. The snarky sister will be released April 3rd (or March 31st for those who buy the whole season pass in advance). She's the first character of the fighting game's season 2 DLC, with another three biff-buddies to follow - one in summer, another in autumn, and the final fisticuffer in winter. Two new stages are also due to be added in this DLC. </p>
<p>Anna is a long-running Tekken fighter characterised by a love for bazookas and a hatred of her sister and fellow Iron Fist contender Nina. She likes espresso, red wine, and the mouse Jerry from Tom And Jerry cartoons. I'm not making this up for a gag. It is what the <a href="https://tekken.fandom.com/wiki/Anna_Williams">always-entertaining Tekken wiki</a> says about her. I don't play as this character, or her sister Nina, so I'm not fully clued in about her high-heel headstomps and gut-blasting gunshots, or her various somersaults and scissorkicks, but the trailer shows a lot of familiar-looking launchers, feints, and open-handed chops. I like her new hairdo.</p>
<p>Tekken 8 has been out for a year now, and Bandai Namco are boasting that they've sold three million copies. That's three million people who want to beat you up - you must have really annoyed them. I thought this instalment was pretty good when I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tekken-8-review">battered my opponents and never ever lost in our review</a>. Although I was disappointed none of my favourite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken-7">Tekken 7</a> characters were available at launch. One year on we still haven't seen signs of bull-fighting Spanish reprobate Miguel or tearful shin-cracker Josie. I'm not confident the latter will return, but I hold onto hope for my other favourite, Lei Wulong. In Tekken 7 the kung fu cop was released relatively early as DLC goes. I'd love to see him this year too. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> publisher Ubisoft has responded to the leak of story details and gameplay footage from its upcoming samurai stabathon, a month ahead of the game's release date.
</p>
<p>
This past weekend, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/careful-of-spoilers-assassins-some-fans-are-playing-assassins-creed-shadows-early">photos posted online showed several fans now had access to early physical copies of Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, while others claimed to have briefly been able to download a digital version of the game from the PlayStation Store.
</p>
<p>
Chunks of gameplay footage are now easily findable online, even as Ubisoft battles to remove the videos. Other fans have posted summaries of their time with the game so far, including story spoilers. And there's still weeks to go until Assassin's Creed Shadows' 20th March launch date.

"We are aware players have accessed Assassin's Creed Shadows ahead of its official release," Ubisoft said in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1ixdc8d/a_message_from_the_assassins_creed_community_team/">message from the Assassin's Creed community team, posted to reddit</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"The development team is still working on patches to prepare the experience for launch and any footage shared online does not represent the final quality of the game."
</p>
<p>
Physical copies of the game were likely manufactured weeks if not months ago, while Ubisoft will continue to issue patches up to and beyond the game's street date in March. That said, fans report not seeing too many issues with the game so far.
</p>
<p>
"Leaks are unfortunate and can diminish the excitement for players," Ubisoft's statement continues. "We kindly ask you not to spoil the experience for others. Thank you to our community for already taking steps to protect everyone from spoilers.
</p>
<p>
"Stay in the shadows, avoid the spoilers, and keep an eye on our channel for more official surprises in the coming weeks!  20th March will be here soon!"
</p>
<p>
It's been a long wait for Assassin's Creed fans, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-as-ubisoft-explores-sale">repeated delays from the game's original launch date</a> late last year. Shadows is the first new Assassin's Creed game since 2023's Mirage, which was originally planned as an expansion for 2020's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a>.
</p>
<p>
The game's launch comes amidst a pivotal few months for Ubisoft, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-acknowledges-buyout-reports-stating-it-regularly-reviews-options">the company looks poised to be sold or taken private</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-pre-orders-solid-in-line-with-series-second-biggest-launch">the threat of further layoffs loom</a>.
</p>
<p>Eurogamer's Katharine Castle recently reported back after playing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/six-hours-with-assassins-creed-shadows-the-biggest-shake-up-of-the-series-in-years">six hours of Assassin's Creed Shadows, calling it the biggest shake-up of the series in years</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>DC boss James Gunn has confirmed he's in talks with both Rocksteady and NetherRealm to develop new games in the DC Universe.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/james-gunns-new-plan-to-unify-dc-universe-includes-labelling-non-canon-games-as-dc-elseworlds">Gunn laid out his plans for the DC Universe back in 2023</a>, which would combine films, TV series and video games into a singular canon universe - much like Marvel has done.</p>
<p>Now, in a recent DC Studios event attended by <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/new-dc-games-netherrealm-rocksteady-batman-arkham-injustice-3/">ComicBook</a>, Gunn and his co-CEO Peter Safran confirmed they're in close talks with the two Warner Bros game studios.</p>

<p>"We work incredibly closely with JB Perrette who runs that division," said Safran. "It's really the first time it's ever been this way at Warner Bros. James and I sit with the guys that run the studios under JB whether it's NetherRealm or Rocksteady. We sit with them and we talk about characters and stories that we're interested in and that they're interested in."</p>
<p>Added Gunn: "We see designs for the projects in their very earliest stages. We talk about those, we talk about what the story might be and we'll say 'Well, maybe you want to go this way because we're planning on maybe doing something with <em>this </em>character'."</p>
<p>There are no details yet on what these games will be, or which characters they'll focus on, with Gunn stating it will be a "couple years" from now when we finally see for ourselves.</p>
<p>Later this year DC will release its new film incarnation of Superman, so could we finally see a decent game adaptation in the future to follow up? There will also be The Batman Part 2 in 2027, while in 2026 there are film plans for Supergirl and Clayface. Could these hint towards game plans?</p>
<p>NetherRealm most recently released <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a>, with the last in its DC fighting series <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/injustice-2">Injustice 2</a> released back in 2017. Rocksteady, meanwhile, released the ill-fated <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> last year.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-has-a-new-single-player-batman-game-in-development-teases-new-report">Rocksteady is "looking to return to Batman for a single-player game"</a>, though it's "years away" from release.</p>
<p>Of course, there's also the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wonder-woman-games-reportedly-still-years-away-from-release-if-it-ever-launches-at-all">Wonder Woman game already in development from Monolith</a>, though it remains years away from release.</p>
<p>In further DC news, further crossovers with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> is planned, as the company is discussing with Epic which characters to focus on. Again, the likes of Superman and Supergirl would make sense with the forthcoming films.</p>
<p>This wouldn't be the first time DC characters have appeared in Fortnite, as various heroes and villains have been available as skins in the past. However, this stopped once Warner Bros' crossover fighting game Multiversus launched.</p>
<p>It appears Warner Bros has U-turned on this decision following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-director-in-deep-mourning-following-last-weeks-shutdown-news">shutdown of Multiversus</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/idxbox-fanfest-reveals-revenge-of-the-savage-planet-date-lies-of-p-overture-trailer-and-more/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><span>Yesterday, during the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y8FrLCDS3hY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ID@Xbox FanFest Showcase, </a>which was held in partnership with IGN, Microsoft unveiled several news tidbits from third-party developers.</span></p>
<p>Arguably, the most important was the announcement of the release date for Revenge of the Savage Planet. This is the sequel to Journey to 2020's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/journey-to-the-savage-planet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Journey to the Savage Planet</a>, which earned a positive reception, including an <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/journey-to-the-savage-planet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">8/10 score here on Wccftech</a> from Nathan Birch:</p>
<p><em>Anybody pining for more Metroid Prime needs to put Journey to the Savage Planet at the top of their list. The game has a few rough edges and its sense of humor might not be to all tastes, but it captures that inviting, adventuresome Metroid spirit better than anything I’ve played in a while. This Savage Planet will pull you into its orbit if you give it half a chanc</em>e.</p>
<p>However, getting a sequel going wasn't easy at all for the developers. Typhoon Studios was acquired by Google shortly prior to the game's release, but in early 2021, following Google's divestiture from its Stadia initiative, the studio was shut down alongside others. Later that year, former members of Typhoon, including Game Director and Writer Alex Hutchinson, established a new developer called Raccoon Logic and were able to secure the rights from Google to produce a sequel. Revenge of the Savage Planet launches on May 8 for Xbox Series S|X, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, and PC, and will be included with Game Pass on day one.</p>

<p>Another big news story from the ID@Xbox FanFest Showcase was the new trailer for Lies of P: Overture, the highly anticipated DLC for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lies-of-p-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acclaimed Soulslike game</a>. In this expansion, players encounter a mysterious artifact that transports them back to Krat in its final days of grandeur. In the shadow of an impending tragedy, their mission is to explore the past and uncover its dark secrets, haunted by surprises, loss, and vengeance. The developer says the choices made will ripple through the past and present in the world of Lies of P, revealing hidden truths and leaving lasting consequences. Lies of P: Overture <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-overture-announced-releasing-this-summer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">will launch this Summer</a>.</p>

<p>The ID@Xbox FanFest Showcase also included several other announcements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Balatro has dropped on Game Pass</li>
<li>Tron: Catalyst, in development at Bithell Games, launches on June 17</li>
<li>Jump Ship, an intriguing sci-fi first-person cooperative game that mixes spaceship combat and on-foot sections, will debut this Summer on early access (including Xbox Game Preview)</li>
<li>Descenders Next launches on April 9 and will be on Game Pass</li>
<li>The coop action roguelike 33 Immortals, inspired by MMO raids, launches on March 18</li>
<li>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault will be on Game Pass when it debuts later this year</li>
</ul>
