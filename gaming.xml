		<p>Bungie has announced that its Star Wars inspired Renegades expansion will launch on December 2nd, and the developer has released a developer video to go into some of the content. Renegades has been a collaborative work with Lucasfilm Games to bring elements of Star Wars to Destiny, including lightsabers, the AT-ST Walker, and blasters.</p>
<p><iframe title="Destiny 2 ViDoc | Infiltrating The Lawless Frontier" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DuJXqw4xgCc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the video, the developers draw various comparisons between Destiny in Star Wars. For example, Destiny’s Barant Imperium are like the Empire, the Dredgen are like the Sith, and the Praxic Order are similar to the Jedi. The story itself puts you in the criminal underworld of Destiny’s universe, meaning dealing and allying with various syndicates to reach your goals, with Drifter taking the lead role in your group, going against the orders of The Vanguard. Players will be sent to the Lawless Frontier to work together while using Renegade abilities, to rise up through the ranks of the criminal underworld. The locations of these maps have also been inspired by Star Wars, with Europa having elements of Hoth, Mars has Sarlaac like pits and Venus is like the swamps of Dagobah. The jobs you will be able to undertake include smuggling, bounty hunting, and sabotage. The Renegade abilities you will be able to equip to help on these jobs are things like air strikes, drop pods, the Cabal Walker, turrets, swoop bikes, interceptors. There are a total of nine abilities and seven upgrades to unlock.</p>
<p>The hub of Destiny 2 Renegades is Tharsis Outpost, which has become a true hive of scum and villainy. The criminal syndicates have set up their headquarters on Tharsis while The Vanguard have been busy elsewhere. The three syndicates that call Thasis Outpost home are the Eliksni Pikers, that are described as a biker gang. The Totality Division is a subset of the Barant Imperium, and is run by Psions. The final group is the Tharsis Reformation, a breakaway Vex group that is learning more about individualism. Bungie has also confirmed that Invasion will return in Renegades too.</p>

<p>But why?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Tomodachi / Magical" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f420aa1c813e3/tomodachi-magical.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has updated two trademarks relating to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/magical_starsign">Magical Starsign</a> on the DS and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/tomodachi_life">Tomodachi Life</a> on the 3DS.</p>
<p>As highlighted by <a href="https://x.com/MikeOdysseyYT/status/1965438662197276967">Mike Odyssey</a> over on X, the trademarks are currently under examination as of 2nd September 2025 before full publication, which is normal. As for <em>why</em> they've been updated, well... that's up for debate.</p>
<p>Odyssey believes that the updates might indicate the inclusion of DS games on Nintendo Switch Online ahead of a rumoured Direct showcase later this week. And sure, that's possible, but perhaps a bit optimistic, in our opinion.</p>

<p>Take Tomodachi Life, for example: as mentioned, that's a 3DS game, and while there was a Japan-exclusive predecessor on DS called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/tomodachi_collection">Tomodachi Collection</a>, this isn't what the trademark is referring to. There's also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/tomodachi_life_living_the_dream">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream</a> to consider, the Switch sequel currently scheduled to release in 2026.</p>
<p>Similarly, Magical Starsign is the sequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/magical_vacation">Magical Vacation</a> on the GBA, which recently saw its own release on NSO over in Japan. With both games, it could simply be that Nintendo is making sure everything is up to date and in tippity-top shape.</p>
<p>It's worth considering, however, that Nintendo does have a patent for a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/10/newly-discovered-nintendo-filing-shows-off-dual-screen-detachable-device">'dual-screen, detachable device'</a>, which may indicate that the company is almost certainly weighing up the viability of a screen accessory for use with DS games on NSO.</p>

			<p>A new version of the NVIDIA RTX Remix modding tools is now available, introducing a new system that promises to elevate the fire and smoke effects of older games.</p>



<p>The new 1.2 version of the modding tools, which can now be downloaded via the NVIDIA App, introduces an <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/rtx-remix-advanced-particle-system-release/">advanced path-traced particle system</a> that allows modders to enhance traditional fire and smoke effects, which continued to lack detail, flair, and fluid animations using older versions of the tools. With this new system, games can now have particle effects that can match those in modern games, as seen in some comparison videos showcasing improvements in Half-Life 2 RTX, where the system can be employed to enhance the looks of the Antlion Guard as well, and Portal with RTX. A final video also shows how the new version of NVIDIA RTX Remix allows users to add these path-traced particles even during regular gameplay, making it easier than ever to enhance old games.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nvidia-releases-game-ready-driver-borderlands-4-dying-light-the-beast/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nvidia-releases-game-ready-driver-optimized-for-borderlands-4-and-dying-light-the-beast.1293414/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NVIDIA released a new Game Ready driver (version 581.29) for its GeForce graphics cards, delivering optimization for Gearbox's Borderlands 4 (out tomorrow) and Techland's Dying Light: The Beast (out on Friday, September 19).</p>



<p>Both games will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation on PC, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-pc-requirements-nvidia-dlss-4-amd-fsr-4-intel-xess-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> also offers DLSS Ray Reconstruction to power its ray traced effects (global illumination and reflections). According to the GeForce company, DLSS 4 Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation can boost performance in Borderlands 4 by up to 5.5 times when they are all enabled on a GeForce RTX 50 graphics card. As you can see in the official slide below, the GeForce RTX 5090 averages 256 frames per second at 4K, max settings, and DLSS Super Resolution set to Performance. There's a big distance with the RTX 5080 in this case, since the smaller sibling stops at 166 FPS.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Reflex, on the other hand, can lower system latency by up to 54% in the looter shooter game. If you're interested in getting Gearbox's game and a new GeForce RTX 50 GPU, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-50-borderlands-4-bundle-dlss-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bundle</a> is available until Monday, September 22. Borderlands 4 can also be played through NVIDIA GeForce NOW by those who do not have a capable enough hardware.</p>



<p>By the way, NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation was recently added to <a href="https://wccftech.com/moba-predecessor-open-beta-now-live-on-pc-and-consoles-complete-with-cross-platform-play-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Predecessor</a>, the team-based strategy MOBA game by Omeda Studios. The title also supports DLAA and Reflex. </p>



<p>There is also good news for RTX Remix users. A new update delivered through the NVIDIA app has just added an advanced particle system that enables modders to enhance traditional fire and smoke effects and more fantastical effects like those in Portal. RTX Remix modders can now create brand new particles in Remix that match those in modern games.</p>

Modders have managed to greatly improve older games thanks to RTX Remix, and Nvidia used <em>Half-Life 2</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nvidia/628796/half-life-2-rtx-remix-nvidia-demo">as a showcase</a> for its RTX 50-series GPUs and the RTX Remix tool earlier this year.</p><p>Nvidia’s RTX 50-series GPUs are also restocked at Amazon, Best Buy, and Newegg with a variety of cards at or close to recommended retail prices.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Treyarch has confirmed some Black Ops 6 skins <em>will</em> carry forward to Black Ops 7 after all, as the Call of Duty community debates the rights and wrongs of Activision’s decision to prevent players from bringing over their cosmetics to the upcoming game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty’s foray into goofy skins territory is well-documented, although recent releases have certainly amped up the conversation around them. With the likes of Beavis and Butt-Head and American Dad hitting the game this year shortly after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-dutys-ongoing-420-obsession-sparks-debate-among-fans-some-have-had-enough-others-really-want-that-seth-rogen-skin"><u>weed-obsessed bundles starring Seth Rogen</u></a>, some fans have said they’ve had enough of what they call the 'Fortnite-ification' of their beloved Call of Duty, and pleaded with publisher Activision to return to its mil-sim roots.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, last month, Activision shocked the Call of Duty community when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amid-battlefield-6s-commitment-to-gritty-realism-activision-makes-shock-call-of-duty-change-for-black-ops-7-we-hear-the-feedback">it confirmed that Operators, Operator Skins, and Weapons from Black Ops 6 would no longer carry forward into Black Ops 7</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This came as a big surprise to players who had expected content they’d bought for Black Ops 6 to carry forward, as it has done with previous entries, and given Black Ops 7 directly follows last year’s Black Ops 6. Explaining the decision, Activision said Black Ops 7 “needs to feel authentic to Call of Duty and its setting.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That is why Black Ops 6 Operator and Weapon content will not carry forward to Black Ops 7," the publisher continued. "Double XP tokens and GobbleGums will still carry forward, because we recognize your time and progression are important.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(This change applies only to Black Ops 7. Call of Duty: Warzone is not affected, and all your Black Ops 6 content stays usable there.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and Warzone's Bloke Biter Shark Skin Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It means that at launch, at least, you won’t see all those goofy skins running around Multiplayer. It sounds like Multiplayer will look like Black Ops 7, at least at the start of things. Activision went on to say that Black Ops 7 bundles and items “will be crafted to fit the Black Ops identity.” “We hear the feedback,” Activision added. “We need to deliver a better balance toward the immersive, core Call of Duty experience.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Initial reaction was a mix of shock that Activision actually canceled carry forward for Black Ops 7, excitement about getting back to Call of Duty’s roots, but for some a frustration that the time and in many cases money spent earning cosmetic items in recent months dies with Black Ops 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, Treyarch has confirmed that some skins, mostly focused on the Zombies portion of Black Ops 6 will indeed carry forward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a social media post, Treyarch said any of the four main quest Operator Skin rewards earned in Black Ops 6 will be available in Black Ops 7 at launch, as well as the New Orders Prestige Level 1000 Operator Skin reward, which will be available for Samuels on day one.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Heads up, Zombies players: any of the 4 Main Quest Operator Skin rewards earned in Black Ops 6 will be available in Black Ops 7 at launch!</p><p>And for the truly dedicated, the "New Orders" Prestige Level 1000 Operator Skin reward will also be available for Samuels on day one. 🤝 <a href="https://t.co/sJMXkR2SXX" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/sJMXkR2SXX</a></p></div>— Treyarch (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1965567095145684994?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, the Guild Override camo is joining the Zombies main quest Reward and New Orders Operator skins, and will be available at the launch of Black Ops 7 for those who digitally pre-order.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, a slight U-turn on the U-turn then, one that Zombies fans are already calling a win. But, interestingly, some portions of the Call of Duty community want Activision to go one step further and let them carry forward all their skins. And some players are now hitting out at Activision letting complaints around cartoon skins like American Dad affect affect the entire playerbase.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Ok but why exclude every BO6 skin just because of a few cartoon skins that people complained about?” said one disgruntled player on social media. “Just don’t let the cartoon skins transfer, but everything else that isn’t over the top goofy should carry over to BO7.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I dont know how I feel about this,” commented redditor Courtneyvictory, “Seems like Treyarch can't make up their mind, or maybe different people are fighting against each other about their game's direction internally.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Could we possibly have these skins carry forward?? <a href="https://t.co/L0UI7172PM" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/L0UI7172PM</a></p>— Tox (@tox83958246) <a href="https://twitter.com/tox83958246/status/1965584725160165516?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Thank you!</p><p>Now, about carry forward in general...</p></div>— GuiGZ1 (@Guiiiiigui_) <a href="https://twitter.com/Guiiiiigui_/status/1965568659889553432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 10, 2025</a></blockquote> <blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Wait I thought you all weren’t gonna carry things forward?

It’s worth noting that this isn’t only about premium skins, either. Call of Duty players put in a huge amount of effort working their way through battle passes and completing challenges in order to unlock certain in-game skins, and with Black Ops 6 they did so with the expectation they’d be able to use them in Black Ops 7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps Activision felt the heat from EA’s Battlefield 6, which is going for a more grounded aesthetic. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/with-call-of-dutys-obsession-with-goofy-skins-firmly-entrenched-battlefield-6-dev-commits-to-gritty-realism-i-dont-think-it-needs-nicki-minaj"><u>Developer DICE has indicated it has no plans to release crossover skins that would break the aesthetic Battlefield 6 is going for</u></a>, and promised the developers were listening to fan feedback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/news/battlefield-6-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>DBLTAP</u></a>, Battlefield 6 design director Shashank Uchil doubled down on EA's commitment to grounded realism, and even pointed to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nicki-minaj-is-call-of-duty-season-5-snoop-dogg"><u>Call of Duty's infamous Nicki Minaj skin</u></a> as something Battlefield 6 doesn't need.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It has to be grounded," he said. "That is what BF3 and BF4 was — it was all soldiers, on the ground. It’s going to be like this,” Uchil said, pointing at the key art featuring soldiers in soldier gear looking out over a wartorn New York City.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He added: “I don’t think it needs Nicki Minaj. Let’s keep it real, keep it grounded.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a> boss Randy Pitchford has suggested that the game's pre-order bundle, which contains a free <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> skin, could become a worthwhile investment — after a previous Borderlands skin fetched "over $2k when trading on eBay."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Writing on social media, Pitchford highlighted the looter shooter's Epic Games Store pre-order offer, which unlocks the Mad Moxxi skin in Fortnite. But players have been quick to point out that "trading" is against Fortnite's Terms of Service, and liable to result in a ban.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Is it true that the pre-order incentive Psycho Bandit skin in became one of the most valuable skins in Fortnite sometimes fetching over $2k when trading on eBay?" Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1964487591253966880" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>. "What are the odds this bundle becomes worth much more than the price of the game it is promoting?"</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Firstly, it's worth breaking down exactly what Pitchford is referring to here. The Psycho Bandit skin he mentions was originally released in 2019, as part of a similar Epic Game Store promotion with Borderlands 3. It was also briefly available via Fortnite's item shop — before disappearing from sale for a lengthy period. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's during this time that the skin did become something of a coveted item among Fortnite players, though its perceived value dropped significantly when it returned returned on sale in April 2025, becoming widely-available once again after a gap of five years. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortnite skins deemed rare or unlikely to be sold again often attract player interest, though Fortnite itself of course does not offer any ability to sell or trade in-game items with other players. Instead, some players simply buy or sell accounts with rare items included — something which Epic Games is <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/c-Category_EpicAccount/c-AccountSecurity/can-i-buy-sell-or-share-an-epic-games-account-a000090985" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">clear</a> is against the company's Terms of Service, and risks a lengthy (or permanent) ban. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of which is worth bearing in mind when considering whether buying Borderlands 4 just for its attached Fortnite skin is really the best pitch for a money-making scheme. But hey, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-standard-edition-price-set-at-70-after-all">at least the game isn't $80</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Borderlands 4 launches this Friday, September 12, for PC via Steam and the Epic Game Store, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S. A Nintendo Switch 2 version will then follow on October 3. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Borderlands 4 is getting more difficulty options than previous games have had, as well as offering co-op players the option of playing on a different difficulty than others in the party.</p><p>In the lead up to Borderland 4's launch, Gearbox has shared a bunch of extra information about the game, including its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-minimum-pc-specs-have-been-announced-and-they-are-eye-popping/1100-6532513/" data-ref-id="1100-6532513">minimum PC specs</a>, graphic settings, and accessibility options. Included alongside accessibility are the game's difficulty options, with Gearbox noting that the difficulty levels "may make the game more accessible to some players."</p>

<p>The three difficulty settings on offer are Easy, Normal, and Hard. Here are how they're described by Gearbox:</p><ul><li><i>Easy</i>: "Looking for a story." Reduced damage, Elemental Affinities matter less</li><li><i>Normal</i>: "Looking for a balanced experience."</li><li><i>Hard</i>: "Looking for a challenge." Increased damage taken, increased Cash, Loot Quality is increased, Elemental Affinities matter more</li></ul><p>Notably, difficulty is selected when creating a character and scales individually when playing in co-op, meaning you can choose to play on hard even if your buddy wants to experience the game on easy mode.</p><p>In practice, this means that most of Borderlands 4's difficulty modifiers are focused on the player rather than enemies--while the enemies' attacks and HP won't change, you'll take more damage per hit if playing on a higher difficulty level. Unlike some games where resources are also more scarce on higher difficulties, Borderlands 4 instead rewards players who choose the hardest game mode, awarding extra cash and better loot.</p><p>While these three difficulties are available from the beginning, Borderlands 4 also has an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-borderlands-4-will-keep-you-looting-and-shooting-after-launch/1100-6534397/" data-ref-id="1100-6534397">endgame difficulty mode</a> called Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode. In this new game plus-style mode, enemies will hit harder and take less damage, but drop even better loot for a high-risk, high-reward playstyle. As its own contained game mode, Ultimate Vault Hunter will include five increasing difficulty levels that will unlock as you progress through its various challenges.</p><p>Borderlands 4 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-times-revealed-heres-exactly-when-you-can-start-playing/1100-6534522/" data-ref-id="1100-6534522">releases on September 12</a> for PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, while the Nintendo Switch 2 version launches October 3.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>Thirty years ago this month, Sony brought the original PlayStation to North America and kicked off a new era in the console wars. To celebrate the 30th anniversary of that occasion, Sony has shared a video that plays up the nostalgia for anyone who recalls the iconic sounds that the PlayStation made when it was turned on.</p><p>Sony followed up on that video with a call for fans to share their PlayStation memories with the <a href="https://x.com/hashtag/PlayStation30Memories?src=hashtag_click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">#PlayStation30Memories</a>, some of which will be featured in a celebration video.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The development history of Lost Soul Aside reads like an epic fantasy in and of itself. Originally the dream project of a solo developer, Yang Bing, it was revealed in 2016 before being picked up as part of Sony’s China Hero Project. Between 2016 and 2025, however, the game went through various different teams and visions, finally being released as a weird fusion of Devil May Cry, Final Fantasy, and an Anime 101 storytelling guidebook. The end result is a fascinating mess that isn’t a complete disaster but instead manages to be almost the dictionary definition of mediocre.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lost Soul Aside - Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GRhg0RYYsa0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First, up, Lost Soul Aside has some fairly impressive production values. At times it looks really nice and the framerate was mostly satisfactory on a base PS5 using performance mode, although there were moments when I wasn’t sure if there were deliberate slow-mo effects or if the game was lagging somewhat. Environments are varied, albeit following the generic pattern of fire zone, ice zone etc. Voice acting is functional but the English dub isn’t going to win any awards (the actors don’t have a great deal to work with to be fair), while the music is decent with some great battle music and area themes.</p>


<p>The solid quality of the game’s aesthetics is undermined, however, by an almost complete lack of any individuality. Almost every character looks like they’ve been lifted from a generic anime protagonist class, and my wife immediately thought it was a Final Fantasy game despite having little to no interest in gaming. Your main character, Kaser, is an emo cypher with long black trenchcoat and a taciturn personality, whilst his companions are various flavours of waifu (the goth one, the noble but reserved one, etc.). Your quest starts out as a political one as you fight against the tyrannical Empire as the guerrilla group, Glimmer. It soon shifts into a more magical tale as a demonic force known as the Voidrax begin to steal the souls of humans, with Kaser’s sister, Louisa, being one of their victims.</p>


<p>The early stages of the game are very slow, but I quite liked the setting and characters until it took a turn for the more generic fantasy narrative. The Emperor becomes a slightly more complex character as the game progresses and continues to wear the most ludicrously oversized helmet this side of Mel Brooks’ Spaceballs. After the Voidrax attack, you become linked to a mysterious power called Lord Arena, who has been trapped for centuries, whilst his power is used to develop the technological breakthroughs of the Empire. Arena is ostensibly a giant dragon, but his power is so diminished that he manifests as a far smaller presence, as well as seemingly being your weapons too.</p>
<p>There is the bones of an interesting story here but, whether due to translation or lack of experience, it feels like a flow chart of ideas rather than anything more complex. You soon have to complete the traditional McGuffin quest as you go off in search of Life Crystals.</p>

<p>So, Lost Soul Aside looks decent and is entirely generic but does it offer anything new? Well, kind of, since the combat system is fluid and filled with potential. You start off with a standard sword, but unlock a huge two-handed version, a speedy polearm, and a scythe as you progress. These all have secondary skills that are vital in area progression, which is welcome but they are rarely mixed up and feel as by the numbers as much of the rest of the game. Combat itself features an unlockable combo tree and an impressive number of attacks considering the two button controls. Alongside the light and heavy attacks you have various skills and can call on Lord Arena to power your attacks when the relevant metre is filled.</p>
<p>Each of the weapons feel pretty distinct in combat and you can switch between them on the fly. Some enemies are susceptible to different elements so later in the game you can equip different versions of each weapon to take advantage of this. As with Final Fantasy XVI, though, this aspect is underdone and could have been used to greater effect. As well as elemental characteristics, you pick up weapon charms that add extra bonuses. These actually have to be fitted onto the weapons themselves and can lead to some ludicrous looking creations if you want. I found that the ones adding base attack bonus and health renewal on criticals were the most effective.</p>

<p>This combat system comes into its own in a number of challenging boss fights but these are few and far between as most of the time you’ll be fighting mobs of similar looking enemies that offer little in the way of challenge. The vast majority of battles can be overcome by spamming the light attack, especially when you unlock the polearm and scythe which are both fast enough to overwhelm your opponents. I’m curious as to whether the combat comes into its own more on the harder difficulty unlocked upon completion but not enough to draw me back into the game yet.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most egregious feature here is the fact that Kaser pulls off some amazing acrobatics and magical transformations but all in non-interactive cutscenes. I actually found myself longing for some QTEs just to feel involved in some way. I wouldn’t be surprised if these were originally a feature but were removed as that feature became less popular. The end result, though, is a series of long corridor levels with brainless battles, inane dialogue, only occasionally redeemed with boss battles that require you to use the full range of skills in a depressingly under-utilised combat system.</p>

            <p>
There's plenty of debate online around the difficulty of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, but while most of us are struggling, speedrunners have already beaten the game in under 90 minutes mere days after release.
</p>
<p>
The record is moving fast, literally! Yesterday, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YaRbJ-y0tI">YouTuber Onaku</a> managed a Silksong any% speedrun in 1:46:47, but hours later <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=If8bCzk3MCw">YouTuber BlueSR</a> managed a run in 1:26:20. What's more, the speedrunner will be aiming for an even quicker World Record time today.
</p>
<p>
I've linked to the runs of both speedrunners above, but of course these will be full of spoilers for anyone still back in the early game. Or perhaps you're keen to check out some expert strategies.

<p>
The <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/silksong">official speedrunning leaderboard</a> won't open until 1st October, at which point we'll have a firm idea of the World Record time and the official rules. Until then, speedrunners will be rapidly sharing their times on social media.
</p>
<p>
Judging by the game's achievements, it's possible to achieve 100 percent game completion in under 30 hours, but there's also an achievement for completing the game in under five hours (aptly named "Speedrunner"). So even if a run of just over an hour isn't achievable for you, those looking to gain all achievements will still need to complete an exceptionally fast run.
</p>
<p>
For comparison, the current <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/hollowknight">World Record for the original Hollow Knight</a> sits at just over 30 minutes!

            <p>Microsoft have announced plans to roll out a policy which will mandate that staff return to working from the office at least three days per week, with a first phase of it set to come into force as of February 2026.</p>
<p>In a memo about the move shared by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/774414/microsoft-return-to-office-policy-announcement">The Verge</a>, Microsoft executive vice president and chief people officer Amy Coleman asserted that it's "not about reducing headcount". The mandate comes just a couple of months after the company's mass layoffs which saw about 9,000 employees let go and several games cancelled. The bloodletting hasn't stopped since that point either, with <a href="https://www.seattletimes.com/business/microsoft/microsoft-layoffs-continue-into-5th-consecutive-month/">The Seattle Times</a> reporting this week that Microsoft have laid off a further 42 employees, bringing the total to 15,000 since May.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We’ve looked at how our teams work best, and the data is clear: when people work together in person more often, they thrive — they are more energized, empowered, and they deliver stronger results," Coleman wrote in the memo about the proposed return to office. "As we build the AI products that will define this era, we need the kind of energy and momentum that comes from smart people working side by side, solving challenging problems together. With that in mind, we’re updating our flexible work expectations to three days a week in the office." The Verge report that some teams at Microsoft might be expected to work from the office four or five days a week, and that some roles like consulting will be exempt.</p>
<p>It's no surprise to read that the RTO mandate reflects the company's wider plans for generative AI. Microsoft have been <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/jul/30/microsoft-q2-2025-earnings">shovelling billions of dollars into AI tech</a> over the course of this year, a move that definitely doesn't have <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/23/is-the-ai-bubble-about-to-burst-and-send-the-stock-market-into-freefall">the potential to end terribly</a> pretty soon. Back in July, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/24/recommitting-to-our-why-what-and-how/">spoke of the need</a> for a "messy" organisational transformation to carry out Microsoft's aims for genAI, while talking around the "incongruence" between the company's vast profits and mass layoffs.</p><p>The Verge's Tom Warren cites some Microsoft staff he spoke to last month as having agreed that this return to office mandate could be seen as a form of 'soft' or 'stealth' layoffs. This is something companies instituting return to office mandates have been <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/12/why-rto-mandates-are-layoffs-in-disguise-according-to-workplace-experts.html">accused of</a> for a number of years now, with the logic being that in rescinding the option of full-time remote work, these businesses are <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/rto-mandates-layoffs-quit-jobs-hybrid-remote-work-office-2025-5">making an effort to push certain staff towards leaving voluntarily</a>. </p>
<p>Naturally, if you're a worker facing a lengthy commute, a move to a different place in order to be able to go into the office while maintaining a decent work/life balance, or have a disability/condition and aren't able to secure an exception, the word 'voluntarily' might be doing some heavy lifting there. Microsoft staff will reportedly be able to apply for an exception to this mandate by September 19th.</p>
<p>Clearly aiming to get out ahead of any accusations along those lines, Coleman wrote in her memo: "Importantly, this update is not about reducing headcount. It’s about working together in a way that enables us to meet our customers’ needs."</p>

<p>The proposed first phase of Microsoft's proposed return to office mandate is set to only affect staff who live within 50 miles of Microsoft’s campus in Redmond, Washington.

            <p>It's not a good time for Bungie. This year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> expansion, The Edge of Fate, is widely regarded as one of the worst expansions the game has ever seen - a big feat to achieve when you're 11 years old. As intriguing as some of the new story developments in the expanding world of Destiny are, little could soften the impact of some atrocious decision-making from the sandbox and gear teams within the studio: the grind in Destiny has rarely been worse, and fans' patience for the MMOFPS is becoming increasingly thin.</p>
<p>Even the blowout reveal of what should have been a slam dunk for Bungie - a Star Wars collab <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2s-getting-two-paid-expansions-this-year-and-one-of-them-is-star-wars-themed">that was initially announced back in May</a> - has been met with apathy and disinterest. Renegades (to give the event its proper name) will be the first ever crossover-themed campaign in Destiny's complicated history, and operates in a muddy middle ground between full crossover and vague skin-based collab.</p>
<p>"Renegades merges Destiny's distinctive storytelling and gameplay with themes and elements drawn from the iconic sci-fi franchise," Bungie enthuses in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/09/destiny-2-renegades-star-wars-inspired-expansion-detailed-launches-december-2/">its own press release</a>. In the expansion, we "will defy the Vanguard" to pursue Drifter across Sol, navigating a world of shadows and syndicates in the new social hub, Tharsis Outpost, as we work across story missions to build a crew and resist a rising faction tied to the Nine.</p>

<p>As you can see from the video above, Renegades positions an activity called the Lawless Frontier front and center: per Bungie, it's "a chaotic, cooperative new game mode, where players take on a variety of high-risk jobs and contracts to earn reputation, unlock all-new Renegade abilities that change the tide of battle, and wield weapons that include the iconic Praxic Blade and an energy-based arsenal from the new Blaster archetype." A new dungeon is also promised to land after the expansion's launch on 2nd December.</p><p>But, frankly, who cares? This should have been a home run for Bungie - a big crossover like this is often catnip for MMO ride-or-dies - but the general consensus amongst the community at the moment is one of exhausted apathy. After the presentation that debuted information on both Renegades and the other incoming expansion, Ash &amp; Iron, the top post on Destiny's dedicated Subreddit reads: <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1ncz9u7/i_think_tonight_this_is_a_breakpoint_for_many/">I think tonight this is a breakpoint for many people and Bungie as a whole</a>. Another bemoans "<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1ncz4yg/almost_everything_in_this_major_update_is/">Almost everything in this "Major Update" is reskinned/reissued, except [the paid shop]</a>", and every single top post in <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1nclax3/destiny_2_renegades_and_ash_iron_developer/">the dedicated megathread</a> about Renegades is critical of Bungie.</p>
<p>Now, I've been a member of /r/DestinyTheGame for about 12 years, and even since the early days (alpha and beta for D1!), the sub has had toxicity issues. Go figure. But this is something else: I don't think I've ever seen the community so fed up and bored with basically everything that is suggested.</p>
<p>The problem is three-fold: as well as Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-ceo-pete-parsons-steps-down-following-years-of-criticism-layoffs-and-that-infamous-classic-car-collection">losing key staff</a> that have overseen the Destiny vision since inception, the remaining designers have also implemented sandbox aspects players actively hate - namely, The Portal, a high-grind, low-reward anomaly of game design that actively punishes you for wanting choice in the things you do and the gear you equip. Decisions like these seem to manifest because of a studio culture<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-management-vehemently-shut-down-destiny-2-subscription-idea-as-reports-of-toxicity-continue"> that "stem from a lack of player empathy, disconnected leadership, and a corporate-first culture,"</a> per one recent report.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>At this point, it feels like Bungie's back is against a wall: player numbers are dropping, player satisfaction is low, and even massive crossover events like Star Wars are failing to stem the haemorrhaging. As a big new update lands, concurrent player counts on Steam are even struggling to reach 50k - a historic low for the game. Will this trend reverse by December, when the Star Wars update actually launches? We'll have to wait and see but right now, it doesn't seem likely.</p>

<figure><a title="Pokémon Legends Z-A" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/62ddaba56e80d/pokemon-legends-z-a.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo, in its ongoing battle against Pocketpair and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/palworld">Palworld</a>, has been filing various patents left, right, and centre in the US, the latest of which is almost certainly cause for concern.</p>
<p>As detailed by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/last-week-nintendo-and-the-pokemon-company-received-a-u-s-patent-on-summoning-a-character-and-letting-it-fight-another/">Games Fray</a>, Patent <a data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-custom-tracking-id="5652783286200639599" data-google-interstitial="false" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-hl-processed="none" data-url="https://gamesfray.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/US12403397B2-2025-09-02.pdf" href="https://gamesfray.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/US12403397B2-2025-09-02.pdf">No. 12,403,39</a> has been granted which essentially covers the summoning of a sub character and letting it fight on your behalf. Now, we're not sure about you, but we can already think of quite a few games that make use of such mechanics outside of Pokémon. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a>, for example?</p>
<p>It goes into further detail and states that the sub character can either be controller by issuing commands, or it can act on its own accord, battling enemies automatically should any appear within the immediate vicinity.</p>
<p>So, according to analysis from Games Fray, games that make us of <em>all</em> of the following could potentially trigger an infringement lawsuit from Nintendo:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. There must be a PC, console or other computing device and the game is stored on a drive or similar storage medium.</p>
<p>2. You can move a character in a virtual space.</p>
<p>3. You must be able to summon a character. They call it a “sub character” by which they mean it’s not the player character, but, for example, a little monster such as a Pokémon that the player character has at its disposal.</p>
<p>Then the logic branches out, with items 4 and 5 being mutually exclusive scenarios, before reuniting again in item 6.</p>
<p>4. This is about summoning the “sub character” in a place where there already is another character that it will then (when instructed to do so) fight.</p>
<p>5. This alternative scenario is about summoning the “sub character” at a position where there is no other character to fight immediately.</p>
<p>6. This final step is about sending the “sub character” in a direction and then letting an automatic battle ensue with another character. It is not clear whether this is even needed if one previously executed step (4) where the “sub character” will basically be thrown at another character.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The world of patents is complicated, and we've no doubt that there will be a number of loop holes that developers could potentially take advantage of to avoid Nintendo's wrath. It's not good though, is it? This is such a wide-reaching game mechanic, and so many titles already make use of it.</p>
<p>This isn't just targeting Palworld, let's put it that way. Whether Nintendo actually intends to make use of the patent in its legal battle against Pocketpair is unclear at this stage, but the mere fact that it exists is a bit of a blow.</p>

            <p>
In my experience, there are two kinds of tank in Battlefield games. There are the ones driven by other people, which are cut from solid granite yet move like ballet dancers. And then there are the ones driven by me, which are made out of candy floss and handle like shopping trolleys. Possibly, this reflects some kind of underlying "skill issue", but come now, that's speculative reporting that flies in the face of logic. <em>Clearly</em> it's a balancing issue. Here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> lead producer David Sirland with a little more, based on learnings during the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games%22%22">shooter</a>'s multiplayer beta.
</p>
<p>
You may have found that the tanks, helicopters, jeeps and jets on show in said Battlefield 6 beta were somewhat squishy, versus the hardiness of infantry and especially, engineers equipped with anti-tank mines and rockets. Responding to an aggrieved Xitter post (as reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/battlefield-6-producer-acknowledges-vehicles-were-underpowered-in-the-beta-but-says-its-better-than-the-alternative-rather-have-too-weak-vehicles-over-too-powerful/">PCGamer</a>), Sirland acknowledged that there's a balancing issue here, but also, suggested that developers DICE, Ripple, Motive and Criterion may have lowballed the rides to begin with, in order to set a good foundation.
</p>
<p>
"That is a balance issue wholesale, not specific to this special situation however," he <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1965413764414718144">wrote</a>, when one user complained about the potency of said engineers and their dastardly munitions. "And one we are actively working on. Rather have too weak vehicles over too powerful to start. Its a tricky one as players get better at using them over time as well."
</p>
<p>
I find this both funny and interesting. Funny because Battlefield 6 has made a drinking game out of slaughtering vehicles in trailers: those choppers certainly don't seem fit for much besides blowing up. And interesting because it's a quick glimpse into the ever-gripping intricacies of game balancing.</p><p>There is arguably no such thing as "good balance" inasmuch as balancing is an on-going process - developers have to keep adjusting the mixture to keep up with the ingenuity and quirks of clashing groups of players, while hazily targeting some kind of optimal all-round experience. Sirland's aside has made me consider the prospect that developers might deliberately ship a game they consider 'unbalanced' because they're trying to anticipate how player behaviour might evolve. They're trying to balance for how people will be playing in a few month's time, perhaps. A fearful gamble, indeed.
</p>
<p>
Add these insights to EA's longer, official account of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bunnyhop-elsewhere-streamers-ea-are-making-battlefield-6-more-strategic-less-run-and-gun-following-the-beta">how they're changing Battlefield 6 based on the beta playtest</a>. There are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-is-getting-persistent-servers-and-two-vehicle-heavy-maps-are-coming-in-the-next-labs-playtest">vehicle-heavy maps coming in future Battlefield Labs playtests</a>, so we can get another sense of the curiously variable sponginess of those tanks, which assuredly has nothing to do with the steadiness of my thumbs.</p>
<p>The final game will release on October 10th. The single player story sees the US army trying to save NATO from a rogue PMC, which I think is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-make-the-usa-the-villain-in-the-next-call-of-duty-or-battlefield-game">a bit daft</a> given the current US administration's foreign policies.

            <p>Dead Island 3 might not be officially announced, but current series developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/dambusterstudios">Dambuster Studios</a> has given a very serious hint, nod, and wink towards it being in development.</p>
<p>In a post on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/934700/announcements/detail/505086494235427243">Steam</a>, the developer gave a small, but rather obvious hint and what is coming next in the zombie-slaying series.</p>
<figure>

<blockquote><p>It's been 14 years since Dead Island first splattered onto the scene, stranding players in the blood-soaked paradise of Banoi.</p>
<p>Since then, the zompocalypse has crawled from tropical shores to the sun-drenched chaos of HELL-A in Dead Island 2, where over 20 million Slayers have left nothing but carnage behind.</p>
<p>This isn’t the final cut though. Dambuster Studios are already carving out what comes next.</p>
<p>For now, the details stay under wraps, the outbreak is far from over…</p></blockquote>
<p>That's it as far as new information. From the teaser image, which appears to show <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-island-2">Dead Island 2</a>'s Jacob trying to hitch a ride out of LA, we're definitely looking at the next game moving to a new location.</p>
<p>While there's a possibility this tease is for a stand-alone expansion of sorts, similar to Dead Island follow-up, Riptide, it's been two and a half years since Dead Island 2 released and a full titled sequel feels most likely.</p>
