              <p>If there’s one thing that can transform how your home feels without dropping hundreds on new furniture, it’s the lighting you choose. These <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5338/">Govee smart bulbs now cost just $17 for a two-pack on Amazon, down from the usual $25, and you can stack an extra 10% off with the promo code IZVCRPT14KV7</a> to hit a record low price that makes upgrading your entire house ridiculously affordable.</p>
<p>You get <strong>1000 lumens of brightness per bulb</strong> (equivalent to old 75W incandescents), <strong>access to 16 million colors</strong>, <strong>tunable white light</strong> from warm 2700K to cool 6500K, <strong>Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity</strong>, and full <strong>voice control through Alexa or Google Assistant</strong>. These bulbs create different atmospheres for different moods without you touching a dimmer switch. Order today and Amazon delivers them before Christmas.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5338/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>1000 Lumens Really Lights Up Big Rooms</h2>
<p>That 1000-lumen output is a lot more important than it sounds like it would be: Cheap smart bulbs usually only go up to 600–800 lumens which means that even at full brightness, they don’t light up big rooms very well. You can make them brighter when you need task lighting or dim them down across the full 1–100% range for ambiance. The CRI90+ color rendering index makes colors look real and true instead of washed out like they do under cheap LEDs.</p>



<p>You can <strong>choose from 16 million colors</strong> so you can get the exact shade you want instead of going through a few presets that never quite match what you had in mind. You can make your living room glow purple while your kitchen stays warm white, or you can set all the bulbs to the same energizing blue-white for morning routines. The <strong>tunable white range goes from 2700K to 6500K</strong> which is the range of colors that goes from the warmth of candlelight to the brightness of office daylight.</p>



<p>The <strong>Govee Home app gives you access to 54 scene modes</strong> that handle the color programming for you if you don’t want to manually adjust settings. <strong>Music sync mode makes the bulbs change colors </strong>when your phone’s microphone picks up sound, turning any playlist into a light show that pulses with the beat. Sunrise and sunset timers gradually brighten or dim the lights to wake you naturally or ease you into evening, and you can schedule these automations to match your actual daily routine instead of fumbling for switches half-asleep.</p>
<p>You can control these bulbs from anywhere using the app, even when you’re not home, which lets you turn the lights on before you get there or check to see if you left something on after you left. You can change the brightness, colors, or turn lights on and off with your voice using Alexa or Google Assistant. This feels like the future at first, but then it quickly becomes the only way you want to interact with lights. The dual connectivity also acts as a backup;<strong> if your Wi-Fi goes down, you can still use Bluetooth to control things locally</strong>.</p>
<p>The bulbs fit in <strong>standard A19 sockets</strong> and work with any lamp or fixture that takes regular screw-in bulbs and makes installation as easy as changing old bulbs. Most routers send out 2.4GHz Wi-Fi signals, which these devices can connect to. These 9-watt bulbs use a lot less electricity than old 75-watt incandescent bulbs, but they still give off the same amount of light.</p>
<p>The $17 price for two bulbs becomes even better when you apply that 10% promo code, and brings your <strong>effective cost down to around $7.65 per bulb.</strong> That’s cheaper than many dumb LED bulbs that just turn on and off, except these give you millions of colors, remote control, voice commands, scheduling, and music sync capabilities.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-community-led-renaissance-kyber-open-beta/</link>
            <guid>1389487</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>DICE's <strong>Star Wars Battlefront II</strong> launch in November 2017 was notoriously hindered by the loot box scandal. The game's original monetization scheme provided in-game advantages to those who chose to spend real money to expedite unlocks. The developers increased the rate at which players could work toward unlocks simply by playing the game. However, shortly before the release date, a Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7c6bjm/it_takes_40_hours_to_unlock_a_hero_spreadsheet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">calculated</a> that it would still take around 40 hours of gameplay to unlock a hero. </p>



<p>This prompted a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsBattlefront/comments/7c6bjm/comment/dppv3bo/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developer response from the EA Community Team</a> that included the infamous <strong>'sense of pride and accomplishment'</strong> comment, which riled up fans so badly that it went down (as certified in 2019 by the Guinness World Records) as <strong>the most downvoted comment in Reddit's history</strong> with over 683K downvotes. Belgian authorities even started an investigation, while as of November 16, 2017, Electronic Arts <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-claim-star-wars-battlefront-ii-not-gambling/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was still maintaining</a> that the loot box model did not constitute gambling. The following day (which was also the release day), though, EA <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-microtransactions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decided to remove all microtransactions from the game</a>.</p>



<p>Needless to say, all this controversy greatly harmed the reputation of Star Wars Battlefront II in the eyes of many gamers. It's a shame, because the game itself was very enjoyable, and over time, it garnered quite a dedicated following. DICE improved it with various content updates, the last of which <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-2-battle-on-scarif-update-date-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was released in late April 2020</a>. Still, the community wanted more, and that's how the <a href="https://kyber.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KYBER project</a> began.</p>



<p><strong>KYBER</strong> is a custom server platform and mod launcher that completely replaces Star Wars Battlefront II's official online infrastructure on PC and introduces various additions, such as:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Dedicated 24/7 community-operated servers</strong> that allow players to host persistent game sessions with custom rulesets, map selections, and gameplay modifications.</li>



<li><strong>Full support for community-made mods</strong>, enabling creators to develop new gameplay mechanics, cosmetics, balance changes, and content entirely separate from official patches.</li>



<li><strong>Key mode changes,</strong> such as Supremacy being developed into the Battlefield-inspired Conquest mode, where matches are faster paced and have a clearer flow.  </li>



<li><strong>A fully functional server browser</strong>, which was missing in the official game.</li>



<li><strong>Proximity-based voice chat</strong>, where players hear teammates and nearby opponents based on in-game distance rather than team-only channels, encouraging organic squad coordination without requiring external platforms like Discord.</li>



<li><strong>Detailed stats tracking</strong> that allows players to review their career statistics across both official online servers and KYBER servers.</li>



<li><strong>Spectator mode</strong> that leverages the game's built-in spectator camera. Useful to monitor suspicious players, view epic battles, and more.</li>
</ul>

<iframe title="KYBER is NOW OFFICIALLY PUBLIC | Galactic Assault | Star Wars Battlefront 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KawoPSZ89ok?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It took a long time, but after four years of work, KYBER launched a few hours ago in Open Beta to expand the player base and help refine the last bugs ahead of the full release. You can now install KYBER following this procedure:</p>



<h2 id="h-prerequisites-preliminary-setup">Prerequisites (Preliminary Setup)</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Own a legal PC copy of Star Wars Battlefront II</strong> (via EA App, Steam, Epic Games, or EA Play subscription)</li>



<li><strong>Disable the Discord overlay</strong> for Battlefront II</li>



<li><strong>Disable FrostyFix</strong> (it conflicts with KYBER)</li>



<li><strong>Launch vanilla Battlefront II once</strong> after installation to initialize the game</li>



<li><strong>Register a free NexusMods account</strong> or log in with your existing one on the NexusMods website.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-installation-steps">Installation Steps</h2>



<p><strong>Steps 1-2: Downloading and Running the Installer</strong></p>



<ol>
<li>Join the <a href="https://discord.gg/kyber" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KYBER Discord server</a></li>



<li>Navigate to <code>#download</code> channel and click "here" to download the installer</li>



<li>If the browser blocks the download, select "more info" then "download anyway"</li>



<li>Extract the downloaded <code>.zip</code> file</li>



<li>Double-click the installer <code>.exe</code> file</li>



<li>Click "Yes" when prompted to allow KYBER to modify your computer</li>



<li>Click "Next" through the installation wizard until "Finish"</li>
</ol>



<p><strong>Step 3: Antivirus Whitelisting</strong><br>Windows Security and third-party antivirus software must exclude KYBER directories to prevent false-positive threats:</p>



<ul>
<li><code>C:\Program Files (x86)\KYBER Launcher</code></li>



<li><code>C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\ArmchairDevelopers</code></li>
</ul>



<p>Access exclusions via: Windows Settings → Update &amp; Security → Windows Security → Virus &amp; Threat Protection → Manage Settings → Add or Remove Exclusions</p>



<p><strong>Step 4: EA Account Authentication</strong><br>Log in to KYBER using your <strong>EA account</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Step 5: Maxima Launcher Authorization</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Click "Open Maxima Launcher" when prompted</li>



<li>The EA App will automatically shift to <strong>Offline mode</strong> (this is intentional)</li>



<li>The EA App must remain offline or closed while playing KYBER</li>



<li>If Windows Defender prompts for network access, click "Allow"</li>



<li>To later play on the official EA servers: close KYBER, set EA App to Online, and launch normally</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Step 6: NexusMods Authorization</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Log in to NexusMods inside KYBER (do not create a new account inside KYBER)</li>



<li>In the NexusMods pop-up window, scroll down and click "Allow" to authorize</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Step 7: Joining a Server</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Go to the "Home" section to open the server browser</li>



<li>Select a server and click "Download Mods"</li>



<li>Once downloads complete, click "Play" to join</li>



<li>Mods download only once per server</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Step 8: Managing Mod Downloads</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Mods with fewer than 150 NexusMods downloads require manual search in the "Mods" tab</li>



<li><strong>Popular mods download faster</strong> (Battlefront Plus V10 Beta101 and Battlefront Expanded V7.1 host files directly on KYBER servers, bypassing NexusMods throttling)</li>



<li>Users can also download mod <code>.zip</code> files from the NexusMods website and drag-and-drop into the KYBER window for installation</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Step 9: Proximity Chat Configuration</strong><br>After launching Star Wars Battlefront II:</p>



<ul>
<li>Press "Insert" or Alt-Tab to KYBER</li>



<li>Go to "Settings" → "In-Game Settings"</li>



<li>Configure proximity chat:
<ul>
<li>Enable/disable voice</li>



<li>Adjust volume</li>



<li>Choose push-to-talk or always-on mode</li>



<li>Select audio input/output devices</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>The KYBER team had also promised to release the source code, but they asked for a little more time to make it 'more presentable'. As such, the current plan is to make it public next month (January 2026).</p>



<p>While a few members of the original development team at DICE <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-ii-developers-would-like-to-get-the-gang-back-together-for-battlefront-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are interested in making Star Wars Battlefront III</a>, it may be a long time before Lucasfilm actually gives the green light to such a project. Thankfully, the PC community at least will be served by the continued development and improvement of KYBER.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/macbook-pro-m5-with-max-config-drops-record-low-amazon-drops-margin-while-official-site-stays-full-price-2000655017</link>
            <guid>1389472</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple just came out with these M5 MacBook Pro models a few weeks ago and they’re still full price on Apple’s website, but <strong>Amazon decided to spread some holiday cheer by lowering the prices on all models to all-time lows</strong>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6538/">24GB/1TB model now costs $1,799 instead of $1,999</a>, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6538/">the 16GB/512GB model now costs $1,349 instead of $1,599</a>. This means that these M5 machines are actually cheaper than the M4 generation was when it first came out. You get here Apple’s new M5 chip, a stunning 14.2-inch Liquid display that can reach 1600 nits of brightness and a battery lasts all day. The<strong> 24GB model will be shipped before Christmas</strong>, and the 16GB model will be sent by the end of the year.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6538/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful M5 Chip</h2>
<p>The M5 processor doesn’t just make the M4 better but it also changes the way a laptop handles heavy workloads. Each GPU core now has a Neural Accelerator that speeds up AI tasks by a lot which means you can handle machine learning workloads and Apple Intelligence features at speeds that would have needed a desktop workstation just a few years ago. The 10-core CPU can easily handle everything from video editing to compiling software and the unified memory architecture means that your RAM talks directly to the processor, so there are no bottlenecks like those that happen with regular laptop designs.</p>
<p>Apple Intelligence runs completely on your device so your private information never leaves your MacBook to be processed on a cloud server. The system helps you write better, make your ideas clearer, and do repetitive tasks automatically without sending your data to Apple or anyone else. This <strong>privacy-first approach is much more important than most people think </strong>and it lets you use AI features without worrying that your emails, documents, or creative work will end up in a training dataset.</p>



<p>The <strong>14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR display has a peak brightness of 1600 nits</strong> for HDR content and a steady brightness of 1000 nits for regular use. The 1,000,000:1 contrast ratio makes blacks look really black instead of that grayish tone you see on cheaper laptop screens. The colors are also very accurate, making this a good choice for professional photo and video work.</p>
<p>The promise of a battery life that lasts all day isn’t just a marketing gimmick: This laptop works the same whether it’s plugged in or running on battery power. Most Windows laptops slow down when you unplug them to save power, but the M5’s efficiency lets you render video, compile code, or run resource-intensive creative apps at full speed for hours without needing to find an outlet. You can really take this to a coffee shop and work all day without bringing the charger.</p>



<p>The ability to <strong>work with other Apple devices makes the whole ecosystem better</strong> than any one product could do on its own: You can control your iPhone from your Mac’s screen with iPhone Mirroring which means you can reply to texts or use apps that only work on iPhones without having to pick up your phone. You can copy something on your iPhone and paste it straight into a document on your Mac. You can also start a FaceTime call on your laptop and then switch to your phone when you need to move around.</p>
<p>The 24GB/1TB model costs $1,799, and the 16GB/512GB model costs $1,349 and that’s<strong> less than what the M4 generation cost when it first came out</strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bethesda Needed a Decade to ‘Feel Comfortable’ with Creating ‘New Stuff’ in Fallout]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-fallout-a-decade-to-feel-comfortable/</link>
            <guid>1389469</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fallout is one of the most recognizable post-apocalyptic franchises in modern gaming. It has become a multimedia gem in recent years with the emergence of the live-series television show, and it boasts a lengthy lineup of titles that span almost a thirty-year history. </p>



<p>In 2004, Bethesda Game Studios acquired a license to develop Fallout 3, before purchasing the franchise outright in 2007. In the words of one of the most notable developers in the Fallout space, it wouldn’t be until Fallout 4 was developed and released almost a decade later that the team felt ‘comfortable’ with the series.</p>



<h2 id="h-getting-comfortable-with-creation-in-fallout">Getting Comfortable with Creation in Fallout</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with GamesRadar, Emil Pagliarulo, one of the Bethesda veterans who has driven the production of Fallout forward over the years, dropped a tasty titbit. He suggested that it took <strong>a long time </strong>for Bethesda to get comfortable with this legendary series, especially following the pivot that saw Fallout 3 become a transformative first-person RPG.</p>



<p>He suggested that buying the brand wasn’t enough for the company to feel as flexible and inventive as they might have wanted. In Fallout 3, it was all about paying tribute to what had come before, and it wasn’t until 2015’s Fallout 4 that the team felt more creative.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The big thing about Fallout 3 was it’s this transitional game. It was the first Fallout we had done. So we wanted to make sure we were really honoring the legacy of the franchise and those earlier games.</p>



<p>We owned it, but owning a franchise and an IP is different than feeling like you own it creatively.</p>



<p>I think by the time Fallout 4 came around we felt more comfortable with like okay, ‘we don’t have to be so reverential now, it’s not all nostalgia, we can create some new stuff.’</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Thanks to <em><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/bethesda-was-scared-of-making-fallout-3-but-by-fallout-4-it-had-chilled-out-we-dont-have-to-be-so-reverential-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a> </em>for the interview quote.</p>



<p>Perhaps Emil is forgetting the creation of Fallout Shelter, which was released just before Fallout 4 and was a pretty innovative and transformative game in itself.</p>



<p>Fallout 3 is seen as being one of the greatest games ever made. It’s a treasure trove of a title that was expanded with stellar drops for months after the game launched, and even today, it remains a fan favorite title. Fallout 4, which is by numbers a better seller than Fallout 3, wasn’t received quite as well.</p>



<p>And in the middle of that, you have Fallout: New Vegas, seen by many as the best Fallout game ever made, which Bethesda <strong>published </strong>rather than developed outright. That accolade goes to Obsidian.</p>



<p>The wider community has mixed feelings about Bethesda’s ‘treatment’ of Fallout over the years. It’s expected that the next major release in the series, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-todd-howard-confirmed-fallout-5-details/">Fallout 5</a>, won’t surface for many years, and for now, Fallout 76 and Fallout Shelter are the only games in the series receiving substantial updates.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Valve has undertaken a shake-up of sorts in the handheld gaming world, nixing production of the most affordable Steam Deck, the LCD ‘OG’ model. It was recently discovered by eagle-eyed gamers that Valve had silently posted a note on the <span>Steam Deck store page, referenc<strong>ing the end of production</strong>, with what was left representing the final stock of&nbsp;</span>the LCD model.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, we were able to add the 256GB LCD model to our basket, but who knows how many are left to purchase in Valve’s supply lines?</p>







<h2 id="h-oled-or-bust">OLED or Bust</h2>



<p>If you want a Steam Deck going forward, you’ll soon need to rely exclusively on the OLED model, which has an entry pricing point of $549 for the 512GB variant. That’s a fair reach over the 256GB LCD model, which boasts a price tag of $399 at the time of writing.</p>



<p>Of course, the OLED model is an improvement in <strong>many ways</strong>. It has a bigger, better screen, better networking capabilities, a larger battery, and a *<em>checks notes</em>* longer charging cable, amongst other things.</p>



<p>It comes as no surprise to learn that Valve is discontinuing the LCD Steam Deck, but many expected a cut-price deal to get rid of them, particularly amidst the ongoing Steam Winter Sale and the approach to the festive window. If stock is there to be cleared, then host a clearance sale!</p>



<p>Last year, when discontinuation plans started surfacing, Valve knocked 15% off the price before phasing out the 64GB LCD Steam Deck.</p>



<p>If you head over to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam’s storefront</a> and try to shop for a Steam Deck, you’ll see the small print:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are no longer producing the Steam Deck LCD 256GB model. Once sold out, it will no longer be available.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Valve is moving on to bigger and brighter things, like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-machine-everything-to-know-about-valves-new-system/">recently revealed Steam Machine</a>, a hybrid device that’s supposed to be the perfect combination of a gaming PC and a traditional home console.</p>



<p>It’s slated for a 2026 release, but nobody has the pricing structure for the thing on lock just yet.</p>







<p>Are you hoping that the Steam Deck LCD model gets a price slash so you can scoop one without breaking the bank? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="0b41a0381cbf6"><a title="Ice Climber - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0b41a0381cbf6/ice-climber-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Ho, ho, ho, everyone! Welcome to a particularly festive edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/poll-box-art-brawl-duel-mega-man-6">Last week</a> saw two covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/mega_man_6">Mega Man 6</a> going head-to-head, and it was a little closer than we expected. The yellow Japanese variant (this writer's favourite) just clinched it, however, taking 54% of the vote and leaving the North American design with the remaining 46%.</p>
<p>This time, as we get ever closer to Christmas Day, we're taking things in a festive and frosty direction, as we match up a trio of covers for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/ice_climber">Ice Climber</a>. Mainly remembered today for its frustrating controls, relationship-breaking potential and <strong>Smash Bros.</strong> fighters, this NES launch title (in North America) remains a cleverly-designed classic, and it's a beauty when it comes to box art!</p>
<p>There are three covers to choose between this week, so get your coat, gloves, and scarf on, and let's go out to meet 'em.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/retro/related-articles:30823 @ 1766322017 -->
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure data-uuid="0098cc938c330"><a title="Ice Climber - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0098cc938c330/ice-climber-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1288-ice-climber">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Gosh, these North American NES covers really are classics, eh? This one in particular is so dynamic. The leaping sprite, the stretched back hammer swing, the 'will they make it?' platform <em>just</em> out of reach, and the ice-cool polar bear all add up to a pretty iconic image. Don't even get us started on those little snowflakes falling down the black backdrop!</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure data-uuid="7d70ae1168584"><a title="Ice Climber - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7d70ae1168584/ice-climber-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1288-ice-climber">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The European design opts for something a little different. This cute, cartoon image sees a titular climber leaping up through the ice and giving a nearby polar bear and seal a nasty surprise (not enough for the former to remove its sunglasses, though). It's framed by the same black background that most European NES covers were, but still, it's a neat design.</p>
<h2>Japan</h2>
<figure data-uuid="5dd003c3ee6fe"><a title="Ice Climber - JP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5dd003c3ee6fe/ice-climber-jp.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/1288-ice-climber">Nintendo / LaunchBox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The Japanese cover uses the same design as the European counterpart, but its horizontal box means that it fills the space far better. The grey backdrop is nothing to write home about, but we still enjoy looking at that poor, shocked bear.</p>

                <p>One of the coolest Lego models themed around space exploration and technology is on sale for a new all-time low price.

This set was $154 during Amazon's Black Friday sale, so if you missed that deal, you can take advantage of an even better offer. The 1,913-piece model is only on sale for this price until December 21 at 11:59 PM PT.</p><p>It's also worth noting that Lego is discontinuing the Lunar Roving Vehicle, so this very well could be your last chance to buy it from a retail store.

Astronauts haven't set foot on the Moon since, so this replica commemorates an important piece of space exploration history.</p><p>When fully assembled, Lego's replica of the Lunar Roving Vehicle measures 15 x 10 x 5.5 inches.</p><p>The bulk of the 1,913 pieces are used to build the large LRV, but this set also has a few modular components that can be detached and displayed separately. One cool aspect with the modular builds is that Lego included display plaques with information cards for the vehicle as well as the three detachable models: Forward Chassis, Lunar Communications Relay Unit (LCRU), and Aft Pallet Assembly.</p><p>The Forward Chassis includes the gyro and odometer navigation unit and the brush that cleaned Moon dust from the vehicle. The LCRU model has the TV camera, communications antenna, and the LRV's battery pack. The Aft Pallet Assembly was used for experiments and features tools such as a drill and shovel, the Traverse Gravimeter, and a rock known as Big Muley, which was actually found on the Apollo 16 mission. The Traverse Gravimeter was used to conduct an experiment on the Moon's composition beneath the surface.</p><p>The LRV has authentic steering, suspension, and wheels. You can display the vehicle upright on its wheels, but it can also be placed upside down by rotating the wheel axles, lowering the seat backrests, and folding the front and back portions. You can see LRV upside down alongside the three modules below.</p><p>Technic vehicle models have place a far greater emphasis on mechanical components than standard Lego sets. You'll find a far larger quantity of non-traditional Lego pieces like pins and beams in these builds. This particular model is recommended for adults or experienced Lego Technic builders.</p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4626886-legotechniclrv.png" data-ref-id="1300-4626886" data-ratio="0.40909090909091" data-width="1100" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4626886-legotechniclrv.png" data-ref-id="1300-4626886"></a><figcaption>Lego Technic NASA Apollo Lunar Roving Vehicle (42182)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4626886-legotechniclrv.png"></figure><p>Another Lego Technic space-themed model deal to check out is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Building-Birthday-Imaginative-Independent/dp/B0CGY3ZB29?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">526-piece Planet Earth and Moon in Orbit</a> for $65 (was $75).

<p>Aspyr teamed up with Crystal Dynamics to make it happen, and if you're wondering if we'll see the other two entries in the "Survivor" trilogy (that's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/rise_of_the_tomb_raider">Rise of the Tomb Raider</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/shadow_of_the_tomb_raider">Shadow of the Tomb Raider</a>), we've now got an official comment.</p>
<p>According to Aspyr's product manager Jordon Reese, the "passionate response" from Nintendo fans has apparently given the team "strong encouragement" to consider more.

<p><strong>This game kicked off the Tomb Raider “Survivor” trilogy, so we need to ask the obvious question – is Aspyr interested in bringing over Rise of the Tomb Raider and Shadow of the Tomb Raider to Nintendo platforms as well?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Aspyr:</strong> "We have definitely seen this question! We’ve successfully brought back the classic era (I-VI) and now the ‘origin story’ of Lara Croft to modern Nintendo platforms. We can’t announce anything at the moment but the passionate response to this release is strong encouragement for us to continue exploring those possibilities."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, again, there's nothing to announce "at the moment", but this response has supposedly given the developer a chance to continue exploring these possibilities. As mentioned, it's also got a bit of a history now, having worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tomb_raider_i-vi_remastered">Tomb Raider I-VI</a>.</p>
<p>Of course, Aspyr's more immediate focus is to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-updates-planned-for-switch-platforms">release some improvements</a> for Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition on the Switch and Switch 2, with Reese adding how the developer wants to provide the "best possible experience for all players".</p>
<p>The same interview also confirmed Aspyr was "committed" to supporting the Switch 2 going forward – with this platform its primary target on the Nintendo front for future cross-platform releases. And as for the chance of existing Aspyr Switch games getting Switch 2 updates, there's "nothing to announce" right now, but nothing is necessarily "off the table these days".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Splinter Cell fans everywhere have been chomping at the bit for a new game in the series, but Ubisoft has left the franchise to stagnate for more than a decade. It’s getting to a point of desperation for some, especially with talk of the ‘Splinter Cell Remake’ floating around <strong>all the time</strong> with almost nothing concrete to back it up.</p>



<p>However, a recent announcement revealed that Sam Fisher is (kind of) back in an all-new way, emerging in the popular VR extraction shooter, Ghosts of Tabor.</p>







<h2 id="h-ghosts-of-tabor-x-splinter-cell-crossover">Ghosts of Tabor x Splinter Cell Crossover</h2>



<p>If you’ve ever wanted to experience the role of Sam Fisher from a VR-based perspective, now is your chance. In a new trailer uploaded by the Combat Waffle team, it was revealed that an official partnership with Ubisoft has brought Fisher’s iconic garb to the VR shooter.</p>



<p>The ‘Splinter Cell DLC’ allows players to <strong>become </strong>Sam Fisher, but elements like the gruff tones of Michael Ironside will be up to them to emulate.</p>



<p>Here’s what’s coming in the Ghosts of Tabor x Splinter Cell DLC:</p>



<ul>
<li>Karambit Melee Weapon</li>



<li>FN 57 Weapon Camo</li>



<li>MP7 Weapon Camo</li>



<li>Third Echelon NVGs</li>



<li>Third Echelon Tactical Kevlar Vest</li>



<li>Third Echelon Suit</li>
</ul>



<p>Why wait for a new game containing Sam Fisher to surface when you can dress up as him and go on a merry LARP in Ghosts of Tabor, which we once <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ghosts-of-tabor-tarkov-vr/">dubbed ‘Escape from Tarkov VR’</a>.</p>



<p>Here’s the trailer for the Splinter Cell DLC:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Ghosts of Tabor is available on Meta Quest, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1957780/Ghosts_of_Tabor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC VR</a>, and PlayStation VR, and it’s widely considered one of the best shooters to occupy the VR ecosystem. It has been around for a couple of years, and the folks at Combat Waffle are constantly updating the title with fresh content and tweaks.</p>

In addition to local multiplayer, you can play against users around the world over Wi-Fi. Like other Deluxe editions from Arcade1Up, it has a 17-inch HD display, light-up marquee, dual stereo speakers, and a faux coin door on the front.</p><p>The cabinet is roughly 61.5 inches tall, just under 19 inches wide, and weighs approximately 62 pounds.

Outside of Arcade1Up cabinets, NBA Jam has been dormant for nearly 15 years; the last home console entry, NBA Jam: On Fire Edition, released on PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2011. Thankfully, Arcade1Up's NBA Jam cabinet offers an authentic way to revisit the best entries in the series. </p></div>                      </div><hr><p>NBA Jam debuted exclusively in arcades in 1993 and was ported to consoles the following year. The Tournament Edition, which launched in 1994, is essentially an updated and expanded version of the original NBA Jam. As the name suggests, the main addition was Tournament mode. It's still 2v2 basketball, but Midway added a third player to each team, allowing you to make substitutions throughout each game. The Tournament Edition also expanded player stat categories.</p><p>NBA Hangtime was developed by the same team at Midway, just with a different title because the NBA Jam moniker was sold to Acclaim Entertainment. Midway once again expanded the rosters to five players and introduced a custom player creator, but NBA Hangtime is still very much an NBA Jam game.</p><h2>Arcade1Up 2025 Holiday Deals</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4626869-arcade1updeals.png" data-ref-id="1300-4626869" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4626869-arcade1updeals.png" data-ref-id="1300-4626869"></a><figcaption>Arcade1Up Home Arcade Cabinets</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4626869-arcade1updeals.png"></figure><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ARCADE1UP-Furious-5-Foot-Tall-Stand-up-Cabinet/dp/B0CHWWLPML?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deluxe Cabinet: Fast &amp; the Furious (2 Games)</a> -- $500 (<del>$600</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade1Up-PAC-MAN-5-foot-tall-full-size-stand-up-linux/dp/B0BYQNPTCF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deluxe Cabinet: Pac-Man (14 Games)</a> -- $450 (<del>$500</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ARCADE1UP-2-Player-Control-Machine-Cabinet-Classic/dp/B0D7JG6FFD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deluxe Cabinet: NBA Jam (3 Games)</a> -- $400 (<del>$500</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FM8L7BDJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Classic SE Cabinet: Mortal Kombat II (13 Games)</a> -- $284 (<del>$334</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FM8H6QDQ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Classic SE Cabinet: Pac-Man (13 Games)</a> -- $284 (<del>$334</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FM8KVTZB?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Classic SE Cabinet: Ms. Pac-Man (13 Games)</a> -- $284 (<del>$334</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/ARCADE1UP-GEN-R-406000-Arcade1Up-Classic-Riser/dp/B0FM8LCZWS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Classic SE Cabinet Riser</a> -- $39 (<del>$60</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade1Up-Class-Ms-PAC-Man-Galaga-Countercade/dp/B0DF3KQXS3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Countercade: Ms. Pac-Man / Galaga (3 Games)</a> -- $130 (<del>$150</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade1Up-PAC-Man-Countercade-Classic-Portable-Table-top/dp/B0DJGHWD1G?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Countercade: Pac-Man (3 Games)</a> -- $130 (<del>$150</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade1Up-Full-Size-Claw-Machine-Customizable-Entertainment/dp/B0DG44KFVL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Full-Size Claw Machine (12 Capsules)</a> -- $500 (<del>$550</del>)</li></ul><p>Two other Arcade1Up Deluxe Cabinets are <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0D7JG6FFD,B0BYQNPTCF,B0CHWWLPML,B0DG44KFVL,B0BYQ7CNHD,B0FH7JCFPT,B0CNKD3DFP,B0CBNPXDL8,B0BYQ7S68P,B0CZCR7ZYT,B0CCPR398D,B0CJSRJRBQ&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on sale at Amazon</a> and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=NBA+Jam+Deluxe+Arcade+Cabinet+On+Sale+For+Lowest+Price+Ever+At+Amazon&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-12-21+00%3A43%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-12-21+00%3A43%3A50&amp;fnarticle_id=6537125&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2F6yvQLQ&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fnba-jam-arcade1up-deluxe-home-arcade-cabinet-best-deal%2F1100-6537125%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>.

<p>Use these Roblox Farm A Fish monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Bait, Coins and much more.</p>



<p>Farm A Fish puts you in charge of your own underwater empire on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-universal-tower-defense-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a>. Unlike typical fishing games where you simply catch and sell, this aquatic tycoon challenges you to build a thriving fish farming business from scratch. Starting with just a small pond and basic equipment, you’ll expand your operation by cultivating different fish species, each with their own requirements and profit margins. The goal is to build up your ponds, gather better gear and pets, and scale your fishing business to become the most successful fisher in the game.</p>







<p>Progression in Farm A Fish revolves around the game’s primary currency, Coins, which you earn from your fish ponds and spend on new pond expansions, worker upgrades, and special items. The value of your harvests depends on several factors including fish rarity (common to mythic), fish weight (heavier specimens fetch higher prices), and special mutations that can significantly increase a fish’s worth. Although Coins can be earned through regular gameplay by selling your catches and completing quests from NPCs, the fastest way to accelerate your progress is by redeeming promo codes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-active-farm-a-fish-codes">Active Farm A Fish Codes</h2>



<ul>
<li>XMAS: 1x Christmas Bait</li>



<li>EARLY: 5x Food Scoop and 500x Coins</li>



<li>Wilco: 1x Wilco Cat and 1x Wilco Pond Skin</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-expired-farm-a-fish-codes">Expired Farm A Fish Codes</h2>



<p>There are no expired Farm A Fish Codes at the time of writing. All the released codes are still active and thus players will need to redeem them quickly before they expire.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Farm A Fish Codes Redemption Menu | Image By Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Like most Roblox games, redeeming codes in Farm A Fish is easy and rather simple. That being said, here are the steps for new players:</p>



<ol>
<li>Boot Farm A Fish on Roblox</li>



<li>Then open the Store menu on the left side of the screen</li>



<li>Scroll down until you hit the Redeem codes section</li>



<li>Enter a working code in the text box</li>



<li>Click on Redeem button to claim your rewards</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-more-farm-a-fish-codes">How To Get More Farm A Fish Codes</h2>



<p>Farm A Fish codes can typically be found through several official channels maintained by the game’s developer, Tetra Games. The most reliable source is the official Farm A Fish Discord server, where developers post new codes in the dedicated #game-updates channel whenever they release major updates or celebrate special events. This community hub is where you’ll often find codes first, sometimes even before they’re announced elsewhere.</p>







<p>Another great place to check is the official Tetra Games Roblox Group page, where the development team regularly shares news about the game, including promotional codes during milestones like reaching certain player counts or celebrating holidays. However, keeping track of all these sources can be time-consuming, especially since Farm A Fish codes don’t come with notifications when they expire. Therefore, we recommend bookmarking this guide in your browser, as it is regularly updated with the latest Farm A Fish codes and removes expired ones promptly to ensure you always have access to valid codes.</p>

<p>Use these Roblox Endzone Strike monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including draws, ball skins and much more.</p>



<p>Endzone Strike fuses high-energy anime action with American football in a unique <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-pet-capture-adventure-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> experience that’s taking the platform by storm. This isn’t your standard sports simulator – it’s a high-octane battle of special moves, character collection, and strategic team building. Players start with basic characters and limited abilities, then work their way up to fielding a squad of powerhouse athletes with flashy special attacks. Each match earns you Strike Points that serve as the game’s main currency. </p>







<p>These points are your ticket to recruiting new players through the gacha-style summoning system, upgrading existing team members, and purchasing equipment that boosts performance. While grinding matches steadily builds your team, the developers regularly release redemption codes on social media and Discord events that grant instant Strike Points, exclusive character skins, or limited-time power-ups.</p>

<p>Endzone Strike codes can usually be found on the game’s official Discord server, on the Roblox game page, and sometimes on the developer’s social media accounts. This includes the No Skill Games Discord group, where the team often shares codes during game updates, milestones, and special events. New codes typically appear during significant game updates, when the community reaches milestones (like the recent “10KMEMBERS” code celebrating 10,000 Discord members), or as compensation when there are technical issues with the game.</p>

<p>The Switch 2 has now been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-six-months-since-launch-how-would-you-rate-switch-2">available for six months</a>, and during this time, there have been multiple Switch game compatibility updates.</p>
<p>With this in mind, we've now got another batch of titles that are now fully functioning on Nintendo's new hybrid system. The highlight of the lot is the Aspyr release <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/star_wars_republic_commando">Star Wars: Republic Commando</a>, with the official Nintendo <a href="https://switch-software-compatibility.nintendo.com/en-US/details/0100fa10115f8000">compatibility search page</a> also reflecting this update.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>More Kairosoft titles have also been updated this week and are now "supported" on the Switch 2. This includes <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pocket_league_story">Pocket League Story</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/mega_mall_story_2">Mega Mall Story 2</a>. This follows other titles from this same developer being <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/multiple-switch-games-have-received-switch-2-compatibility-fixes">updated in recent weeks</a>.</p>
<p>Nintendo has also identified an issue with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shovel_knight_treasure_trove">Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove</a> tied to audio problems in some parts of the game.</p>
<p>And in case you missed it, Warner Bros. released an update earlier this week for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/batman_arkham_knight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a> featuring performance, visual and stability improvements when playing the game through backwards compatibility on the Switch 2. There are also some improvements on the original Switch.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nordprotect-online-identity-service-covers-up-to-10k-in-scam-losses-now-going-for-peanuts-2000655012</link>
            <guid>1389271</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The last shopping rush before Christmas is a great time for cybercriminals because there are so many online transactions, quick purchases, and distracted shoppers. NordProtect’s decision to lower the price of its <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5883/">identity protection service to a record low of $4.49 per month, down from its usual $14.99 rate</a>, is especially important this time of year, when prices are usually lower.</p>
<p>This isn’t just another holiday sale on electronics or entertainment subscriptions that people don’t care about: Identity theft protection deals with a basic security issue that gets worse around the holidays, when fake transactions blend in more easily with real spending patterns and stolen credentials are more actively traded on criminal networks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5883/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordProtect</a></p>
<h2>The Scale of the Problem</h2>
<p>Think about how bad identity theft is in the United States right now. According to the Federal Trade Commission, consumers lost $12.5 billion to fraud last year alone. This is a 25% increase from the year before. In 2024, the agency handled more than 1.1 million identity theft complaints. This means that a new victim came forward every 22 seconds throughout the year.</p>
<h3>Identity Theft by the Numbers</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Every 22 seconds:</strong> A new identity theft case occurs in the United States</li>
<li><strong>1.1 million:</strong><span> Identity theft complaints filed with the FTC in 2024</span></li>
<li><strong>$12.5 billion:</strong><span> Total consumer losses to fraud in the past year</span></li>
<li><strong>44%:</strong><span>&nbsp;Percentage of identity theft cases involving credit card fraud</span></li>
</ul>
<p>These risks are even higher during the holidays: More people shopping online means more chances for data theft, and when there are a lot of legitimate transactions, it’s harder to spot fake charges right away. Phishing attempts that look like shipping notifications or seasonal sales alerts are on the rise, and retailers and payment processors are at greater risk of breaches because their infrastructure is under stress and they have to hire temporary workers.</p>
<h2>How Protection Really Works</h2>
<p>Instead of checking identities by hand every so often, NordProtect uses continuous automated surveillance. You can <a href="https://gizmodo.com/best-vpn/nordvpn/nordprotect">read Gizmodo’s review here to learn more about it</a>. <strong>NordProtect checks credit reports from all three major bureaus</strong>, looks for personal information on dark web marketplaces, and keeps an eye on linked financial accounts for strange activity.</p>
<p>The part that watches the dark web is especially important: There are parts of the internet (dark web) where stolen Social Security numbers, credit card numbers, and full identity packages are traded. When your information shows up in these places, it usually means that there has been a security breach in one of the services you use. Early detection is important because it gives you time to lock down accounts before criminals can use the information.</p>
<p><strong>TransUnion’s credit monitoring service</strong> can catch things like new loan applications, account openings, or changes to your credit limit that you didn’t authorize. The system marks these events right away instead of waiting for monthly reviews of credit reports. When you monitor your bank account, you can spot strange withdrawal patterns, suspicious transfer requests, or debit card use that isn’t safe.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5883/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordProtect</a></p>
<p>The value proposition goes beyond just alerts: NordProtect gives you specific instructions on what to do when it finds a problem. If your email is part of a data breach, you will be told which accounts need new passwords, which security questions need to be changed, and whether or not two-factor authentication should be turned on. The service explains how to dispute charges that are not real and how to freeze your credit if they do.</p>
<h2>Financial Protection That Goes Beyond Monitoring</h2>
<p>Most people don’t realize how much it costs to recover from identity theft until they have to deal with it directly. For example, hiring a lawyer to fight fraudulent accounts can cost hundreds of dollars per hour. If you have to take time off work to deal with banks, creditors, and credit bureaus, you will lose money. And the costs of traveling to meet with law enforcement or financial institutions in person add up.</p>
<p><strong>NordProtect covers up to $1 million in identity theft recovery costs</strong>, including legal fees, lost wages, and documented costs related to restoring your identity and credit score.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5883/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See NordProtect</a></p>
<p>Extra parts of insurance cover certain types of threats that aren’t usually covered by identity theft: Cyber extortion coverage pays up to $50,000 for cases of blackmail or ransom demands. Online fraud protection will pay up to $10,000 for money that is stolen directly from bank accounts or credit cards through digital scams. These amounts of coverage show how much damage advanced attacks can do.</p>
<p>Access to dedicated case management may be more valuable than money: When someone steals your identity, NordProtect sends a U.S.-based expert to handle the whole recovery process. This case manager talks to credit bureaus, files reports with banks and the police, keeps track of dispute deadlines, and keeps an eye on the case until it is resolved.</p>
<h2>The Cost of Preventing</h2>
<p>NordProtect is currently charging $4.49 a month, which is 71% less than the normal price and it is the lowest price the service has ever been offered at. This makes full identity protection cheaper than most streaming subscriptions or a single trip to a coffee shop. The service comes<strong> with a 30-day money-back guarantee</strong>&nbsp;so you don’t have to worry about losing money if it doesn’t meet your security needs.</p>
<p>Look at this cost next to the possible costs of recovery. The<em> Identity Theft Resource Center</em> says that people who have their identities stolen spend an average of 200 hours trying to fix the problem. Even at a low hourly wage, this means thousands of dollars in lost productivity. When you add up the costs of hiring a lawyer, buying credit monitoring services after the fact, and possible losses from fake transactions, prevention is much cheaper than reaction.</p>

Every game has its limitations, there is only so many actions you can take, narrative threads to unspool, buttons to press. What about a game that you can only play one round of every day? A game where you "take up the sword against an NPC or another girl-esque thing irl and fight until one of you is holding the lifeless, bloodstained hand of the other." This is the description of a tiny, visceral Yuri Game Jam game called Everyday Sororicide.
</p>
<p>
Developed by Blood Machine and Snek Remilia Ketter, Everyday Sororicide is self-described as a "tragic attempt at conveying the feeling of interacting with another girl on any level beyond superficiality." It is also a game of duels, as mentioned above, to the death. A 1v1 me on Final Destination, not items kind of game, each character bequeathed a sword with which you have a handful of actions. Stab, feint, dodge, jump, slam down, it is simple, yet particular; you have to watch for an opening, the girl-esque thing in front of you won't go down easily, all while drone music blares increasingly aggressively at you.

<p>
In its solo mode, you can only play it a single time a day. That's all. It is defiant in its structure, unwilling to bend to your wants of discovering more, of learning why these women feel such desperation to fight each other, of discovering a secret you didn't know you sought after. There's a mystery here made more tantalising by its refusal to be uncovered quickly.
</p><p>
That isn't to say this is a game you can only play once a day, as it actually has a multiplayer mode in which you can do battle with a mate, or, maybe someone you have a toxic situationship with. Seems like the right kind of game for such an activity.
</p>
<p>
If you too would like to figure out how to interact with another girl, you can pick up Everyday Sororicide on <a href="https://snekofspice.itch.io/everyday-sororicide">itch.io</a> for free.

            <p>
The thing about Big Business these days is that when you get Big Numbers, that normally leads to Bigger Business, right up to the point the well has not only dried up, but turned to dust. So, when you have a game like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, now winner of many Geoff Keighleys and seller of many copies, you might assume that developer Sandfall Interactive would increase the size of their operations. Apparently, you would be wrong!
</p>
<p>
As part of Edge's Knowledge newsletter (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/we-love-making-games-more-than-we-love-managing-clair-obscur-expedition-33-lead-says-its-good-to-have-limitations-so-the-rpg-studio-wont-scale-up-for-any-future-projects/">GamesRadar</a>), director Guillaume Broche was asked about whether the studio's next project would be a "larger-scale production," to which he responded: "No, I think it's good to have limitations when you are creative. It's the best way to be the best version of yourself."
</p>
<p>
He continued, "We could scale up now that we have a lot more money, but I would say it's not tempting for us, because even the management team and myself, we'd have to be hands-on and doing things for ourselves." Perhaps my favourite bit of the interview is where Broche says that they "love making games more than we love managing, so we want to keep doing that. These past five years were some of the best of my life, and I want to be happy like that again."
</p>
<p>
Of course, it's still important to remember that discourse causing bit about the fact that Clair Obscur <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-clair-obscur-expedition-33-wasnt-made-by-30-people">wasn't made by just 30 people</a>, so it's not like the game was made by a teeny, tiny group of folks. Expansion may still happen, including through utilising more outsourced studios, but it's still nice to hear a company not chasing the money for once.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Indie Game Awards took place on December 18, and, as many could assume, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-indie-game-awards-2025-all-award-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took home the awards</a> for Game of the Year and Debut Game. However, things have changed and The Indie Game Awards are making a big decision to strip the Clair Obscur and developer Sandfall Interactive of their awards over the use of gen AI in the game.</p>



<p>In an announcement made on Saturday afternoon, Six One Indie, the creators of the show, said that it’s removal comes after the discovery after voting was done, and the show was recorded.</p>







<p><strong>“The Indie Game Awards have a hard stance on the use of gen AI throughout the nomination process and during the ceremony itself,”</strong> <a href="https://www.indiegameawards.gg/faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the statement reads</a>. <strong>“When it was submitted for consideration, representatives of Sandfall Interactive agreed that no gen AI was used in the development of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“In light of Sandfall Interactive confirming the use of gen AI on the day of the Indie Game Awards 2025 premiere, this does disqualify Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 from its nomination.”</strong></p>



<p>Six One Indie ended by thanking the community for being patient and providing feedback on the situation.</p>



<p><strong>“The organizational team behind the ceremony is a small crew with big ambitions, and The Indie Game Awards can only grow with your help and support,”</strong> they said. <strong>“We already can’t wait for the 2026 ceremony!”</strong></p>







<p>With Clair Obscur’s disqualification, the awards will now go to the runner ups. That means the award for Debut Game goes to Sorry We’re Closed while Game of the Year now goes to Blue Prince.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Most years, when looking around at the best sports and racing games of the year, the list is dominated by annual releases, partly because they are sometimes the only sports and racing games to hit shelves in the last twelve months. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/best-sports-racing-games-of-2024-switching-gears/">Our list for 2024's best sports and racing games</a></strong> can certainly be defined by that, but 2025 is a different beast.</p>



<p>In fact, 2025 was a standout year for sports games and racing games, the likes of which we're not used to seeing. With that said, let's dig into our top picks for 2025. Oh, and don't forget to vote for your own favorite game in the poll at the end of the article!</p>



<p><em>Other Best Games of 2025 per Category:<a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2025-a-relentless-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <strong>Action</strong></a></em>, <strong><em><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2025-old-and-new-challengers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fighting Games</a></em></strong></p>



<h2 id="h-mario-kart-world-8-5-10">Mario Kart World (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/">8.5/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/16x9-MarioKartWorld.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Mario Kart World was the first brand-new Mario Kart game since Mario Kart 8 on the Wii U.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The first brand-new Mario Kart game since Mario Kart 8 on the Wii U, Mario Kart World was an expansive return for the franchise and <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-launching-exclusively-on-nintendo-switch-2/">the major first-party Nintendo launch title for the Nintendo Switch 2</a>. It brought the series out of its tried-and-true racing formula and put players into a vast open world, littered with collectibles for players to find, mini-challenges, and the chance to just drive over to every track included in the game.</p>



<p>Grand Prix race tracks are connected with long-winding roads, rather than the game cutting to a loading screen and lining up all of the cars at the starting track. You could now also control your vehicle like it's a Tony Hawk game, with grindrails and tricks impacting gameplay to such a degree that we've seen shortcut clips that would've previously only been possible by actually glitching through the game.</p>



<p>All of that sounds great, and for the most part, it is, but the big question around it was<a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/"> whether it was worth $80 or not</a>, as Mario Kart World was also the first Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive title to bump up game prices by another $10.</p>



<p>While only you can decided for yourself if a game is worth the price of admission, Wccftech's Nathan Birch summarizes the game quite well in his review, writing, "<em>Mario Kart World is a bold and ambitious new entry in the world’s most popular racing franchise, delivering smartly updated mechanics, a collection of gorgeous courses, and an open world that impresses with its scope and variety. Admittedly, the game doesn’t quite manage to eclipse the giant that is Mario Kart 8 and some classic modes don’t mesh perfectly with the new sandbox approach, but there’s no denying Mario Kart World gets the Switch 2 off to a peppy start.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-3-4-8-5-10">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review/">8.5/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Tony-Hawk-Pro-Skater-34-Review-1.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 rounded out the remasters for the first four Tony Hawk games.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Speaking of doing tricks like Tony Hawk, 2025 also saw Activision round out the remasters of the first four Tony Hawk Pro Skater games with Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4, though this time it was Iron Galaxy at the helm of its development, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-remake-was-planned-before-vicarious-visions-got-merged-into-blizzard/">after Vicarious Visions was swallowed up by Blizzard.</a></p>



<p>Though it's not exactly the straightforward remaster/remake in the same way that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tony-hawks-pro-skater-12-feeling-younger-in-my-mind/">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1+2</a> was, due to how much about Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 was changed, it is still able to capture the fun of those skating games and provide more than a solid escape for anyone wanting to revisit those titles.</p>



<p>As I said in my review, "<em>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4 is a successful remaster for anyone wanting to shut out the world and grind away your problems for a while, and remember simpler times. The classic Tony Hawk gameplay only seems to have gotten better with age, and the custom parks are sure to keep you skating for hours after you've washed the career mode. Even though it's not a faithful remaster of THPS 4, and your mileage may vary on the soundtrack, any fan of the series would do themselves a disservice to skip out on grabbing this remaster bundle.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-sonic-racing-crossworlds-8-10">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/sonic-racing-crossworlds/">8/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Sonic-Racing-CrossWorlds-1.png"></a><figcaption><em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds made 2025 the year of the kart racer.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Yet another kart racer on the list, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds arrived later in the year to try and give Mario Kart World a run for its money. Depending on who you ask, it did exactly that, as it is an incredibly fast game stuffed to the brim with character collaborations and the kind of structure kart racing fans are more used to seeing.</p>



<p>While Mario Kart World looked to try something new, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds went for tried-and-true methods and tried to polish them to a near-perfect shine. It may not have perfectly hit its mark, but it at the very least brushed Mario Kart in a way that Nintendo would do well to remember. Because the next time a Sonic game and a Mario Kart game go head-to-head, the plumber's reign may just be toppled by a blue blur.</p>



<p>Nathan Birch's review summarized how close Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds gets perfectly, writing, "<em>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds is a solid alternative to other games in the mascot-racer space, offering speedy, stripped-down action, a few clever twists, and perhaps most importantly for some folks, courses that feel more like those in Mario Kart 8 than the less universally-beloved Mario Kart World. A general lack of content and originality keeps CrossWorlds from fully breaking away from the pack, but it’s at least in striking distance of the winner’s circle.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-f1-25-8-10">F1 25 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/f1-25-review/">8/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/F1-25.png"></a><figcaption><em>EA Sports F1 25. Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The only annualized sports game in our top five list, F1 25 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-f1-26-not-happening-f1-25-major-expansion-f1-27/">which won't actually count as an annualized release next year since EA and Codemasters are skipping F1 26</a>), is able to inch into the list on the back of its established formula and known pedigree.</p>



<p>EA and Codemasters would have to actively sabotage the game at this point to turn out a bad one, and while it's a more than fair criticism to point out how little each new installment improves on the last when they are pumped out on a yearly basis, that doesn't diminish the overall quality on display.</p>



<p>As Wccftech's Chris Wray puts it in his review, "<em>F1 25 is a good game, make no mistake about that. With a near flawless presentation, improved my team mode, and additional features, there's a lot to do. There are a few pitfalls here and there, but nothing that takes away from what is another genuinely good release by Codemasters.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-rematch-7-5-10">Rematch (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">7.5/10</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Rematch-Key-Art.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Rematch. Image credit: Sloclap</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The one entry on the list that isn't about what you can do on four wheels, Rematch, was a breath of fresh air in terms of the kinds of football games we're accustomed to. Sifu developer Sloclap took its experience in making extremely detailed, well-animated physical bodies that move with precision, and adapted that to a 3v3, 4v4, and 5v5 arcade football game that plays like someone having the idea of taking the cars out of Rocket League and shrinking the ball down to the size a human would need.</p>



<p>Its launch was unfortunately <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-pushes-hotfix-for-rematch-network-stability-issues-as-rematch-hits-1-million-unique-players-in-first-24hrs/">marred by technical issues</a>, matchmaking problems, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-rematch-wont-support-cross-play-at-launch/">a lack of cross-play that was not announced until hours before the game would actually release</a>. It has improved on all of those fronts, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/rematch-crossplay-support-live-patch-3/">full cross-play support now included</a> and several bug-fixing updates having been pushed.</p>



<p>But it's unfortunate that these issues, along with a few issues with the UI/UX, caused it to stumble from the start, because outside of those problems, Rematch is arguably one of the best sports games to hit the market in years.</p>



<p>As I wrote in my review, "<em>Rematch is arguably the best sports game I've played in years, and that comes down to the air-tight mechanics at the core of its gameplay, and how good it feels to dribble, make a pass, take a shot, or make a save - all of which wonderfully balances its 3v3, 4v4, and 5v5 game modes. It's tackled at the knees by everything around that core gameplay, from its poor UI/UX menu design, to its uninspired visual style and the fact that it currently lacks any offline game modes, and, at least at launch, the several networking issues and bugs that plague the experience</em>."</p>

<h2 id="h-honourable-mentions">Honourable Mentions</h2>



<p>The five games above are our top picks for the year overall, but there are still a few games worth mentioning that didn't make the cut. If you're a fan of sports and racing games, you would do well to check out these games, too.</p>

            <p>
The end of a very short era is here! I guess, if you care about the life cycles of tech products made by multi-billion dollar companies. It appears that the days of the original LCD model of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/steam-deck">Steam Deck</a> is coming to an end, as a quiet notice from Valve suggests their focus will be with the slightly newer, shinier OLED line of handheld gaming devices.
</p>
<p>
As spotted by <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/12/valve-discontinuing-the-last-steam-deck-lcd-model/">GamingOnLinux</a>, heading to the store page for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamdeck">Steam Deck</a> sees you being greeted with the usual spiel about how good it is, the games you can play on it, which models you can buy, and now, this note: "We are no longer producing the Steam Deck LCD 256GB model. Once sold out, it will no longer be available." That kind of says it all really, but essentially, if you were putting off buying one, don't like buying tech second hand, and aren't particularly fussed about screen quality, there's your warning.
</p>
<p>
The original Steam Deck, this LCD model, launched back in February, 2022, so we're coming up to its fourth anniversary. Our own James <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-review">liked it quite a lot back then</a>, and then a little under two years after it launched <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-announce-the-steam-deck-oled-with-an-upgraded-screen-and-longer-battery-life">Valve announced the OLED model</a>. No real surprise there considering those Nintendo guys did the same thing, the difference there being they're still shifting original Switches alongside the OLED upgrade. I can only assume that Valve just aren't selling enough of the LCD version to justify its continued production.
</p>
<p>
Of course, the next big thing for Valve right now is their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">new attempt at a Steam Machine</a>. A new Steam Deck will surely come at some point, though according to the House of Gabe, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/youll-have-to-keep-waiting-for-a-steam-deck-2-because-valve-says-the-tech-isnt-there-for-it-just-yet">you'll be waiting a while longer for it</a>. Perhaps an LCD model is all any of us really need right now.

Yes, I’m cliché and enjoy the holidays for the warmth and celebrations they bring, but today I’m more interested in reflecting on the evolution of accessibility throughout 2025. And thankfully, this year brought improvements to long-standing franchises, as well as surprise additions to the triple-A and indie scenes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From my perspective, there were no accessibility moments that revolutionized the industry in 2025. Instead, the year demonstrated a continuous evolution of what disabled players have rightfully come to expect when purchasing a new release. In my opinion, no one game has been better than another, especially in terms of innovation, but that’s not to say this year didn’t surprise me in unexpected ways. So, for this <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/columns/access-designed">Access Designed</a>, let’s explore some of my favorite examples of accessibility during 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: and Roger</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/best-accessible-games-2025-and-roger-1765286660135.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>This section contains mild spoilers for and Roger.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The inclusion of TearyHand Studio’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/and-roger">and Roger</a> on my list may surprise some. This roughly hour-long visual novel features numerous quick-time events that guide you through the loving memories of Sofia and her husband, Roger, as Sofia succumbs to dementia. Each minigame puts you directly in control of Sofia as she completes everyday tasks like brushing her teeth, making soup, or looking through old photographs. While these may seem mundane activities, Sofia’s dementia makes each simple event feel like a monumental task. And for disabled players, the intensity of the QTEs is exacerbated by the game’s notable lack of accessibility features.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And Roger features no accessibility tools to help you complete the game. There are no alternatives to finishing QTEs, options to skip them, or settings that have the game natively complete them for you like in this year's Assassin’s Creed Shadows. You are forced to continuously mash or perfectly drag a white button for every single QTE, something that was immensely exhausting with my physical disabilities. Yet, after completing an event within the first chapter that had Sofia push Roger’s hand away by rapidly mashing a button on the screen, I realized its inaccessibility made the experience much more powerful.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And Roger, through its lack of accessibility, made me reevaluate how I critique games, something I’ve been professionally doing for six years. Sofia’s struggles with dementia were far more pronounced when I was struggling with her. And in an industry where proper disability representation is still relatively lacking, and Roger masterfully captures the truest expression of disability. There are moments of love, grief, pain, joy, and suffering – all emotions I’ve personally felt or witnessed disabled friends and family experience. I have never played a game so dedicated to having, and occasionally forcing, the disabled experience on the players, thus making and Roger one of my favorite games of not only 2025, but of all time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up: EA Sports FC 26</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/best-accessible-games-2025-ea-sports-fc-26-1765286682630.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I will be the first to admit I don’t like sports games. The genre just doesn’t appeal to me, which is admittedly ironic considering I live in a very sports-centric city. Yet, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ea-sports-fc-26">EA Sports FC 26</a> made me appreciate soccer games (football for non-Americans) because of its incredible attention to accessibility detail.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">FC 26, like most games with accessibility offerings, provides customizable controls, subtitles, and colorblindness settings. However, I appreciated the features for varying gameplay assists. Shooting, passing, defending, switching, and dribbling all have their own settings to provide relief during extended play sessions. When I was too fatigued to properly shoot, I would activate Auto Shots, which would trigger as I came close to the goal. If passing becomes too much, I can simply increase the sensitivity, making the game natively pass the ball without the need for immense precision. Even as the goalkeeper, I can use assists to help with saves. And for longer sessions, I can activate one or two button control schemes, significantly reducing the number of inputs needed to play (unfortunately, one and two button use cannot be used in competitive play).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet, FC 26’s greatest accessibility achievement doesn’t impact my disability. For the first time in the series, as well as in a competitive multiplayer setting, players can activate High Contrast Mode. Everything from the home team, away team, referees, to even ball color can be customized to increase their contrast. This provides blind players with crucial visual information when playing frantic matches. It’s easy to lose control of player and ball position when matches become intense, especially with online PvP, but FC 26 redefines what accessibility can be in the competitive scene. The potential to challenge industry perspectives for competitive games is why FC 26 deserves a spot among the most accessible games of 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winner: Doom: The Dark Ages</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/best-accessible-games-2025-doom-the-dark-ages-1765286697173.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>, id Software’s latest in the iconic FPS series, is by far my favorite entry, as well as its most accessible. While the newest game includes relatively common accessibility options like customizable controls, adjustable subtitles, and varying difficulty modes, The Dark Ages adds new tools that redefine accessibility in this fast-paced game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shooters like Doom rely on immense speed and precision to slaughter enemies and complete levels. You are constantly dodging enemy fire, sprinting through levels, jumping over obstacles, and switching weapons within your extensive arsenal to play the game. And if you don’t have the strength or stamina to perform any of the above, the gameplay formula becomes abysmally inaccessible, even with lowered difficulty settings. But The Dark Ages has a solution: it introduces modifiers that adjust game speed, enemy projectile speed, enemy aggression, player damage, and even enemy damage. Further, The Dark Ages includes options to change the parry windows for melee encounters. Every piece of the combat system is customizable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With accessibility, there’s often this incorrect notion within Internet spaces that options and inclusive designs ruin the intended gaming experience. The Dark Ages completely nullifies this argument with its customizable settings, which indicate that the "artistic intent" is the experience that you as a player want to have. There's no punishment for modifying the experience. Whether you have a disability or not, you control how you play. Are you a masochist that enjoys frantically throwing yourself against an onslaught of demons? Simply adjust every setting listed above to maximize their values. In my case, I would customize parry windows and game speed if I was particularly tired, but would find myself increasing enemy aggression for more of a challenge. I’ve never played a game that allows me to fine-tune every aspect of combat, and that is why Doom: The Dark Ages is my game of the year for 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These three games represent only a fraction of the excellent accessible titles throughout 2025. Assassin’s Creed Shadows, South of Midnight, Split Fiction, and even Kirby Air Riders all deserve credit for their accessible tools and designs. And while the three games listed above are my personal favorite, 2025 has arguably been my favorite year as a critic, not for the innovations, but for the continued dedication to disabled players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Grant Stoner is a disabled journalist covering accessibility and the disabled perspective in video games.
