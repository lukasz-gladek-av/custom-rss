			<p>The development team behind Skyblivion, the total conversion mod that seeks to recreate The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion in Skyrim, has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LwUibq6wBn4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> a new progress update to celebrate the advent of the new year. As you probably remember, 2025 is the year they had <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-total-conversion-mod-officially-set-for-2025-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">designated</a> for the long-awaited release, and this was confirmed in the new video.&nbsp;Then, the team focused on the progress of specific areas:</p>
<p><em>We're finalizing the world map with only the Nibenay region on Cyrodiil's eastern border left to complete. Massive swathes of the map are ready for the hero of Kvatch to explore.</em></p>
<p>Most of the landscapes have been completed (though they still need to be fully navmeshed to allow NPCs to properly navigate the areas). The only exceptions are the Nibenay Valley (268 out of 300 cells completed), the Nibenay Basin (289 out of 674 cells done). As such, 93% of the cells in Skyblivion are ready, though only 44% are navmeshed. The team is still looking for new volunteer recruits to speed up the navmeshing process. Likewise, they put out a shout for 3D artists with a specialty in plants, as only 74 of the 118 3D plant objects have been remade so far.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Path To Release (Skyblivion Roadmap 2024)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LwUibq6wBn4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Many quests were implemented in 2024. In last year's update, the team still needed to add over a hundred quests; now, only six haven't had work on them started yet. As for music, the team has not only ported all the music from Oblivion, but they also added 24 new tracks: one for each region of Cyrodiil, three new dungeon exploration tracks, three new night exploration tracks, two new boss fight themes, and three new atmospheric tracks that will play when roaming through Oblivion realms.</p>
<p>Lastly, Skyblivion was always meant to include the DLCs, such as the large expansion Shivering Isles. However, they likely won't be available when the mod launches:</p>
<p><em>A note on Shivering Isles and the other big DLC. We are currently focused on the main game experience to ensure it is released on time. Once the main game of Skyblivion is released, we will look into how we can tackle DLCs.</em></p>
<p>There have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors</a> of an official The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remaster from Bethesda. That would be a bit of a wrench in the team's plans, though there's no official confirmation for the time being.</p>

            <p>
Happy new year all! And what better way to kick off another undignified 12 month crawl toward the next Xmas holiday than with the news that one of my favourite dark fantasy storybook extravaganzas, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghost-of-a-tale">Ghost Of A Tale</a>, is getting a sequel.</p>
<p>The newness of this news is in question, admittedly. Developer Lionel "Seith" Gallat and his team have been working on another helping of haunted mouseketeering since 2022. But this is the first time they've properly blogged about it, sharing details of a gruelling switchover to Unreal Engine 5 and a couple of new screens. They still haven't updated the title to make the obvious pun, but perhaps a title as pungent with whimsy as "Ghost Of A Tail" is beyond the trumpeted capabilities of Unreal Engine 5.

</p><!--more-->
<p>
If you've not had the pleasure, Ghost Of A Tale is sort of a whole game set inside the Undead Parish of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>, except that it's also sort of set in Redwall. You are an incarcerated mouse minstrel, Tilo, who must escape a monstrous clifftop fortress full of gangly rat guards. Along the way, you'll plunder spider nests, strike deals with reclusive alchemists, practice songs with preening rat lords, don some fetching disguises, and unravel some surprisingly well-imagined species prejudice, rooted in a mythological battle against an apocalyptic Green Flame. 
</p>
<p>
There's a sparkling cast of anthropomorphic animals with jovial character portraits, some absurdly handsome, tumbledown environments, and a fair bit of fun writing. The stealth kind of sucks, mind, but it's nothing you won't forgive when you're handed a quest to identify mushrooms in a sun-dappled courtyard using a parchment fungipedia. Redwall and Dark Souls aside, the game's other inspirations include The Secret of NIMH, Ico (probably the more natural comparison than From Software's output, here), The Dark Crystal, and Zelda. The words "love" and "lovely" appear no less than eight times in John Walker's (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ghost-of-a-tale-is-a-stealthy-rpg-with-bright-whiskers">review</a> from 2018. 
</p><p>
The original game ran in Unity, and that's the engine they were using for the sequel, to begin with. Seith - a former DreamWorks animator - and his collaborators have also developed a new in-house tool for quests and dialogue - the "previous off-the-shelf tool was little more than a glorified text editor", apparently.
</p>
<p>
The game had been in development for a "couple of years" before the team found that Unity wasn't cutting the mustard. "We were spending more time fighting the engine rather than actually creating gameplay systems and assets," Seith <a href="https://www.ghostofatale.com/were-back/">writes in the blog post</a>. So he decided to switch to Unreal Engine 5, despite "not having liked at all the earlier 4.x iterations", after talking it out with designer Paul Gardner and programmer Cyrille Paulhiac.
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/2_tHsyFBf.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>SeithCG</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Changing to a different game engine mid-production "almost never happens in the industry because the consequences are too dire to contemplate," Seith notes in the blog post. "Normally you would have to go through a storm of unpleasant meetings, convince the heads of the studio, look producers and investors in the eye and say 'we need to scrap those last couple of years of development and start again from scratch'. Unthinkable!
</p><p>
"Thankfully in our case it turned out Paul and Cyrille were willing to trust me and bite the bullet," he goes on. "Still, Cyrille was doing a lot of the back-end pipeline like data management, saving/loading system and authoring tools and it meant for him to ditch everything he knew and had accomplished in C# and move on to C++. Not an easy prospect by any stretch of the imagination."
</p>
<p>
Gardner, meanwhile, had "to revert to early stages of testing and participate again [in] the initial development of a new system of dialogs and quests, intricately interwoven with game design" but thankfully, investing in their own tools for dialogue and quests "meant that the nature of Paul's writing work wouldn't be affected too much by the game engine change." 
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/3_hsfvOu4.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>SeithCG</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
The reset has also given Seith and his collaborators a chance "to refocus on the game's strengths and essence, which we might not have done had we kept on plowing ahead as initially planned". 
</p>
<p>
Changing to Unreal Engine 5 has involved a "lost" year and a half of development time, Seith concludes, "but I'm very glad to say today that it was all well worth the time, pain and money. We're now at a stage we would never have reached with the previous engine." You can assess the results yourself by means of the screenshots, creatively dotted around this article like mice peeking over parapets.
</p>
<p>
I've given Ghost Of A <strike>Tail</strike> Tale much love over the years, though as with many games I cherish, I'm not sure I've ever written anything that measures up to my enthusiasm. It's the first and only game my life partner has ever watched me play from intro to credits. What I want from the sequel is: make the stealth a more organic part of exploration and questing, and less of an irksome capital-S system (with grating encounter music) you have to appease along the way to the Good Stuff. Do clevererer things with disguises, too. And give me an even more elaborate mushroom-picking quest. I wouldn't object if the entire experience were about foraging.

            <title><![CDATA[Our Most Wanted Games of 2025 – #50 to #46]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/02/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-50-to-46/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-%E2%80%93-50-to-46.1072521/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/02/our-most-wanted-games-of-2025-50-to-46/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>That’s that then. 2024 is officially consigned to the history books – no doubt a year that will be extensively studied – and we are now in 2025, which means we look forward to the games that we are hoping will delight us in the coming twelve months.</p>
<p>As a team, we’ve discussed all the big games we’re expecting this year and now bring you our top 50. Today. we’ll be looking at which games come in at 50 to 46. There’s a bit of horror, a bit of action, a bit of over-the-top shenanigans too!</p>
<h2>50 – Cronos: The New Dawn</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2025</em></p>


<p>Kicking off the list is Bloober Team’s Cronos: The New Dawn. Coming off the back of a successful and well received <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/silent-hill-2-2024-review/">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, there will be much anticipation for Bloober’s next foray into the survival horror.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn - Official Cinematic Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ibQP4F8SyeA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn has time travel at its core, with your character being a Traveler. This Traveler goes back to the past, where the world falls to an event called The Change which has killed much of humanity and turned the remnants into monsters. As a Traveler, you scour the future for rifts to travel to 1980’s Poland looking key people and bringing their Essence to the future. However, the job won’t be easy and every encounter with an enemy will be extremely dangerous. Get ready for some scary timey-wimey stuff.</p>

<h2>49- The First Berserker: Khazan</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 27th March 2025</em></p>
<p>Sometimes, you just want a violent, revenge story to dive right into, and it looks like The First Berserker: Khazan will be that game. Ben Starr, the iconic voice behind Final Fantasy XVI’s Clive Rosfield, has been cast as General Khazan. General Khazan is betrayed by his Emperor and exiled to the the mountains, where he nearly dies. However, after surviving he merges with the Blade Phantom, and sets out for revenge.</p>
<p><iframe title="The First Berserker: Khazan - Early 2025 Launch Reveal Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nvdSisTLPhg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The world of The First Berserker: Khazan will be merciless. Set in the Dungeon &amp; Fighter universe, every foe will provide a challenge in combat. Bosses will be even tougher, and defeat will come easily to those who are not prepared for it.</p>
<h2>48 – Bionic Bay</h2>
<p><em>PS5, PC – 13th March 2025</em></p>
<p>Bionic Bay is a platformer that looks like it will be combining a lot of elements to bring a challenging experience for players. The game will feature abilities to slow down time momentarily, flip gravity, and teleport to avoid dangers. You will also use these abilities to open up and create paths to move forward.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Bionic Bay - Gameplay First Look Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jpaMbI7Awqg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>From the trailer, it looks like Bionic Bay will really test player skills and reactions, as well as expect puzzle solving to figure out how to pass obstacles. The most exciting looking part though has to be the online racing, where you compete against others to run through courses in the quickest time. It looks like absolutely exhilarating carnage. You can grab the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1928690/Bionic_Bay/">Bionic Bay demo</a> on Steam.</p>
<h2>47 – Revenge of the Savage Planet</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, XBO, PC – May 2025</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/01/27/journey-to-the-savage-planet-review/">Journey to the Savage Planet</a> was a fun time, pitting players on a hostile world and leaning right into the comedy. Revenge of the Savage Planet looks like it will continue right in that vein, but with one major change to the gameplay. Where Journey was a first person title, Revenge of the Savage Planet will be in third person.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Revenge of the Savage Planet Gameplay Preview | PC Gaming Show" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7WQ8EEDycDk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Revenge of the Savage Planet looks colourful and chaotic, but with plenty of danger to watch out for. You will need to shoot, scavenge, and upgrade to survive after being abandoned by Alta Interglobal. Interestingly, there is not just one savage planet to learn to survive on. There are four this time around, all enjoyable on your own or in co-op.</p>
<h2>46 – Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PS4, XBO, PC – 21st February 2025</em></p>
<p>The Yakuza/Like A Dragon series is as much known for its leftfield side quests and spin offs, as it is for its more serious crime stories. Yet, Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii may just be the most out there for the series, and placing Goro Majima as a pirate captain with his own ship. It is bonkers and fits the character of Majima so well, who is probably only second to Kiryu when it comes to the franchise’s cast.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GCmDF0NqZQc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii is a spin off set after the events of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/25/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-will-let-you-build-your-dream-home-holiday-island/">Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>. In this spin off, Majima has lost all of his memories and wakes up on a desert island. Soon, after he is the captain of his own pirate ship, engaging in naval battles with other pirate captains, and setting foot on a pirate enclave known as Madlantis. Combat will be more of the classic action style of Yakuza, rather than the turn based of Like A Dragon, and we are expecting the story to be both bonkers and full of feeling when it drops anchor.</p>
<p><em>Come back tomorrow for another batch of hot upcoming titles!</em></p>

<p>Game Science’s CEO and Founder has confirmed that the Xbox port for Black Myth Wukong didn’t arrive due to optimization issues on the Series S.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1hrajzb/black_myth_wukongs_game_director_confirms_the/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>, Yocar-Feng ji, CEO and Founder of Game Science, recently took to the Chinese social media app, <a href="https://m.weibo.cn/detail/5118097780121223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Weibo</a>, to express his views on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/2024-steam-awards-winners-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam Awards 2024</a>, stating that he felt “a little emotional” after winning three awards. He also elaborated on the Series S optimisation issues, which led to Black Myth Wukong not releasing for Xbox.</p>



<p>Feng-Ji stated that the only thing missing for Black Myth Wukong in 2024 is the Xbox port. The reason for that is “10G of shared memory,” which is “really impossible to get” on the Series S “without several years of optimization experience.”</p>



<p>Black Myth Wukong’s delay on Xbox due to memory issues on the Series S is not surprising, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukongs-xbox-release-is-indefinitely-delayed-due-to-memory-leak-bug-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports</a> about this started emerging earlier last year. A Microsoft representative also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-isnt-delayed-due-to-xbox-platform-limitations-microsoft-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">refuted this claim</a>, stating that the game was not delayed “due to the Xbox platform limitations.” However, the CEO has officially confirmed that the Series S optimization issues were why the game didn’t make it on the platform.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a Black Myth Wukong <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-knock-off-appears-on-nintendo-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">knock-off appeared on the Nintendo e-Shop</a>. Also, the CEO revealed his views on the title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/game-science-ceo-reveals-his-views-on-black-myth-wukong-not-winning-goty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not winning GOTY at The Game Awards 2024</a>. What are your thoughts on Black Myth Wukong being delayed on Xbox due to Series S memory issues?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/888/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/rockstar-launcher-pc-red-dead-redemption</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/please-rockstar-i-just-wanted-to-play-2010%E2%80%99s-red-dead-redemption-why-are-you-sending-me-through-the-circles-of-hell.1072515/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/rockstar-launcher-pc-red-dead-redemption<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm currently (supposed to be) on vacation and today, having recently<a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-douglas-slocombe-cinematography-cutscenes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> finished up playing the excellent <em>Indiana Jones</em></a>, I decided to revisit a classic and play the original <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> on PC. I shouldn't have bothered.</p><p>After installing the game just after breakfast and settling in with a nice cup of coffee, I hit PLAY in Steam and was soon greeted by the sight of<a href="https://aftermath.site/ubisoft-ea-paradox-launcher-pc-steam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> one of my great enemies in life</a>: Rockstar's third-party launcher. Which courteously tried to automatically log me in, then decided it could <em>not</em>, because it was trying to use a very old email.</p><p>That email was my old Kotaku work email,<a href="https://www.lukeplunkett.com/youre-solid-gold-ill-see-you-in-hell/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a job I left in July 2023</a>, so you can see that I don't play Rockstar games on PC too often. Even though I no longer had access to that email, and the launcher couldn't log me in automatically, I tried signing in manually anyway because I figured I could remember the password, but no dice: the launcher sent a verification email, which I would never be able to read.</p><p>So I tried logging in using my <em>other </em>Rockstar account, one I'd made more recently for my PlayStation 5 and which was tied to a personal email I <em>did </em>have access to, but again was met with an error message. Turns out I couldn't use a different account on PC because Rockstar had linked the old/dead account to Steam, only one account was allowed to do this, and I didn't have access to that account.</p><p>That's OK, I figured, I'll just change which Rockstar account is linked to my Steam account. Nope! You can't do that manually; you need to contact Rockstar support for that--complete with screenshots and a written statement you acknowledge that switching accounts will mean you lose all access to the old one--and let them do it.</p><p>So I supplied all the information they asked for, waited a few hours then, at 4pm--remember, I'd wanted to play this game at <em>breakfast time</em>--I got a response. That response repeated the instructions I had already followed, asked for a screenshot and Steam ID I had already supplied, then told me I'd never be able to play <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> using that account again.</p><p>I was trying to play <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>.</p><p>A singeplayer campaign.</p><p>One I'd already acquired through Steam, and was trying to launch through Steam.</p><p>It's now 8pm at time of posting, and I've given up. But not before becoming even more convinced that anyone who has ever worked on the design or implementation of a third-party launcher on PC should be thrown into the deepest, coldest part of the ocean.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-is-free-to-add-to-your-epic-games-store-library/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Epic Games Store's New Year's Gift is <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/kingdom-come-deliverance" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance</a> from Warhorse Studios. You've got until 5 PM today to permanently add it to your library. Like Christmas's gift, <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-is-once-again-free-to-grab-on-the-epic-games-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Remedy's Control</a>, Kingdom Come Deliverance was also previously featured as a freebie <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-free-epic-games-store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in early 2020</a>. Likewise, just as Control, in case you didn't grab it at the time, you absolutely should do it now.</p>
<p>For one thing, it'll get you prepared for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-qa-half-of-the-voiced-lines-arent-related-to-the-story-at-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sequel</a>, which is scheduled to launch in just a month. That's around the right amount of time you'll need to complete, as just the main story requires over 40 hours of gameplay on average. If you add side content, it's easily going to double that figure. This is just the base game, mind you - there are also a few DLCs, which you can <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/kingdom-come-deliverance--royal-dlc-bundle" target="_blank" rel="noopener">grab for $3.99</a> (with an 80% discount) with the ongoing Holiday sale.</p>
<p>Originally funded via Kickstarter, Kingdom Come Deliverance has <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sets-dev-stream-for-tomorrow-first-game-reaches-8-million-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sold</a> over eight million units to date. It is a first-person roleplaying game set in a fully historical setting, 1403 Bohemia (modern day Czech Republic), at the time of King Wenceslaus IV. This would already be enough to make the game stand out from most RPGs. Adding to that, the main character, Henry of Skalitz, is the mere son of a blacksmith. And no, he never gets magic powers or anything like that.</p>
<p>It's all quite realistic, and so are the missions, which sometimes ask the player to perform regular chores as would be required for a relatively lowly person in the medieval ages. Even so, Warhorse managed to make it feel fun on most occasions, although you'll definitely need a greater deal of patience than in most RPGs, especially as you learn the unique direction-based combat system. The characters are very well-written, and some scenes are absolutely memorable.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-creator-of-playerunknowns-battlegrounds-wants-to-build-a-true-metaverse</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-creator-of-playerunknown%E2%80%99s-battlegrounds-wants-to-build-a-true-metaverse.1072509/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-creator-of-playerunknowns-battlegrounds-wants-to-build-a-true-metaverse<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2017, Brendan Greene (aka “PlayerUnknown”) pioneered the Battle Royale genre of games with the early access release of PlayerUnknown’s Battlegrounds. The game has since gone on to become a massive hit, spawning countless more games like it, including some of the most successful games of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next year, 2025, Greene wants to pioneer something new. He wants to make a metaverse. No, not the one you’re thinking of. Greene doesn’t think those count as actual metaverses.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I hesitate to talk about this, because it's just such a dirty word, but I want to build a metaverse because I don't think anyone else is,” he tells IGN. “I think everyone's building IP bubbles that might talk to each other at some stage in the future, maybe if we're lucky, but it's not the metaverse. See, the Metaverse is a 3D internet. You should be able to create your own worlds and just have them all operating on the same protocol, like HTTP. So a world is a page, and that's what I'm trying to do with Artemis.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Artemis, aka Greene’s metaverse, is actually the third of three games he’s currently cooking up at his studio, PlayerUnknown Productions. The first two are testing grounds for the technology Greene eventually wants to use to build his metaverse. They’ll each be games in their own right, but their real purpose is to work out the kinks in Greene’s most ambitious ideas before they hit primetime in Artemis.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Final Chapter Prologue</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The first game, Prologue, is already being tested by players in Greene’s Discord (in an early format Greene refers to as “Preface”) and is planned for a wider release in 2025. It’s a fairly basic survival game, Greene says, with a simple loop of trying to reach an objective while dealing with typical survival mechanics. There’s weather, hunger, crafting, discoverable loot, and other such elements to deal with, but the real meat of Prologue is its terrain generation tech. That’s what Prologue is really about: testing high-tech terrain generation at a small scale, before implementing it more broadly in Artemis.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Greene calls the terrain generation tech used by his studio “Melba,” and it’s basically a world generation machine. Melba uses machine learning, and is trained on NASA data of real-world Earth terrain. With that information, Melba is able to spit out entire maps, or even worlds, that have realistic geological features, and is able to do so either randomly or based on instructions, such as a request for a world with tons of mountains. These worlds are then filled with textures, assets, and other elements designed by actual artists, and are able to be customized in a similar fashion to have more forests, rivers, or whatever other elements are desired.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“There's a new terrain every time you press play,” Greene explains. “The seed system gives us, I think 4.2 billion possible maps, but maybe millions of those would be interesting, I'm not sure yet…But this kind of tech is really cool because we're seeing it shaped day to day with the artists. They're going, ‘Let's try this, let's update the masks we use for the river to this so we generate that slightly differently.’ And they're learning how to use this tech along with us, which is just great to see.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's more an emergent space to test our terrain tech, and we're going to work with the community to try to figure out: how can we make this test interesting? How can we make this game mode fun? What can we add to it that's systemic, and then will help us moving forward going into game two, and three, and building these bigger systems using the foundations we built in Prologue?”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Building the World Machine</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Prologue is just game one. Game two, which is currently unnamed, will come once the terrain tech is solidified. For Game Two, Greene wants a world that’s “500 million square kilometers, earth scale” to test a different sort of tech ahead of the release of Artemis: gameplay with <em>a whole awful lot</em> of characters all in one space together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Greene won’t say much about this one. He tells me about his end goal for Artemis, which is to fit not thousands, but <em>millions</em> of players in a space together and have everything still work. In Game Two, Greene will test that via both multiplayer gameplay as well as AI character interaction. “You’ll be controlling an army, basically,” is all I can really get out of him. Game Two will focus on multiplayer while “controlling lots of assets”...which, when combined with Melba, will lead to the massive, multiplayer metaverse that Greene is dreaming up for Artemis.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The internet was empty when it first started, and it was just the way of sharing data, and I look at this the same.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“The metaverse has to have millions of people, and server client-side, you'll never get that. You'll maybe get a few thousand, maybe 10,000 if you're lucky, but it's attacking the problem at the wrong end, which is to solve the simulation locally, which we've done with Preface and then you can scale to hundreds of thousands, millions of people, hopefully.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what all those millions of people will be doing in Greene’s metaverse…that’s largely up to them, he says. He compares it at one point to a Star Trek Holodeck, and then later to Minecraft Survival. In the tradition of the latter, Artemis will have a sort of basic game experience everyone can play, but then those users will be able to go off and make their own worlds, freely mod them, share them with others, and essentially treat them like “3D webpages” and experiment, build, and create totally new things within these spaces. He says he’s already seeing some of the beginnings of that within his Discord community as they tool around with and mod the early release of Prologue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The internet was empty when it first started, and it was just the way of sharing data, and I look at this the same,” he says. “This is probably going to be empty for the first few years, but then eventually you'll start to see the possibility of what you can do with this kind of world generator that it's like a multiverse of worlds.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Critically, Greene wants Artemis to eventually be like the open internet in the sense that no one can really control what’s on it, not even him. I ask him how content moderation will work in that case, and while Greene believes Artemis will need moderation, he wants that power to stay in the hands of the users.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Prologue: Go Wayback! Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I've been thinking a lot about this and what I want to do within this multiverse of digital spaces, you give the power to the community, that if someone acts like an asshole then they're locked out of spaces. And it comes down to identity. We have to solve the identity problem because anonymity online kind of breaks the social construct. But if on our network or on our system, it's tough for you to reenter it or to create an identity twice, you could still be anonymous, but at least there will be consequence to action.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Greene also suggests that instead of outright banning people who cause issues, one path might be to turn miscreants into “ghosts” that can’t interact with anyone. They can see everything happening and browse the world, but they are incapable of speaking or otherwise engaging with anything in it. “If you look at Covid, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2021/jul/17/covid-misinformation-conspiracy-theories-ccdh-report" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>there were 12 people that generated something like 96% of the misinformation that was online</u></a>. <em>[Author’s note: The actual number was 65% of disinformation posts on Facebook, and 72% of all anti-vaccine content.]</em>...If you shut out this small group of people that really actively try to upset the information space and deliver propaganda, then you've solved the problem kind of holistically…I think that the future will be local. Everything will be local. You will have your identity locally and you will share it as you see fit, and it won't be stored by people across the world. At least I hope.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I press Greene on this - what if people are doing illegal things in this metaverse? What about copyright violations, or worse, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/roblox-accused-of-massively-inflating-user-stats-and-fostering-hellscape-for-children-in-scathing-report"><u>everything Roblox has been accused of</u></a>? At what point does he become responsible? Greene admits he doesn’t have an answer yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That's where we're going to have to figure it out. As I said, I want to build games with the community, rather than for them, and I think with their help and finding out what tools they need to better do this, then we can figure out how to do this in a way better way for everyone. Thankfully we have good AI regulation in the EU as well so there are checks and balances there already, at least this side of the planet to help with this, right? I mean, let's see how long they last, but at least there are people smarter than me thinking about it already. So I'm happy to follow guidance, and work with the community to figure this out because it's important to get right.”</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Long Road Ahead</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Greene’s vision is incredibly technically complex, and he mentions several times that he doesn’t expect we’ll see its final form – Artemis – for ten, maybe even 15 years. He’s already highlighted a number of the challenges ahead of the team, but I ask him about another one he hasn’t yet mentioned: is Artemis going to be PC-only? No, he says. It’ll be on everything, eventually.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It has to. I mean, the device is just an access point to the world. It has to be. Kids in Africa on their mobile phones have to be able to access it the same as gaming PCs on the West Coast. The experience of the world might be slightly different, but because it's not a game, that's okay. It just has to run on every device.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there’s another technological issue I need to raise with Greene: NFTs. Previously, it’s been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/artemis-pubg-creators-next-game-will-have-nfts-and-the-metaverse"><u>reported that Artemis will implement them</u></a>, but Greene says that was a misunderstanding stemming from an interview he did with Hit Points back in 2022.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We need a platform where people can just create and not worry that you've got an exec team shooting it.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“[Nathan Brown] asked me about blockchain because it was the hype thing at the time,” Greene says. “And I explained that blockchain, I thought, was an interesting financial instrument, as a layer within a digital world. But that was it. I said maybe some future iteration of blockchain or hashgraph or that tech is interesting. Ultimately it's a digital ledger and if we can use a digital ledger, we'll find the best one and use it. But that's really it. The next day after I did that interview, [headlines were] ‘PUBG Guy Making Blockchain Game’, and that's not what I said. It's an interesting tech and I think it can be used if it's useful, but otherwise we'll use what is the best at the time.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So he’s not currently thinking about NFTs in Artemis, then?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“No, not even thinking about it. Our concern is about getting the engine to a state that we can make things in it and then as I said, Game Two, we'll test ideas then, but really now not even thought about it. More just getting some fun games made.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Between the length of time Greene needs to build Artemis and the sheer amount of questions still looming about its final form, Greene and his studio have a difficult road ahead. He’ll need time and personpower, which also means money, and the games industry is currently going through a funding drought amid layoffs, closures, and project cancellations. Greene says his project is fine, having gotten funding for Prologue early on and used it thoughtfully thus far. But that doesn’t mean Artemis is guaranteed. He says they’ll still need people to buy Prologue so they can sustain development long-term.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Greene isn’t daunted by the fact that he’s basically claiming he wants to build an entire second internet in a time of mass game and tech instability. In the same way that PUBG started out as a fairly barebones game but became a smash hit that launched a genre, he believes his new vision can grow to something massive with the help of a creative community. And maybe, he suggests, a successful Artemis could even help prevent the current games industry situation from happening again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Games are driven a lot by data points on Excel spreadsheets rather than making fun games and it's a little depressing,” he says. “So that's why I want to stick to my vision because I think we need a platform like this. We need a platform where people can just create and not worry that you've got an exec team shooting it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I want to find the next PlayerUnknown. I was really lucky to have been given this chance and providing people with a platform that can help do that, why wouldn't I do that? And yes, it's a big vision, but I've got a good team of industry professionals and they don't think it's that crazy. So yeah, I'm filled with confidence.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social. Got a story tip?

<p>Kanye West, the popular rapper, producer and fashion designer, has stated on social media that The Last of Us 2 is the best game ever.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kanye West, or Ye, took to his <a href="https://www.instagram.com/stories/ye/3536393017760655041/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Instagram Stories</a> earlier today to express his love for Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us Part 2. Ye stated, “Last of us 2 on Survivor + mode got me spending all day on one board. By faaaaaaarrrr the best game ever made so far. This is not a sponsored post.” The popular rapper posted a small clip of his gaming display along with this caption to his story.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kanye’s beloved survivor mode for The Last of Us 2 is called No Return. It was introduced with the remastered release on January 19, 2024. No Return is a single-player rouge-like survival mode in which players decide their path while encountering randomised encounters in known locations in The Last of Us Part 2’s universe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Additionally, The Last of Us 2 survivor mode features perma-death, adding more challenge to the experience. Once you die, all weapons, items and upgrades acquired during the previous run are lost. The new mode allows you to play with more characters, each with unique traits and play styles. The playable characters include Ellie, Abby, Dina, Joel, Tommy, Jesse Lev, Yara, Mel, and Manny.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The MultiVersus open beta feels like a distant memory and a complete shift from its full release. Warner Bros. and Player First Games had a bonafide winner on their hands; one with a ton of popularity, players, and potential. Fast forward to 2024, and its future is looking bleaker than being knocked off a map at 200% damage. </p>



<p>The prospect of Bugs Bunny and Superman taking on the duplicitous duo of Rick Sanchez and The Joker sounds ridiculous. But this is one of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-acquires-multiversus-developer-player-first-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MultiVersus</a>‘ shining qualities—making the ridiculous and impossible seem normal and tangible. Tom &amp; Jerry versus LeBron James, Jake the Dog squaring off with The Iron Giant, and the list goes on.</p>



<p>MultiVersus has an incredibly diverse roster of fighters, and I’d argue it’s as spectacular as any other in the genre. I sank many hours into the open beta, and I closely followed MultiVersus game director—Tony Hyunh—on X to see how he addressed feedback. I felt confident in the full game’s launch, but a string of questionable decisions and design choices have left the live-service title fighting for its life.</p>



<h2 id="h-an-open-beta-to-remember">An Open Beta to Remember</h2>



<figure><figcaption>There can only be one. Credit to Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure>



<p>July 26, 2022, is the day MultiVersus burst onto the scene. It launched its open beta / Early Access period to test the waters. It had a few characters available at launch, a season pass (more on this later), and a handful of modes. There wasn’t much, but it was enough. I can proudly say Bugs Bunny became my main very quickly—before the burrowing bunny became the meta. I had a blast yeeting enemies to the top of the map with Bugs’ bat, and kicking safes to send foes careening to oblivion.</p>



<p>The gameplay was outstanding, but one thing I noticed early on was <strong>how slow progress was</strong>. You needed a <em>lot </em>of Gold to unlock characters, and it felt very intentional. The Battle Pass was extremely grindy too, you could already smell the stink of microtransactions being pushed. Regardless, I enjoyed the MultiVersus beta, but the lack of content couldn’t be ignored as the months wore on. </p>



<p>Incredibly strong player count numbers were dwindling, and by early 2023, it was reported that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-player-drop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MultiVersus lost 99% of its players</a>. On Mar. 27, 2023, MultiVersus ended its beta period. This annoyed many players who were now unable to access the characters and cosmetics they had paid for.</p>



<p>Overall, <strong>I’d say the open beta was actually a success</strong>, and it more than adequately showcased MultiVersus’ frantic and focused fighting mechanics. A Super Smash Bros. clone it may be, it was an extremely good one. Myself, and the community waited patiently until <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-release-date-announced-for-may-28th/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">May 28, 2024, for the full launch</a>. Giving Player First Games plenty of time to right the wrongs.</p>



<p>The day came, MultiVersus was back, but it was quickly evident there was only one agenda for Warner Bros.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-launch-to-forget">A Launch to Forget</h2>



<p>MultiVersus’ relaunch was met with scratching criticism toward its predatory microtransactions, lack of content, and the paywall nature of existing content. Apparently, both <strong>developer and publisher learned nothing from the open beta</strong>—ironic, as that’s what it’s for.</p>



<p>Using <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1818750/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam Charts</a> to extrapolate basic data, we can see how quickly support for MultiVersus dissipated. For the fighter’s full release, <strong>114, 515 players</strong> hopped back into MultiVersus to try it out. This doesn’t quite hit its all-time peak of <strong>153,433</strong>, but it was a great starting point. Unfortunately, numbers dropped off faster than the Flash going for a light jog. </p>



<p>Within two weeks, the daily count was already down to about <strong>20,000 players</strong>. By mid-July, MultiVersus could barely scrape together 5,000 players, and if we zoom to December, the figures reached as low as <strong>363 players in a single day</strong>. As of writing, MultiVersus is quite dead, and worse still, <strong>it could soon be literally dead</strong>. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/multiversus-might-be-in-big-trouble-and-that-bums-me-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Vice</a> reported that Warner Bros. lost hundreds of millions in 2024—thanks to Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League and MultiVersus. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-updates-will-end-with-season-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Suicide Squad’s content is wrapping up after one year</a>, and MultiVersus might not be far behind on the chopping block.</p>



<p>Player First Games is attempting to make late changes such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiversus-makes-changes-to-how-players-unlock-fighters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changing how to unlock fighters</a>. This is presumably a desperate act to make MultiVersus more accessible and rely less on microtransactions. Only time will tell if it can bounce back, but one thing’s for sure, MultiVersus squandered its potential because of the allure of microtransactions, and companies need to learn to remember its players are the heartbeat of a game, not exploitable cash cows. </p>

<p>Were you a hardened MultiVersus player sucked by the addictiveness of the beta? Are you sad to see what’s become of the once-promising fighter? I am and thought it had a chance of competing with Nintendo’s long-time franchise. Let me know what you’re thinking below.</p>

The trio of electronic figures are only available in the starter courses. While each Mario Kart kit includes at least one buildable figure, only the starter figures can take full advantage of the built-in interactive elements on the Mario Kart vehicles and other accessories. If you're buying Lego Mario Kart kits for play rather than display, you'll probably want at least one of the figures.</p><p>Let's take a closer look at all six Mario Kart Lego sets available now. New Year's Day tends to be a big day for Lego, and that's the case in 2025, too. Mario Kart is the most exciting of the new video game-inspired sets, but Lego has also expanded the Animal Crossing, Sonic the Hedgehog, and Minecraft collections with new builds. You can also pick up new sets based on Star Wars, Harry Potter, Jurassic World, Marvel movies, Batman, and Superman.</p><div title="[Various] Lego Mario Kart Launch Lineup" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3022" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="[Various] Lego Mario Kart Launch Lineup" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Super-Mario-Collectible-Independent/dp/B0DJ199XBY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Super-Mario-Collectible-Independent\/dp\/B0DJ199XBY?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Super-Mario-Collectible-Independent/dp/B0DJ199XBY?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Lego Mario Kart - Standard Kart (174 Pieces)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Super-Mario-Collectible-Independent/dp/B0DJ199XBY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Super-Mario-Collectible-Independent\/dp\/B0DJ199XBY?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Super-Mario-Collectible-Independent/dp/B0DJ199XBY?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$20</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>This 174-piece set includes Mario's iconic red starting vehicle from Mario Kart 8 Deluxe. The kart comes with a detachable Super Glider, drift-ready wheels, a Red Shell launcher, and an attachable Banana item. Like all of the vehicles in the Mario Kart line, the Standard Kart is compatible with the trio of Interactive Figures from the Adventures with Super Mario starter sets. Naturally, the Mario figure is the obvious choice here. The figures unlock new sound and visual effects when the race starts, while drifting or gliding, and when honking your horn.</p><p>Mario's Standard Kart set also comes with a workstation with a target for the Red Shell. Hopping on the workstation with Mario, Luigi, or Peach triggers more sound and display effects.</p><p>If you don't have one of the Lego Mario starter sets, the included Pit Crew Toad figure can drive the kart instead. Toad is just a regular Lego figure, so the aforementioned interactive elements don't work when he's connected to the kart.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Super-Mario-Collectible-Independent/dp/B0DJ1CP9BM?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Super-Mario-Collectible-Independent\/dp\/B0DJ1CP9BM?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Super-Mario-Collectible-Independent/dp/B0DJ1CP9BM?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Lego Mario Kart - Yoshi Bike (133 Pieces)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Super-Mario-Collectible-Independent/dp/B0DJ1CP9BM?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Super-Mario-Collectible-Independent\/dp\/B0DJ1CP9BM?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Super-Mario-Collectible-Independent/dp/B0DJ1CP9BM?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$15</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The cheapest of the bunch, the Yoshi Bike is a 133-piece set that only costs $15. It includes a green bike modeled after Yoshi, a Light-Blue Yoshi figure, four traffic cones, an Item Block, and the Banana (peel) and Green Shell items from the Mario Kart games.</p><p>Mario, Luigi, and Peach figures react as the race starts, while drifting, when honking the bike's horn, and when the bike is in hover mode. In addition to the physical items, colliding with the Item Box plays out just like in the games. Sound and visual effects will let you know which item you earned.</p><p>Once again, the sound and visual effects won't happen without one of the three figures, but Yoshi sure does look cool on the bike. This is the first time Light-Blue Yoshi has been featured in a Lego Mario set. You can connect Yoshi figures from other sets to the bike, too. The Adventures with Mario starter set includes Green Yoshi. You can also get Yoshi figures with the same design as Light-Blue Yoshi in the following sets right now.</p><ul><li><a href="https://howl.link/7mxix51am395e?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17355490689107?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yoshi's Egg-cellent Forest (107 pieces)</a> -- $10 | Yellow and Pink Yoshi</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Expansion-Building-Collectible-Adventures/dp/B08589KGTY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mario's House &amp; Yoshi (205 pieces)</a> -- $35 | Green Yoshi</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Expansion-Collectible-Buildable-Birthday/dp/B0BSRDK8KZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Picnic at Mario's House (259 pieces)</a> -- $30.39 (<del>$38</del>) | Yellow Yoshi</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLEGO-Super-Mario-Yoshi-s-Gift-House-Expansion-Building-Toy-Set-71406-Featuring-Iconic-Yoshi-Monty-Mole-Figures-Great-Boys-Girls-Kids-Fans-Games-Movie%2F246178568%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmario-kart-lego-sets-are-available-now-check-out-all-six-in-the-launch-lineup%2F1100-6528603%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yoshi's Gift House -- Retired, Prices Vary (246 pieces)</a> | Green Yoshi</li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flego-super-mario-peach-39-s-garden-balloon-ride-exp-set-71419%2F-%2FA-87057840&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmario-kart-lego-sets-are-available-now-check-out-all-six-in-the-launch-lineup%2F1100-6528603%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Peach's Garden Balloon Ride (453 pieces)</a> -- $50 | Pink Yoshi (Target Exclusive)</li></ul></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Super-Mario-Collectible-Buildable/dp/B0DJ19F5P9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Super-Mario-Collectible-Buildable\/dp\/B0DJ19F5P9?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Super-Mario-Collectible-Buildable/dp/B0DJ19F5P9?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Lego Mario Kart - Baby Mario vs. Baby Luigi (321 Pieces)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Super-Mario-Collectible-Buildable/dp/B0DJ19F5P9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Super-Mario-Collectible-Buildable\/dp\/B0DJ19F5P9?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Super-Mario-Collectible-Buildable/dp/B0DJ19F5P9?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$30</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The ridiculously cute Baby Mario vs. Baby Luigi set rewinds the clock to a time before the brothers knew how to use a toilet, let alone fix one.

As such, it's also double the price of the second most expensive option (Toad's Garage).</p><p>Technically, this is called Baby Peach &amp; Grand Prix Set, which makes sense since Peach is the obvious standout of the three included racers. Baby Peach may still use a pacifier, but she has her license and drives an adorable Wild Wiggler kart. Peach is joined by Toad on a Standard Bike and Lemmy on the Landship kart.</p><p>Other accessories include traffic cones, two Item Blocks, a snack wagon, directional signposts, Green and Red Shells, a Banana, and a cloud for Lakitu.</p><p>The trio of Super Mario Interactive Figures work the same way as they do with the other sets.

While Peach dashes and jumps for the flag at the end of the mini course, Lakitu tries to stop her atop their cloud with a fishing hook.</p>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Adventures-Interactive-Nintendo-Playset/dp/B0CV27VY6L?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Adventures-Interactive-Nintendo-Playset\/dp\/B0CV27VY6L?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Adventures-Interactive-Nintendo-Playset/dp/B0CV27VY6L?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Adventures with Interactive Lego Luigi (210 pieces)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Adventures-Interactive-Nintendo-Playset/dp/B0CV27VY6L?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/LEGO-Adventures-Interactive-Nintendo-Playset\/dp\/B0CV27VY6L?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Adventures-Interactive-Nintendo-Playset/dp/B0CV27VY6L?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$50</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Luigi's 210-piece starter set includes Kamek on her broomstick, Boo, and Pink Baby Yoshi.

<p>FaZe Clan’s representatives have taken to social media to reveal a rebrand that includes giving the organisation a new logo for the first time in years. It’s not a <strong>huge </strong>change, but it’s a reworking of one of the most recognisable images in content creation and competitive gaming.</p>



<p>Along with the new logo is a fresh ‘FaZe Camo’, a new stylisation of the name, and a fresh colour palette.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-year-new-faze">New Year, New FaZe</h2>



<p><a href="https://x.com/FaZeClan/status/1874532461608411160" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On social media</a>, the FaZe team posted a series of images uncovering the new organisation’s iconography, including a gaudy ‘distorted’ camouflage that will be applied to everything from company branding to merchandise:</p>



<figure><figcaption>This isn’t a glitch, that’s the camo print created by FaZe Clan</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a short video uploaded by FaZe Banks, the organisation’s CEO, the reasoning behind the overhaul was explained. He showcased a transparent, behind-the-scenes look at group chats established to discuss and plan the rebrand, highlighting why certain creative decisions were made.</p>



<p>To ring in the new year, the organisation, which has been through many tribulations of late, posted a video looking back on the recent history of the brand, stating: ‘New Year, New FaZe. Bigger Than Ever.’</p>



<div><article><p><span>New Year, New FaZe. Bigger Than Ever.</span></p></article></div>







<p>Beyond the rebrand, nothing else has been confirmed for 2025. There are high expectations for the organisation, which has taken some huge leaps forward in the last few months since the control of the company was handed back to the ‘OGs’ that founded it.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-transition-bug-fixed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/latest-escape-from-tarkov-update-fixes-%E2%80%98transition%E2%80%99-bug.1072407/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-transition-bug-fixed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Battlestate Games has rolled out a sudden update in Escape from Tarkov, patching a few issues in the game. One of the most major changes is a fix for the bug that was causing players to ‘transition’ between maps with enemy players, understandably causing quite a stressful situation upon loading into the next raid.</p>



<p>To answer the issue, BSG temporarily switched off transitions, blocking a few tasks and longer raids from taking place. Now, in a snapshot update, the team has fixed this issue – and a dozen others.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-free-to-move">Free to Move</h2>



<p>The ability to transition in Escape from Tarkov is a relatively new feature. It was added a few months back, and it allows players to jump between maps almost seamlessly, logically continuing their raid and pushing into a new environment to keep up the action. It’s the foundation for many of the game’s newest tasks, too.</p>



<p>When the latest wipe hit Tarkov, transitions went awry, with many players encountering a bug that saw them transition with enemy players. The moment they loaded in, all hell broke loose and they started gunning each other down, prompting Battlestate Games to lock the feature down.</p>



<p>In a recent post <a href="https://x.com/tarkov/status/1874583477141536818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on social media</a>, the team at BSG confirmed that the following fix has been applied to Escape from Tarkov:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Fixed all known issues where players transitioning between locations could enter a raid with players outside their group</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Additionally, the following adjustments have been made:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the player has been teleporting in place without being able to move in any direction on various locations</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where kills from Aklys Defence Velociraptor .300 Blackout did not count towards progress of Punisher. Part 2 quest</li>



<li>Reduced the sales limit for 7.62x51mm BCP FMJ rounds to 100 (120 for owners of The Unheard Edition) per restock</li>



<li>Harris “S-BRM 6-9” bipods moved to Skier LL2</li>



<li>BT10 V8 Atlas Bipods moved to Mechanic LL2</li>



<li>NVG-57E night vision device added to Prapor LL1</li>



<li>Adjusted spawn rates for barter items in the pockets on Scavs and player Scavs</li>



<li>Adjusted spawn rates and conditions for armour and armoured rigs on Scavs and player Scavs</li>



<li>Adjusted spawn rates for ammunition on player Scavs</li>



<li>Adjusted spawn rates for backpacks on Scavs.</li>
</ul>



<p>The changes have been coming thick and fast since Escape from Tarkov wiped just under a week ago. Many have attributed this cadence to the Unity engine upgrade performed by Battlestate Games alongside the global reset event.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/will-gta-6-be-delayed-history-tells-us-it-will/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>With 2025 finally here, one big question is on everybody’s mind: is 2025 the year we finally get a GTA 6 release? Outside of the wild fan conspiracies we saw in 2024, it’s been relatively quiet for GTA 6 since its initial reveal in December 2023, with no official announcements from GTA developer Rockstar Games. It’s led to many rumours and rumblings that GTA 6 has already been internally delayed, with a delay announcement rumour to be coming soon.</p>



<p>The biggest and latest rumor of a delay came in September 2024, with the lack of official announcements seemingly making the rumor more valid. It eventually prompted Take-Two Interactive to squash the rumor in its Q2 earnings call in November 2024, which was the most significant amount of information we received since the game’s initial announcement. At least at the time of the earnings call, the publisher confirmed that the game was still to launch in Fall 2025.</p>



<p>At face value, Take-Two’s comments are reassuring, but history has told us that Rockstar Games tends to postpone its games, and it won’t be the first time that Take-Two has had to adjust its financial forecasts due to such a delay.</p>



<h2 id="h-a-history-of-delays">A History of Delays</h2>



<p>Rockstar Games’ last two major title releases, GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 saw significant delays from their initial announcement to their final release date.</p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption 2, Rockstar Games’ latest major title saw two delays from its announcement trailer to its final release. Announced on October 18, 2016, the game was initially planned to be released in the second half of 2017 but eventually released on October 26, 2018, with Rockstar Games saying that the game needed additional development time for polish.</p>



<p>Grand Theft Auto 5 saw a delay, too. From its planned Spring 2013 launch, the game would eventually launch in September 2013. Although it was a small delay, Rockstar Games asserted that it was needed due to polish. In fact, it’s been a recurring theme for Rockstar Games in the past 15 years, with almost every one of Rockstar Games titles, from GTA 4 to the original Red Dead Redemption, seeing delays. While GTA 6 has yet to meet the same fate, it isn’t difficult to imagine that Rockstar Games will continue its trend, especially in the games industry’s current climate. </p>



<h2 id="h-take-two-s-packed-lineup-in-2025">Take-Two’s Packed Lineup in 2025</h2>



<p>It’s already been widely discussed, but another point to consider is Take-Two’s already-packed lineup for 2025, even without a GTA 6 release. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands 4</a>, Civilization 7, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-mafia-the-old-country/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mafia: The Old Country</a>, and annual releases like NBA 2K and WWE 2K make 2025 arguably one of Take-Two’s most stacked years of all time, and that’s without what will be the biggest game release in the past decade.</p>



<p>So why is having its most stacked game release lineup ever an issue for Take-Two? Well, unfortunately, it boils down to revenue and investor expectations year-over-year. Investors expect continuous growth, and piling so many big releases into one year could be an eyebrow-raising decision for investors, especially if Take-Two’s 2026 lineup is on the weaker side of big game releases. Of course, we all know that Take-Two’s money-maker will be GTA Online for GTA 6, but if that will come on launch or not is currently unclear.</p>



<p>But from a purely financial point of view, would Borderlands 4 and Mafia: The Old Country sell millions more copies if GTA 6 is delayed into 2026? It’s a question that investors will likely be pondering. While a GTA 6 delay will undoubtedly cause Take-Two’s share price to fall by a few percent, Take-Two’s financial year will still be strong, and with the prospect of GTA 6 having a cemented release date, its share price will continue to rise.</p>



<p>Although I think that Take-Two will ultimately let Rockstar decide if more polish is needed, it’s certainly a point to be raised that this is, at its core, a business, and GTA 6 is going to make the company billions over the years to come. An additional six-month delay isn’t the end of the world for Take-Two, and if the extra polish is needed, well, I don’t mind waiting a bit longer, either.</p>

                <p>One of the best feelings in a roguelike is when the pieces all come together to create a perfect run. In Hades it's a powerful combination of powers, in Dead Cells it's a perfect set of weapons, and in Balatro it's all about getting the right combination of Jokers. With the right set of Jokers, a run in Balatro can feel almost easy at times. You have so many Joker effects happening that the game starts to speed up the animations and your score catches on fire because you aren't about to just win the round--you are about to blow past it, making the score you need to reach seem trivial in the process.</p><p dir="ltr">These runs are amazing in Balatro and in other roguelikes, but that's because it's not how every run goes. In fact, that's how very few runs usually go. Most runs in Balatro, including many of my winning runs, have me barely beating out each round with my final hand. Every shop or bonus for skipping a blind becomes deeply important, because I need another boost in chips or multiplier; otherwise my run is about to crash and burn. This scrappiness is what makes Balatro special, and there are multiple mechanics that let you take some of the chance out of these runs, making it just as viable to fight tooth and nail to win a run as it is to break the game entirely with your build.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Balatro lets you control your fate (mostly)</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4413185-balatrojokerlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4413185" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4413185-balatrojokerlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4413185"></a><figcaption>Balatro's iconic Jokers can drastically change how each hand plays out.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4413185-balatrojokerlarge.jpeg"></figure><p>While it's not uncommon for roguelikes to allow you to influence the powers or weapons you might receive in a run, Balatro consistently provides you the opportunity to make risk-versus-reward assessments. Each ante has three blinds, two of which can be completely skipped. You won't earn any money or get to visit the shop, but you will get something else. Sometimes it's as simple as a pack of cards to add to your deck, or it can guarantee a Joker of a certain rarity or with a specific bonus type. Importantly, the reward is never a specific Joker--only certain modifiers or rarities. There is never any point where you can guarantee yourself the exact Joker you need, which puts an emphasis on working with whatever Jokers you do get.</p><p dir="ltr">One of my favorite decks to run is the Plasma deck, which combines and then averages your chips and multiplier whenever you play a hand, turning 50 chips with a two multiplier into 26 times 26. While that might sound like it's easier to win a round--and it certainly is the first ante or two--this deck also doubles your target score, making it much harder to hit. A quick way to run up your total using this deck is by drastically increasing your chip total, since that number can be easier to inflate compared to the multiplier.</p><p dir="ltr">That means a foil Joker, which automatically adds 50 chips to each played hand, can offer a pretty big increase to your score in the short term, even if the Joker itself doesn't work with a run. A guaranteed foil Joker is one of the rewards that can appear for skipping a blind, offering what is essentially an easy way to keep a run alive. Even if the Joker's effect doesn't help your build and you might have to dump it later, it can still get you through more rounds, which means you have more chances to get the right items in the shop.</p><p dir="ltr">This sort of influence over your rewards, however small, is incredibly important in Balatro because it's a game about math. In an action-focused roguelike, you can make up for a few bad rolls with skill, so long as you have the skills to dodge or parry consistently. By contrast, you can't win rounds of Balatro through pure skill--you have to work with the materials offered to you. This design feels purposeful, based on other aspects of how the game works.</p><p dir="ltr">When you reach a new ante, Baltro presents you with a ton of information. You can see exactly what you need to score in all three blinds to win, what your rewards are for skipping either of the first two blinds, and what the special condition is in the third blind. You might not know exactly what's going to be in the store, but you do know there will be two packs, two card slots that could be Jokers, Tarots, or Planets, and a voucher. You also have a pretty good idea of how much those items all cost, and how much money you will win for each blind beaten.</p><p dir="ltr">All of this information is important, because it allows you to make decisions based on both the short-term and long-term impacts of each item. Sure, the first Joker in the shop might not be one you want long term, but any amount of multiplier can help. A foil Joker adding 50 chips could be a huge boost right now, even if the Joker itself is focused on straights when you're building around two pairs. Even as you move up the stakes and the game becomes harder and more complex, with the addition of eternal Jokers that can't be sold or destroyed or perishable Jokers that stop working after five rounds, having this information lets you put together scrappier runs.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4413186-balatrootherlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4413186" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4413186-balatrootherlarge.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4413186"></a><figcaption>It's not uncommon to have strange Joker combinations early in a Balatro run.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4413186-balatrootherlarge.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">What you can do with this information and the small amount of influence Balatro offers you is the ability to adapt. The limitation on how many Jokers you can have at once makes runs more dynamic. It's common in roguelikes, especially deck builders, to have no limit on powerful items like Jokers, with their power stacking on top of each other. The catch though is that you typically can't get rid of these items easily. While you might have a limited number of slots for Jokers, you are rarely stuck with one, letting you dump any conflicting Jokers in an instance, allowing greater flexibility. The Joker that gains one multiplier when you play a hand but loses one when you discard might sound good at first, but if you find yourself needing to discard to play the hands necessary to win, you can easily dump it for something else at the next shop.</p><p dir="ltr">These runs don't sing the way that the game-breaking ones do, where you score so much that it starts getting displayed in exponentials instead of numbers. Despite that, they do feel just as satisfying, albeit in a different way. Overcoming a rough start, bad Joker rolls, and special blinds that feel targeted at your specific build is its own kind of magic, creating the kind of run that makes up most of my time playing Balatro. It's much easier to let yourself have just one more run when you always feel like you can throw together a combination of Jokers and cards that is just good enough to get by, instead of your run crashing because you didn't get the perfect combination of items.</p><p dir="ltr">All of this comes together to create a roguelike experience where I never feel compelled to abandon a run. Every run feels like it can succeed, right down to the moment where the game over screen appears and even in that moment, I'm sure I could have had it if I had if I had made better choices. That feeling makes it easy to immediately boot up another run again and again, which is perhaps the highest compliment you can give a roguelike.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>More Best Of 2024:</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/our-favorite-games-of-2024-that-didnt-make-the-top-10/2900-6090/" data-ref-id="2900-6090">Our Favorite Games That Didn't Make The Top 10</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-ps5-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6054/" data-ref-id="2900-6054">Best PS5-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6080/" data-ref-id="2900-6080">Best Switch-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-pc-exclusive-games-of-2024/2900-6083/" data-ref-id="2900-6083">Best PC-Exclusive Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-new-xbox-games-of-2024/2900-6081/" data-ref-id="2900-6081">Best Xbox Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-reviewed-games-2024/2900-5065/" data-ref-id="2900-5065">Best-Reviewed Games Of 2024</a></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/best-of-2024/">Best Of 2024 hub</a></li></ul>

		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> monthly games for January 2025 have been announced, and Sony has chosen to start off the new year with… well, with Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Also some games that weren’t commercial and critical flops.</p>

<p>The following three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, which will be 7th January.</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/05/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review/"><strong>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</strong></a> (PS5)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/08/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit-remastered-review/"><strong>Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit Remastered</strong></a> (PS4)</li>
<li><strong>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe</strong> (PS5 | PS4)</li>
</ul>
<p>The most celebrated game here is The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe, a game that’s all about&nbsp;office worker Stanley discovered all of his co-workers had disappeared and wandering around to try and figure out what’s going on. All his actions (as controlled by you) are narrated by the Narrator, voiced by Kevan Brighting, in humourous ways as Stanley encounters weirder and weirder scenarios. The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe expands upon the original game with more content, choices, and secrets. The graphics have also been updated to take advantage of newer technology. It’s a brilliant game and well worth playing, whether for the first time or revisiting over a decade on from its original 2013 release.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe - Launch Presentation" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZnoHCP0Lk0U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Another game from the remaster/remake pile is Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit Remastered. This was the first game in the series helmed by Criterion, and it really showed off that studio’s arcade racer chops in style. Back in the day on PS3 and 360 it was only at 30fps, but with the remaster, the game’s running at a much better feeling 60fps. See our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/08/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit-remastered-review/">review</a>.</p>


<p>And that brings us around to Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League. Released after years of delays, it failed to hit the heights of Rocksteady’s Batman: Arkham series. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/05/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review/">Suicide Squad review</a>, Gamoc said, “Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League is a perfect example of how live services can sap all the energy out of a game experience. The story, the character and gameplay all range from good to fantastic, but the missions grow stale before too long, the loot system’s few bright spots are tarnished by the chore of everything else you earn, and the story and characters all but evaporate once you reach the endgame.”</p>
<p>The game was one of the biggest flops of 2024 – probably neck and neck with Sony’s own Concord – and has recently been included in Steam sales for just £3, while Warner Bros. and Rocksteady have confirmed that its seasonal content will be ending <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/as-expected-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-support-will-end-with-season-4/">as soon as its pre-announced 1 year content roadmap has completed</a> with an update in mid-January. On the positive side of things, they’re patching in an offline mode, and PS Plus subscribers will be getting the game at its most content-filled…</p>
<p>So, what do you think of this month’s games?</p>
<h2>Can you still get the December 2024 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>You can still grab December’s titles up until the new set of game’s arrives on 7th January, so make sure to grab them while you can! They are:</p>

<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance is the newest free game on the Epic Store. The medieval RPG can be redeemed between today and tomorrow at 13:00 BRT.</p>



<p>This is the perfect way to get hands-on with the franchise before Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 arrives on February 4, 2025.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://store.epicgames.com/pt-BR/p/kingdom-come-deliverance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Redeem here -&gt; Kingdom Come: Deliverance on the Epic Store</a></strong></li>
</ul>



<p>As the second game will serve as a sequel to the story of Henry, the protagonist, having prior knowledge of the story and gameplay systems are key aspects to getting the most out of Warhorse’s new game.</p>



<p>Check out the plot for the first game:</p>



<p><em>“Thrust into a raging civil war, you watch helplessly as invaders storm your village and slaughter your family. Narrowly escaping the brutal attack, you grab your sword to fight back. Avenge the death of your parents and help repel the invading forces!”</em></p>



<p>The game is widely regarded as the perfect game for anyone who loves the Middle Age. Unlike traditional RPGs, Kingdom Come provides a more immersive experience that comes slightly closer to a simulator, even though it’s not one.</p>

<p>The PS Plus Essential games for January (2025) <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">have been revealed</a> and, well, there was certainly a better way to start the year. The three games awarded to subscribers in the lowest tier are:</p>



<ul>
<li>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</li>



<li>Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit Remastered</li>



<li>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-the-games-from-ps-plus-essential-january-2025">The games from PS Plus Essential: January 2025</h2>



<p>The list certainly isn’t going to fill anyone’s eyes, after all, we’re talking about one of the biggest flops of 2024 and two old games. The games will be available starting January 7th.</p>



<h3 id="h-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-ps5-nbsp"><strong>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League | PS5&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Take down The Justice League yourself in single-player or team up with friends in multiplayer co-op in this genre-defying, action-adventure third-person shooter from Rocksteady Studios, creators of the critically acclaimed Batman: Arkham series. Featuring an original narrative set within an expansive open-world city of Metropolis, the game puts the four DC Super-Villains on a collision course with an invading alien force and DC Super Heroes who are now laser-focused on destroying the city they once vowed to protect.</p>



<h3><strong>Need for Speed Hot Pursuit Remastered | PS4&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>Feel the thrill of the chase and the rush of escape in Need for Speed Hot Pursuit. Unleash a savage sense of speed both as an outlaw and a cop in the world’s hottest high-performance cars. Outsmart the heat or take down lawbreakers with the tactical weaponry at your disposal in a heart-pumping, socially competitive racing experience. Updated with enhanced visuals, cross-platform multiplayer – including the asynchronous competition powered by Autolog – plus all additional DLC content, this is the ultimate edition of Criterion Games’ critically acclaimed Need for Speed debut. It’s time to reignite the pursuit.</p>



<h3><strong>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe | PS4, PS5&nbsp;</strong></h3>



<p>The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe is an expanded re-imagining of the critically acclaimed, award winning indie game The Stanley Parable from 2013. Everything that was in the original Stanley Parable is here, preserved just like it was back in 2013. But The Stanley Parable: Ultra Deluxe also dramatically expands the world of the original game with new content, new choices, and new secrets to uncover. The labyrinth has just gotten bigger. In addition, the game has been visually upgraded to reflect modern technology while faithfully preserving the tone of the original game. Accessibility features have also been added to the game, including localization of in-world text, colorblind options, and content warnings. And just as before, the impeccable voicework of Kevan Brighting will accompany you every step of the way.</p>

Welcome to 2025, and congratulations for living through yet another complete rotation around the giant firey gas ball we call the sun. The start of a new year is as good a time as any to take a look at what games are currently on the horizon, so here are the biggest game releases of 2025 that we know about right now!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">January 2025</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/19/dynasty-warriors-origins-biggest-games-2025-1734608245107.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On January 17, Tecmo Koei’s flagship musou series returns with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dynasty-warriors-origins"><strong>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</strong></a>, its first full-fledged entry since 2018. It will, of course, take full advantage of current gen hardware to flood your screen with enemies that you can plow through while yelling the titular battlecry, “DIE, NASTY WARRIORS!” It'll be available on PS5, Xbox Series consoles, and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you prefer to make warriors die in nasty ways from really far away, on January 30 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sniper-elite-resistance"><strong>Sniper Elite: Resistance</strong></a> continues the long-running and long-range gratuitous-Nazi-castration-simulator series. This latest installment doesn’t seem to be shaking up the formula too much, but it’s hard to complain about that when the formula involves shooting the private parts off of fascists. Did I mention you can shoot Nazis in the junk? Because you can. That’s on all the Xboxes and PlayStations, plus PC.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">February 2025</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/19/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-biggest-games-2025-1734608337081.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy? Well, none of the above, but it is technically a bohemian rhapsody - <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii"><strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</strong></a> picks up where the first sprawling historical RPG left off, continuing the adventures of Henry of Skalitz, a poor boy with no need for sympathy. And while KCD2’s immersive and historically grounded simulation of 14th century Bohemia is by no means easy come or easy go, the deep role-playing mechanics and massive open-world means you can take Henry any way the wind blows. Doesn’t really matter to meeeeeee. That’s on current gen consoles and PC, launching February 11.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you like simulated history on a much larger scale and even larger timeframe, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii"><strong>Sid Meier’s Civilization 7</strong></a> drops that same day. When a game franchise has had 7 installments over three decades, it really shouldn’t need much in the way of introduction, but in a nutshell: you’re in charge of seeing a society and guiding its progress through history by Exploring, Expanding, Exploiting, and a 4th X word as needed, which unsurprisingly, can get a bit complicated. That’s out for basically everything, including Linux, but excluding mobile - but that’ll probably come later.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On February 14, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows"><strong>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</strong></a> sends Ubisoft’s flagship open-world series into the much-requested setting of feudal Japan. If you can’t decide if you’d rather be a ninja or a Samurai, we have great news: this one lets you do both, thanks to its dual protagonists. That’s on current gen and PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re feeling lonesome on Valentine’s day, there’s also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/date-everything"><strong>Date Everything!</strong></a>, a sandbox dating simulator where you may in fact be able to date an actual sandbox - and if not, there’s 100 other anthropomorphized inanimate objects with which you can become romantically involved, from the windows to the walls - or the floor, anyway - and they’re all fully voice acted. That’s on PS5, Xbox series consoles, Switch, and PC.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/19/monster-hunter-wilds-biggest-games-2025-1734608417854.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Monster Hunter Wilds</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On February 18, Obsidian’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/avowed"><strong>Avowed</strong></a> hits Xbox series consoles and PC. This is set in the same fantasy universe as the studio’s isometric Pillars of Eternity games, but this time offers a whole new point of view thanks to its first-person perspective and realtime action combat. It may look like Skyrim, but don’t expect an epic timesink - the devs have said it’s more comparable to their previous sci-fi RPG, The Outer Worlds (which takes around 40 hours to do the main quest and sides), which is great news for anyone who sucks at finishing games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of timesinks, if you think it’s time to sink some ships and terrorize the high seas, well you’re in luck because <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii"><strong>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</strong></a> is… well, I feel like the title really covers its bases there. This’ll see Goro Majima, the fan-favorite foil and frenemy to the series' usual protagonists, taking the wheel - somewhat literally - after he gets amnesia and decides to explore a new career as a pirate. Classic Majima. That’s on the Xboxes, PlayStations and PC on February 21.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pirate Yakuza actually moved its release date up a week to get the hell out of the way of one of the biggest games of the year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds"><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong></a>, which comes to Xbox Series, PS5 and PC on February 28. Again, it's one of those series that requires little introduction, especially after how many new players got hooked on Monster Hunter World last gen. With Wilds, Capcom is aiming to refine and improve the core experience in a way that satisfies longtime fans and newcomers alike, but also introduce new features that take advantage of current hardware to keep things interesting. Oh yeah, and it also needs to be accessible enough to attract more new players - so, if you’re wondering why this game has taken so long… that might have something to do with it. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">March 2025</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/19/split-fiction-biggest-games-2025-1734608469506.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Split Fiction</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On March 6, it’s time to buddy up for another co-op adventure from Hazelight, the studio behind It Takes Two and A Way Out.

Nintendo has announced that details will be revealed sometime before the end of March 2025, and based on some leaked product listings for third-party accessories, there’s some speculation that it’s targeting a summer release window. Again, this is completely unconfirmed at this point, but it makes sense. The original Switch was revealed in October 2016 and went on sale the following March, and the organic buzz generated by gamers and early adopters made it a must-have item by the time the holidays rolled around.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/01/switch-time-to-buy-1714545882432.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Will Nintendo's successor to the Switch launch in 2025?</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Whatever this new thing is called, it’ll launch with at least a few games. The original Switch had about ten games available on day one, which sounds underwhelming until you remember one of them was The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Another dozen or so games were released over the three month “launch window” following the Switch's release. Bear in mind, a lot of people were skeptical of the Switch at the time of its launch, including publishers who’d been burned by the Wii U. The Wii had been such a hit that there was initially a ton of support for its successor, and the Wii U’s launch lineup was almost three times the size of what was out for the Switch on day one. Considering the Switch has outsold the original Wii by almost 50 million units, and is currently the third best-selling console of all time, it’s safe to assume that a LOT of publishers will want to get in on the ground floor for whatever’s next - so I have a hunch there’ll be a lot of Switch 2 games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a couple bigger Nintendo games we’re expecting to drop this year. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond"><strong>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</strong></a> was basically just a logo for the better part of a decade, and presumably it’ll actually be a video game at some point in the near future, which is exciting. That’s coming to Switch, but I wouldn’t be surprised if that was one of the big flagship launch titles for the new console, as well - and even if it’s not, the new hardware is supposedly backwards compatible, so I’m sure plenty of people will be playing it on there either way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong></strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a"><strong>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</strong></a> is slated for 2025, which is another entry in the open-world action RPG side-series - Pokémon Legends Arceus took some big swings, but it also made the Switch show its age in some places, so hopefully that can benefit from more powerful hardware - or at the very least, improve on the groundwork laid by Arceus.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Grand Theft Auto 6</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/01/17/screenshot-445-1705507701395.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Grand Theft Auto 6</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A rising tide raises all ships, and new Nintendo hardware will definitely help keep the games industry afloat a bit, but the other big 2025 release that’s sure to make some waves is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi"><strong>Grand Theft Auto 6</strong></a>. I don’t need to tell you how much excitement there is for this game. GTA 5 is the second best-selling game of all time, and after a twelve year, three console generation wait, people really, really want to see what Rockstar does next with its signature series. I'm calling it right now: it’ll probably be the best-selling game of the decade, and almost definitely the best-selling game of 2025 - assuming it does in fact come out in 2025. It’s worth noting that practically every major Rockstar release, GTA and otherwise, has been hit by a delay or two.

While Hideo Kojima has had no involvement with it (aside from directing the original) it seems like a lot of care is being taken on Konami’s part to not fuck it up. This showed up in a PlayStation promo that dropped last January showcasing big 2024 releases, and a November 17 release date was briefly leaked by GameStop, but was apparently that was all inaccurate.

This time Playground Games has been given the keys and taken the wheel, if you’ll pardon the expression. Playground is the studio behind the Forza Horizon series - as in, that’s literally all they’ve publicly done, so I’m dying to see their spin on an RPG. I don’t give a shit about racing or cars and can barely drive one in real life, but I somehow sunk 120 hours into Forza Horizon 5 - so if they can make me enjoy something I don’t care about that much, I’m dying to see how they handle an epic fantasy game with wizard stuff and fart jokes and large frogs.

This game will see Captain America teaming up with the Black Panther during world war 2 - specifically, Azzuri, who’s the grandfather of T’Challa.

Oh, and there’s also a rapidly shrinking circle of acid rain to contend with - or <em>ring </em>if you will. So, yes, it’s a little bit Fortnite - but also clearly something else entirely. As much as I love how FromSoft has gradually refined that core Soulsborne experience, this feels like a direct response to the creative ways players have been approaching their games - you know, doing speed runs with DDR mats, or beating the game without jumping or levelling up or whatever, or making mods where every enemy has been replaced by Malenia and stuff like that. Not sure if it’s something I will personally enjoy playing, but I’m dying to see what other people do with it.

And yet again, let me emphasize that these are by <em>no means</em> all the games coming out in 2025. And I guarantee you at least one of the games I mentioned will <em>not</em> come out in 2025. If you want more comprehensive and up to date updates on what’s coming out, we make videos about what games are releasing monthly. The second I finish writing this, I’m gonna get started on the script for January’s big games, so keep an eye out for that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, also, if you really want to stay up to date on what’s coming out, go check out <a href="https://playlist.ign.com/" data-cy="styled-link">IGN Playlist</a>. It’s like Letterboxd or Goodreads, but for video games. It has a dedicated app where you can keep tabs on what you’ve played, what you’re playing, and what you want to play someday. Thank you to Logan, who manages the huge database of games that IGN Playlist pulls from. Every time a new game gets announced, he has to update it, and I think this year’s game awards may have killed him. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gematsu.com/2025/01/honkai-star-rail-version-3-0-update-paean-of-era-nova-launches-january-15<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The version 3.0 update for <em><a title="Games > Honkai: Star Rail [35 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a></em>, dubbed “Paean of Era Nova,” will launch on January 15, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [183 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-936698"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>In this update, players will finally experience the long-awaited new world of Amphoreus, beginning a fresh chapter in the main story. The Trailblaze Mission in Amphoreus will be released in two parts across eight versions, from 3.0 to 3.7, making it the largest story arc in <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> to date. This update brings not only new world storylines but also multiple maps and rich gameplay features waiting to be explored. Get ready to embark on the “Hero’s Journey” with new playable characters—Aglaea, The Herta, and the Trailblazer: Remembrance!</p><p>Leaving Penacony the Planet of Festivities behind, the Astral Express embarks toward Amphoreus under Black Swan’s guidance, seeking both to replenish Trailblaze Fuel and uncover the mysteries of this celestial body. From the outside, Amphoreus appears as a chaotic vortex, its existence impossible to detect or understand. Similarly, its inhabitants remain completely unaware of the outside universe. Unlike other worlds, they do not know of the concept of “Aeons,” instead worshiping deities known as “Titans.” According to legend, twelve Titans created Amphoreus: Three who wove fate, three who shaped the heavens and earth, three who molded life, and three who brought calamity. In Amphoreus, gods and miracles are tangible existences rather than mere myths. Yet this realm’s history is steeped in tragedy. In ancient times, the arrival of three Titans—“Strife,” “Death,” and “Trickery”—sparked a civil war among the gods. Soon after, a mysterious force known as the “black tide” swept across the world. None know its origins, but all life touched by it loses sanity, with even the mighty Titans proving vulnerable. Over millennia, between the black tide gradually consuming Amphoreus and the gods waging endless war, the world fell into eternal night. Now, in humanity’s final sanctuary—the Holy City of Okhema—only the protection of Kephale, the Worldbearing Titan, stands as the last barrier against the black tide.</p><p>The Astral Express, arriving as an unexpected force from beyond this world, is destined to change the course of Amphoreus’s fate. Upon entering Amphoreus, the Trailblazer and Dan Heng first descend into a region known as the “Abyss of Fate.” Legend says three Titans—Time, Passage, and Law—once wove here the threads of time, space, and rules that would govern Amphoreus, determining the fate of all creation. Now this land lies in eternal night, with only emptiness echoing through its grand architectural remains. As the story unfolds, the Trailblazer’s group will return to the Abyss of Fate, pierce through the mists, delve deep into the temple, and finally gain audience with Oronyx, the Titan of Time. Through this encounter, the Trailblazer embarks on the Path of Remembrance, gaining the ability to “draw strength from the past.”</p><p>Meanwhile, players will meet a new companion who, due to their mysterious origins and tendency to only make “Mem” sounds, is temporarily named “Mem.” Beyond their adorable appearance, Mem plays a crucial role in combat. The Trailblazer can summon Mem during battles, where it gradually charges Energy. Once fully charged, it provides Mem’s Support that allows a designated character to immediately takes action and deal additional True DMG, turning the tide of battle. Together with Mem, the Trailblazer will surely overcome the various challenges that await in Amphoreus.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Following the winding path beyond the Abyss, players will reach Okhema, the Holy City built into the mountainside. Bathed in the eternal dawn light of the Worldbearing Titan’s protection, this city will serve as a crucial base for the trailblazing expedition through Amphoreus. Among its most distinctive landmarks stands the Marmoreal Palace, a grand baths. More than just a place for bathing and relaxation, it functions as the city’s heart, a public gathering space fostering daily social connections among residents. In these times of eternal night and chaos, Okhema, sheltered under the Worldbearing Titan’s protection, remains humanity’s final sanctuary and beacon of hope. Local legend tells a romantic tale: Kephale shall one day open their eyes, leading humanity to triumph over the black tide and forge a new world. From beneath this holy city, a group of human heroes known as the Chrysos Heirs embarks on a quest for flame, shouldering the mission to reclaim the twelve Titan Coreflames and restore Amphoreus to glory. In future stories, the Trailblazer will join their journey, fighting alongside the Chrysos Heirs in this legendary expedition.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_936700"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Meanwhile, Trailblazers will also have a chance to explore the unique city-state of Castrum Kremnos. It was named after the Blade of Fury that dangles high above the city, and it is also where the Strife Titan resides, thus making it the place where the seventh Coreflame slumbers. In the second half of the Trailblaze Mission, players will borrow the power of the Oronyx to return to the past and experience Castrum Kremnos during its golden age. There, they will discover one of the mechanisms the Trickery Titan Zagreus left behind: The Hand of Zagreus. This mechanism can be used to lift heavy obtains, pick up items, smash open pathways, and obliterate enemies easily in special circumstances. It serves as a major aid to exploration. During this time, the players will enter Castrum Kremnos alongside the Chrysos Heirs and travel through the ruin stronghold to face the fallen and maddened Strife Titan in battle to take back the Coreflame of Strife.</p><p>Version 3.0’s last map is the starting point for the entire world of Amphoreus: The Vortex of Genesis. This is the grand sanctuary for the 12 divine Titans, and it is also the prophesied place where the Miracle of Genesis occurred. Every time a Chrysos Heir overcomes a Titan and takes its Coreflame, they will return the Coreflame here. In the void, every constellation that is lit represents a journey walked by one’s predecessors. The long Flame-Chase Journey has already undergone centuries of tribulations, with much work done, and the remaining labors require the Trailblazer to work hand-in-hand with the Chrysos Heirs to accomplish.</p><p>Version 3.0 will also invite two new and powerful 5-star characters to join the player’s teams. The first is the esteemed#83 member of the Genius Society, an Emanator of Erudition: The Herta. Since Herta first debuted, she made a deep impression via her unique Herta puppets and idiosyncratic behaviors on the space station. It is said that her true self resides in a place on the Cosmos’ edge, and she rarely reveals herself to others. It is only today that she has finally shown herself. The Herta is an Ice-Type Erudition character that is skilled at AoE DMG. In battle, she can apply Interpretation on enemies, and ally characters attacks can also further apply Interpretation. With the increase of Interpretation stacks, The Herta’s abilities can increase powerful hits of DMG based on their high Interpretation stacks on specific targets and multiple enemies besides. Additionally, The Herta’s Ultimate can also Transfer the highest Interpretation stacks to Elite or stronger enemies, before dealing Ice DMG to all enemy targets. </p><p>The second character making her debut is Aglaea from Amphoreus. She bears the divine authority of “Romance,” and is one of the earliest Chrysos Heirs to embark on the Flame-Chase Journey. As Okhema’s dressmaster, Aglaea isn’t just a legendary hero of Amphoreus, but she is also a major figure in recruiting new Chrysos Heirs to embark on the world-saving journey after the Flame-Chase Journey was interrupted prior. As the first limited 5-star Remembrance character, Aglaea can summon her memosprite Garmentmaker in battle to fight alongside her. They demonstrate a duet dance aesthetic in combat. Additionally, through their cooperation, Aglaea and her Garmentmaker can synchronize attacks on enemies. This new joint attacking mechanism not only increases the Garmentmaker’s SPD, and also adds a new layer of rhythm and variability to combat, allowing an exquisite dance for two to unfold at a charming cadence.</p><p>In addition, in the first half of Version 3.0, there will also be a special Warp event. Limited 5-star characters Lingsha, Feixiao, and Jade will be making reruns. In the second half, the 5-star characters Boothill, Robin, and Silver Wolf will also be making a limited return. These characters will serve stronger reinforcements, walking side by side with Trailblazers to embark on a journey across Amphoreus. Aside from this, March 7th will gain a Preservation outfit. It can be claimed after unlocking the “Characters” function and logging in during the Version 3.0 period.</p></blockquote><p><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,617 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [22,060 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/honkai-star-rail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honkai-star-rail/id1599719154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.hkrpgoversea&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.

After several months of updates and new characters being added to the game's roster, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-seasonal-updates-ending-with-offline-mode-coming-soon/1100-6528327/" data-ref-id="1100-6528327">its final season went live in December 2024</a>.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit/" data-ref-id="5000-78253">Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit</a> is widely regarded as one of the best entries in EA's racing game series, and its remaster, released in 2020, added several neat enhancements.
