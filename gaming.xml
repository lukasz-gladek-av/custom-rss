Guardians of the Galaxy leads this month’s selection, but you also get seven other games, including SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake, all for just $11.99. It’s a great deal, since you get $269 worth of games for just $12. If you’ve had your eye on any of these, you’re basically losing money if you <em>don’t</em> join.</p><h2>Humble Choice Games for September 2024</h2><div catalogid="d1208fa6-3558-4161-92a8-68ad38073d0d" id="207022"><div id="207022" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Humble Choice - September 2024</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li>Guardians of the Galaxy</li><li>SpongeBob SquarePants: The Cosmic Shake</li><li>Coral Island</li><li>Stranded: Alien Dawn</li><li>Lost Eidolons</li><li>You Suck at Parking</li><li>Infraspace</li><li>Astrea: Six-Sided Oracles</li></ul><p>All of the games are yours to keep forever, regardless of your Humble Choice subscription status. You can skip a month or cancel your subscription at any time, so there’s no commitment or lock-in. You can always rejoin later if a future month’s offerings spark your interest. The games are delivered in the form of Steam codes that you can redeem yourself, or pass off to friends or internet strangers if you don’t want a particular game.</p><p>As for this month’s selections, the big Marvel game is well worth $11.99 all on its own. From our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-game-review">Guardians of the Galaxy review</a>:</p><p>“Marvel’s Guardians of the Galaxy nicely balances a goofy, action-filled adventure with some genuinely heartfelt story moments, and the choices you’re given can add some surprising personal twists to your particular playthrough. Its combat and level design are relatively simple if still consistently entertaining, but it’s the relationships and banter between its characters that keep everything fresh as they evolve. It isn’t going to set the world on fire, but Guardians of the Galaxy is still another convincing example of how much fun a linear, no-frills, single-player campaign can be.” </p><p>In addition to free games each month, Humble Choice subscribers save up to 20% off other games in the Humble Store. And 5% of your subscription purchase goes to charity.

        <p>These people should move to a nicer town</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>The second season of animated show Arcane is due to arrive on Netflix this November. After an initial teaser trailer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arcanes-second-season-will-be-its-last-says-its-first-trailer">back in June</a>, Netflix have now released a more substantial two-minute trailer that you can watch below.
</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysqiEC6bLUI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>That looks like the beautifully animated melodrama I remember.
</p>
<p>It was also announced alongside the first trailer in June that Arcane's second season would be its last. I think its admirable, given the popularity of the first season and of League Of Legends in general, that they're driving towards a specific ending to the story.
</p>
<p>Arcane is produced by French animation studio Fortiche, who Riot Games <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-games-buy-big-part-of-arcane-animation-studio">bought a big part of</a> in 2022. Riot also apparently have plans for a lot <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-games-outline-five-year-strategy-including-plans-for-more-tv-movies-and-music">more TV and movie projects still to come</a>.
</p>
<p>Watching the trailer above got me excited for season two, but also made me realise how little I remember of season one, despite loving it, outside of the broad strokes of its A plot. What's Kate's deal again? What happened to that... other guy? Was someone inventing magic or rediscovering it or...? I'd watch season one again to refresh my memory, but I'm not sure I can face its emotionally intense plot beats again, so instead I'm hoping season two begins with a really meaty recap. 
</p>
<p>Season two will arrive in November, but there's no specific release date yet.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Well, almost everything. The neat thing about summer is that it’s prime time for deals on video games,, and this narrow window between the end of summer vacation and the actual beginning of autumn is the last bit of time for stores to squeeze some sales out before the heavy-hitting releases of the year start dropping every other week. In other words, here are a bunch of great games to check out on the cheap before <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-beta-weekend-1851638800&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-multiplayer-beta-weekend-1851638800"><em>Black Ops 6</em></a></span><em> </em>rolls around and ruins your productivity and spending habits.</p></div><div><p><em>Untitled Goose Game </em>has the benefit of being the most straightforward game included here. In it, you play as the titular fowl as they go about terrorizing the neighborhood. Rather than being some kind of freewheeling, open-world sandbox for chaos like <em>Goat Simulator</em>, <em>Untitled Goose Game </em>is actually secretly a stealth game. The goal is to get away with causing as much mayhem in the little English village as possible without getting caught. This includes ruining someone’s backyard, an avenue full of storefronts, and all manner of otherwise quiet, domestic settings. All the while, your rampage is set to classical music that quiets and loudens based on the current state of emergency. The whole thing feels much more elevated and elegant than it first appears, and I think that’s part of <em>Untitled Goose Game</em>’s appeal. Nowadays, you can even play it cooperatively, and two geese simply sounds like too much for this poor little town to deal with. <strong>Terrorize the locals and become untethered in </strong><em><strong>Untitled Goose Game</strong></em><strong>, which is going for $10 on the Epic Games Store.</strong><br></p></div><div><p>The first few <em>Mega Man X </em>games are among the most cherished games of my childhood, and anything in that vein has immediately earned my attention and admiration. <em>Gravity Circuit</em> is one such game, but it’s even more interesting because it actually strips you of your blaster and focuses on melee combat and combos. It took me a while to wrap my head around that pretty drastic change, but once I did, <em>Gravity Circuit </em>really opened up, and just thinking about it now makes me want to pick it back up and actually finish the game. <strong>If you like games that love to throw twists on tried-and-true formulas, </strong><em><strong>Gravity Circuit </strong></em><strong>is well worth picking up for $8.49.</strong><br></p></div><div><p><em>Remnant 2 </em>is the pulpiest sci-fi action game you’re going to get. Often described as “<em>Dark Souls </em>with guns,” <em>Remnant 2 </em>is some of the most unabashed fun you can get out of a game. Shoot and satisfyingly dodge-roll your way through dark fantasy and sci-fi settings in a world-hopping adventure that feels ripped from the covers of schlocky novellas from another era. In the meantime, you’re also constantly earning new loot and progressing your class, which includes archetypes like the tank as well as one loadout that gives you a great dog as an AI companion. Its story has a sci-fi B-movie feel to it, being just coherent enough to propel you through its beats, but not enough to have tremendous staying power. In short, <em>Remnant 2 </em>is just the right amount of nonsense, and I loved playing it. It’s probably even better in co-op and now that most of its DLC is out, you’ll likely have even more sick-looking plant aliens to blast to bits. <strong>You can get the deluxe edition of </strong><em><strong>Remnant 2 </strong></em><strong>for $30 on EGS.</strong><br></p></div><div><p>Despite my best efforts, I have not been able to shake <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>since playing it for the first time last year. It had one of the messiest launches ever, and is no doubt still <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-fixed-re-review-2023-impressions-saved-1850143200&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-fixed-re-review-2023-impressions-saved-1850143200">riddled with blemishes and imperfections</a></span>, and yet everywhere I turn, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791">I still see Night City</a></span>. I see Afterlife and Rogue sitting in the back of it. I see Johnny Silverhand and a view of the city from the outskirts of town. I see Santo Domingo, a neighborhood named after the capital of my mother country, and how rundown it is. I see the dilapidated ruins of Dogtown and the glow of the Heavy Hearts Club’s massive pyramid jutting out of it. I miss it all the time. I miss my V, and I miss his friends and his partner. Warts and all, <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>is one of the most unforgettable games I’ve played, and I still haven’t been able to place my thumb on exactly why.<strong> If getting lost in a world filled with people making the best of a shitty situation sounds like something that </strong><em><strong>could </strong></em><strong>mean a lot to you, you can pick up </strong><em><strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong></em><strong> for $30 and its ultimate edition (which packs in the </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-update-review-idris-elba-1850852291&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-update-review-idris-elba-1850852291"><strong>phenomenal <em>Phantom Liberty </em>expansion</strong></a></span><strong>) for $53.59.</strong><br></p></div><div><p>I’ve only ever watched people play <em>RoboCop: Rogue City</em>, but from that alone, I’ve been able to glean that it’s actually a decent game that captures the spirit of the original movie. In it, you’re the eponymous character and you do exactly as he would do: you shoot, kill, and otherwise maim criminals. If this sounds simplistic, it’s because it is, and <em>Rogue City </em>thrives on that. It doesn’t have huge aspirations, and because the developers appeared to keep the game’s scope in check, they were able to make a competent AA-quality shooter with modest depth that adapts the original movie’s grisly violence pretty faithfully. You are a walking, talking tank who blasts and punches enemies to literal bits. You can grab enemies by the neck and fling them around. It’s a game that just nails the power fantasy of being RoboCop, and you can be him by picking up the game for $25. </p></div><div><p>Don’t Nod is most famous these days for making the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-max-endings-chloe-1851538397&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-max-endings-chloe-1851538397"><em>Life Is Strange</em></a></span><em> </em>series, but it has spent the last few years taking the goodwill and resources from the massive success of those games to make a ton of markedly different games. One such game is <em>Jusant</em>, a game about a boy with the singular goal of climbing an impossibly high mountain. There is no combat and I’m pretty sure there’s no dialogue either. All you do is climb. I love games that focus on a thing and make it the most entertaining, challenging, and all-consuming version of it possible, and that’s how I feel about climbing in <em>Jusant</em>. After decades of playing through video game setpieces, it’s pretty easy to see through the artifice of scenarios designed to rouse me. I’m rarely, if ever, on the edge of my seat, muscles and jaw tightened due to the sheer exhilaration of a sequence. I was in that state for the entirety of my time with <em>Jusant </em>though. <strong>You can feel the thrills of surmounting the highest peak, too, by picking up </strong><em><strong>Jusant </strong></em><strong>for $16.24.</strong><br></p></div><div><p>Haters be damned, the newest <em>Saints Row </em>game was good. Maybe even great. It is not some ambitious and fundamental rework of the series that people grew to love, and it definitely isn’t the politically correct “woke” shit that certain people accused it of being. It was a fresh new skin on the exact same formula that made the series so widely loved in the first place. It’s maybe a bit more earnest than its predecessors, but that didn’t stop it from also being crass and inane, which are key tenets of what made <em>Saints Row </em>click for most of its audience. People just kind of <em>wanted </em>to hate this game and barely gave it a chance. If you played and loved the earlier games like I did, and just want another one of those with even more customization tools and a fun new setting in the American Southwest, there’s no reason not to pick up the new <em>Saints Row</em>. <strong>Crucially, it’s also only $9, and you can get the gold edition with the expansion pass for just one more dollar.</strong></p></div><div><p>Until the next <em>Skate </em>comes out, you may as well pick up the best possible skating simulator out there. <em>Session </em>is perhaps the most technical of all the skating games on offer, but it is alsothe most freeing. There’s no scoring, and there’s no real story there either. All you do is make your character, hop on your board, and cruise around real-life locales. The only goal is whatever you want out of that session. It’s beautiful and relaxing. Whenever I picked up skating as a teenager, I really just wanted to glide. Tricks and races were cool, but skating has always been about a vibe to me, and that’s what <em>Session </em>is built upon. <strong>You can chase that vibe down by picking up </strong><em><strong>Session: Skate Sim </strong></em><strong>for $12.</strong><br></p></div><div><p><em>System Shock </em>is one of the most stunning remakes of a game there is. It’s a complete visual overhaul of the 1994 original, but one that manages to maintain what made that game so legendary and profoundly influential. All of the friction of it is still there, and it is one the most densely textured games I’ve ever seen. It even features the return of the original voice for <em>System Shock</em>’s villain, SHODAN. If you’ve ever wondered about the history of immersive sims (a genre of game I’m obsessed with), there’s no better way to experience the moment where it all clicked into place than buying this very sensible and very faithful recreation of one of the genre’s formative texts.<strong> You can dive into </strong><em><strong>System Shock </strong></em><strong>for just $18. </strong></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The next major Helldivers 2 update is coming this month, and Arrowhead Studios is promising “significant changes” for the game.</p>



<p>“We see the steam reviews and we hear you loud and clear,” Arrowhead said in a blog post outlining the next Helldivers 2 update. This update, which is scheduled to release on September 17 for all players, is aimed at “ensuring Helldivers 2 meets the high standards we all expect.”</p>



<p>As far as what this update will include, there’s plenty. Some of the bigger changes include boosts to weapons like the heavy machine gun and autocannon as well an overhaul to a number of enemies. There’s no mention of any additions, such as new enemies or additional content. Instead, everything seems to be focusing on fixing a game that many fans believe to be broken after various nerfs over the months.</p>



<p>Ahead of the release of the update, the studio held multiple closed beta tests for players in order to “ensure everything runs smoothly”. They also mention expanding the tests before full release to help find any “issues and missteps”.</p>

<p>Below is what <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4613462911400573371" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Arrowhead is promising</a> with the next update:</p>



<ul>
<li>We are reworking Armor Penetration, Anti-Tank weapons and enemy armor and health values. As a key part of the rework we have done an initial balancing pass on over 30 weapons and stratagems.</li>



<li>We are overhauling a number of different enemies to make them feel more rewarding to kill when you use the proper tools to handle them but ensure they still feel formidable. Enemy bots, including Hulks, will have lower armor, and the number of rockets fired by enemies like the Devastator and Gunship will be limited, making combat more balanced. The armor values of particularly tough bug enemies like the Charger, Impaler, and Bile Titan will also be reduced.</li>



<li>Weapons such as the Autocannon, Heavy Machine Gun, and Anti-Material Rifle will be more effective, providing greater loadout versatility. We are also working towards additional improvements for the flamethrower weapons.</li>



<li>We’re taking this opportunity to consider new player fantasies and design goals for these weapons and stratagems based on the feedback we’ve received and the trends we’re observing during gameplay.</li>
</ul>



<p>Helldivers 2 is available for PlayStation 5 and PC.</p>

Featuring a vintage green screen aesthetic, Space Colony Studios strives to create an “era-accurate” game that exudes retro vibes in every way, from the text to the visual effects. As the Jovian patrol ship sails into the darkness among the stars, the players will feel like they are on an adventure in an 80s Sci-Fi as they solve the mystery they find themselves in.</p><p><strong>The Story: A New Threat Emerges From the Void</strong></p><p>Humans have long since freed themselves from the grasp of gravity, but they are still unable to escape the hold of war.<br>It’s year 214 of the Planetary Calendar.

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Last week's new JAK Deathmarch aftermarket part for the BAL-27 assault rifle arrived broken, with an issue allowing the gun to have an infinite reserve ammunition.

            <p>
As of earlier this week, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> is officially, and slightly alarmingly, ten years old. And coinciding with that impressive milestone, EA has unveiled the life sim's latest seasonal roadmap, which includes a life-and-death-themed new expansion arriving this Halloween.
</p>
<p>
EA's roadmap is admittedly pretty light on specifics right now, with more to be share as each release nears, but we do know The Sims 4's latest content season - collectively presented under the name To Be Continued - kicks off on 19th September with two new Kit packs.
</p>
<p>
"Give your little nooboo a sophisticated start with the Storybook Nursery Kit," teases <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/the-sims-4-season-of-to-be-continued">EA's blog post</a>, "or build an inspiring retreat to help your Sim’s creativity flow with the Artist Studio Kit."

<p>
That'll be followed by the Reaper's Rewards Event, coming to The Sim 4's base game on 24th September, which sees players helping out Death in order to earn rewards.
</p>
<p>
And there's still more busywork for the Grim Reaper starting on October 31st, when The Sim 4's Life and Death Expansion Pack arrives. This will enable players to embark on an "endless journey through life and beyond" - which could mean anything from the introduction of funerals to an new afterlife realm - and more is set to be revealed on 31st October.
</p>
<p>
All this follow a rather steamy summer for The Sims 4, which introduced the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-is-getting-ready-for-a-summer-of-sexy-updates-starting-with-swimsuits">sexy new swimwear</a>, new love retreats, and features such as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-is-turning-up-the-heat-with-its-super-sexy-lovestruck-expansion-pack">Romantic Boundaries and new romatic interactions</a> across a range of free and paid updates.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-now-on-pc-adds-mod-tools-manager-evil-endings-and-more/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baldur%E2%80%99s-gate-3-patch-7-out-now-on-pc-adds-mod-tools-manager-evil-endings-and-more.973191/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-out-now-on-pc-adds-mod-tools-manager-evil-endings-and-more/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-update-7-is-out-next-week-adding-mods-and-new-cinematics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> recently, Larian has <a href="https://x.com/baldursgate3/status/1831688936281739295" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> Baldur's Gate 3 Patch 7 on PC. This heavy update (11.6GB in size, but you'll actually need 160GB of free space on your drive to install it) was highly anticipated mainly because it finally adds those evil endings players have been waiting for. There are 13 of those that include cinematics, as well as unique endings for Origin characters.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The other major addition of Baldur's Gate 3 Patch 7 is undoubtedly the public release of mod tools. The editor is a separate app that can be downloaded via Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2934770/Baldurs_Gate_3_Editor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at this URL</a>. You'll have to make sure that DLC is enabled through the store page and that ‘Tools’ is checked in your Steam Library to make the application visible once installed.</p>
<p>For those interested in Baldur's&nbsp;Gate 3 modding, Mod.io offers a series of tutorials and guides. The game now also officially supports some scripted mods using Osiris, Larian's in-house scripting language. This means that mod authors can load their own scripts, handle build errors, and even do some basic debugging. Mods can be published straight from the toolkit, making it seamless.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Furthermore, Baldur's Gate 3 Patch 7 introduces a built-in mod manager. This allows users to easily browse mods made with the toolkit, install them without having to move out of the game and check that everyone has the same mods installed in a multiplayer party.</p>
<p>The game itself also received some improvements. Honour Mode, for instance, has seen the introduction of new Legendary Actions and other fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li aria-level="1"><em>If Dror Ragzlin finds himself inside the spider pit, he'll try his best to befriend the spiders residing there with a new spell called Arachnid Compulsion so they can band together to fight the real enemy - you.</em></li>
<li aria-level="1"><em>The Bulette has a new condition called Diamond Scales and a new Legendary Action called Shredding Scales.</em></li>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Malus Thorm has a new Legendary Action called Grasping Appendage.</em></li>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Added a new aura and spell for Spectators: Panicked Sentinel and Ocular Nightmare, respectively.</em></li>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Ch'r'ai Tska'an, the leader of the githyanki ambush in Act II, has a new Legendary Action called Soul Sacrifice.</em></li>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Ch'r'ai Har'rak, the githyanki leader at the Knights of the Shield Hideout, has a new Legendary Action called Tu'narath's Embrace.</em></li>
<li aria-level="1"><em>Ptaris has a new Legendary Action called Ptarian Dogma.</em></li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<p>While Baldur's Gate 3 Patch 7 is live on PC, Mac and console players must wait until October. After this update, there will be two major features left on the roadmap: cross-play and photo mode. Beyond that, fans of the game can only expect small fixes while the bulk of Larian is busy with their <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-larian-studios-2-new-original-projects-best-work-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new projects.</a></p>

            <p>
Every time you load up Agentia you are reincarnated as a different creature. "Creature" is perhaps too narrow a word - the game's "playable characters" range from geese, microscopic life and triceratops to menhirs and small rocky islands. Each forms the heart of a diamond of delicately drawn, isometric grid terrain with a baby mobile canopy of clouds and sun. It looks like an illustration from an old botanical or geographical textbook, although the inviting emptiness around the visible area also dimly reminds  me of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exile_(1995_video_game_series)">certain elder RPGs</a> I used to play on Macintosh.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
There are no dungeons or fell beasts to wrangle with, however. You exist here simply to explore, or be explored, roaming the landscape using the arrow keys (the angled perspective is a little unwieldy) or staying put to witness the passage of other entities such as birds and sailboats. There are snatches of music against a steady wash of animal and mineral noise. As you and the world move through each other, encounters produce or modify lines of poetry along the bottom of the view, with underlined text you can click to develop or sometimes, reduce the possibilities of a phrase - it feels a little as though you're asking somebody to repeat themselves, to be a little more specific.
</p>
<p>
The game's tilesets are based on the <a href="https://withering-systems.itch.io/city-game-tileset">city game isometric asset pack</a> created by <a href="https://withering-systems.neocities.org/">withering systems</a>, while the main theme is George Georgia's Solemn Solstice. The verbal elements were algorithmically extracted from a range of mostly "vintage" texts in the public domain, then organised by hand. These sources include manuals of astronomy, accounts of mountaineering expeditions, and works of philosophy such as Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's <a href="https://files.libcom.org/files/A%20Thousand%20Plateaus.pdf">A Thousand Plateaus</a>. The latter tome begs to be navigated in a similarly pliant and loosely connected way.
</p>
<p>
"Each entity featured in Agentia experiences, senses, or simply witnesses the world in ways very different to that of the human mind and body," explains <a href="https://richardacarter.com/agentia/">the project's web page</a>. "Rather than suggest their being can be expressed directly through language, Agentia (Medieval Latin for agency, ability, to act, perform, broadly construed) uses found language excerpted from related works of literature, creating a collage of registers (often strange and enigmatic), that can hint at such more-than-human stories - including, inevitably, their entangled relations with our own. 
</p>
<p>
"Plants and stones, of course, do not move through the world in the same way," it continues. "Readers are invited to be still with them, reading vignettes from time and space as they flow by, and so consider a distinctly non-human mode of being."
</p>
<p>
I enjoyed Agentia, which you can <a href="https://richardacarter.com/agentia-content/index.html">play in a browser for free</a>. It has opened a small space in my head, and I'm not sure what, if anything, I should put there yet. The creator, Richard A. Carter, is a UK-based academic who "investigates the material and ecological dimensions of technical artefacts, activities, and environments". I know him a bit via Xitter, and always like hearing about his experiments. His <a href="https://richardacarter.com/work/">other works</a> include Signals, a book of algebraic poems written in a mathematical language designed for extra-terrestrials, and Dark Mode, a "minimal meditation on the rogue-like / adventure game genre, stripped to its bare essentials: a labyrinth, varied "encounters", and numerical stats".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/mike-rufail-ceo-tradeoff-envy/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Mike Rufail, the prolific founder of Envy Gaming, which merged with OpTic Gaming in 2022, has been named CEO of TradeOff, an all-new virtual trading and gaming platform. This fantasy stock trading platform is set to launch soon, and earlier today, the organisation announced Rufail’s appointment, dubbing him a ‘gaming and esports expert’.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-from-gaming-to-gaming">From Gaming to <em>Gaming</em></h2>



<p>TradeOff is preparing to launch worldwide, but in the meantime, it’s busy assembling a corporate structure, assigning Mike Rufail as CEO. In 2009, Rufail joined the Envy team and ultimately became the company owner, managing it effectively until it merged with OpTic Gaming in 2022, scrubbing the Envy Gaming branding from the esports industry.</p>



<p>TradeOff is a platform that allows users to earn real money by competing in online contests ‘similar to fantasy sports or fantasy sports betting’. It’ll feature leaderboards, community-based elements, and partnerships with top traders when it launches. </p>



<p>In a statement on the fresh appointment, Mike Rufail said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Today, there is no accessible entry point for learning how to trade stocks and crypto without putting personal capital at risk, which can be intimidating and prohibitive. TradeOff is going to change how financial brands reach and connect with new audiences, borrowing the best elements of what made playing and streaming video games widely popular and give people opportunities to explore trading, learn, practice and compete in fun new ways with low-risk, high-reward potential.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>At TradeOff, Rufail will be focused on product design, testing, corporate strategy, partnerships, and marketing. Also on the team are fintech experts, entrepreneurs, and even a ‘patents expert’ with time served at HP, Intel, and Wells Fargo. </p>



<p>Sarne Lightman, a member of TradeOff’s leadership team and the managing director of GG Poker, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Mike’s passion as a self-taught trader paired with his roots in building communities around emerging forms of entertainment, social connection and competition make him the ideal leader for TradeOff. We believe TradeOff can be to stock trading what fantasy sports, mobile betting and online poker were to sports and gaming: an invitation to new audiences to participate and emotionally invest in and learn about the game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Is this how you thought Mike Rufail would resurface after two decades in the gaming and esports industry?</p>

                <p>Football Manager 25 has been delayed by several weeks and will not include several expected features. Studio manager <a href="https://www.footballmanager.com/news/development-update-football-manager-25" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Miles Jacobson announced</a> that the game will now release in late November, rather than early November. The exact release date will be confirmed later in September.</p><p>As for cut features, the mode International Management will not be playable in FM25, FM25 Console, or FM25 Touch. Jacobson cited the difficulty of transferring the series to Unity and claimed the mode would not reach the studio's "initial quality threshold." The team also looked at the in-game data. Reportedly, only 5.6% of FM24 PC saves played International Management. According to Jacobson, the data "validates our view that we need to do much, much better with the experience.” The feature will return in FM26 and remains in FM25 Mobile, as that version is on a different development track and uses a different code base.</p><p>The other removed feature is minor: player weights will no longer be visible. With the introduction of women's leagues into Football Manager, the developers found that women's weight fluctuate more often than men's. The game will still incorporate a basic measurement for simulation purposes, but it will not be visible to players.</p><p>This is the second time feature cuts have been announced for Football Manager 25. Create-a-club and Versus were cut back in June. Those modes are also set to return in FM26.</p>

On September 4, Warner Bros. posted what it called a teaser for the movie to social media and the film distributor’s YouTube channel.

Fans of the game will catch a lot of familiar items and creatures, such as the iconic green creeper, a tree floating with a block of wood missing from its trunk, and many weird looking animals.</p><p>One of the biggest initial reactions to the teaser trailer from fans is dissatisfaction over the film’s look, which brings a strange CGI aesthetic to the iconic blocky textures of <em>Minecraft</em>. Many have taken to social media to voice their concerns over the visual style of the movie, with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/death444star/status/1831694473115443360&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/death444star/status/1831694473115443360" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one poster</a></span> on X (formerly Twitter) saying that, “we gotta give the <em>Minecraft </em>movie the sonic treatment bc it’s looking buns rn,” referring to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-movie-first-trailer-ugly-design-delay-redesign-1851446390&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-movie-first-trailer-ugly-design-delay-redesign-1851446390">the debacle surrounding Sonic’s original trailer design for his 2020 film</a></span>, a look that would be completely redone before the movie’s release. Other criticisms of the movie’s aesthetic call it worse than AI, or just as bad as crappy renderings of what “realistic <em>Minecraft</em>” would be like.</p><p>To make matters worse, audiences are also bringing up <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/minecraft-story-mode-works-surprisingly-well-1736251691&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-story-mode-works-surprisingly-well-1736251691"><em>Minecraft: Story Mode</em></a></span>, the 2015 game from Telltale that took a more narrative approach to the sandbox title. While it had its problems, <em>Story Mode</em> retained the iconic style of the original game, with blocky textures and characters throughout that made it feel like it was set in true <em>Minecraft</em>. Almost a decade since its release, and with the trailer for the movie not satisfying a lot of fans, some are seeing <em>Story Mode</em> in a new light.</p><p>Yet, beyond all the hate on how the<em> Minecraft Movie</em> looks, there are some acknowledging what the film actually is: a fun, if silly, movie aimed towards kids. <em>Kotaku</em>’s own John Walker said as much in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/a-minecraft-movie-trailer-jack-black-kids-1851640395&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/a-minecraft-movie-trailer-jack-black-kids-1851640395">his post</a></span> on the internet backlash to the movie, succinctly telling adults complaining on the internet that the movie just isn’t for them. He’s not wrong! This movie is absolutely trying to be just fun enough to make kids happy. </p><p>I think there’s a world in which a <em>Minecraft </em>movie could have served old and young fans, without being what looks to me like the most boring drivel imaginable. But clearly, this version of the film is doing exactly what it aims to, whether we like it or not.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Larian Studios has finally released <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/baldurs-gate-patch-7-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the highly-anticipated</a> Patch 7 for Baldur’s Gate 3 on PC. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/patch-7-now-live_121">new patch adds a number of features</a> to the game. From new evil ending cinematics to Honor Mode improvements to new Legendary Actions, there’s a lot for players in this update. Of course, there’s no bigger addition than official mod support for Baldur’s Gate 3.</p>



<p>“We’re also bringing you another way to mod your Baldur’s Gate 3 saves, with Patch 7 introducing our very own in-game Mod Manager and modding Toolkit,” Larian Studios said. “With this new and supported way to create and install mods, you should see improvements in compatibility and accessibility, and can rest more assured that your supported mods work wherever you’re playing Baldur’s Gate 3.”</p>



<p>With the mod support and the new Toolkit along with the rest of the update, there is the potential for third-party modes to become incompatible. </p>



<p>“Please try uninstalling your mods and confirm whether the issue persists without them installed,” Larian says.</p>



<p>While Baldur’s Gate Patch 7 is available now on PC, those on Mac and console will have to wait a little longer. Larian says that the update will come to those platforms sometime in October.</p>



<p>The patch comes in at 11.6GB on PC and requires 160GB of free space to install on your machine. Should you not have the space to install the update, Larian suggest uninstalling the game and then re-downloading the patched version of the game.</p>



<p>While Patch 7 is going to be the last major update to the game, Larian isn’t done support Baldur’s Gate 3 just yet. The studio is still working on full crossplay and a photo mode along with various other fixes. Once those are out the door, however, Larian will then pivot fully to its next,  unannounced project.</p>



<p>Full notes for Patch 7, which includes hundreds of fixes and updates, can be found via <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/patch-7-now-live_121" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the game’s official website</a>.</p>

			<p>A recent trip to the Team Asobi studio <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/astro-bot-dlc-will-include-challenge-and-speedrun-levels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">made by VGC</a> revealed upcoming plans for a DLC for Astro Bot, a game that will be released on September 6. Reviews have already started pouring in, and you can read our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/astro-bot-celebrated-platformer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review written by Kai here</a>. For those who have already played it, the game is highly revered and scored 94 on Metacritic, making it Universally Acclaimed. When people get around to playing it, they may want more from Astro Bot. With the trip that VGC made to Team Asobi, it has been confirmed that there is a DLC coming, which adds to Speedrun mode and challenge levels for those who want to push themselves to the limit.</p>
<p><iframe title="Astro Bot - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/unYFdcEjV9k?start=40&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>To prepare for the upcoming release of Astro Bot, Team Asobi has been adding plenty of content to Astro's Playroom, the predecessor to Astro Bot. This includes new trophies for players, such as collecting all four Special Bots and trophies for collecting them individually from their dedicated area. It also includes gatchas, where players can use their in-game currencies to collect the special rewards.</p>
<p>According to the report made by VGC, Team Asobi is planning on adding new content over the coming weeks and months, with an estimate of ten challenge levels and five speedrun-focused levels. However, it isn't fully confirmed whether that will be everything that is added, and it will most likely revolve around the success of Astro Bot.</p>
<p>With how well it's currently doing in the critics' eyes, likely, the game will also be universally liked by those who purchase it. Additionally, Team Asobi have expressed interest that they want to know whether those on PC would be interested in being able to access Astro Bot, with Team Asobi saying in <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/astro-bot-how-team-asobi-has-turned-playroom-into-a-galaxy-sized-sequel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an interview with VGC</a>, Nicolas Doucet, the Creative Director of Team Asobi noted that he believes it wouldn't be an issue if there were an Astro Bot game released in the future that didn't rely on PlayStation theming. Before the pack-in Astro Bot game for PlayStation 5 was released, it was a point of contention whether they would rely on PlayStation's theming for the game, but so far it seems to be a nostalgic success.</p>
<p>Even with the free pack-in software alone for PlayStation 5, Astro Bot has provided fun and nostalgia to those who grew up with the consoles, and the possibility of an Astro Bot DLC gives the game and franchise even more room to grow and to stand on its own two feet.</p>

            <p>Did you forget about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a>? Because Baldur's Gate 3 did not forget about you. Specifically, it did not forget about the incorrigible evil-doers amongst you who've been gunning for some additional plot catharsis. Larian's very bestest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> has been biding its time in the shadows while you've been busy with other games. It has lingered silently while you go heisting on Tatooine or get messed up by Golden-Eyed Beasts, waiting and waiting for the perfect moment - and now, it has finally struck with an unholy new patch, which adds 13 new Evil Endings, revamped splitscreen and an official modding toolkit. Foolish summer child! It is too late to flee.</p><!--more-->
<p>We last heard about Patch 7 back in July, in the shape of a blog post <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-will-add-dynamic-splitscreen-new-evil-endings-dark-urge-fixes-and-lots-more-kissing">that contained no less than 10 mentions of kissing</a>. Subsequently, there was a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/delayed-baldurs-gate-3-patch-notes-reckon-youve-all-been-eating-too-much-delicious-irresistible-soap">stern memo about players eating soap</a>. The full changelog eases off on both the soap and the sauce, with just five kisses to unearth and minimal discussion of cleansing products. It also details revisions to the game's "Show Cinematic Nudity" option, which is now "Show Sexual and Violent Cinematics" and has a more extensive description. </p>
<p>I highlight the Show Sexual And Violent Cinematics setting because you'll need to disable it if you want to view the aforesaid new evil endings in their entirety. They are, after all, <em>very</em> evil. "This setting does not affect your adventure, your choices, or your access to romance options," the changelog reassures. "However, it does block sexual content with nudity and particularly violent scenes with gore."</p>
<p>If you're playing as a Dark Urge character, the update also makes it possible to add a particular Tiefing bard to your party as a controllable character at camp, given an empty slot. This is very much a "one-night kinda thing", however. "There are no new companions," the developers note. "There is only death." If you were hoping for a surprise deluge of permanent full-time party members, you'll have to console yourself with new Honour Mode features instead. These include new Legendary Actions - Dror Ragzlin will now be able to befriend pit spiders, while local physician Malus Thorm has a new trick called Grasping Appendage.</p>
<p>And then there's the official in-game mod manager and accompanying toolkit, available via Steam, which are far too <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/community-update-27-official-modding-support_118?mc_cid=62c7d6b649&amp;mc_eid=e6ec8a7074">voluminous</a> to summarise. "With this new and supported way to create and install mods, you should see improvements in compatibility and accessibility, and can rest more assured that your supported mods work wherever you're playing Baldur's Gate 3, which will include consoles a little down the line," the devs note.</p>
<p>Patch 7 weighs approximately 11.6GB on PC, and will require 160GB of free space to install - the devs suggest uninstalling and reinstalling the patched version as a single download if you don't have room.</p>
<p>Larian are still working on crossplay and photo mode, but this will be one of the last significant Baldur's Gate 3 patches, as the developers bid the Sword Coast goodbye and commence work on no less than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-have-two-new-games-in-the-works-fueled-by-the-very-same-fire-as-baldurs-gate-3">two new games</a>. As the patch notes conclude, "it's time for the team to go back to our cave and hang the armour on the wall while we focus on bringing you our next project."</p>

This can be a bit challenging, but we once again recommend going to one of the Marvel-themed areas with a boss and shooting the AIs. Just make sure there is some good distance between you and them.</p><h3 id="h8909"><a id=""></a><strong>Her shadow is my place of peace in this world of torment</strong></h3><p>This is straightforward. You only need to reach the statue near Rebel’s Roost and crouch.

These can be a bit challenging to obtain. We suggest landing either at Restored Reels or Rebel’s Roost. The reason is that these areas always spawn Avenger chests, increasing the odds of finding the gear you need. Oh, and then pick it all back up again as it’s super-useful.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a9e0bddcea1d1b10164bf5776aaca1f2" data-recommend-id="image://a9e0bddcea1d1b10164bf5776aaca1f2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Latverian chest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Latverian chest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Epic / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a9e0bddcea1d1b10164bf5776aaca1f2" data-recommend-id="image://a9e0bddcea1d1b10164bf5776aaca1f2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Latverian chest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><h3 id="h8911"><a id=""></a><strong>This chest is now property of Latveria</strong></h3><p>For this quest, you’ll need to open five rare chests. These commonly spawn in named areas, especially if they’re highlighted gold. You’ll know you found one when you spot a giant blue chest. After you open five, you’ll complete this quest.</p><h3 id="h8912"><a id=""></a><strong>Insolence must be punished</strong></h3><p>This quest is easier said than done. For this, we recommend playing with friends because you’ll need to kill either the Doombot or someone carrying the Arcane Gauntlets. Once you’ve obtained them, you’ll need to be smart and use them wisely in combat because they’re not the best weapons. To complete this quest, you must hit four players with Doom’s Arcane Gauntlets.</p><h3 id="h8913"><a id=""></a><strong>There is triumph, even in torment</strong></h3><p>This is another quest that may take a little while to complete. What you need to do is place first or second in a match. Depending on how sweaty your lobbies are, this may take a while to complete.</p><h3 id="h8914"><a id=""></a><strong>Doom masters all that lies before</strong></h3><p>Here you’ll need to pick up Captain America’s Shield or Shuri’s Black Panther Claws from a fallen enemy. It’s important to mention that you don’t need to be the one that kills them. The quest will be completed as long as another dead player has them before you.</p><h3 id="h8915"><a id=""></a><strong>Defend Latveria.

<p>While admitting there were some issues, we were quite taken with GreedFall on its initial release.</p>
<p>"GreedFall has more than its fair share of faults, and its curious mix of the sweet and the sour is far from a roleplaying revelation. But the elements that matter have been imbued with such love and care - so much so that I quickly forgave this ambitious RPG its shortcomings," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/greedfall-review-technical-shortcomings-are-overcome-by-an-abundance-of-heart">Eurogamer's GreedFall review from 2019</a>.</p>
<p>We were less enamoured with Shadow of the Tomb Raider, however. "This Tomb Raider may have motivation and purpose and a vague semblance of an emotional arc but it all rings hollow, particularly when elsewhere there's repetition and an overall lack of new ideas," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-review">Shadow of the Tomb Raider review</a>. "This Lara has forgotten herself and forgotten the joy and the thrill."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
