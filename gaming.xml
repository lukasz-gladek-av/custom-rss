		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> monthly games for December 2024 have been announced, and Sony’s getting right into the holiday spirit with one of the best local co-op games out there, some family friendly monster battling aaaaaaand…. Aliens.</p>
<h2>What are the PS Plus December 2024 games?</h2>
<p>The following three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, which will be 3rd December.</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/24/it-takes-two-review/"><strong>It Takes Two</strong></a> (PS5 | PS4)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/06/19/aliens-dark-descent-review/"><strong>Aliens: Dark Descent</strong></a> (PS5 | PS4)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/temtem"><strong>Temtem</strong></a> (PS5)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you haven’t already played <strong>It Takes Two</strong>, then I don’t know what is wrong with you – OK, so it can be difficult to get someone to sit down for co-op, and maybe 3D platformers ain’t your thing. Hazelight’s latest game is easily their greatest, though, with full couch co-op at the heart of the game (and an online counterpart that works really well), and a quirky story that sends its married protagonists on a wild and ever-changing adventure. It’s well worth playing, if you can, and chances are this is tying in with a new Hazelight game announcement very soon. Fares has a knack of popping up at The Game Awards…</p>


<p>For a complete change of pace we have <strong>Aliens: Dark Descent</strong>, a fraught real time tactical game set in the dark sci-fi universe. You have to command a small team of Colonial Marines on missions where the possibility of xenomorphs appearing to attack you is around every corner. In our review, Steve said “It absolutely nails the feel of the films and brings exactly the kind of tense and thrilling strategy combat you would want. The iconic motion tracker and creature design fit perfectly with the genre and there is even an interesting narrative that introduces some new perspectives to the series. While game over can come far too swiftly at times, there is always something to draw you back in.”</p>

<p>Rounding this month out is the PS5-only <strong>Temtem</strong>, a game that riffs off the monster collecting and battling of Pokémon with an online multiplayer twist. The game spent a good year or two in early access, building out from an initial island to a broader game. We played that initial launch, with Aran saying “So far Temtem has captured similar feelings to what I felt when playing Pokémon originally on the Game Boy, but with the MMO layer on top of that, TemTem has a chance to become many people’s obsession for years to come.”</p>
<p>So, what do you think of this month’s games?</p>
<h2>Can you still get the November 2024 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>You can still grab November’s titles up until the new set of game’s arrives on 3rd December, so make sure to grab them while you can! They are:</p>
<ul>

        <p>A "disaster combat" game from the creators of The Invincible</p>

            <p>I have one urgent request for Starward Industries, creators of the just-announced “anti-combat” survival RPG Dante’s Ring – don’t use the phrase “ring of fire” in your English marketing materials. I get that you’re going for a cocktail of Divina Commedia and FromSoftware associations, but you have to remember that this is the internet and we're all desperately crude. I can’t speak for people from other English-language countries, but when I hear somebody talking about their "ring of fire", I tend to assume they’ve been at the vindaloo.</p><!--more-->

<p>There’s no time for such shenanigans in Dante’s Ring. It doesn’t look like it has a sense of humour at all, probably to its credit. According to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2988030/Dantes_Ring/">the Steam page</a>, it’s “an action-adventure RPG with survival and arcade elements, and a disaster combat theme, where you confront the deadliest forces of nature — from raging fires and molten lava to powerful earthquakes.”</p>
<p>You play somebody exploring an extinct volcanic mountain range that isn’t quite as extinct as advertised. Rather than fighting any individual enemies, you must “strive to survive and save as many lives as possible while facing the force of nature, the aftermath of a natural disaster, deep-seated human beliefs, social conflicts, and your own inner demons”.</p><p>To do all this, you’ll scavenge for resources and make use of “retro” gadgets such as propellor-powered sleds and vulcanologist suits, together with more basic instruments such as fireaxes. “Will you fight a frenetic fire or flee from a pyroclastic flow?” the Steam page goes on. “Break the door to rescue someone or stop and give first aid?”</p>
<p>That covers the immediate “disaster combat” aspect, anyway. As regards the themes of belief and social conflict, there’s talk of “complex moral choices” and negotiating between “diverse” NPC factions. The game is hub-based, with the ability to choose a loadout before embarking on a mission. The world appears to evolve from mission to mission, “with outcomes that can influence the course of the story”.</p>
<p>The social/religious theming here sounds laboured, if I’m honest, but I like the idea of a game about making ends meet on the surface of an active volcano. I imagine they have a propagating fire system and fluid physics for the lava. Hopefully, they’ll give the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry-2">Far Cry 2</a> a run for their money. Hopefully, they'll also improve on their previous game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-invincible-review">The Invincible</a>, which Julian Benson described as "an engaging sci-fi adventure that can leave you cold and confused the moment it stops holding your hand".</p>
<p>Dante’s Ring will launch into Steam early access next year. If you want something weird and fiery to play in the meantime, there's always <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/noita">Noita</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Keep in mind this isn’t the full list; that will be revealed later next month. </p><p>The big news is that, as part of the company’s continuing 30th anniversary celebration, Sony is adding even more PS2 games to its Classics Catalog in December. These older PS1, PS2, PS3, and PSP games are only available to PS Plus Premium subscribers. </p><p>And this time around, Sony is completing the OG <em>Sly Cooper</em> trilogy with the addition of <em>Sly 2</em> and <em>Sly 3,</em> the best games in the series. Back in May, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/playstation-2-classics-ps4-ps5-tomb-raider-star-wars-1851503467&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-2-classics-ps4-ps5-tomb-raider-star-wars-1851503467">Sony added the original <em>Sly Cooper</em></a></span>. Since then, I’ve wondered when or if these other two games would arrive. It’s nice to see some of the best platformers ever released on the PS2 finally playable on PS4 and PS5. It’s easier than ever to play through these colorful platformers about a thieving, talking raccoon stealing valuable items from criminals around the world while avoiding the police. </p><p>It’s a shame that these are just so-so emulated versions of the PS2 games and not the much better-looking and playing PS3 remasters, but <em>Sly Cooper</em> fans will take what they can get at this point. (Oh, and <em>Jak and Daxter</em> is being added too, which is nice.) </p><p>The last game that needs to be added is 2013's <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lets-take-a-look-at-a-playstation-game-pitch-1847183157&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lets-take-a-look-at-a-playstation-game-pitch-1847183157"><em>Sly Cooper: Thieves in Time</em></a></span><em>.</em> That would make the entire series playable on PS4 and PS5. Sadly, that game was released on PS3 and, as such, won’t be playable natively on either platform, so if it arrived at all, it would be as a streaming title. Still, like I said, <em>Sly </em>fans will take what they can get. </p><p>Meanwhile, starting December 3, <em>all</em> PlayStation Plus subscribers will be able to grab <em>It Takes Two</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/temtem-pokemon-mmo-end-development-1851310155&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/temtem-pokemon-mmo-end-development-1851310155"><em>TemTem</em></a></span>, and <em>Aliens: Dark Descent </em>as part of the month’s free games.</p><p> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/it-takes-two-creates-an-almost-perfect-union-of-story-a-1846576907&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/it-takes-two-creates-an-almost-perfect-union-of-story-a-1846576907">Co-op puzzler <em>It Takes Two</em></a></span> is a perfect game to grab during the holidays as you and a family member visiting for a few days can easily beat it in a weekend while gorging on leftovers and booze.

                <p>Not every title from the 16-bit era of consoles is readily available to legally play, but three more games from the Sega Genesis vault are heading to Nintendo Switch. ToeJam &amp; Earl in Panic on Funkotron, Vectorman, and Mercs will all be available starting today. Nintendo made the announcement on X and dropped a brief trailer for all three games.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1861593424215838733" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>Three classic SEGA Genesis games have just been made available for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitchOnline?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NintendoSwitchOnline</a> + Expansion Pack members!</p><p> ☑️ ToeJam &amp; Earl in Panic on Funkotron<br>☑️ Vectorman<br>☑️ WOLF OF THE BATTLEFIELD: MERCS<br>Original packaging shown. Contest has ended. <a href="https://t.co/83mMTzfl4m" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/83mMTzfl4m</a></p></div>  — Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1861593424215838733?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>ToeJam &amp; Earl in Panic on Funkotron is the first sequel in the franchise, and it debuted on Genesis in 1993. While the aliens known as ToeJam and Earl were stranded on Earth in the first game, Panic on Funkotron brings the duo back to their home planet where new problems await them. Several humans stowed away on their journey to Funkotron, and it's up to ToeJam and Earl to make things right in this side-scrolling platformer.</p><p>Vectorman was a state-of-the-art game by 1995 standards, and also Genesis' answer to Super Nintendo's Donkey Kong Country. Developer BlueSky Software successfully utilized pre-rendered 3D models that made this 2D action-platformer stand out from other Genesis titles. The initial story for the game is similar to Pixar's WALL-E, because the Earth has been abandoned by humans who left robots behind to clean up their mess. The story diverges when one of the robots becomes a nuclear-powered tyrant known as WarHead, leaving Vectorman as the only robot on Earth who isn't under his control.</p><p>Mercs--or Wolf of the Battlefield: Mercs--was an arcade title developed and released by Capcom before Sega brought it to the Genesis in 1990. Up to three players could assume control of the covert mercenaries in Wolf Force. Their mission was to infiltrate Zutula--a fictional African country--and rescue the former President from rebels who seized control of the land.</p><p>ToeJam &amp; Earl in Panic on Funkotron and Vectorman are among <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sega-is-delisting-many-of-its-classic-games-in-december/1100-6527642/" data-ref-id="1100-6527642">the long list of games that Sega is delisting from Steam</a> in December.

            <p>
Following last week's report Valve is working on a new iteration of its brilliant (if divisive) Steam Controller, a fresh leak has offered what might well be a first look at its refreshed design - and it's probably not a complete surprise to see it taking plenty of cues from Steam Deck.
</p>
<p>
Valve's original Steam Controller was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-controller-revealed">initially unveiled in 2013</a>, accompanying its chatter of third-party Steam machines. But while that particular initiative eventually floundered, the controller portion lived on, eventually releasing in November 2015. Unfortunately, four years later, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-calls-time-on-its-divisive-steam-controller">time to say farewell</a>, amid patent infringement claims relating to its paddle-like rear buttons.
</p>
<p>
Valve <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2021/2/3/22264213/valve-steam-controller-lawsuit-scuf-4-million">initially lost that case</a> and was ordered to pay $4m USD in damages, but the company successfully appealed the verdict in August 2021, paving the way for a Steam Controller 2. All of which brings us to last week, when knowledgeable Valve source Brad Lynch claimed that not only was a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-reportedly-reviving-its-divisive-steam-controller-trackpads-now-different-sizes-and-shapes">new Steam Controller in the works</a>, it was "being tooled for a mass production goal in their factories right now".
</p>

<p>
Lynch also reported the new device's "biggest change will be the shape/size of the trackpads", with Valve edging toward a more traditional "gamepad-y form". And, again thanks to Lynch, we've now got a much better idea of what the new Steam Controller might look like, thanks to a <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1861543924470251771">low-quality image</a> squirrelled in Valve's SteamVR drivers.
</p><div>

<p>
Notably, it appears Valve is taking many of its design cues from Steam Deck this time around - which seems entirely appropriate given how much the handheld gaming PC owed to the original Steam Controller. Assuming the newly discovered render is accurate, Valve's second iteration could, like the Steam Deck, feature a more traditional twin analog stick set-up alongside twin track pads (one pad below each stick), all packed into a seemingly much more ergonomic design.
</p>
<p>
The original Steam Deck's single analog stick set-up wasn't universally loved, but it's been a staple of my couch/PC set-up ever since launch thanks to those track pads. This newly uncovered Steam Controller design, then, is definitely encouraging, promising the best of both worlds.
</p>
<p>
Officially, of course, Valve's Steam Controller 2 remains nothing mroe than a rumour at present, but an exciting one nonetheless (although I'll readily admit I probably love the original controller more than most). And it's not the only new hardware rumoured to be in the works at Valve: the company is also said to be working on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZOEgUmkhzOU">new standalone hybrid VR headset known as "Deckard"</a>, which'll apparently feature new wand-like controllers, codenamed Roy.

			<p>30 Birds is art. A unique piece that uses rotating lanterns to blur the line between 2D and 3D perspectives, and filling these lanterns with a vibrant city stuffed with quests and mini games. 30 Birds is a narrative puzzle game in which a goddess has been kidnapped, and the only way to save her is to round up 30 of her feathery friends that are dotted around the magical Lantern City.</p>
<p><iframe title="30 Birds | Bande-annonce | Jeux vidéo | ARTE" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/H0ISggIEf3g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>30 Birds’ inspiration can be found in Persian art and mythology. The artwork of the lanterns, which are bright, colourful, and feature unique looking characters, are based upon Persian miniatures. The goddess at the heart of kidnapping is Simurgh, based upon a bird of the same name from Persian mythology. Within the world of Lantern City there are some mischievous djinns, and puzzles that require music to solve them.</p>


<p>The person to solve the mystery of Simurgh’s kidnapping is Zig, a detective. She arrives in Lantern City on the night of Simurgh’s disappearance after getting a mystical message from one of her informants. She quickly comes to understand that The Scientist is behind the kidnapping of Simurgh, and the only way to save Simurgh is to find the 30 Birds, who have their own problems that need sorting out. &nbsp;Take Hoop for example. Hoop is the first bird you are required to rescue after she gets locked in a cage due to gambling debts. To rescue Hoop, you need to match a pattern design, manipulating lines so they represent the puzzle. It is a bit like using an etch-a-sketch and can be just as finicky. This is just one puzzle type in 30 Birds. Others include animal based musical synthesizers from which you need to get a melody going. The puzzles themselves are generally pretty easy to solve, it is just using the controller and lining things to be near perfect can take a bit of patience.</p>


<p>After you rescue Hoop, 30 Birds really begins as you begin the quest to find the other 29. Now, that does not mean there are 29 individual quests to complete to find each one, as some birds are in pairs or groups. The discovery of each bird can be simple, from finding them in the world and having a conversation, to a bit more complex where you need to solve puzzles. One of the more complex ones requires solving a djinn’s puzzle of picking the correct direction five times in a row. Some birds cannot be recruited straightaway, requiring story progression or finding a number of collectibles. One bird needs feathers to be collected for it as a djinn cursed it and stole all of its feathers. You then have to restore the bird’s plumage after which it will join your mission to save Simurgh.</p>
<p>Exploring Lantern City is really smooth too. There are four main lanterns that make up different parts of the city – Central, Park, College, and Grand Bazaar – and you then have a few offshoot lanterns from each of these hubs. For example, you will find cafes, an observatory, and a market to name a few places. Each lantern has four sides to it, with the face Zig is on rotating to face the player as you move around. The flat 2D faces of the lantern can look a bit confusing at first for navigation, but the visual design of each is so well done that you figure out how to move around, and switch between levels with ease.</p>

<p>While the overall arc of the story is fairly predictable, there’s details within that can hold some surprises. There is also a decent amount of comedy spread out throughout the game, which was amusing though not laugh out loud funny. The game even has its own little minigame called Tiles, which is essentially a matching game using picture tiles. The objective is to clear your tiles before your opponents, smashing matching pairs to win. It is a fun little aside, and can also help in collecting items you need for completing some missions.</p>
<p>There were a couple of issues in 30 Birds that I found. One was a bug in Park Lantern where Zig fell through the world, forcing me to restart the chapter and losing some progress as a result. Another was that there was a moment where it was not clear what I had to do next, so I spent some time wandering the lanterns until I stumbled across the next checkpoint. One time I had received a task to complete before I had spoken to the character that would give the task, resulting in me talking to a character for the first time and completing the objective before getting any background. It is not the biggest issue, but it meant some conversation lines were missed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/27/24307438/google-genchess-generative-ai-chess-pieces<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Google has released a <a href="https://labs.google/genchess">new chess website</a> that puts one fun twist on the game: it uses custom pieces that are created each time by generative AI. The game starts by letting you type in a short description for what the white pieces should look like; it’ll generate the set using its Imagen 3 AI model, then automatically come up with a related idea for black. When I asked for sci-fi-themed pieces for myself, it made fantasy-themed pieces for the opponent.</p><p>From there, you can play the game. It’s functional, but it’s far from a fully featured chess app. You can choose three difficulty settings and two time controls, but you can’t review past moves or see what pieces have been captured. The game also defaults to an isometric view of the board that is cool to look at but disorienting to play on, since most chess apps are top-down. You can change to a top-down view in the game’s settings.</p><p>The game was released this week, timed alongside the start of the 2024 World Chess Championship, where reigning champ Ding Liren is defending his title against the 18-year-old Gukesh Dommaraju. Google is the event’s main sponsor, and it seems to be using the moment to <a href="https://blog.google/technology/ai/world-chess-championships-2024/">announce a bunch of new</a> chess products and initiatives.</p><p>Google’s other big chess announcement this week is the promise of a forthcoming chess bot within Gemini. You’ll be able to play by typing your moves, and Gemini will display an updated chess board as the game progresses. Google doesn’t say whether Gemini will be gaining any other chess smarts, though —&nbsp;right now, the AI chatbot consistently fails to accurately assess the position on a chess board when you upload an image of one. The new feature will be available in December for Gemini Advanced subscribers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They exist to cause FOMO, and see collectors scrambling to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars to get another version of a thing they likely already have, while anyone who just fancies getting a new device that features their favorite IP is most likely to fail. It’s therefore massive advertising for the product, and very likely leads to further sales of the ordinary, vanilla versions after people discover they cannot get the new, prettier case. So yeah: because capitalism, no duh, etc. But when this extends to literally just a different plain color, it’s <em>idiotic</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="eb806ba916b89f0f5d3c10dd340443ae" data-recommend-id="image://eb806ba916b89f0f5d3c10dd340443ae" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The very white PS Portal, showing Astrobot on its screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The very white PS Portal, showing Astrobot on its screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Try to imagine this in another color!

The limit is entirely self-imposed by the creators, for the reasons given above, with the rationale that people will feel special for owning something that others cannot get. There are many who will defend the forced shortages of stock for a version of their favorite peripheral designed to look like R2-D2 or what have you, as it’s only special because there aren’t many of them, and around the circular logic goes. It strikes me as a sucky way to make yourself feel good, but we all crave rarity and the status it brings, and I’m not here to argue against that today. I’m here because that goes from odd to just inexplicable when it comes to something being black instead of white.</p><p>Yes, absolutely, it costs a bit more money for a company to make more than one color of their hardware. It’s a different production line run, with different inks, and then requires different packaging. But oh good grief, it’s <em>negligible</em> when you’re Sony or Valve or whoever it is trying to imply they’ve discovered the Ark of the Covenant because they produced a different run of plastic cases. And the reality that it doesn’t need to be this way is no better proven than by one particular producer of plastic peripherals: Nintendo.</p><p>Gosh, yes, we’re not here today to rag on the litigious behemoth, because when it comes to offering a range of colors without artificial scarcity, it’s hard to fault Nintendo! And that’s been the case as far back as I can remember. Game Boys were sold with six alternative colors than the regular grey, and this trend of readily available variety continued through the Game Boy Advance, Advance SP, and all iterations of the DS, all with so many colors to chose from, and most of them always available.</p><p>Come the Switch and it got even better! Sure, the screen usually comes just with a plain black bevel, but it’s all about the color of the Joy-Cons, which offer so much variety, along with the option to mix and match. Heck, it was a defining feature of the launch model, with its red and blue defaults. It’s enough that when my kid has friends round for a big <em>Fortnite</em> or <em>Minecraft</em> game, there’s no confusion over whose is whose, given they’re all essentially a different color. Let alone the Switch Lite, which launched in a variety of colors, and even still sells <em>Zelda</em> and <em>Animal Crossing</em> special versions years after they were released.</p><figure id="" data-id="f74bd27d0efbbfce5c2d60ab89cec3df" data-recommend-id="image://f74bd27d0efbbfce5c2d60ab89cec3df" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three Switch Lites, in pink, blue and yellow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Three Switch Lites, in pink, blue and yellow." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f74bd27d0efbbfce5c2d60ab89cec3df" data-recommend-id="image://f74bd27d0efbbfce5c2d60ab89cec3df" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Three Switch Lites, in pink, blue and yellow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That strikes me as what should be normal. Pretending that a console or a peripheral can only come in one color, at least until the planets align and the spirits allow a special alternative to appear until the next blood moon, is utterly ridiculous, and removes one of the most important things a customer wants: choice.</p><p>What’s weirder still is that this false scarcity creates two secondary markets, neither of which benefits the companies imposing the limits. There’s the scalping market, where people scoop up as many of the special editions as they can and then resell them for vastly higher prices, which of course does nothing to benefit the original manufacturer. Then there’s the third-party accessories market, where entirely separate companies sell faceplates and cases that provide excellent variety for people who want a distinct and colorful device, but usually at the cost of voiding any warranty as they precariously remove screws they were never intended to touch. And, again, not one cent of that money ever reaches the company making the original product.</p><figure id="" data-id="164261c1f86f253d3b86325e0e7312d2" data-recommend-id="image://164261c1f86f253d3b86325e0e7312d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An explosion of paint in many different colors." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An explosion of paint in many different colors." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Don Farrall<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="164261c1f86f253d3b86325e0e7312d2" data-recommend-id="image://164261c1f86f253d3b86325e0e7312d2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An explosion of paint in many different colors." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The main result of it all seems to be disappointment. Sure, it’s great for the few who were lucky enough to get to the front of queues that last literally minutes before selling out. But they’re the few! The majority are left bummed out, and unless they’re rich/stupid enough to massively overpay to scummy scalpers, there’s no recourse! “No,” said the massive corporation, “You may <em>not</em> have the product you wanted to give us money for. Because...of the reasons.”</p><p>Just sell your product in seven colors! It’s not that complicated! It’s a Photoshop color-shift for your packaging design, and a few extra pennies on the cost of the device for the extra paint. How do I know they can? Because Nintendo does it for every device, and they <em>all </em>do it for their controllers! </p><p>Right now, to use an incredibly trivial example, I have a black TV above a black shelving unit, and a white Xbox Series S and a monstrous white original PS5. It looks rubbish! I’d have bought both in black if I could. I should have been able to. I certainly shouldn’t have to read the gaming news every hour to see if Sony is announcing a seven-second window in which they’ll sell a non-white version of a device to the fastest bots.</p><p>Although, if I’m being more honest, what I actually want is everything in purple. Purple GameCube, I love you. I’ll always love you.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>There’s another leak surrounding the upcoming Intel Arc Battlemage graphics cards. According to a new report making the waves, at least one price for the Intel Battlemage has appeared online.</p>



<p>According to known leaker <a href="https://x.com/momomo_us/status/1861755473718108511" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Momomo_us</a>, there will be an Intel Arc B580 Limited Edition GPU available when the new graphics cards launch. Based on the information found, the B580 Limited Edition will cost roughly $250. They’ve found it online for as low as $246 in some places, as well.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Should the leaked pricing be accurate, the Intel Arc B580 will cost more than what A580 did when it launched in 2023 at $179. It will still be less than the $289 of the Intel Arc A750 when that launched in 2022.</p>



<p>The Intel Arc B580 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/with-reveal-imminent-more-intel-arc-battlemage-details-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored to feature 20 Xe2 cores</a>, 12GB of GDDR6 VRAM, a clock speed of 2.8GHz, and more. Latest reports suggest a reveal will happen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intel-battlemage-gpu-to-be-announced-next-month-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sometime in December</a> before Nvidia and AMD announce their new graphics cards in January.</p>



<p>It’s currently unknown how many Intel Battlemage GPU SKUs will be released. Intel has not commented on any of the rumored details of its new graphics cards.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/survival-guide-to-develop-a-game-and-then-publish-it-on-steam-<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When we started the last year of our masters in videogame development, we already knew that the challenge ahead was a big one: creating a complete videogame and publishing it on Steam as the final project. However, what seemed like just a challenge on a technical level at first sight, turned out to be a journey that included design, production, marketing and all the other aspects of the industry that make a good idea become a finished and published project. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>There are lessons that you only learn when you take the leap.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We want to share the lessons we learned, talk about what worked, and also about the things we could have done better, so that if you are also facing this challenge, you have the best perspective and avoid common mistakes in this area so unknown for many.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="You have to be realistic. Know your abilities and define a scope.">You have to be realistic. Know your abilities and define a scope.</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the most important learning experiences when we started out was to understand our own limitations and the real resources we had. At the beginning, everyone wanted to develop something big, innovative, open worlds… but we also knew that we had a limited amount of time and a small team. So the first challenge was to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>define an idea that was exciting, but doable</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. This meant carefully adjusting the scope: there was no place for features that we would not be able to polish on time. We learnt that a well executed project, even if it is humble in its ambition, will always be better than one that tries to do a lot of things with no quality or polish.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the case of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Everdark</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, we decided to do a first person shooter with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>survival horror</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> elements, inspired by horror and B-movies from the ‘80s. This idea allowed us to focus our creativity in a compact but well thought out project. If you are in front of the challenge of creating a first game, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>do not underestimate the importance of limiting your scope so time is on your side </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and you can achieve your goals in terms of quality.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="The next challenge? Organizing ourselves.">The next challenge? Organizing ourselves.</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In such a short development, it was crucial that each member had a well defined role, no matter if it was in modelling, level design, programming or marketing. The key was to give ourselves specific roles and responsibilities from the get-go. This helped us avoid ambiguity and allowed each of us to know what to focus on at every moment. If you’re working with a small team, it is essential to assign clear tasks and use management tools that keep the workflow structured. For example, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Trello</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, creating a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Discord </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">server or using </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Notion</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are excellent options. (Spoiler: these are the tools used by studios and it is very useful to have worked with them previously).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You know very well the skill set of each person in the group, so it’s fundamental to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>understand your strengths and assign roles that make the most out of those skills</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="The production plan and the infinite amount of unexpected situations that will come up.">The production plan and the infinite amount of unexpected situations that will come up.</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Defining a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>production plan </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">is crucial to make an efficient use of time and resources.&nbsp; In the initial stages of planning, identify the different stages of the development and establish realistic milestones. This plan will help you have a clear roadmap, but keep in mind that in videogame development, you have to be ready to adapt to anything. The best you can do is assess everything weekly, so in case there are any problems, you have room to deal with them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you’re developing your first game, establish achievable goals, make a list of priorities and review the production plan constantly. Accept that not everything will go according to plan, and that it will be necessary to adjust priorities according to unexpected events.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Publishing the game on Steam can look like an odyssey… and it is. However, Steam offers many tutorials through SteamWorks, and if you follow them step by step, you shouldn’t have any problems. Speaking from experience, we recommend you read the tutorials ahead of time and with a lot of attention so that your Steam page going public, the release of your Demo, or any other action you take on the platform does not suffer from any delays.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="You hear a lot about Marketing, but it’s still a big unknown.">You hear a lot about Marketing, but it’s still a big unknown.</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Do you think your project has great quality and you want to show it off? </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>From this moment onwards, everything you do is marketing.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> The way you present your game, no matter if it is through its pictures on Steam, the GIFs on social media or showcasing it at an event, will define how users perceive you.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Social media is not an “all or nothing” thing</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">; you have to choose them carefully. If you feel particularly comfortable on a specific platform, start there. You can also explore other platforms to find out where your content can get the most attention. These platforms are windows that allow the press and potential content creators to learn about your game. Before you start contacting them or making posts, think about who your players will be: their age, their tastes… All of this will be key to prepare adequate messages, to determine who you address with your communication and to decide where to post all that content.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another point that we cannot ignore is to start contacting </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>content creators and the press</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Using our project </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Everdark</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as an example, we are currently investigating blogs, YouTube channels and Twitch profiles that talk about horror games. Especially if they are attracted to ‘80s aesthetics or horror B-movies, which are the most obvious inspirations of our game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Do you have your contact list ready? Now it is time to focus on what we will send them. In these cases, the best thing is to have a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Press Kit</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> ready. If you visit many websites from different studios, you will find a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Press Kit</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">in it, where you have to add a short description of the game, pictures, videos, YouTube links, etc. that showcase your game in the best possible light. We also recommend adding the history behind the project and the team. It is like a presentation letter, so everything people need to know about the game has to be there.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once you send out the e-mails, you have to follow up on them. You have to always be nice, especially if you get a reply. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Persistence, as long as it is done with respect and you keep it professional, can make a difference.</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> When you approach anyone interested in the game, you have to show you are being genuine and convey the passion you have for the project.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/no-titan-quest-2-will-not-feature-pay-to-win-or-loot-box-mechanics/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/no-titan-quest-2-will-not-feature-pay-to-win-or-loot-box-mechanics/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Following the immense success of Diablo IV and the upcoming Path of Exile 2, both of which heavily feature microtransactions, primarily in the form of cosmetic skins, the ARPG genre, while flourishing, is bogged down by loot boxes, pay-to-win mechanics and in-game stores. It’s left many fans of the genre worrying about upcoming titles, such as Titan Quest 2. According to developer Grimlore Games, we have nothing to worry about. Titan Quest 2 isn’t pay-to-win and features no loot boxes!</p>



<p>On the topic of loot boxes and pay-to-win mechanics in the mythology-focused ARPG, developer Grimlore Games said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With Titan Quest 2, we intend to take a bit of a different approach than with most projects before. We want to involve the community in a typical Steam Early Access manner. Our reasoning: we want Titan Quest 2 to stand its own ground within the ARPG genre and we are convinced that there is only one way to pull it off: swarm intelligence.</p>



<p>When the first Titan Quest originally released in 2006, it was the alternative to Diablo 2 and not many others in the ARPG genre. In 2024, the situation looks a little different. Apart from the still ongoing Diablo franchise, there are numerous other contestants out there.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But with such stiff competition and a desire to earn back its investment, Grimlore Games certainly has its work cut out for it in developing, releasing, and improving upon Titan Quest 2 over time. As such, the team made the community four promises:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We do despise this with a passion. There will never ever be any monetization mechanic in the game, urging you to spend money on any gameplay-related item to give anybody an advantage.</p>



<p>You can play the way you want to play the game. When we launch into early access in the winter of 2025, we will however not yet have online multiplayer (four-player co-op) implemented. This will be among the first two updates once we launch into Steam Early Access.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you’re a long-time fan of the ARPG genre, chances are you probably played the original game back in the day. Well, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1154030/Titan_Quest_II/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wishlist its sequel on Steam right now</a>!</p>



<p>While it won’t be available at launch, Titan Quest 2 will feature co-op sometime after its Early Access release. You have plenty of time to find a co-op partner or two to grind levels with. You could even check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our community forum</a> for like-minded players!</p>



<hr>



<p>It took a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/titan-quest-2-17-years-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staggering 17 years for Titan Quest 2 to be announced</a>, but the iconic ARPG is finally within our grasp. You just have to wait until late 2025, sadly!</p>

As Cody and May, a couple with a rocky relationship who have been trapped in a fantasy world, players will have to work together to overcome unique challenges and possibly mend a broken partnership. The game has been a critical and commercial success story since it was first released a couple of years ago, and its director Josef Fares has recently been teasing that studio Hazelight is working on something new that'll be published by EA again.</p><p dir="ltr">On the opposite end of wholesome co-op platforming, Aliens: Dark Descent is a real-time strategy game where you'll guide a squad of Colonial Space Marines through a deadly Xenomorph outbreak. With all communication lost on the moon of Lethe, it's up to you to figure out what happened and survive the journey. You can customize the abilities, weapons, and talents of your Marines, and while the core gameplay can become repetitive, it's still an authentic dive into the galaxy of Aliens.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, Temtem is a neat spin on the catch-'em-all formula established by Pokemon. You'll get to explore the six islands of the Airborne Archipelago, encounter dozens of Temtem, and train them in your quest to become the very best, like no one ever was. The game also features MMO elements, and you can team up with other players if you're looking to trade Temtem or battle them in intense competitions.</p><h2 dir="ltr">PlayStation Plus Free Games for December 2024</h2><p><em>Available December 3 until January 6, 2025.</em></p><ul><li>Aliens: Dark Descent (PS5, PS4)</li><li>Temtem (PS5)</li><li>It Takes Two (PS5, PS4)</li></ul><p>As part of PlayStation's 30th Anniversary celebrations, Sony has also announced several events that'll be taking place in December.

                <p dir="ltr">Fans of the zombie survival-horror game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dayz/">DayZ</a> have taken a chunk out of its Steam user-score after developer Bohemia Interactive released a DLC that players say is overpriced and underwhelming. Now, the game's developer has responded to the criticism… by posting a Beatles song.</p><p dir="ltr">"Did you know that 8 million users for whom we have data on Steam played for an average of 188 hours and paid an average of 30 USD gross in Dayz?" Bohemia Interactive CEO Marek Spanel said on Twitter. "That means we received less than 10 cents for an hour of live online gaming, for which we host the online infrastructure and have been updating it for 10+ years. Yet DayZ Frostline is currently being review-bombed on the same platform for being too expensive: $26.99 for 'just a map,' and some users demand 'gimme more for less money.' Hmm. Please Please Me."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/maruksp/status/1861353665455366218" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Did you know that 8 million users for whom we have data on Steam played for an average of 188 hours and paid an average of 30 USD gross in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dayz?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Dayz</a>?

The game is currently sitting at a "Mostly Negative" user review score <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/2968040/" rel="nofollow ">on Steam</a>, where players are pointing out the DLC's various flaws. The main problem seems to be a lack of new, engaging content.</p><p dir="ltr">"First things first: This is not even an original map," one user pointed out. "This $37 CAD DLC map is a cut-down reskin of the ArmA III map 'Tanoa.' That being said, Sakhal does have <em>some</em> neat stuff to it, but it is absolutely <em>not</em> worth its asking price as of right now. Maybe in time they'll add more interesting features to the map to justify its existence, but right now you can get much better maps for free, and Bohemia knows it."</p><p dir="ltr">"This is an extremely lazy effort from Bohemia Interactive," the player continued. "Bugs that have plagued this game for years go unmentioned, the fabled 'AI overhaul' has been pushed back for <em>years</em>, but now we have a snowy Tanoa with less landmass to explore, and most of the islands they left intact are just completely empty anyways. Joy."</p><p dir="ltr">Others have pointed out that the DLC's more interesting POIs--like the new map's Weather Dome and Volcano--cannot be entered or interacted with whatsoever. Others have pointed out that maps with far more content have been released for free by modders.</p><p dir="ltr">Aside from Spanel's Beatles-based reaction, Bohemia Interactive has yet to make any further comment on the controversy.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/no-more-room-in-hell-2-qa-torn-banner-talks-permadeath-roguelike-and-sandbox-ish-elements/">Torn Banner Studios</a>, the developer behind Chivalry 2, has just announced that the first Early Access update for No More Room in Hell 2 has been released. This update is called Reinforcement and is currently available for players to explore. No More Room in Hell 2 is an eight-player, co-op horror shooter that just launched into early access and is already doing pretty well for itself. The Reinforcement update adds a number of quality-of-life fixes, new weapons, a new ending scenario, and additional skills for players to utilize. A montage of some of the features has been created and uploaded to the YouTube channel for No More Room in Hell so you can see what to expect from this update.</p>
<p><iframe title="No More Room in Hell 2 | Montage - 0.2.0 Reinforcement Update" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R_cMfhGCILQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As with any update, the Reinforcement update will also fix a number of bugs and provide a well-needed balance across all difficulties. This will mean that the harder difficulties will be more challenging and will be a lot harsher on the player than they previously were. Additionally, the UI and UX has been improved for easier viewing and navigation, as well as allowing players to remove HUD elements should they feel the need to.</p>
<p>In this update for No More Room in Hell 2, Zombies will now have more natural reactions to damage, as well as improved hit responses to make the combat a smoother experience. As stated above, a new alternate ending scenario has been added to the game. This ending scenario is specifically for the Power Plant map and helps provide more variety for those who have a lot of experience with the game thus far.</p>
<p>The Reinforcement update also adds new weapons for players to experiment with, including the M7A1 Assault Rifle and the M1911A1 Pistol. Alongside this, players will have access to new skills to play with, as well as character generator rules.</p>
<p>On the official X account for this game, they have shared their <a href="https://x.com/nmrih/status/1848433282918322431" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Early Access Roadmap</a>, which includes some of the features that have been added or updated in today's update. They still have a ton of plans for what will come next in the game, such as the infection system. There are also concept ideas that they are toying with, including new maps, weapon attachments, and alternative game modes for players to dive into.</p>
<p>You can check out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/292000/view/4452465569899216931" target="_blank" rel="noopener">full blog post here</a> to find out all of the little tweaks they've done in the Reinforcement update so you know what to expect when you next play No More Room in Hell 2.</p>

            <p>Earlier this week Humanoid Origin, a studio led by former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> director Casey Hudson, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-mass-effect-director-cancels-his-next-sci-fi-game-as-his-studio-closes-before-it-is-fully-revealed">closed doors without a game to their name</a>. Now, sadly, it's the turn of Worlds Untold, a studio founded by another former Mass Effect developer, Mac Walters. The studio have "paused operations" after apparently parting ways with publisher NetEase. While the announcement makes mention of continuing on with a new funding partner, laid-off staff are describing it as a studio closure.</p><!--more-->
<p>Worlds Untold <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/one-of-the-original-mass-effect-writers-is-making-a-sci-fi-near-future-action-adventure">revealed themselves in November 2023</a> as the creators of "triple-A action adventure games with an emphasis on narrative and worldbuilding", boasting a mixture of Halo, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> alumni. Their first game is or was to be a "near future action adventure game in a breathtaking world filled with mystery and exploration". Back at announcement, Walters spoke of moving away from the space opera RPGs he's worked on in the past and embracing something more linear, perhaps influenced by Naughty Dog's creations. </p>
<p>"It's hard to find the right words for this, but I wanted to share that we've made the very difficult decision to pause operations at Worlds Untold while we search for a new partner to help bring our vision to life," Walters wrote in <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/worlds-untold_its-hard-to-find-the-right-words-for-this-activity-7267282640670482433-OJta/">a LinkedIn post</a> this week. "This was not a decision we made lightly - it's been a deeply personal journey, and we're all so proud of everything this team has built together.</p>
<p>"In the meantime, our incredible team members will be exploring new opportunities," it continues. "If you're looking for passionate, talented professionals, please reach out - I'd be honored to connect you with some of the best people I've ever worked with.</p><p>"This is a heartbreaking moment for everyone involved, but I'm deeply grateful for the support of our partners, friends and family, and for the time we've had together at Worlds Untold. While we're pausing for now, this isn't goodbye - there's more to come, and we look forward to sharing the next chapter with you when the time is right."</p>
<p>Departing team members have been quoting the post and providing their own context. While Walters ends his message on a more hopeful note, the takeaway seems to be that Worlds Untold as it stands will effectively cease to exist. "Very sad and gutted, especially so close to the holidays," writes former senior gameplay designer Elaine Gómez. "Our entire studio is getting laid off at end of year." Former senior producer Kitty Lee is also describing the announcement as a "full studio shutdown".</p>
<p>2024 continues to be an awful year for games industry <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">layoffs</a>, including at studios run by veteran blockbuster developers looking to start afresh. The gutting of Worlds Untold and Humanoid Origin follows <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netflixs-team-blue-of-halo-overwatch-and-god-of-war-vets-close-without-a-single-game-to-their-name">the closure of Netflix's Team Blue</a>, another studio founded by blockbuster veterans that never managed to announce a single game. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nightingale">Nightingale</a> developers Inflexion - founded by BioWare's former general manager Aaryn Flynn - have also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nightingale-cant-outfly-the-stark-realities-of-the-industry-as-creators-inflexion-close-uk-office-and-lay-people-off">announced cutbacks</a>.</p>
<p>Best of luck to everybody at Worlds Untold now looking for a new job.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Worlds Untold, a NetEase-backed studio founded by former Mass Effect producer Mac Walters, is “pausing operations” just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netease-adds-new-studio-led-by-mass-effect-veteran/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a year after being founded</a>.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/worlds-untold_its-hard-to-find-the-right-words-for-this-activity-7267282640670482433-OJta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>, Walters said the studio is looking for a new partner and that halting operations was a “very difficult decision”.</p>



<p>“It’s hard to find the right words for this, but I wanted to share that we’ve made the very difficult decision to pause operations at Worlds Untold while we search for a new partner to help bring our vision to life,” Walters said. “This was not a decision we made lightly—it’s been a deeply personal journey, and we’re all so proud of everything this team has built together.”</p>



<p>Worlds Untold had been working on a “AAA action-adventure game” since it was founded. However, NetEase recently decided to pull funding due to “current market conditions”.</p>

<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-veteran-will-pause-operations-at-fresh-aaa-game-studio-while-seeking-new-partner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, a NetEase spokesperson said discontinuing funding was an “incredibly difficult decision”.</p>



<p>“This choice was not made lightly, as we have been consistently inspired by the team, their unwavering dedication and the bold vision behind their project,” the spokesperson said. “Although current market conditions have required us to reassess and prioritise our opportunities, we are actively collaborating with the studio to explore potential next steps and provide support during this transition.</p>



<p>“While this chapter comes to a close, our commitment to a strong global presence remains unwavering, and we are excited about the promising projects underway at our other studios. We thank Worlds Untold for their remarkable contributions and wish them every success in the future.”</p>



<p>Walters added that all of the studio’s staff are able and looking for work elsewhere. He said that while the studio is “pausing for now”, it’s not the end of the line for Worlds Untold and their plans.</p>



<p>“[There’s] more to come, and we look forward to sharing the next chapter with you when the time is right,” he said.</p>
