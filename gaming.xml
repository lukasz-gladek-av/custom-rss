            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/21/24225133/samsung-odyssey-3d-gaming-monitor-glasses-free-announcement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Samsung has announced a new Odyssey gaming monitor lineup at gamescom that uses eye-tracking technology to convert 2D visuals into glasses-free 3D. The Odyssey 3D is set for a global release “within this year” <a href="https://news.samsung.com/global/samsung-electronics-unveils-groundbreaking-glasses-free-odyssey-3d-gaming-monitor-at-gamescom-2024">according to Samsung</a>, and will allow users to “seamlessly switch between 2D and 3D modes” based on preference — which may tempt folks who are curious about 3D gaming, but apprehensive to commit.</p><p>The Odyssey 3D is Samsung’s first 3D gaming monitor, having first <a href="https://www.ces.tech/innovation-awards/honorees/2024/best-of/s/samsung-light-field-display.aspx">teased a concept display at CES</a> earlier this year. It’ll be available in 27- or 37-inch sizes and features a 4K QLED panel with a 165Hz refresh rate, alongside a 1-millisecond response time and support for AMD FreeSync. Both monitors also include a single DisplayPort 1.4 and two HDMI 2.1 ports for connectivity, and a tilting, height-adjustable stand to ensure you can best position it to experience 3D content.</p><p>The glasses-free 3D is achieved by combining a lenticular lens — specialized hardware that can direct different images to each eye — with a built-in eye tracking camera, and view mapping to continuously adjust for depth perception. Acer uses a similar system in its own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/27/22451850/acer-spatiallabs-3d-content-rendering-conceptd-7-pro">SpatialLabs laptops and monitors</a>. The resulting Stereoscopic 3D can only be viewed by one person at a time, but that’s hardly an issue for gamers, and my own experiences with the technology have left a good impression: it’s really fun to see things jumping out at you without having to wear special glasses.</p><p>One thing that’s missing is the price. We’ve reached out to Samsung to see if pricing information is available, but if <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/13/22723345/acer-conceptd-7-spatiallabs-edition-laptop-features-specs-display-design">Acer’s products</a> (and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/12/23757776/samsung-qd-oled-odyssey-g9-curved-gaming-monitor-price-release-date">historical pricing on Samsung’s Odyssey lineup</a>) are any indication, the Odyssey 3D offerings won’t come cheap.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-hands-on-preview-exactly-what-i-hoped-for</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-hands-on-preview-exactly-what-i-hoped-for.959364/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-hands-on-preview-exactly-what-i-hoped-for<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>The first thing that jumped out to me as I began Monster Hunter Wilds’ introductory mission was how quickly I got invested in its story now that both my character and my Palico companion had voice acting of their own. The second thing, sadly, was how poorly this early preview build ran once I took control. Wilds is exceptionally exciting to me, recapturing what I love about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/01/25/monster-hunter-world-review">Monster Hunter World</a> while learning from the joy that came from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-rise-review">Monster Hunter Rise</a>’s enhanced mobility, finding a balance of both that felt great across the handful of missions I tried. It’s unfortunate that its rough, in-development performance put a little bit of a damper on my demo time, but if Capcom can sort those issues out by launch next year, Wilds could be exactly what I was dreaming of from the next Monster Hunter.</p><p>What’s immediately clear is that Wilds has continued to put a priority on smoothing out some of the traditionally rougher edges of this series. For instance, rideable monster mounts make a return after first being introduced as an automated option in World’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/04/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-review">Iceborne</a> expansion and then expanded into full control in Rise. This iteration leans more toward the latter, defaulting to follow a target but allowing you to take the reins directly anytime. Your dino-bird, called a Seikret, can scamper across special paths, glide, and give you time to use or collect items, which makes travel engaging in a way that feels less artificial than Rise’s Spiribird busywork.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But it’s not just a matter of convenience, as your mount also stores a second weapon option that you can swap to while riding. As a lifelong Insect Glaive main, this didn’t really appeal to me at first… until I realized that you can also use ranged weapons like Bowguns <em>while </em>mounted. That fully recontextualized this system, letting me pepper a retreating monster with bullets while my Seikret automatically chased it down, then swap back to my Glaive when it was time to hop off. I guess we’re all learning ranged weapons now, and I am very okay with that added flexibility.</p><p>I can only really speak to my experience with the Insect Glaive when it comes to how weapons have changed, but I was surprised by the adjustments I saw there – most of which seem to be in service of the new Focus Mode option that lets you more precisely aim your attacks at specific monster parts and special weak points. I found myself with a lot more options to sidestep or make micro-adjustments while attacking, with seemingly fewer combos that would end with a move that killed my momentum and more opportunities to really control how I was laying down the hurt. Again, I didn’t play enough to have the clearest sense of that shift just yet, but it feels like that Rise philosophy of speeding up some of the clunkier parts of combat is alive and well, even if you aren’t flying around on a Wirebug this time.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Wilds has continued to put a priority on smoothing out rough edges.</p></div><p>And if you’ll indulge some Glaive-specific gushing, there are two <em>massive</em> changes that radically changed the combat pattern I was used to. First, landing your aerial attack no longer bounces you back into the air for a chain of helicopter-blade slicing, which was admittedly a huge drag to discover. But the loss of that goofy fun is at least partly made up for by more convenience tweaks, as hitting a weak point with a special Focus Strike move will not only deal tons of damage, it also immediately collects all three Kinsect essences at once, massively speeding up that process in the mid-to-late part of a hunt. (Your aiming reticle now also has a helpful indicator that tells you which essence the monster part you are aiming will provide, and managing that system feels like less of a hassle all around.) </p><p>Even in my short playtime, I saw so many little examples of things like this – stuff that doesn’t undermine the challenge and deliberate pace that makes Monster Hunter what it is but <em>does </em>make the experience that much smoother. There’s a quick option to use whatever recovery items you have that will minimize waste, your hook can grab most items from afar (even while mounted), collecting at gathering points moves just a bit quicker, you can finally pick up bomb barrels after placing them, and firing an SOS flare will even fill your team with AI hunters if you’re offline or until real people online are able to join. It’s a laundry list of tweaks that aren’t necessarily revolutionary, but all make so much sense you wonder why it wasn’t like this before.</p><p>Of course, the big, buggy Gammoth in the room is how it all ran. I am willing to give Capcom the benefit of the doubt to a pretty substantial degree here given Wilds doesn’t even have a release date beyond “2025” yet – there is presumably a lot of time left to polish things up – but it’s still worth mentioning that this demo ran badly. Like, <em>really distractingly badly. </em>During busy moments, the framerate dropped to a degree that almost made it hard to play, and the group I was playing with saw multiple hard crashes. Again, this in-development build is by no means the final version of Wilds, but it is the version Capcom chose to show us, and I can’t help but be just a <em>touch </em>concerned that maybe that’s an indication that, at best, Wilds might drop later in 2025 than I was expecting, or at worst, that Capcom bit off a little more than it will ultimately be able to chew.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Monster Hunter Wilds gamescom ONL Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>That’s partly because the ambitious scope here is truly impressive, seemingly hoping to keep hunters out in the field longer. Rather than kicking you back to town after a successful hunt, the second mission I did was structured more like Iceborne’s Guiding Lands, where you could stick around after to explore or immediately take on a new one, with world events and other dynamic things coming and going around you. Rather than starting from a single tent, there was even a surprisingly large outpost on the map I saw, complete with NPCs to talk to. I didn’t really get to see much of this side of Wilds in my demo, but it could add up to a very different feel between fights. </p><p>From what I did see, Wilds is shaping up to be pretty much what I hoped for: a Monster Hunter that embraces the parts of Rise that made it so much more inviting, but also doesn’t shy away from the larger scale and spectacle that helped make World the more enduring entry for me. It’s hard to tell exactly which way that needle will point after just a few missions (or if these structural changes will swing it somewhere else entirely), but I certainly can’t wait to play more so I can find out. </p><p><a href="https://twitter.com/TomRMarks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tom Marks</em></a><em> is IGN's Executive Reviews Editor.

However, Towerborne is now a ‘limited time exclusive on Steam,’ according to a new trailer, below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>What that means is Towerborne begins Steam Early Access on September 10. In a post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/08/20/towerborne-why-early-access-and-a-focus-on-fun-means-a-better-game-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a>, Microsoft said an Xbox Game Preview release will follow, with a full, now free-to-play launch planned for 2025. Towerborne will also include cross-progression, so your progress will carry over to whichever platform you prefer to play on.</p><p>Explaining the decision to go with an early access launch, game director Daniel McLaren pointed to the successful Kickstarter that got The Banner Saga off the ground.</p><p>“Stoic’s history has always been about interacting with our players, and Kickstarter is the promise of something,” McLaren said. “For Stoic, that worked out very well, and now we’re able to say hey, you don’t have to wait for us this time, we can give you a game right now.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Xbox, PC, and Xbox Game Pass players will immediately feel the benefit of the refinement Towerborne will undergo during the early access period and beyond.</p></div><p>Microsoft said that as a result of the Steam early access launch, “Xbox, PC, and Xbox Game Pass players will immediately feel the benefit of the refinement Towerborne will undergo during the early access period and beyond.”</p><p>It’s fair to say the announcement of Towerborne Steam first launch and full launch in 2025 has sparked a vociferous discussion among Xbox fans. While some are saying they’re fine with the release strategy, others are pointing to the fact Microsoft has for years marketed Towerborne as a Microsoft-published Xbox game and now it’s set to launch on Steam first, disappointing yet again what’s left of the company’s core console audience.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/towerborne-1724236339356.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Towerborne. Image credit: Microsoft / Xbox Wire.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Of course, this all taps into the growing sense that Xbox console exclusives are no longer a priority for Microsoft’s gaming business, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-vision-of-the-future">more games set to launch on rival platforms</a> and an upcoming push into the mobile space with an app store of its own. While Microsoft executives continue to stress the importance of consoles to Xbox, and indeed have promised next-generation consoles and heavily teased an Xbox handheld for the future, the overall strategy is clear to see. All this at a time when <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">Microsoft cut an eye-watering 1,900 staff from its gaming business this year</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-addresses-studio-closures-ign-live-2024">shuttered a number of studios</a> amid plummeting sales of Xbox Series X and S.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a>'s director Hiroshi Takai has said it's "possible" and "probably even likely" that future series entries will launch day one on PC, rather than further down the road from their console counterparts.</p>
<p>In conversation with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-16-confirms-september-pc-release-date-director-says-its-possible-probably-even-likely-future-final-fantasy-games-launch-day-1-on-pc/">GamesRadar+</a>, Takai spoke about Final Fantasy 16's upcoming PC debut, and the time between its arrival and the PS5 release. Final Fantasy 16 first released as a PlayStation console exclusive last year, with the PC version promised when it was ready.</p>
<p>"Naturally, we wanted to get the PC version into players' hands as quickly as we possibly could," Takai told the publication. "We don't get anything out of delaying its release either."</p>

<p>"I don't think there's much more we could have done to speed up the porting process," Takai continued, adding the time taken to get the PC version up to snuff was "time well spent".</p>
<p>When asked if future Final Fantasy games could perhaps see a day one PC release, Takai said: "I think it's possible - probably even likely." He did caveat this point though, saying "the team in charge of each project gets to decide its own policy", so this was "just [his] personal opinion".</p>
<p>The director went on to address some of the recent bumps <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s PC ports have faced on release. You may recall, on its own PC debut, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2021-final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-pc-barebones-port">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade was criticised for its performance</a>. Digital Foundry contributor Oliver Mackenzie called it a "flawed, barebones release" that was "nowhere near good enough".</p>
<p>However, Takai said Square Enix "always listens to player feedback and bears it in mind".</p>
<p>"Since we want as many players as possible to enjoy our game, we made sure to address any points that could be perceived negatively," he said. "Of course, it's not just feedback from FF16 players that we listen to, but from other games, too."</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 16 is set to arrive on PC next month, on 17th September. The game will arrive as a complete edition, including all DLC: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16s-first-dlc-opens-that-one-mysterious-door-and-its-characters-minds">Echoes of the Fallen</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-is-finally-complete-though-its-dlc-wont-appease-critics">The Rising Tide</a>.

The announcement came via a teaser trailer, below, that on face value offers little insight into what to expect when the game launches in 2025. But eagle-eyed fans have spotted a number of secrets buried within the trailer itself, and Gearbox chief Randy Pitchford has said there are even more yet to be discovered.</p><p>“There are several secrets in the teaser for Borderlands 4,” Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1826058021614793024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> following ONL. “Some I have not seen commented on yet. What have you found!”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Potential spoilers for Borderlands 4 follow.</em></p><p>Let’s start with what has been found. The most obvious secret is a snapshot of what very much looks like Borderlands villain Handsome Jack with the vault symbol covering his face. This heavily suggests Handsome Jack, the president of the Hyperion Corporation, returns for Borderlands 4.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/jack-1724230300344.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Is this the return of Handsome Jack?</figcaption></figure></output><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Looks like Handsome Jack is returning for Borderlands 4. The vault symbol perfectly aligns. (Credit to @UndeadMD for the find) <a href="https://t.co/j2plLNACuk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/j2plLNACuk</a></p>— JoltzDude139 (@Joltzdude139) <a href="https://twitter.com/Joltzdude139/status/1826003824018075880?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 20, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>But what else? There is eridian writing in the trailer. The Eridians are the ancient, presumably extinct alien race that serves as something of a mysterious force throughout the Borderlands series. Could the Eridians play a role on Borderlands 4?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/writing-1724230502972.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>HE IS WATCHING.</figcaption></figure></output><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/more-writing-1724230591197.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>BREAK FREE.</figcaption></figure></output><p>But what does the eridian writing say? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands/comments/1ex4p1i/comment/lj3ettm/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Redditor pskought</a> believes this is a substitution cipher, and the translation works out as “HE IS WATCHING” and “BREAK FREE.”</p><p>This is all very cool, but what does it mean? Fans have a number of theories, including that “HE IS WATCHING” alludes to the Watcher, an alien of Eridian origin that appears in 2014's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-the-pre-sequel">Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel</a>. Some fans are currently speculating that The Watcher will end up as the antagonist of Borderlands 4, or at least a shadowy figure who is revealed to have been pulling the strings all along.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/jack-again-1724230409142.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Is this also Handsome Jack, or someone else?</figcaption></figure></output><p>Meanwhile, a mysterious orange face pops up at the end of the trailer which may be another look at Handsome Jack or someone else. Fans aren’t sure who this is, or who the robotic hand shown grabbing the face mask belongs to, but all these clues combined with Gearbox’s confirmation that Borderlands 4 is set on a brand new planet, suggest Borderlands 4 is certainly heading in something of a new direction. Perhaps a more serious tone this time around?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/21/hand-1724230753969.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Who's this?</figcaption></figure></output><p>As Pitchford says, there are more hidden secrets players have yet to discover. Some may be little more than Easter eggs. X/Twitter user Primidian spotted what they think is an easy to miss look at Lilith crashing into Elpis, Pandora's moon and the main setting of Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel.

Borderlands 4 is the fourth mainline title and seventh overall entry in the franchise. Players will once again assume the role of a legendary Vault Hunter as they search for secret alien treasure while blasting everything in sight.</blockquote><blockquote>“The team and I at Gearbox have a lot we’ve wanted to do with Borderlands since we first introduced the looter shooter genre to the world with our original game,” said Randy Pitchford, founder and President of the Gearbox Entertainment Company. “All of us at Gearbox have massive ambitions for Borderlands 4 and are putting everything we have into making everything we love about Borderlands better than ever before while taking the game to new levels in exciting new directions.”</blockquote><blockquote>The Borderlands franchise has sold-in more than 87 million copies to-date, receiving critical acclaim from reviewers and fans alike. With unforgettable characters, deep world building, and more unique guns than can be counted, the franchise has cemented itself as a must-play series.</blockquote><blockquote>“We’re thrilled to be able to share with our fans that 2025 will mark a massive year for 2K and Gearbox Entertainment,” said 2K Core Games Senior Vice President and General Manager Catharina Lavers Mallet. “The Borderlands series is one of 2K’s most successful franchises ever and is beloved by millions globally. We’re excited that our already close partnership and collaboration with the Gearbox team has grown even deeper, and we look forward to delivering best-in-class experiences for both longtime fans and new players alike.”</blockquote><p>The reveal of Borderlands 4 is a long time coming, with Pitchford teasing it on a number of occasions in recent years.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, Netease' free-to-play Overwatch wannabe comprised of superheroes from the Marvelverse, is set to launch on December 6th. And in a "hah, take this Overwatch!" way, they've also announced that all of its heroes will be unlocked for everyone straight off the bat (man). Oh no wait, he's DC isn't he. To be fair, I've only watched one Avengers film, two Captain Americas, and Thor: Ragnarok (without seeing the other Thors). All of which I have zero recollection of. Anyway, yes, Marvel Rivals.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The game's big middle finger to Overwatch isn't only that every hero is free-to-play immediately, but any heroes released later down the line will be too. On the one hand I think this is good because there's no barrier to trying out the new hotness. But on the other, I do think there was some merit to locking new heroes behind at least a bit of progression. Not like, spending real life money or anything, but just a sense that you've worked to unlock the new hotness. I don't know, I just found it quite exciting whenever I unlocked a new character with my hard earned Overwatch Bucks. And weirdly, it gave me a sense that I'd passed some basic tests: in mastering the simple free characters, I'd graduated to the more complex new release.</p>

<p>Captain America and the Winter Soldier are also joining the roster, which confuses me slightly as I thought they were one and the same. Then again, I am about as in tune with the Marvelverse as I am some of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BX38z_Ar9yI">The Voice's coaches performing Beautiful Day 12 years ago</a>.</p>
<p>Otherwise yeah, my thoughts on Marvel Rivals are thus: I think this game is swinging around far too late. I wouldn't say hero <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS games</a> are dead, but I do believe Marvel Rivals' specific brand of shooter just isn't in demand anymore - even if it does look alright.</p>
<p>It might be DC or whatever, but I hope Square Enix one day gives us another Guardians Of The Galaxy adventure again. Now that game? That game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-review">was good</a>.</p>

Atsuko Tanaka, the Japanese voice of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a>, has passed away after an unnamed illness she had lived with for more than a year. She was 61 years of age.
</p>
<p>
The news of her passing was shared by her son Hikaru Tanaka on social media earlier this week. He said she "fought... with grace, humour and strength" during her illness. 
</p>
<p>
"I believe it was a life that was truly characteristic of Atsuko Tanaka," her son wrote (translated by <a href="https://animecorner.me/voice-actress-atsuko-tanaka-passed-away/">Anime Corner</a>). "I feel truly blessed to have had such a proud mother."

            <p>If you have experience of the London rental market, there is but one way you can react to a game – a French game, no less, the cultural product of a country where two-bed apartments apparently grow on trees – that promises to maroon you in a sprawling labyrinth of flats. “Haha, alright for some!” you chortle despairingly, after freeing yourself from the laundry basket and retrieving your trousers from the fridge. “I bet labyrinths have more than one window,” you sob, as you yet again tackle the problem of opening the front door without becoming part of the wall. </p>
<p>If you have have experience of the London rental market, you are probably reading this and thinking: “He’s got a front door? Such extravagance. I live in a folded umbrella.” Touché, my friend. I guess it’s just as well we have spaciously proportioned first-person puzzle adventures to console us in our time of compound elbow bruises, rising damp and preposterous financial debt.

<p>Created by Swing Swing Submarine and published by ARTE, it’s a first-person Myst ‘em up, Witness-a-lot and/or Fez-alike (these are the developers' own stated influences, along with 90s fantasy films) in which you wake up one day to a phone call from your mate Fael, who has gotten lost in his own apartment. Sallying forth in search of him, you discover that your own flat and its surroundings have gotten all mazey. It’s just as well you remembered your handheld-console-which-is-legally-distinct-from-the-Game-Boy-Advance-SP.</p>
<p>“To open all the doors and corridors, and access certain rooms, players will have to work their brains out and solve numerous mysteries, using the GameLeaf, an intriguing retro portable console to help them complete the levels,” explains the announcement release. “Each game is a piece of the puzzle that brings players closer to the truth about Fael's disappearance.</p>
<p>“Experimentation is at the heart of the experience, and players will need to be very attentive and interact with the setting, as every detail is important, from photo frames to seemingly uninteresting furniture, everything can be a clue to solve a puzzle,” the release continues. “The world of the flat is full of surprises, and players will have to think outside the box to progress. As they solve Fael's mysterious disappearance, players will also have to question the very nature of reality.”</p>
<p>Thinking outside the box? I only wish I had a box to think in. You’d have to pay £2500 a month for the privilege round these parts, and you’d need to bring your own lid. Anyway, you can read more of Fael’s doings on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/%E2%80%9Dhttps://store.steampowered.com/app/2521170/Looking_For_Fael/%E2%80%9D">Steam</a>. It’s out in 2025. The obvious comparison here is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blue-prince-is-already-the-very-best-shapeshifting-videogame-house">Blue Prince</a>, which takes things in more of a boardgamey direction with no retro handhelds to speak of.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Dying Light: The Beast was revealed by Techland during the Opening Night Live showcase. Shortly after, it was confirmed by the team that it started life as a story expansion for Dying Light 2 (2022) before blossoming into a standalone release. Now, Techland has revealed more details exclusively to the press at Gamescom, along with uncovering a 20-minute gameplay walkthrough.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has those details – read on.,</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-end-of-the-world-looks-phenomenal">The End of the World Looks Phenomenal</h2>



<p>At first blush, Dying Light: The Beast is unequivocally Dying Light 2 – it looks and feels the same as the 2022 release. Under the surface, there’s so much more to uncover, least of all being the return of Kyle Crane after almost a decade. He’s being voiced once again by the legendary Roger Craig Smith, which will be a huge win with fans worldwide.</p>



<p>In The Beast, players will traverse an 18-hour story set in a new and unique location made up of several ‘biomes’. There is a forest region alongside an ‘Old Town’ area, and an industrial complex set beside a railyard, for example. It’s comparable in size to a single region of Villedor from Dying Light 2, which means it’s not the largest map, but Techland assured me that they’ve crammed a lot into the smaller environment.</p>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast will take players through a linear story, which means the ‘choice and consequence’ mechanics of Dying Light 2 have been eradicated. This is because the team wants players to feel like they <strong>are </strong>Kyle Crane and are following <strong>his </strong>story.</p>



<p>For The Beast, Techland has overhauled several in-game mechanics, including stealth, weather, and environmental opportunities when it comes to innovation in combat. It’s the same intense, parkour-fuelled experience players are used to, but modernised slightly and upgraded with some nice graphical improvements, new zombie archetypes, and fresh weapons and skills.</p>



<p>The gameplay walkthrough I saw genuinely filled me with excitement. I’m a ten-year veteran of the series and a huge fan of Dying Light, and I for one can’t wait for The Beast to be released.</p>

            <p>Lo, a ripple in the release date sands. Stand still a moment while we study this phenomenon. Yes, yes, it is the unmistakable rumble of a large survival MMO pondering its release date. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> is having a think and has decided "early 2025" is a good non-specific time period to come out in early access. That could mean January or February. Or March, I guess. April? Now don't be silly, that's spring. Not April, surely. This beast seems hungry. It will eat before then. I have foreseen it. Mostly by watching the trailer that dropped at Gamescom.</p>

<p>The trailer aired during Gamescom's advertising bonanza, Opening Night Live. It takes us swiftly through a new player's idealised opening experience, during which they're dumped in the desert but find another player to team up with. "Working with others will always increase your chances of staying alive," say developers Funcom (they've never <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-tried-to-escape-hell-in-chained-together-and-one-of-us-kept-running-ahead-with-no-warning">played Chained Together with Edwin and Nic</a>). There's a fair bit of ornithopter flying, which looks like quite a buzz.</p>
<p>As expected, much else of what we see is in keeping with Dune's lore. There are body shields and sand worms and those wibbly hoverpacks I don't know the name of. You even suck up all the blood from your enemies and put it in a machine to extract drinking water. (Mostly, I like that you can sell the blueprints of your finished buildings to other players for cash, but this feels like the least Dune-y thing in the whole trailer). You'll also get to meet known characters from the fiction such as famous protagonist <del>Duniel Baggins</del> Paul Atreides. </p>
<p>We've previously heard from developers Funcom that it plays fast and loose with the source material in some important ways, though. Paul's father is alive and well, for example, counter to the canon. Even the environment will see some changes. "The Dune in the movie shows no natural vegetation whatsoever," said Tech Art Director Richard Cawte in <a href="https://duneawakening.com/en/developer-update-1-art-of-arrakis">a blog update</a>, "which is not the case for our Dune." Plants!? On Arrakis!? My outrage better be coming across as fake!! Because it is!!! I like plants!!!!</p>
<p>Edwin got an early look at the crafty <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival game</a> and came away <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sandworms-are-the-spice-in-dune-awakenings-otherwise-quite-familiar-survival-simming">"surprisingly enthused"</a>. Funcom have previously made similar multiplayer survive-o-crafts with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/conan-exiles">Conan Exiles</a> and have been in the sci-fi MMO business since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-anarchy-online">Anarchy Online</a>, so it makes sense that they were chosen to grip the reins of this particularly large franchiseworm. </p>
<p>There's an ongoing beta that you can still sign up for on <a href="https://www.duneawakening.com/#">the game's website</a> if you're so inclined. For everyone else, time to squat in the sand and look at the horizon thoughtfully for 5-6 months. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>&nbsp;is all set to immerse players in the medieval machinations of warring kings and lords all over again, when it comes out on 11th February 2025.</p>
<p>We’ve played a few hours of the game, experiencing its opening narrative twists, as well as leaping ahead to the big city of Kuttenberg and the broader historical RPG action – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/21/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview-kuttenberg-gameplay/">you can read all about that here</a> – but we also got to sit down with Warhorse figurehead and PR Manager Tobias Stolz-Zwilling to talk about a game that’s been a whole console generation in the making.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance II Gameplay Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AwywU6b_JKE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><b>TSA: </b>It’s going to have been 7 years almost exactly between games, which is basically a full console generation which is a lot of time in terms of tech, gaming and people’s attitudes. As a developer, has your approach for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 changed compared to the original, beyond the studio simply getting so much bigger?</p>
<p><b>Tobias Stolz-Zwilling: </b>Yes and no. No, it’s still very much the same kind of game, so we’re trying to stay true to Warhorse, stay true to KCD, and deliver what we believe is a true, authentic medieval experience, but then again, now with more people and the cushion of a successful KCD1, we can make things bigger –&nbsp;everyone always says it’s going to be bigger and better, but in our case we do have more people, we have the financial funding that can support the development, but we also have the technology and the skills now to bring stuff into the game that we couldn’t afford before.</p>

<p>For example, we and [Director] Daniel Vávra always wanted to have a city in the game, and in KCD1 they’re teasing and talking about how in Kuttenberg something is happening, but we simply couldn’t [go there], because we weren’t able to have more than a few people on screen, the task of building a huge medieval city was too big, and so in KCD1 we basically have a bunch of villages and one overblown village, which is Rattay. Compare Ratai to KCD2 and it’s like one street in Kuttenberg. Now we are confident to tackle bigger things and that is what I think has changed most.</p>

<p><b>TSA: </b>You’ve almost already answered my next question, which is what ways KCD2 has changed from the original? The scope, of course, but are you sticking with the alchemy system, the style of combat and things like that?</p>
<p><b>Tobi: </b>Yes, the scope is the easy answer, but pretty much every element from KCD1 is being tweaked, fine tuned and upgraded. Even the dice minigame will be deeper and there will be some badges you can earn.</p>
<p>I think the most prominent example is with the combat […] We said of KCD1 that combat was easy to learn but hard to master, and I think the hard to master we nailed, but the easy to learn, not so much. Many people liked it, but some struggled, so the idea now is to have different animators come to the studio so that they all feel different, but they ca also offer different playstyle. So if you want to play the intricate combat system, then you can take a sword and do all the combos and moves, but if you’re a character that doesn’t want to combat at all or want a more straightforward style, then there’s weapons like the mace where you pretty much just whack the opponent on the head!</p>
<p>Then in the UI there are less attacking zones, it’s a bit more straightforward, the combos are not so difficult, and so on. It’s also stayed true to each weapon historically and what it was used for –&nbsp;of course the crossbow was easier than a bow, that’s why they invented them, and of course a pole weapon is easier that fencing, that’s why they used them. The intent is for a more entertaining game that offers you this choice.</p>
<p><b>TSA: </b>You mentioned hitting enemies on the head, and video game developers have got a rich tradition of exploding watermelons. Usually it’s for first person shooters, I think, but did you get through many watermelons during development?</p>
<p><b>Tobi: </b>[laughs] I don’t want to spoil too much, but many watermelons were harmed!</p>

<p><b>TSA: </b>It also feels like you’re taking a step forward in the storytelling and the cinematic stylings. Perhaps a lot of that is from experiencing the opening hours and getting people into the setting, but does that continue as the open world is exposed to you?</p>
<p><b>Tobi: </b> Daniel Vávra is a huge cinematics fan, and one day wants to shoot a film himself, so of course you can see this in his games –&nbsp;you can also see this in Mafia and Mafia 2, his earlier products. He has this hand for dramatic scenes and sequences, and KCD 2 especially is not different.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the game, it’s a little bit more hands on and we bring you up to speed with the video sequences to introduce you to the game and the surroundings. This will be less through the rest of the game, however, I think we have 4, 5 or 6 hours of cinematics in the game, and they’re extremely powerful and important for us to deliver the story. We have a 100 hour game, after all, and it’s a story driven game first, and an action RPG and the fighting and so on, so therefore the cinematics are very important.</p>
<p><b>TSA: </b>I like that you can really put Henry and Sir Hans together as two characters that have a lot of growing up to do in this game.</p>
<p><b>Tobi: </b>And that’s what makes them so lovely! Hans Capon in the first game, if you check on Reddit and so on, most people are saying the same: “I hated this dude in the beginning, but then he became my most loved character!”</p>
<p>He had this interest arc in KCD where he became a friend to Henry, but still there’s the difference where he is a noble and Henry is a Squire, a bastard. This is still present, but KCD2 will focus strongly on the bromance between those two, as they face terrible situations through the game where they’re on the edge of surviving (maybe even further), and that’s a dramatic part that we have a big focus on.</p>
<p>Henry, in KCD1, pretty much solved everything by himself, but in KCD2 that will not be the case. He will find out very quickly that he needs friends and he needs other misfits to get things done.</p>
<p><b>TSA: </b>I get the feeling that Hans would like Henry to still sort everything out for them! [laughs]
</p><p>How important is that you kept Mutt in the game? Was that a day one addition to the plan?</p>
<p><b>Tobi: </b>Yes, and you can finally pet him! That was a big thing and even our own guys said we have to have a pettable dog, and to go one further, we have a petable horse as well, which is great.</p>
<p>Some of the perks and stats we are taking over to KCD 2, like the dog for instance or Henry being able to read –&nbsp;it doesn’t make sense to make him learn to read all over again –&nbsp;however, things like combat and other intricate things, he has to rediscover.</p>
<p>I like to say it’s like he’s the champion of a Sunday league, but now he’s going to the Premier League, so he will suck at most things in comparison. However, he now knows how to play soccer, but now needs to step up the game to deal with armies, knights, lords, nobility and so on. It’s not like he forgot everything, it’s more like he needs to refine his skills.</p>
<p><b>TSA: </b>He didn’t just take a mace to the head and forget stuff.</p>
<p><b>Tobi: </b>Exactly.</p>

<p><b>TSA: </b>There’s obviously still areas that you might still be able to improve and add in future, so you talked about not having jousting in the game, which I’m sure a lot of people would be nagging you to do. Is that the main thing that is still on the wish list?</p>
<p><b>Tobi: </b>Honestly, I think everything that’s in the game and everything that’s not in the game is exactly as intended by Warhorse – this is how we do it, this is what we wanted to deliver, and we are looking forward to getting this out.</p>
<p>Jousting and these things are coming from fans that are very often used to Hollywood scenes, like A Knight’s Tale. Yes, jousting was a thing in the Middle Ages, but it definitely wasn’t as present as people might think…</p>
<p><b>TSA: </b>Also, it was probably just for the rich folks.</p>
<p><b>Tobi: </b>For the <em>very</em> rich folks. For the nobility mainly, and even then, when they were participating, it was a problem because you were actually hurting a nobleman!</p>
<p>But there will be tournaments: swordfighting tournaments, archery tournaments, horse tournaments and so on and so on. There will be cool stuff in there, but jousting would be a bit like a Quidditch game for Harry Potter. Of course everyone wanted Quidditch in there, but…</p>
<p><b>TSA: </b>I mean, jousting you can understand, but Quidditch is impossible to figure out how to make into a workable game!</p>
<p><b>Tobi: </b>Just catch the golden ball! [laughs]
</p>
<p><b>TSA: </b>Lastly, I was wondering about big picture for Kingdom Come. Obviously you will tell a story of its own in KCD2, but is there still another chapter in a grander saga? I’m not sure you’re allowed to say right now…</p>
<p><b>Tobi: </b>I’m allowed to say anything! KCD1 ended with a cliffhanger, and KCD2 will end a story, but I don’t tell you which story. What the future brings, we don’t know yet.</p>
<p>In our history at Warhorse, we had two sink or swim situations. One was the Kickstarter, and the other was the release of KCD, because even then we weren’t sure if it would be a success or not. it’s not a sink or swim situation anymore, knocking on wood, but we have to wait and see how KCD2 performs. I am positive, I think the game is great and in very good shape already.</p>
<p>I can tell you already that Warhorse tries to aim to get bigger. We want more people, have bigger studios and again tackle bigger challenges.</p>

		<p>Supermassive Games have revealed the next game in The Dark Pictures Anthology and, as we found out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/02/01/next-dark-pictures-anthology-game/">quite a while ago,</a> it’s called Directive 8020. This time we are off into space for some body horror, checkout the trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Directive 8020 | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/etXhOhzbXso?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>I don’t think Supermassive would mind us saying that The Dark Pictures Anthology format had got a little stale after four games so it’s nice to see they are switching things up for this new release. “In a dramatic step forward for the series, the game features persistent real-time threats, all-new stealth gameplay mechanics, and enhanced interactive cinematics powered by Unreal Engine 5,” they say.</p>
<p>The game will feature Hollywood actor Lashana Lynch who you may have caught in Bob Marley: One Love or the superb The Woman King. Here’s more from Supermassive:</p>
<p>“Earth is <span>dying</span>&nbsp;and humanity is running out of time. 12&nbsp;<span>light</span> years from home, Tau Ceti f offers a small sliver of hope. When the colony ship Cassiopeia crash lands on the planet, its crew soon realize they are far from being alone.”</p>

<p>“Hunted by an alien organism capable of mimicking its prey, the crew of the Cassiopeia must outwit their pursuers to make it home alive. As they battle to survive, they are confronted with the hardest choice of all: to save themselves, they must risk the lives of everyone on Earth. In space, death takes many forms.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Next-Gen Cinematic Survival Horror&nbsp;</strong>– Experience immersive cinematic storytelling and edge-of-your-seat horror on a deep space mission to save humanity.</li>
<li><strong>Real-Time Alien Threats&nbsp;</strong>– Evade a deadly alien threat that roams the dark corridors of the ship, intent on eradicating human life. Overcome your enemies using improvised weapons, lightning reflexes, and stealth.</li>
<li><strong>Trust No One</strong> – Encounter an alien lifeform that perfectly imitates its prey. Years of training and trust are lost among the crew when their enemy hides in plain sight. Who is human and who is not? Your choices are now more important than ever!”</li>
</ul>

<p>Arena Breakout: Infinite’s development team just addressed a whole host of topics about the game at Gamescom, talking exclusively to media about upcoming changes and additional features. The team spoke at length about the full release of the game, which is expected to arrive later this year, and touched on some recent controversies, such as the game’s ‘pay-to-win’ model.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prepare-to-breakout">Prepare to Breakout</h2>



<p>Arena Breakout: Infinite is now in early access, and some players were quick to find issues with the game’s operating model. For instance, accusations have been lobbied at MoreFun for promoting a pay-to-win model by stuffing certain items behind paywalls, but this was one of the key areas addressed by the team at Gamescom.</p>



<p>Speaking on the topic, Enzo Zhang, the Head of MoreFun Studios, said that all microtransactions are cosmetic-focused and that a battle pass structure is coming soon. He mentioned that users <strong>can </strong>access everything in-game, and as the title isn’t inherently ‘grindy’, it’s relatively easy to do.</p>



<p>Users can of course buy in-game currency, but the team is stressing that the game isn’t pay-to-win.</p>



<p>Touching on other popular topics, MoreFun explained that there is a console release planned for the game, and while it’ll be the same experience, it won’t be crossplay-compatible. That means that PC players won’t be able to interact with console players.</p>



<p>There are also no plans to introduce a PvE or ‘offline’ mode, despite the team working on innovative AI systems that would perfectly facilitate such a platform. </p>



<p>Elsewhere, MoreFun is working on better engagement with the community. It’s kicking off a ‘support-a-streamer’ program, introducing streamer items, streamer <strong>codes</strong>, and a creator program to support those who want to broadcast their gameplay on the likes of Twitch and YouTube.</p>



<p>By the end of the year, Arena Breakout: Infinite will have a new map (TV Station), more weapons, game modes, and the first female operator. The team is also hard at work on intense anti-cheat mechanics, working on automated solutions, manual mechanics, and better encryption.</p>



<p>Ultimately, there’s one hell of a roadmap lined up for Arena Breakout: Infinite, which is poised to fully disrupt the extraction shooter genre with reckless abandon. As the team said, it’s designed as an ‘extraction shooter for everyone’, and it’ll allow users to dip in and out as they please without feeling like they’re being penalised for taking time away from the game.</p>

<p>Arena Breakout: Infinite just entered early access but is expected to launch as a full game later this year. It’s breaking heavily into the extraction shooter market, which is admittedly becoming quite a densely populated landscape, but it’s coming with quite a bit of innovation.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has learned that the team at MoreFun Studios is working on an innovative AI solution known as ‘FACUL’, which stands for First Ever AI Companion Who Understands Human Language.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-next-level-intelligence">Next-Level Intelligence</h2>



<p>MoreFun Studios is working to constantly pump Arena Breakout: Infinite, a new free-to-play extraction shooter, with content. On the roadmap is the integration of a next-generation artificial intelligence engine called FACUL, which will allow players to make use of AI-powered companions that they can order around the battlefield.</p>



<p>But it’s far from the command model that existed 20 years ago in the likes of SOCOM.</p>



<p>FACUL allows AI characters to recognise up to 17,000 in-game items, such as buildings, weapons, landmarks, and as the team said, ‘even blades of grass’. Players can use an adaptive, dynamic model to issue commands to these AI companions, ordering them as though they were talking to teammates. They can even have casual conversations and crack jokes with the AI.</p>



<p>MoreFun admitted that it hasn’t found a real use case for the AI in the game, particularly as it’s trying to avoid implementing something that could become quite overpowered, but it’s an innovative and interesting feature that’s being penned as a first-ever for the FPS genre.</p>

            <p>Hyper Light Breaker - Heart Machine's fully 3D rogue-lite spin on its acclaimed 2016 action-adventure Hyper Light Drifter - has had its early access launch bumped back a bit, and is now targeting an early 2025 release.</p>
<p>In a post shared on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1534840/view/5989310788331688818">Steam</a>, Heart Machine founder Alx Preston said the team needs a bit more time to ensure the gameplay experience is up to the "polished" standard the studio is aiming for.</p>
<p>"We don't want to ship a project, even in Early Access, that we're not satisfied with on a number of fronts. Especially in the current state of the industry, we need to put as good a foot forward as we can," Preston wrote.</p>

<p>The developer said the studio also wanted to ensure the wellbeing of its staff, with their mental and physical health a priority. This delay, Preston said, will "enable the team to offer better, more responsive support to community feedback during the Early Access period itself", rather than seeing them burnt out having pushed for that earlier launch.</p>
<p>"Trust that we REALLY want to put Breaker out there, and see people engage with a game that we've all worked so hard on," Preston assured the community. "However, we also REALLY need to make sure that the core foundational units of the game are as strong as they can be, so that we can build on them during the Early Access period."</p>

<p>Hyper Light Breaker was first <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyper-light-drifter-is-getting-a-fully-3d-rogue-lite-follow-up-with-online-co-op">announced back in March 2022</a>, with an expected launch into early access the following spring. Its release then shifted to autumn 2023 before it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hyper-light-drifters-3d-rogue-lite-follow-up-gets-first-gameplay-trailer">pushed back to 2024</a>. As with this latest delay, Heart Machine said it wanted to make sure it could "bring the game to its full potential" ahead of its debut.</p>
<p>In the meantime while waiting for Hyper Light Breaker, you can give Hyper Light Drifter a whirl if you are yet to do so.

		<p>Dying Light: The Beast is a new stand alone game that brings back Kyle Crane from the first <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dying-light/">Dying Light</a> game and it’s DLC. Kyle was absent from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dying-light-2/">Dying Light 2,</a> probably because at the end of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dying-light-the-following/">The Following</a> players could experience two different endings and neither of them were particularly… healthy.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dying Light: The Beast - Announcement Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/azIBRaiB05I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game is set thirteen years since Kyle was last seen and finds him exploring the post-apocalyptic Castor Woods, a once-popular tourist destination. The area is populated with human factions as well as monsters including “the mysterious creature that’s turned the woods into its personal hunting grounds.”</p>
<p>As you might have gathered Kylie is no longer fully human. “Years of brutal experimentation took its toll, but the zombie DNA and yours are now intertwined so that you are able to unleash a beast-like power,” say Techland. “It flows through your veins. No one can take it from you. Use it. And you’ll discover it’s not just a curse.”</p>
<p>Voice actor Roger Craig Smith will be returning to the role of Kyle Crane. “Stepping back into Kyle Crane’s shoes feels like a reunion with an old friend,” Smith said. “And even though he’s gone through a terrible time, there’s still plenty of legendary hero left in him.”</p>

<p>The extra nice news is that if you own &nbsp;Dying Light 2: Stay Human Ultimate Edition you will get The Beast for free!</p>
<p>“Development of Dying Light: The Beast originally started as a story DLC for Dying Light 2 Stay Human. But after two years of work, its size and scope has changed so much that it evolved into a standalone, self-contained experience,” say Techland. “To show appreciation for the community who patiently waited for the DLC, Techland will be offering Dying Light: The Beast at no extra cost to all owners of the Dying Light 2 Stay Human Ultimate Edition, delivering a full standalone adventure instead of just a DLC.”</p>
<p>Dying Light: The Beas coming to to PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store, Xbox and PlayStation – and that includes last gen&nbsp; – but no release date has been given.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-%E2%80%93-the-first-preview.959277/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-the-first-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It's about to kick off in the centre of Kuttenberg, the sprawling medieval city at the heart of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. Menhard the sword master has offered to teach protagonist Henry of Skalitz a few tricks with the blade, but the lesson has been interrupted by Kuttenberg's official fencing guild. They won't let Menhard teach so much as a pommel strike, despite him having a charter from King Wenceslas to do just that. Moreover, they're going to fine the old Fechtmeister for breaching their rules.</p><p>Things are getting heated, with the chance of a real swordfight breaking out growing by the second. But Henry has an idea. "Menhard wasn't teaching me anything," he blurts out. "We were duelling because I insulted his honour!" </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 - Gamescom 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Unconvinced, the guild master asks what the duel was about, at which point I'm given an array of choices for Henry to respond with. Reacting quickly, I decide to have Henry say that he slept with Menhard's daughter. I don't know whether Menhard has a daughter, but it seems like the sort of thing medieval people would get into a duel over, so I roll with it. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The guild master buys my bald-faced lie and waives the fine...</p></div><p>It works. The guild master buys my bald-faced lie and waives the fine, though Menhard is still prohibited from teaching longsword in the city. With a fight avoided, I turn to Menhard expecting him to be grateful. Instead, he's furious. It seems Menhard really does have a daughter, and the very idea of Henry sleeping with her has genuinely insulted his honour. Oops. With their relationship damaged, Henry must desperately placate the raging swordmaster before they can focus on more important matters, like plotting how to get back at Kuttenberg's fencing guild.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is shaping up to be an even bigger RPG than the original, a 100+ hour epic featuring massive battles, sweeping Bohemian landscapes, and a fully simulated medieval metropolis. But at Warhorse Studios' preview event hosted in the real-life city of Kutná Hora (the modern Czech name for Kuttenberg) it was this throwaway detail that stuck with me the most. Warhorse claims every choice the player makes in its RPG will feel like it matters, and this dramatic response to a decision I barely thought about was the first (but not the last) indicator that KCD2 could well deliver on this promise. </p><p>It'll be several hours before KCD 2 opens-up to you in this way, however. Warhorse provided access to two separate chunks of the game, the first of which took place right at the beginning. Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 opens in medias res, with an explosive castle siege where you defend the ramparts with crossbow and longsword. Warhorse says KCD 2 will feature substantially larger battles than the previous game, and this initial sequence was an impressive taster of playing at a larger scale, from booting down siege ladders from the castle wall, to firing crossbow bolts into a crush of enemy soldiers as they come barrelling through the gate.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Following this exciting opening, KCD 2 rewinds to connect with the end of the first game, as we rejoin Henry and his friend and liege lord Sir Hans Capon on a mission to deliver a letter to neighbouring lord Otto von Bergow. This initial hour is strictly linear and heavy on cutscenes, but it keeps you engaged through the feelgood vibes of Henry and Hans' friendship. Like the first Kingdom Come, the sequel is written in a very humanistic style. Henry remains a deeply affable, fish-out-of-water protagonist, while his position as Sir Hans' squire leads to an interesting blend of camaraderie and tension between the two.</p><p>Together, the pair have big "lads on tour" energy, clearly revelling in the rare freedom their position and assignment affords them in medieval society. It isn't all fun and games, however. An encounter with a retinue of Bergow's knights emphasises the danger that lurks around every corner, as the two have to convince the armed horsemen that they aren't bandits. It's the first of many elaborate dialogue sequences, with numerous player choices and a lot of exposition. Indeed, while KCD's conversations are generally interesting, I did wonder if they might benefit from some sterner editing at times.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>KCD2 is built to be played with no foreknowledge of the original. As such, the opening hours fold in several refresher tutorials, such as Henry and Hans having a friendly duel that reintroduces you to KCD's unique swordfighting system. This has been refined for the sequel, reducing the number of directions you can swing your sword from five to four, and making actions like parrying and riposting easier to pull off. While it's been years since I played the first game, I was nonetheless able to hold my own against Sir Hans after a few minutes of instruction, suggesting that Warhorse's changes have indeed made the system easier to grapple with. The sequel also introduces bespoke fighting systems for certain non-sword weapons like maces, letting players who don't fancy mastering the blade to adopt the simpler approach of cracking skulls.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>KCD2 is built to be played with no foreknowledge of the original.</p></div><p>The introduction culminates in Henry and Hans taking a bath in the river, followed by a goofy scene where they sneak through the reeds along the riverbank, drawn by the sound of peasant women singing nearby. The scene quickly takes a darker turn, however, as the pair's camp is attacked by bandits, whereupon they're forced to flee into the woods wearing nothing but their pants. It's a sequence that shifts between dramatic and comedic multiple times, and the game handles those tonal changes well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Through a series of unfortunate events, Henry and Hans end up in the care of a local peasant woman, where we get a chance to see the quieter side of KCD2. One of the original’s strengths was how it strived to immerse players in moment-to-moment play, and KCD2 seems just as indulgent in this regard. Simple actions like eating stew from a pot and picking herbs to make potions are depicted with intensely detailed first-person animations, while the Bohemian forests you explore are verdant and alive with birdsong. There's a chance to experiment with the updated alchemy system, which is even more tactile and involved than the first game, with you sprinkling ingredients into a big cauldron, before adjusting its height with a lever to change the heat level. Later, when Henry has to fight and kill a couple of bandits who come looking for him, an optional objective unlocks to bury the bodies away from the peasant woman's home, and you can go through the entire process of putting these wayward souls to rest.</p><p>Everything in this initial demo suggests KCD 2 will retain the original’s capacity for letting players steep in its medieval setting. What it didn't show was anything wildly new. For this, the second demo was more promising. This fast-forwarded the campaign to the 50-hour mark, where Henry arrives in Kuttenberg. This medieval metropolis is the largest urban space seen in the series yet, a bustling environment where every NPC has their own daily routines and behaviours.</p><p>It's here where Henry encounters the swordmaster Menhard and becomes embroiled in the dispute over who has the rights to teach longsword in the city. To settle the disagreement, Menhard hatches a plan, and asks Henry to steal the fencing guild's official sword and hang it on the wall of the Rathaus (the town hall). This, Menhard explains, is the formal way of issuing a challenge of arms to the town, a challenge which Menhard could then accept to prove his martial superiority.</p><p>Of course, this means sneaking into a guildhall filled with master swordsmen, which Menhard wisely suggests you do at night (though you are free to try it in the daytime if you wish). Yet even in darkness, clandestine activities are a risky business in Kuttenberg. Anyone walking around at night is expected to carry a torch, and not doing so will get you in trouble with the guards. Having successfully evaded the city watch, I then have to climb over the wall of the guild house, pick the lock on one of several potential entrances, find the sword, and escape. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Here, the open-ended nature of KCD 2 becomes much more apparent, with the quest feeling closer in spirit to a game like Dishonored than the more directed sequences of the early game. The first time I attempt the theft, things go south quickly. I pick the lock but attract the attention of one of the nightwatchmen, who relocks the door after searching for me. I pick the lock again, and proceed three steps into the building before I'm rumbled. I try to fight my way out with fisticuffs, managing to knock out one of the nightwatchmen, but another has roused the town guard, who come barrelling in with swords drawn to quickly cut me down.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The quest can alter in multiple ways depending on your actions, both in narrative choices and general play.</p></div><p>In my second attempt, I'm more careful, and succeed in lifting the sword unnoticed and hanging it on the wall of the Rathaus. This would be a natural endpoint for the quest, but it proves to be far from over. Succeeding in the theft leads to a multi-stage longsword tournament between Menhard and the swordmasters' guild, and you can choose to be sworn in under Menhard's stewardship and fight for his honour and right to teach longsword in the city. Moreover, the quest can alter in multiple ways depending on your actions, both in narrative choices and general play. If you steal the sword but are spotted doing so, for example, the guild will accuse you of the theft when Menhard accepts their challenge. Consequently, the swordmasters' guild is given heavier armour during the tournament, making the fight more difficult on your end.</p><p>This elaborate structure isn't entirely surprising; quest design was one of the first game's strengths too. Nonetheless, it certainly feels like the sequel is operating at a higher level amid the busy streets of Kuttenberg. And if Menhard's quest is reflective of the sequel's 100+ hour total, then Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 could end up being something rather special indeed.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Seven years is a long time to wait after a cliffhanger ending, but as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a> ably proves, it takes a good long time to make a game, these days. Warhorse Studios found great success with the first game, selling millions of copies to allow them to grow both in their ambitions and as a studio. Picking up right where the last game ended, the adventure that awaits Sir Hans and Henry is bigger, more deadly, and will take you from the countryside and into the big city.</p>

<p>Spending several hours with the game, we got to experience the opening region and the events that kick this new narrative arc into gear, before jumping ahead to the big city and some of the politicking and possibilities that this region provides. There’s a pretty stark contrast between the two, most notably in terms of the environment that you’re exploring, but also in terms of pacing.</p>


<p>Dubbed ‘Bohemian Paradise’, the opening area is full of lush greenery and small villages surrounding the hilltop Trosky Castle, but we had only a glimpse of this amidst the narrative upheaval that greets Henry and his lord Sir Hans. They have been entrusted with delivering a message of peace to Lord Bergow, though as they get close, they’re greeted with suspicion and hostility from guards on patrol. There’s bandits in the area and they’re immediately suspicious of you, not least because of the respective allegiances in the war between King Wenceslas and the upstart King Sigismund.</p>
<p>That initial interaction starts to define who your version of Henry is. This is a fresh start from the first game, and Warhorse Studios describe it as a new arc – KCD was Henry becoming a man, while KCD 2 will be him becoming a warrior, but still seeking revenge for the murder of his parents, like he’s starring in a Shenmue game. Seeking to back Sir Hans up and express the honourable nature of our mission, I put my foot in it while trying to navigate the conversation with the guard’s captain, until Sir Hans steps back in and resolves the issue – of course, I doubt you can really start a fight at this point, but it lets you emphasise whether Henry will be a smooth-talking envoy or a strong, battling soldier that will fight to resolve issues, rather than talk too much.</p>


<p>You never make it to the castle, though, those aforementioned bandits ambushing your group and sending Sir Hans and Henry fleeing through the woods with just a pair of britches to hide their modesty. Thankfully the old lady who eventually takes them in, all battered, bruised and bleeding, doesn’t mind their lack of clothing, but once you actually reach Trosky, reality bites hard at Sir Hans, the brattier side to his summery character driving a wedge between the two. Also, you’ve got to go and find your dog, who went missing after the ambush.</p>
<p>It’s a compelling opening hour or so, giving a rather linear introduction to this game, providing you with some fighting practice, a bit of stealth, and revisiting a few of the key plot points via flashbacks, so you can enjoy this and understand Henry’s origins without having played the first game. However, it’s not a true representation of the more than 80 hours that will follow. That will be much more open and free for you to explore as you see fit, with gameplay and quest design that builds upon the style of the original. It’s when we leap ahead to explore Kuttenberg (now known as Kutná Hora in Czech) that we get to see this side of the game play out.</p>
<p>One of the most important cities within Bohemia at the time, Kuttenberg’s reputation was largely built on the silver mines that gave it so much wealth. This was a major economic centre because of it, with a minting press clanging away to produce currency, and people drawn to the area because of this.</p>

<p>Kuttenberg has been recreated in fantastic detail here, with Warhorse getting a lot of support from the city to help them build something authentic to the period. Leaning upon historical references and records, they’re able to peel back the centuries and restore buildings and structures back to what they would have been like – a walking tour through the city lets us see the comparison between the modern and preserved streets and structures, and how they look in the game, as well as educated guesses like an astronomical clock that they know was there, but have modelled after the world famous clock in Prague. While you might have a mental image of a world filled with muddy browns, Kuttenberg’s wealth was shown through colour, artistic construction and finery.</p>
<p>And naturally, with a large population centre, politics come to the fore and create conflict. Menhardt the master swordsman –&nbsp;a Fechter –&nbsp;has come from Frankfurt with a license from the king to found a brotherhood and spread his artistry in combat. But as he arrives in Kuttenberg, he finds another brotherhood from Prague has established itself, and the city council siding with them. All Menhardt wants –&nbsp;you’ll gather from his mixed English and German dialogue (in that Hollywood way that people never actually speak in when using foreign languages)&nbsp;– is the opportunity to fight and prove that he should be allowed to establish a brotherhood, but as they refuse to fight him, he hatches a plan with Henry to steal the Kuttenberg Sword from the local brotherhood and place it at the town hall to open them up to challenges.</p>

<p>There’s bound to be a bunch of ways to pull this off, but by far the easiest and most obvious is to sneak into the brotherhood’s house at night and steal the sword – people have routines through a 24-hour cycle, so you can skip forward to get to the point in time that you need. Nighttime is dictated by rules like needing to walk with a lamp or torch, so that you are above suspicion of being a thief, but you’ll encounter locked doors that need careful (and most importantly quiet) picking with a tricky, but enjoyable minigame, that can alert the people inside. Thankfully, if you are caught, then there’s still a way to trigger the duel and competition, just with the odds in the tournament being stacked against Menhardt and his brotherhood that you can join up to.</p>
<p>There’s been some significant improvements to the combat in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, though it’s building on the same foundations as the original game. You still have the five-pointed star reticule when fighting an opponent, giving you the ability to attack and block from either side, from above, jab down the middle or attack from below – these upward swings are now combined instead of being separate directions. I found it a little easier to grasp the basics in this game than with the first, learning a bit better how to parry and open an opponent’s guard, or to string together a flurry of blows. Don’t get cocky, though, because this is still a tricky style of combat to master.</p>
<p>Is there that much of a difference between Menhardt’s German school of combat and the Prague brotherhood? I couldn’t really say, but with their success and growth over the past seven years, Warhorse has grown the animation team from basically a single person, to having someone dedicated to each weapon and combat style. There should be greater distinction and nuance between them, letting your specialise.</p>
<p>But maybe you don’t want to be up close and personal? Fighting from afar will be perfectly viable, and maybe even preferred when the pitched battles can be much larger and more grand than before. You’ll see full-blown castle assaults, man the ramparts with a crossbow in hand, as opposed to a bow and arrow, and KCD2 will feature the earliest of firearms, including boom sticks that are basically a tube on a stick that you shove gunpowder and a bullet down, before making it go… well… boom!</p>

<p>There’s plenty more aspects to the game, all building upon the original, such as the public perception of Henry which shifts depending on your actions – so if you’re a thief, you’ll be branded as such and treated as one –&nbsp;or the in-depth alchemy system that has you physically mixing healing remedies. Oh, and of course there’s a fun game to sink your time into, though in this case it’s a historically accurate game of dice. It’s actually surprisingly addictive –&nbsp;well, I had to keep playing if I wanted my dog to have a sausage for dinner! –&nbsp;as you roll a bunch of dice and try to find pairs and runs with which you can score points and then keep rolling, but you importantly need to know when to quit, otherwise you’ll end up with no points for a round.</p>
<p>Put it all together and Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is shaping up to be a real showcase for how much Warhorse Studios has grown, evolving their take on the historical setting and their approach to role playing games in general.</p>

			<p>It feels insane that I wrote a<a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> hands-on preview</a> of Kingdom Come: Deliverance seven years ago, following a trip to Hever Castle. It's not insane that I wrote the preview; I was interested in Kingdom Come: Deliverance for quite a while. What is insane is that it was seven years ago. Time flies.</p>
<p>As you now know, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is getting a release on its seventh anniversary</a>. In addition, we know other aspects, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-dev-says-combat-will-be-more-accessible-explains-why-the-game-still-uses-cryengine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more accessible combat</a> and an increased size and scale of the game. Having recently had a hands-on with the game in Kutna Hora, formerly known as Kuttenberg, I'm able to talk about some of these changes and what it bodes for the full release.</p>
<p>Let's start with the basics. <a href="https://warhorsestudios.cz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhorse Studios</a> has designed Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 so anybody can jump in. You don't need to have played the first game to be able to play and understand the second, despite it being a direct continuation. At the end of the first game, you - with Hans Capon - are riding into a forest on a mission to deliver a message. This starts as you exit that forest mere days later and are on the Bohemian Paradise map, the first of two.</p>
<figure>

</figure>


<p>This marks the first part of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 and is the first of two hands-on sessions I had with the game while in Kuttenberg. With such a direct link, mere days between the first and second game, you would naturally wonder how they will work in what will essentially be a resetting of abilities and taking Henry back to basics, at least the basics for starting any game. In this case, you are badly injured in an ambush, which puts you back to basics.</p>
<p>Not everything is lost; Henry learned how to read and write in the first game, and this isn't a case of complete amnesia. Skills that Henry learned as part of the story remain, but if you played the first and you maxed everything out, you became the bohemian version of Connor MacLeod; you won't be that here. You may find it easier to progress here because the changes made by Warhorse Studios have greatly improved certain game elements.</p>
<p>Before discussing that, let's cover the basics without giving too many spoilers. Yes, the reset is due to an ambush of you and Hans Capon, and from what I have seen in the initial part of the story, the aim will be to complete the mission you were initially there for. You're there to deliver your message to Trosky castle, but in that ambush, you have lost everything, and naturally, the only sign of being there were seals to prove who you were, all lost. It's time to work your way up. In my first few hours, seeing how the game brought you either into - or back into - the world was interesting. I would argue that it is more than welcoming to new people, as it organically introduces you to several mechanics.</p>

<p>The second gameplay session I had put me later in the game, in Kuttenberg itself, gave an excellent example of how certain quests could change and how choices - and even the inability to do something - can have consequences as questlines go on. I won't go into the full details of it, but this quest puts you in the middle of two factions looking to run a sword-fighting training school. During the quest, you'll have a few routes to progress. I tried the sneaky route, stealing an item, but I was spotted, which resulted in a penalty on my side in a tournament.</p>
<p>What I will say from this is just how big Kuttenberg is. Sasau, with the monastery, is the most significant area in the first game. Kuttenberg, in this, is considerably larger. With its bustling nature, roaming around the city makes it feel alive. Initial impressions make it seem that Warhorse has been successful in making Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 on a much grander scale in all ways, from the variety of quests, the size of the world, and also the themes it follows. The original was already a more mature title than most, with the aim for this being even more so.</p>
<p>This also applies to the dialogue. Games and other media often consider "mature" just a fair amount of swearing and some unnecessary and out-of-place sex. The swearing is still present from the four-plus hours I've had with the game. Still, the dialogue feels fantastic, and character development certainly feels strong, with a particular note to the conversations between Henry and Hans. Even the other conversations I've seen feel more natural.</p>
<p>Dramatically improved animations further enhance it. Including motion capture on faces adds to the immersion of these conversations and the game, with a much-improved overall visual quality and added animations throughout. Combat also looks smoother, with an increased variety of weapons and improved unarmed combat with further actions on how you're punching during your bar fights.</p>
<figure>

<p>In addition to the improvements in combat animations, the fluidity of combat works better. Having recently replayed the original, the sequel is certainly more accessible. However, it manages this without weakening what is the best melee combat system in any RPG. You will still be using combos, feints, parries and more, targeting specific areas of an enemy to catch them off guard.</p>
<p>Ten hours of recorded music with a full choir support all of this. I heard a few of the coming tracks, which will further enhance the immersion of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 and add to the improvements mentioned above. It all comes down to what feels like it will be a much-improved game and precisely what a sequel should be: a natural expansion on the first.</p>

But I’m surprised by just how “immersive sim” it is, even if I get the sense Warhorse might shudder at that characterization. Though its introduction is slow and narrowly focused on familiarizing newcomers with the gameplay, what I play much later in the game feels like an exciting digital LARP session I can’t wait to experiment in further.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196599,196358" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Pre-order <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em></strong>: <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Kingdom-Come-Deliverance-II-PlayStation-5/dp/B0D2FGZ3HF/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview-medieval-rpg-1851626849&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0D2FGZ3HF" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmVfoOcD78C&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmVfoOcD78C" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy&nbsp;</a></span></p><h2 id="h87353"><a id=""></a>A slow but “authentically medieval” start</h2><p>The game’s opening is set within Trosky Castle, the centerpiece of <em>KCD2</em>’s first (of two) major regions: Bohemian Paradise, during the year 1403. Hungary, on orders of King Sigismund the Red Fox, is invading, and Henry, Hans, and other soldiers find themselves at the mercy of arrows, trebuchets, and more. It’s a fun set piece and showcases the new crossbow weapon, which joins other additions like early firearms and missile weapons, but just as things get going, we cut to a time several weeks earlier.<br></p><p>Unaware of the incoming invasion, protagonist Henry, his former rival but now best friend Hans, and their crew make camp after a brief scuttle with some watchmen looking out for bandits, used here to showcase the game’s skill-check-based dialogue system. Immediately, I’m entranced by the music, written by Warhorse’s in-house composer duo, Adam Sporka and Jan Valta. It’s refreshingly medieval and whimsical and avoids the more generic tone of heroism that can sometimes accompany the genre’s music. At camp, I play a few rounds of the dice-based minigame Tankard, find a way to feed my dog (which you can pet, of course), and practice swordplay with Hans.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="7c50f89b6f3d6afc5c8d646817f5bbfb" data-recommend-id="image://7c50f89b6f3d6afc5c8d646817f5bbfb" data-format="jpg" data-width="2298" data-height="1300" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A house in a rural setting with a wooden cart out front and a castle or fort in the distance is seen at what appears to be dusk." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A house in a rural setting with a wooden cart out front and a castle or fort in the distance is seen at what appears to be dusk." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warhorse Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7c50f89b6f3d6afc5c8d646817f5bbfb" data-recommend-id="image://7c50f89b6f3d6afc5c8d646817f5bbfb" data-format="jpg" data-width="2298" data-height="1300" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A house in a rural setting with a wooden cart out front and a castle or fort in the distance is seen at what appears to be dusk." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Dueling against Hans feels weighty and deliberate as I select a direction for my attack with the right stick before swinging with the right trigger. I do this while watching Hans’ attacks and their direction so I can block with the left trigger. It’s surprisingly difficult as you must manage your directional input, enemy input, parries, and more. The game does a great job diegetically signaling what’s next, but it’s still a lot to account for. I initially suck at it. But after a few more fights, I start to feel the appeal of this combat system. Warhorse says it focused on making the combat more engaging and easier to understand for the sequel, tackling one of the most common criticisms of the first game.<br></p><p>Warhorse PR Manager Tobias Stolz-Zwilling, who spoke on behalf of the studio during the event, says <em>KCD2 </em>is an “authentically medieval game but not a medieval simulation.” The combat speaks to that most. It feels like what I imagine medieval combat was like—deliberate, weighty, and a touch unwieldy—but still manages to be fun.<br></p><p>“Authentically medieval” also allows the team to get away with things like “Remedium Savegamium,” a potion that must be drunk to save the game. From the groans and laughter I hear during the preview when Warhorse mentions this, it’s clear fans of the series find this potion both a frustrating element of the first game and an endearing aspect of the difficulty and challenge it’s known for.<br></p><p>After some time in the camp, Hans beckons Henry to join him on a little adventure, following the voices of women he hears nearby. This moment serves as the game’s introduction to stealth, which seems simple but serviceable, but more importantly, it kicks off an event that sends Hans and Henry running for their lives. Bandits attack the crew back at camp and then the women, and Hans and Henry are forced to flee, but not before Henry takes an arrow to the back.<br></p><p>As the two attempt to escape across a nearby pond, Henry is forced to relive tragic (and trippy) moments of his history through flashbacks likely caused by extreme blood loss. I like these moments, as they inject a bit of fantasy and surrealism that <em>KCD2</em>’s devotion to “authentically medieval” might otherwise prevent, and the flashbacks help me, a newcomer to the series, catch up on how Henry went from a nobody to somebody. </p><figure id="" data-id="a867dd785b5223d4de0479bcacb715e6" data-recommend-id="image://a867dd785b5223d4de0479bcacb715e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="2284" data-height="1270" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A point-of-view shot shows hands holding a pot of liquid and pouring it into a flask in an image of KCD2's alchemy process." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A point-of-view shot shows hands holding a pot of liquid and pouring it into a flask in an image of KCD2's alchemy process." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Doing some alchemy in Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warhorse Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a867dd785b5223d4de0479bcacb715e6" data-recommend-id="image://a867dd785b5223d4de0479bcacb715e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="2284" data-height="1270" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A point-of-view shot shows hands holding a pot of liquid and pouring it into a flask in an image of KCD2's alchemy process." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I eventually make it to a rickety backwood cabin and meet Pavlena and Hezbonah, who rehabilitate Henry and teach me alchemy (a fun multi-step minigame to craft potions) and the effects of my dialogue choices. Henry gains reputation with different people, like Pavlena and Hezbonah, as well as factions based on selections I make, even with dialogue that doesn’t rely on skill checks, which provides the type of introspection I feel in good <em>D&amp;D</em> roleplay. As I chose the Advisor playstyle in the game’s intro, my Henry leads with knowledge in conversation, but a Soldier playstyle might come off more brutish or a Thief more conniving.<br></p><p>Choosing Advisor, Soldier, or Thief allocates your starting ability points, but Warhorse says you aren’t locked into one direction and are free to class out your Henry however you like. Something I enjoy during my brief time with the game is the way it rewards your direct actions. Warhorse calls it “true roleplaying,” but it reminds me most of classic <em>Runescape</em> in the sense that if I want my combative actions to improve, I need to actually do things like swing a sword or shoot a bow. It’s nice interacting with the world to improve Henry’s abilities, as opposed to arbitrarily receiving points I can allocate to any skill after completing quests, and adds a satisfying level of action-and-immediate-consequence to the world.<br></p><p>I eventually reach the <em>KCD2</em> title card and just before I can finally interact with the open world of Bohemian Paradise, I’m booted out. Though it’s clear the sequel’s introductory hours are meant to catch new players up on this series and how it works, even I, a newcomer, found it slow when all was said and done. It’s a ton of dialogue, admittedly well-written, but enough to make one’s eyes glaze over in between the sparse gameplay sequences.<br></p><h2 id="h87354"><a id=""></a>A dash of <em>Thief </em>in <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em></h2><p>Thankfully, though, there’s more to come. The second half of my play session takes place 60 to 70 hours into the game, I’m told, in <em>KCD2</em>’s other major region, Kuttenberg, a place not seen in the first game but teased throughout. It’s a massive and sprawling medieval city inhabited by hundreds of NPCs and surrounded by villages and wilderness that invite exploration. According to Warhorse, Kuttenberg and Bohemian Paradise make up 25 square kilometers of <em>KCD2</em> to explore, double the size of its predecessor.<br></p><p>Here, I encounter the Meister of Frankfurt, Menhard, a loud but charming character attempting to become a local guild leader by challenging others who hold the title. Henry, who stumbles upon this conversation, is free to ignore it or at least stay quiet. But you can also side with Menhard or the opposing group of people. I side with Menhard and, after a dodgy conversation over a mug of beer, find myself in charge of stealing a special guild sword and hanging it at Town Hall.<br></p><p>It’s midday and, curious about this request, I immediately head toward the waypoint. This brings me to a locked door that I attempt to lockpick, clearly forgetting myself because the guards nearby immediately arrest me. Henry must first endure humiliation and embarrassment in a pillory before he’s freed and, because of his arrest, must now sleep to rid himself of a debuff that makes him easier to spot. I sleep long enough to get rid of it and awake at 1 a.m., the perfect time for some daring thievery. It’s here I learn that if you’re out at night, you have to carry a torch, lest you face questioning and scrutiny (that I fail) from guards patrolling the city…and it’s jail again. Soon, this time with a torch in hand, I attempt this guild sword heist at night again and eventually reach the correct location.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="d32208583218ca1d8b4cd181f4798fb2" data-recommend-id="image://d32208583218ca1d8b4cd181f4798fb2" data-format="jpg" data-width="2294" data-height="1292" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hooded character with a dagger crouches while a guard with a pike looks toward workers carrying crates to or from a cart in a city at night." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A hooded character with a dagger crouches while a guard with a pike looks toward workers carrying crates to or from a cart in a city at night." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warhorse Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d32208583218ca1d8b4cd181f4798fb2" data-recommend-id="image://d32208583218ca1d8b4cd181f4798fb2" data-format="jpg" data-width="2294" data-height="1292" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hooded character with a dagger crouches while a guard with a pike looks toward workers carrying crates to or from a cart in a city at night." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After successfully picking some locked doors, I enter. I see a guard at a table and sneak in close to knock him out. It’s here I learn that baths are important. Throughout my time in Kuttenberg, almost every NPC I walk by remarks on my smell, but I ignore it. I wish I hadn’t because as I sit behind the aforementioned guard preparing to knock him out, he smells something awful, turns around, and spots me…jail again. After a third attempt, I finally retrieve the sword and hang it at Town Hall as Menhard instructed. Acting as a guild challenge of sorts, Menhard, Henry, and a third NPC must now face off against the other guild would-bes in a tournament. I love that when Henry isn’t dueling, he must stand on the sidelines and watch the other NPCs duel. It’s a small touch of authenticity that I welcome after expecting the game to either fast-forward or let Henry join in on the other fights.<br></p><p>It’s here in this Kuttenberg section of the preview that I find the freedom, diversity, and variation the game’s opening lacks. Though the first two hours of the game feel paint-by-numbers, what I see in Kuttenberg, more than halfway through the game’s story, hints at a sprawling medieval RPG that borders immersive sim—I wish I’d gotten to experience more than just 60 minutes of it.<br></p><p>Warhorse stresses there is a linear story here—Henry is still on a quest to avenge his parents, who were murdered in the first game, all while fighting back against the invading Hungarian army—and I’m looking forward to seeing how it plays out. I especially enjoy the comedic buddy-duo dynamic between Henry and Hans and how their relationship informs the wider narrative moments happening around them (and sometimes because of them). However, it’s the steps I’ll take to reach those moments, the choices I’ll make mechanically informed by the real history of this medieval landscape, that excite me most as <em>KCD2</em> approaches launch early next year.</p><p><strong>Pre-order <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em></strong>: <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Kingdom-Come-Deliverance-II-PlayStation-5/dp/B0D2FGZ3HF/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview-medieval-rpg-1851626849&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0D2FGZ3HF" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmVfoOcD78C&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmVfoOcD78C" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span></p><p>.&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmVfoOcD78C&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmVfoOcD78C" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">&nbsp;</a></span><br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Random events across three huge maps (available in the Alpha) will keep players on their toes, while player-versus-environment-focused missions can be completed for valuable loot.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->
