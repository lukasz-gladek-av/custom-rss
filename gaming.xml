Those interested in purchasing the DLC can obtain it for $9.99. The DLC features a brand-new storyline for players to explore, new dungeons, the Warden Archetype, and a Boss Rush game mode. This is the third and final DLC to be launched for Remnant II, and for those who are curious about the game, both the Standard and Ultimate editions are <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1282100/REMNANT_II/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">currently 50% off</a>, with the DLC bundle being 25% off for a limited time across all platforms.</p>

<p><iframe title="Remnant 2 - Dark Horizon DLC &amp; Boss Rush Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oHWAlJ3J3LQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The new Boss Rush mode will be added to Remnant II as a free major content update. It is available now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. In this DLC, players will return to N'Erud and uncover a new location that has been preserved in time, where there are alien farmlands that are cared for by robots, as the previous inhabitants are long dead. However, rogue AI and robots are threatening while Travelers search for the secrets of the entity that dominates the skyline. In this storyline, players need to work to uncover the secrets hidden within N'Erud, where players will get to explore new dungeons, as well as a glider traversal system that isn't found in any of the other worlds. In addition, there will be new powerful gear to obtain, as well as "The Warden" archetype.</p>
<p>The Warden is all about enhancing your playstyle, and is accompanied by The Drone, which can shield, heal and attack enemies.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fHz22PggehA" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> A trailer</a> has been released explaining the new archetype in detail.</p>
<p>Regarding the Boss Rush update, players will be able to choose whether to play the mode by themselves, or alongside fellow Travelers via multiplayer, where they can choose from three different difficulty options. It includes a three-boss run, a seven-boss run, and a nineteen-boss run, and the game mode can be accessed by heading to the World Stone in Ward 13.</p>
<p>Alongside the Boss Rush update, there are new quality-of-life improvements, as well as a new system called Prisms. This feature rebalances the fragment system, and can add additional levels to give you stat bonuses as you explore the worlds of Remnant II.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-explains-why-zelda-is-echoes-of-wisdoms-main-character.990282/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-protagonist<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has explained why Princess Zelda is the protagonist of the upcoming&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>, and it turns out that she wasn't always intended to be the star of the game.</p>
<p>In the latest&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> Ask the Developer interview, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-dungeon-maker">follows on from yesterday's</a>, producer Eiji Aonuma sits down alongside directors Tomomi Sano and Satoshi Terada to answer more questions about the upcoming top-down action-adventure game.</p>
<p>Aonuma says that initially, the team planned Link to be&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>'s protagonist, but given the "copy-and-paste" gameplay style, the developers quickly found that Link's sword and shield "got in the way".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-protagonist-fighting.jpg?itok=EVto1fM4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-protagonist-fighting.jpg?itok=sjN7fRR5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>had to star Zelda for a very specific reason.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Aonuma, the team realized that "if you have a sword and shield, you can just fight using those", and that there would be no need for the echo system if Link simply had weapons.</p>
<p>Terada then chips in to say that the team originally considered having Link only be able to use echoes to begin with and unlocking the sword and shield later, but then they realized that "once [players] got the sword and shield, they would stop using echoes".</p>
<p>This led to a realization that the protagonist of&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>would need to be a character that didn't fight with a sword and shield, which is where Zelda comes in.</p>
<p>Aonuma says that he and the&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>team have been asked many times over the years whether Zelda would be the protagonist of her own story, and when he saw the team "struggling to identify"&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>'s ideal protagonist, he realized it would be "exactly the game" for Zelda.</p>

<p>Later in the interview, Aonuma says that he and the team "had no intention of establishing any new theories" in&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>lore with&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, so don't expect any earth-shattering timeline revelations.</p>
<p>It's well worth reading <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-13-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-part-3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the full conversation</a> with Aonuma, Sano, and Terada, especially if you're a&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>fan, as it's got some very enlightening tidbits of information regarding&nbsp;<em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>'s development and the series as a whole.</p>
<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom&nbsp;</em>launches exclusively for Nintendo Switch on September 26th. Check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-preview-brilliant-creative-player-freedom">our preview of the game here</a> to find out whether we think its more creative and freeform approach will pay off.</p>

In addition, the company <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/24/xbox-cipher-series-transparent-controller-design-lab/">announced</a> new chromatic options for the D-pads and paddles. Prices start at $149.99 for a custom design, but you’ll pay extra for some options.</p><p>The new translucent faceplate options are white (Ghost Cipher), green (Velocity Cipher), purple (Astral Cipher), blue (Surf Cipher), pink (Candy Cipher), and red (Pulse Cipher) options. Meanwhile, you can choose Energy Chroma and Sunset Chroma for the paddles and D-pad. </p><p>Microsoft also released a new standalone <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.xbox.com%2Fen-US%2Faccessories%2Fcontrollers%2Fghost-cipher-special-edition">Ghost Cipher edition</a> of the standard Xbox Wireless Controller that’s much more transparent than the Elite options (the Elite rubberized grips keep the translucence from extending past the faceplate). It’ll set you back $69.99 when it arrives on October 8th, and preorders begin today.

I particularly like the challenge of making something as garish as possible, so I’d end up creating something like the below images if I could bring myself to pay for it.

Annoying, but makes sense. However, in this case, Sony is asking PC players who already have a Steam account to create a separate account on a different video game service just so they can play by themselves. That’s silly. And I expect players will continue to mod these odd single-player PSN requirements out of any future PS5 and PS4 ports that arrive on Steam. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[N0tail On The Esports Industry: ‘Games Are Not Going Anywhere’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/notail-esi-lisbon-esports-industry/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/n0tail-on-the-esports-industry-%E2%80%98games-are-not-going-anywhere%E2%80%99.990261/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/notail-esi-lisbon-esports-industry/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Johan ‘N0tail’ Sundstein has done it all. He’s the highest-earning esports player of all time, he has secured some of the most prolific trophies in competitive gaming, and he contributed to the foundation of both OG Esports and Team Secret. He was named in Forbes’ 30 Under 30 and started competing at just fifteen years of age.</p>



<p>Sundstein took to the stage at ESI Lisbon to appear in a ‘fireside chat’, clueing the audience in about his experiences with the esports industry and how he thinks everything is going, given recent struggles.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-stabilising">‘It’s Stabilising’</h2>



<p>Johan Sundstein is perhaps one of the best-placed individuals to talk about the esports industry. He has been there since the sudden uptick took place that saw millions of fans pulled into the esports ecosystem, and he has contributed more to the industry than almost every other personality in the space.</p>



<p>Speaking at ESI Lisbon, Sundstein said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Where we’re at now, I think when esports went really high up a lot of investments were made, but I will also say that probably a lot of money was burnt. And now, I think it’s stabilising a bit. It went down, COVID happened to everyone, but I think we’re seeing a lot of interest from different regions in the world that are also ready to invest.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The esports industry has wavered in recent years in terms of financial struggles, viewership, and the need for organisations to diversify as much as possible just to make ends meet. There are a few outliers standing firm against that line of thinking, though. For instance, last year’s League of Legends World Championship event broke peak records, pulling in more than six million concurrent viewers.</p>



<p>N0tail remains optimistic – and more importantly, <strong>realistic</strong>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think games are not going anywhere. For as long as humans have been around, we’ve been practising sports and games in different shapes and forms. As long as we are around, I think people will continue to make games and those games will only continue to get better.</p>



<p>I think the future is electronic, mostly. I don’t think sports is going anywhere, like it’s not going to die off, but I do think that the majority of our new games will be digital and electronic.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sundstein remarked that ‘we’re all in the same boat’, speaking about fans, spectators, organisers, and even team leaders and founders like himself. He said, ‘We’re all the same people in the same boat trying to enjoy the same thing together.’ </p>

                <p>Microsoft is leveraging the aesthetic power of the 2000s for its newly announced Xbox Ghost Cipher wireless controller. While the internals remain the same, externally is where this controller shines, as it sports a transparent clear design, silver interior, metallic features, and more. This will be available starting October 8, and it's priced at $70 through the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/accessories/controllers/ghost-cipher-special-edition" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Store</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4371831-xbox-ghost-cipher.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4371831" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4371831-xbox-ghost-cipher.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4371831"></a><figcaption>Xbox Ghost Cipher controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4371831-xbox-ghost-cipher.jpg"></figure><p>This isn't the first time that Microsoft has released a transparent Xbox controller--the Xbox 20th-anniversary controller combined a darker transparent shell with green highlights and the <em>very blue </em><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Wireless-Controller-Special-Windows-Devices/dp/B09Z7J4L6X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="nofollow ">Sky Cipher released earlier this year</a>--but this design does allow you to get a really good look at what's inside of the peripheral. The clear transparent top case is complemented by metallic and silver interior parts that shine through from the inside, while the bronze metallic triggers, matching D-pad, and ash grey rubberized grips add some elegant finishing touches.</p><p>Beyond that, this is the same Xbox controller that was introduced four years ago. It's still a reliable jack-of-all-trades device, as it has a robust construction, durable face buttons, and a useful share button. These work not only on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One consoles but also wirelessly on PC and smartphones via a Bluetooth connection. While it may not be as advanced as Sony's DualSense controller, this is still a comfortable device to use for long gaming stretches. It also has an excellent battery life, and you can choose to use regular AA batteries or a rechargeable battery pack.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4371835-xbox-cipher-series.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4371835" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4371835-xbox-cipher-series.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4371835"></a><figcaption>Xbox Controller Cipher series</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4371835-xbox-cipher-series.jpg"></figure><p>Over at the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/24/xbox-cipher-series-transparent-controller-design-lab/xboxdesignlab.xbox.com" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Design Lab</a>, you can also create your own custom transparent Elite Series 2 controller. This is a nostalgic collection inspired by '90s and 2000s technology, and there are several retro-modern designs to choose from in the expanded Cipher series: Velocity, Astral, Surf, Candy, and Purple Cipher.</p><p>In addition to the Cipher Series, there are also two new chromatic D-pad and paddle designs--Energy Chroma and Sunset Chroma--that add even more colors to the controllers.</p>

                <p>Developer Shift Up and publisher Sony are being sued by a film production company in Louisiana called Stellarblade over the name of the PlayStation exclusive Stellar Blade.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellarblade-trademark-lawsuit-sony-shift-up" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Stellarblade and its owner, Griffith Chambers Mehaffey, are suing Shift Up and Sony, both for damages and to prevent the name from being used further. This includes asking that they both stop using the Stellar Blade name or any similar names, as well as handing over all materials in their possession with the name "Stellar Blade" so that they can be destroyed.</p><p>In the lawsuit, Mehaffey claimed that he has owned the <a href="https://www.stellarblade.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">stellarblade.com</a> domain name since 2006 and that the company started in 2010. Shift Up registered the name Stellar Blade as a video-game-related trademark in January 2023, while Mehafffey registered his own for Stellarblade in June. A month later, he then claimed to sent a cease-and-desist letter to Shift Up.</p><p>Mehaffey also claimed that when customers look for Stellarblade on the internet, information about Stellar Blade now completely overtakes search results. Furthermore, he alleged that the "S" styling Stellar Blade's logo looks too similar to his own Stellarblade's.</p><p>"Mr. Mehaffey registered the stellarblade.com domain in 2006 and has used the STELLARBLADE name for his business for nearly 15 years. Given this long-standing and public use, it's difficult to imagine that Shift Up and Sony were unaware of Mr. Mehaffey's established rights before adopting their identical mark," Mehaffey's lawyer said in a statement to IGN.</p><p>They continued, "We believe in fair competition, but when larger companies disregard the established rights of smaller businesses, it's our responsibility to stand up and protect our brand. The defendants’ far superior resources have effectively monopolized online search results for STELLARBLADE, pushing Mr. Mehaffey's long-established business into digital obscurity and threatening the livelihood he's built over more than a decade."</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/stellar-blade-review-nier-as-it-can-get/1900-6418215/" data-ref-id="1900-6418215">Stellar Blade review,</a> we said, "A strong battle system and exciting moments make Stellar Blade more than just an imitator."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/breaking-down-gta-v-s-pedestrian-dialogue-system-an-analysis-with-speculative-examples<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content" data-testid="featured-image"><p>GTA V's pedestrian dialogue system fills out the game's soundscape.<span>Rockstar Games</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What is Ambient &amp; Pedestrian Dialogue?">What is Ambient &amp; Pedestrian Dialogue?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For massive AAA games like the Grand Theft Auto series or Cyberpunk 2077, it’s not enough to only write dialogue for player-facing events, like quests, cutscenes, and ally conversations. To make a game world at this scale feel “alive”, NPC’s must be conversing amongst themselves without the player’s involvement, giving them a sense of independent agency. The best way to convey this agency? Incorporate ambient dialogue.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ambient, or pedestrian, dialogue can be broadly defined as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>dialogue that plays without direct player input from the general NPC population</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Standard dialogue in a game is player-initiated, i.e. a player walks up to an NPC, presses a button prompt, and starts conversing with that character. Ambient dialogue, instead, occurs autonomously, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pzHYESXYf4g">regardless of the player’s presence</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How Does GTA V Implement Ambient Dialogue?">How Does GTA V Implement Ambient Dialogue?</h2><p>The ambient dialogue system uses a number of subsystems working in tandem, like NPC spawn zones. Source: Rockstar Games</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Note: this is an educated inference on how Grand Theft Auto V structures their pedestrian dialogue system. This is not meant to be a definitive, wholly accurate summary.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As mentioned earlier, colossal-sized games like Grand Theft Auto V relies on using pedestrian dialogue to fill out the game’s soundscape and make Los Santos feel like a real metropolis. GTA V would feel significantly more empty without NPC’s, for example, asking for help feeding their 57 cats. These small, passing one-offs from the pedestrian population are an often overlooked, but critical part of the game’s interactivity.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="NPC Spawn Zones">NPC Spawn Zones</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A core part of how GTA V’s ambient dialogue system works relies on a connected, underlying mechanism: the NPC spawn system. Different NPC’s have a higher likelihood of spawning in certain sections of Los Santos than others, such as businessmen NPC’s primarily appearing around Rockford Hills, or country bumpkins spawning mainly in Grapeseed and Blaine County.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="NPC Archetypes">NPC Archetypes</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To conserve resources during production, Rockstar chose not to create individual dialogue pools per NPC, but rather created “archetypes” of NPC’s. Forest rangers, muscleheads, wannabe celebrities, Rockstar formulated several roles like these and created </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJcwuD5DEdU">dialogue corresponding to their stereotype</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, then recorded male and female voiceover for each.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="“General Purpose” Dialogue">“General Purpose” Dialogue</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To stretch the use of these character archetypes further, Rockstar made the decision to not incorporate any location-specific voice lines in its pedestrian dialogue system. While this may make some ambient remarks from passerby NPC’s feel plain, this decision helped to simplify the archetype logic by not having to create location-based variations for each role (ex. having one generic rich person NPC vs. having specific ones for Vinewood, Rockford Hills, Vespucci, etc.).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This methodology also applies to characters conversing with one another. When an NPC is being talked to by another NPC, they will typically respond with a very brief (often disjunct) line, which ends the conversation (“What?”, “Who cares!”, “Unbelievable!”, etc.). Like before, this is to get the maximum amount of use from each recorded line, and helps to simplify the system logic running these random NPC dialogue events.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Dialogue Pools">Dialogue Pools</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Regardless of what archetype an NPC is, or where they spawned, each of them has a set “pool” of voice lines to pull from. For instance, every NPC has at least one or two lines to react to the player getting too close to them, aiming a gun at them, hitting their car, and more. This not only simplifies the writers’ jobs by giving them a “checklist” of lines to write for each archetype, but also ensures that any NPC can properly interact with the player, while also having a healthy pool of ambient lines to say while walking around Los Santos.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Put It All Together">Put It All Together</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With all these systems in mind, the basis of Grand Theft Auto V’s NPC system can be inferred. When the game spawns an NPC, the following steps (not necessarily in order) are executed:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">1.) What archetype is this NPC?</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Depending on the spawn zone the player is currently in, certain types of NPC’s will be much more likely to spawn then others.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">2.) What are the general characteristics of this NPC?</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The archetype selected may limit the range of possible characteristics. For example, if the archetype is LSPD Cop, then “Elderly” would not be one of the possible characteristics.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">3.) Find the dialogue pool asset that matches the selected characteristics and archetype. This can be boiled down to indexing a specific folder using each attribute selected (ex. index the audio asset folder path named “Cop_Male_White_Young”).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ssoVhPB162g">4.)

My goal for the future is similar: recreate Rockstar’s pedestrian dialogue system within an Unreal sample project, as a way of delving further into its mechanics on a programmatic level. This will necessarily entail a few other subsystems, like a randomize NPC spawner, NPC AI BehaviorTrees for routes and player reactions, and more. However, I believe this will be a fun, informative challenge, and something that I (or others, once released to GitHub) could plug into their full-fledged projects.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://randenbanuelosdev.wixsite.com/home">https://randenbanuelosdev.wixsite.com/home</a></span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>What are you doing tonight at 11pm UK time? That's right, watching Sony's latest PlayStation State of Play broadcast right here with us. We'll keep you up to date with everything that happens in a blow by blow account, and we would love to have you chat along with us as you watch the stream and tell us what you think.</p>
<p>The show begins at 11pm UK time (3pm PT) and is embedded below, and it runs for around half an hour, so it's blessedly brief. Despite that, Sony has promised to pack in more than 20 upcoming PS5 and PSVR2 games, some of them new, some of them getting updates.</p>
<p>What do we expect? Well, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-announced-via-playstation-listing">the Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1 &amp; 2 remaster because it leaked ahead of the show</a>. But also probably the Until Dawn remake, and probably the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake, after it was confirmed as a PlayStation exclusive the other day. And maybe the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> remaster, and maybe a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> remaster. Yes, we live in a world where remasters and remakes rule (give us Bloodborne you cowards!).</p>
<p>The newly unveiled PS5 Pro will also feature, in all its exorbitant expensiveness, as will myriad announcements of game-enhancements for it. Pre-orders for it open on Thursday 26th September, remember.</p>
<p>The question is, what would you like to see?</p>
<p>See you later on.</p><figure>

Short and sweet: that's how I like my State of Play broadcasts, and that's apparently what we're going to get. Is that enough room for Kojima? Will Geoff Keighley be there somehow? And can anyone afford the PS5 Pro yet? We'll have to wait and see!

            <p>Microsoft is continuing on with its mission to provide us with as many different Xbox controller variants it can.</p>
<p>Today, the company debuted the Ghost Cipher Special Edition Xbox Wireless Controller, which features grey and bronze accents with a clear top case so you can see the controller's inner workings (see header image above)</p>
<p>The Ghost Cipher Special Edition Xbox Wireless Controller will be available from next month, on 8th October, retailing at £64.99. If you are interested in purchasing one for yourself, you can <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/accessories/controllers/ghost-cipher-special-edition">pre-order</a> the controller now.</p>

<p>In addition, Microsoft has also revealed some transparent Cipher Series top cases, along with some chromatic D-pad and paddles, for its Elite Series 2 controllers. These are available via <a href="https://xboxdesignlab.xbox.com/en-gb/configure/xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2">Xbox Design Lab</a>.</p>
<p>The top cases are inspired by the "translucent tech of the '90s and early 2000s", which reminds me I once had a transparent inflatable chair that I would stick to uncomfortably but insisted was the best piece of furniture ever whenever my parents gave me a questioning look.</p>
<p>But, I digress! Back to the controller news. "These vibrant, candy-coloured top cases encapsulate the controller’s metallic frame, showcasing both its external beauty and the advanced engineering within the Elite Series 2 controller," a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/24/xbox-cipher-series-transparent-controller-design-lab/">blog post</a> accompanying today's controller announcement reads.</p>
<p>There are six case colours to choose from: Ghost Cipher (colourless), Velocity Cipher (green), Astral Cipher (purple), Surf Cipher (blue), Candy Cipher (pink) and Pulse Cipher (red).</p>
<p>As for those chromatic D-pad and paddle designs, these are called Energy Chroma and Sunset Chroma, and promise a "dynamic spectrum" of colour.</p>

<p>"These metallic finishes blend hues to create a hypnotic gradient that shifts depending on the angle, adding a sci-fi, jewellery-like feel to your controller," Microsoft said. "Energy Chroma starts with the signature Xbox green and fades into blues, yellows, and magenta accents, while Sunset Chroma evokes a warm, summery glow with its transition from yellow to bright pink."</p>
<p>You can check out how these controller design options look via the video above.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in Microsoft news, the company recently shared an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-green-initiatives-for-xbox-have-saved-over-3bn-car-miles-of-co2-emissions">update on its sustainability efforts on Xbox from the past three years</a>. In that time, the company has reduced its emissions by over 3bn car miles - that's over 1.2m metric tons of CO2e.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/newzoos-august-2024-report-reveals-black-myth-wukong-top-grossing-game-across-six-markets/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://newzoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newzoo's</a> financial report for August 2024 is out, discussing the engagement and revenue rankings for the month. Many of the statistics aren't too surprising, with Black Myth: Wukong dominating the market. Although Black Myth: Wukong was incredibly popular and performed well in revenue, it didn't quite hit the mark regarding MAU (Monthly Active Users) rankings. Despite not performing well in the MAU rankings, it remained first in August and was the top-grossing game in six markets. This was a huge achievement for Game Science, the game developer, as they had only worked on mobile titles previously. The game was #1 on PC and #3 on PlayStation.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, Fortnite had the most Monthly Active Users and continued to dominate on that front. However, some other games jumped up the leaderboard significantly, even if it wasn't in the top spot. Fall Guys, Diablo IV, and World of Warcraft jumped up the rankings significantly, as Fall Guys got two new DLCs in July (Carbon Night and Hotdog Fusion), which helped increase the player count. Diablo IV received a 40% discount on Steam, which helped boost the game while experiencing consistent PC engagement drops.</p>
<p>World of Warcraft also saw a huge increase in player count, as the highly anticipated expansion <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-better-than-ever/">The War Within</a> was released on August 26. This helped boost the game seven spots on the list and put it into the 20th position.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/valorant-lands-on-consoles-soon-no-pc-crossplay-but-theres-cross-progression/">VALORANT finally made it to console</a> after being exclusively on PC for four years. The game dropped from #1 to #3 on PC by total revenue, with Black Myth: Wukong taking the top spot. However, VALORANT's engagement went up drastically with the ability to play the game and get cross-progression, and only time will tell whether the game will be a strong contender on console the same way it is on PC.</p>
<p>When looking at all markets and all MAU combined, not a single Nintendo Switch game made it into the top spots. Considering the lack of releases in August, this isn't too surprising. They may emerge victorious by the end of next month's report, as The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is due for release, a highly anticipated game for <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-q1-2025-report-reveals-sales-down-by-46-5/">the company</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, when it comes to sports games, it was a big summer for American football titles. EA Sports College Football 25 was released on July 19 and remains a mainstay on the charts, being in #4 on PlayStation and #3 on Xbox. EA Sports Madden NFL 25 was released on August 16 and is #2 on PlayStation and #1 on Xbox, and they are both continuing to maintain their high rankings on the charts. However, the releases of EA Sports FC 25 and NBA 2K25 are fast approaching, and it may see them knocked off the top spots.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dont-nod-ices-projects-as-jusant-and-banishers-underperform.990186/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-financials-first-half-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Life Is Strange&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden&nbsp;</em>developer Don't Nod has released its financial summary for the first half of 2024, and it paints a pretty gloomy picture for the French studio.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases?ID=ACTUS-0-87839" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release summarizing the studio's year so far</a>, Don't Nod says its revenue has declined 11% when compared to the same period last year, citing the performance of 2024 releases&nbsp;<em>Jusant&nbsp;</em>and the aforementioned&nbsp;<em>Banishers</em>, which the studio says "performed well below expectations".</p>
<p>Don't Nod says that an increase in sales over last year is "mainly driven by the back catalog", citing&nbsp;<em>Vampyr&nbsp;</em>and the license for&nbsp;<em>Life Is Strange&nbsp;</em>in particular, so <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/team17-financials-first-half-2024">just like Team17</a>, Don't Nod isn't having much luck with newer releases.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dont-nod-banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden.jpg?itok=WtWPMykv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dont-nod-banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden.jpg?itok=bY_MFgY0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't Nod's 2024 releases have underperformed so far.</figcaption></figure><p>The studio also says that its revenues won't cover its operating expenses, which means it expects to post a loss of around&nbsp;€1 million for the first half of the year.</p>
<p>In response to its disappointing financial performance, Don't Nod says it's focusing its efforts on the games "offering the highest potential return on investment in the short (and medium) term".</p>
<p>To wit, this involves seeking "discussions" with "industry leaders to secure economic benefits" for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-delay">the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em></a>, which will serve as the debut project for Don't Nod's Montreal studio.</p>
<p>One of Don't Nod's projects, codenamed P10, is being scrapped, while two projects currently in the design phase at the Paris studio are being "temporarily paus[ed]", although they're seemingly not being canceled altogether.</p>

                <p>The parents of Parkland school shooting victim Joaquin Oliver have released a video game, The Final Exam, with the goal of raising awareness and ultimately enacting legislative changes regarding gun control. Manuel "Manny" Oliver and Patricia Oliver lost their 17-year-old son in the February 2018 shooting, which left 14 students and three staff members dead, and another 17 injured. It remains the deadliest high-school shooting in US history.</p><p>The Final Exam sees players step into the shoes of a student navigating an active-shooter situation. Players have 10 minutes to escape the building--a reference to the fact that the average school shooting lasts 10 minutes--but must also collect pieces of gun-control legislation hidden around the school.</p><p>"These halls represent the real-life horrors of hundreds of schools that have suffered mass shootings--places that were promised to be safe for children but were failed by our government," reads a portion of <a href="https://www.thefinalexam.us/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the game's official website</a>. "In this game and in real life, gun-control bills are the key to survival. By surviving the game and collecting all the bills, you can demand change and help save thousands of lives in the real world."</p><p>The gun-control bills featured in the game include a ban on assault weapons, mandated safe storage of firearms (also known as Ethan's Law), a ban of high-capacity magazines, mandated background checks for all firearms purchases, and a bill proposing the minimum age to purchase a firearm be raised from 18 years old to 21 years old.</p><p>The game also takes issue with certain politicians' tendency to blame mass shootings on violence in video games. It isn't violent games that make the Olivers fear for students around the country, but the sheer ease with which Americans can obtain deadly weapons with a high rate of fire--regardless of whether they're mentally or emotionally capable of handling those weapons in a safe manner.</p><p>"The clock starts now," the game's site continues. "Let's pressure politicians to do the right thing: Stop blaming games and start taking meaningful action against gun violence."</p><p>The Final Exam is <a href="https://www.thefinalexam.us/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available for free via its website</a>, where players can also donate to non-profits that support for gun reform.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/god-of-war-ragnarok-psn-requirement-modded-out/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sony’s latest PC game release, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarok</a>, has been in the spotlight for its requirement that players have an attached PSN account, and the PlayStation overlay that is imposes on the game. Now a mod has been released to remove the PSN overlay and bypass linking Steam and PSN accounts.</p>
<p>The mod – simply called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/godofwarragnarok/mods/22?tab=description">NoPSSDK</a> – removes the PSN overlay and makes it so it cannot request account linking. While it works to remove it currently, it’s not clear if Sony can reengineer the overlay in future, and is probably some kind of EULA breach… though since nobody reads those, it’s impossible to know. This also won’t enable gamers from regions not supported by PSN to play, with Sony restricting sales of the game within those countries, just as is now the case with Helldivers 2.</p>


<p>The PSN requirement has been coming for Sony’s games since earlier this year, first featured in Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut, very briefly with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/03/concord-is-shutting-down-this-week-refunds-being-issued-while-they-explore-options/">Concord</a>, and was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/06/sony-backtracks-on-helldivers-2-pc-psn-requirement-may-6th-update-cancelled/">announced for (and then pulled) from Helldivers 2</a>. All of these games have one thing in common: cross-platform multiplayer.</p>
<p>God of War Ragnarok does not have multiplayer in any form, and people have taken to airing their grievances over the imposition by Sony to the reviews section on Steam. The main addition that it brings in this case is the ability to earn PlayStation trophies while playing on PC.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there are instances where the overlay has interfered with the game’s running, whether that’s blocking people from accessing the game because linking had a server error, or with other complaints including crashes and visual bugs, which could be unrelated. At the same time, the mod itself isn’t a guaranteed success, and some report that it doesn’t work.</p>

<p>Expect there to be some back and forth between Sony’s engineers and the modding community, not just for God of War, but also for future single-player PC releases when they arrive, such as Spider-Man 2.</p>
<p>In our experience, God of War Ragnarok is a fine port of a great PlayStation game. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/23/god-of-war-ragnarok-pc-review/">our hands on report</a>, Miguel said, “I was impressed by how gorgeous it looked and sounded on my desktop, and blown away by how similar the experience was when I brought it over to my Steam Deck. In many ways, the PC releases that Sony puts out of their games feel like the optimal way to experience them. God of War Ragnarok continues that trend.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tekken-8-heihachi-mishima-dlc-release-date-revealed.990153/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-heihachi-mishima-dlc-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>Heihachi Mishima DLC release date, and the Resurrected King himself is arriving early next month (or late this month if you're on Pacific time).</p>
<p>Per a new trailer, Heihachi joins the&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>roster on October 1st for Year 1 Pass holders, and everyone else will be able to play as him on October 4th (again, that's September 30th and October 3rd for Pacific time players).</p>
<p>Heihachi is the third DLC character to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-dlc-heihachi">be announced</a> for&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>since it launched earlier this year. He joins a DLC roster that also includes <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-eddy-gordo-release-date">capoeira legend Eddy Gordo</a> and (fictional) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-lidia-release-date">Polish prime minister Lidia Sobieska</a>, with one more fighter yet to be announced as part of the game's first year of DLC.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tekken-8-heihachi-dlc-release-date-pose.jpg?itok=iLAeINTR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tekken-8-heihachi-dlc-release-date-pose.jpg?itok=Pu7kk_mr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Heihachi joins&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>'s roster very soon.</figcaption></figure><p>As is customary for&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>DLC characters at this point, Bandai Namco has also released a gameplay trailer for Heihachi, showing off the Mishima patriarch's brutal fighting style.</p>
<p>He first goes up against none other than <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-tekken-8-gameplay-trailer-reveals-jin-kazama-in-action">Jin Kazama</a>, suggesting that the two "should try getting along" as "two men back from the dead". Sadly, that doesn't take, and it's not long before Heihachi is taking on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-kazuya-gameplay-trailer-shows-bone-crunching-combos">Kazuya Mishima</a>.</p>
<p>Kazuya demands to know how Heihachi is still alive, in response to which Heihachi expresses amusement that Kazuya "thought some measly lava could kill me". Him and the rest of the world, Heihachi.</p>
<p>As you'd probably expect, Heihachi's trailer concludes with his Rage Art, which consists of an almighty punch delivered to Kazuya while he's in Devil Form. That's got to smart.</p>

<p>Heihachi lands as part of&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>'s first season of DLC characters on October 4th (for most players). One more fighter is also set to arrive as part of this DLC pass, although we don't know who it is yet.</p>
<p><em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1778820/TEKKEN_8/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/tekken-8/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tekken-8/9ppsm14vkclw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

<div><p>Today Titmouse, the animation studio behind productions such as <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8fba9665-9011-4fc8-bf7e-3873de998554" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-vox-machina-season-2-review">The Legend of Vox Machina</a> </em>and Netflix's<em> Big Mouth</em>, have announced that they're taking a step into Tabletop Gaming with the announcement of <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/call_to_action/d2f63040-d2c6-4d61-8703-a5e83c7c3d21/landing"><em>Drunkards, Druggies, &amp; Delinquents</em></a>. This game will begin crowdfunding on October 8th via Backerkit with an expectation to have the game in player's hands by Spring 2025. This delivery date is expected to be just in time for Titmouse's 25th anniversary.</p>
<p>Titmouse explains that <em>Drunkards, Druggies, &amp; Delinquents</em> will put players in the shoes of rebellions adventurers "fueled by their drink or substance of choice, and navigate a world where chaos reigns supreme." As you might expect from the shows that Titmouse works on there is an intension for the game to be absurd and to challenge player's creativity. While there isn't much about rules shared it is mentioned that as players take damage playing <em>Drunkards, Druggies, &amp; Delinquents</em> they're encouraged to drunk, smoke, or partake in their favorite vice.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;We designed <em>Drunkards, Druggies, &amp; Delinquents</em> to bring people together in the best possible way, &nbsp;through shared chaos, a few drinks (or more), and laughter, we invite you to open your mind, imbibe, and let the dice be your guide to new realms of absurdity!"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once revealed the campaign will include exclusive rewards for early backers including limited-edition content, bonus materials, and a look into what it took to create this game.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dont-nod-pause-projects-fail/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/don%E2%80%99t-nod-puts-projects-on-hold-as-jusant-and-banishers-fail-to-sell.990144/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dont-nod-pause-projects-fail/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Don’t Nod has published a relatively shaky financial update for H1 2024, revealing some critical issues. It was stressed that Jusant and Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden failed to hit the mark, underperforming against expectations by a considerable amount. With that in mind (and in the open), Don’t Nod has announced the ‘temporary pause’ of two projects that were being fleshed out at the studio.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-going-down">Going Down</h2>



<p>Don’t Nod’s financial update revealed an 11% decline in operating revenues year-on-year. In recent months, the studio has released two titles, neither of which failed to secure the sales that were projected, drawing disappointment from the firm’s leadership team.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases?ID=ACTUS-0-87839#:~:text=For%20the%20first%20half%20of,16.5%20million%20in%20H1%202023." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In a statement</a>, Oskar Guilbert, the CEO, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>We are obviously disappointed by our recent performance in an extremely competitive and selective market. Despite an excellent critical reception, Jusant and Banishers: Ghosts of new Eden unfortunately did not achieve the commercial results we had hoped for, resulting in a deterioration in our 2024 half-year results and leading us to consider all possible options regarding our roadmap.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The ‘possible option’ that the studio has settled on is to temporarily suspend ‘two production lines’. It was noted in the financial report that even this has incurred a sizeable cost.</p>



<p>It was pointed out that most of the studio’s sales came from back catalogue titles such as Vampyr and Life is Strange. The latter franchise was likely boosted following the recent reveal of Life is Strange: Double Exposure and the imminent release of Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage, a similar game based on an emotional choice-and-consequence model.</p>



<p>It’s worth mentioning that Life is Strange: Double Exposure isn’t being developed or published by Don’t Nod, but the earlier iterations of the franchise were.</p>



<p>Toward the end of the financial update, it was highlighted that two projects, designated as ‘P10 and P14’ are due to be released before the end of 2027. </p>

                <p dir="ltr">Zelda is off on her own adventure for the first time ever (there definitely weren't any games starring her on CDi) in The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, and the princess has Link's sword and shield to thank. Nintendo has revealed that his weapon combo "got in the way" of the Switch game's defining feature: copying and pasting items to solve puzzles and fight enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">A new <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-13-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-part-3/?utm_source=SW-AAA&amp;utm_medium=sotwnoa&amp;utm_campaign=N1141-01&amp;utm_id=N1141-01" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ask the Developer volume</a> touched on how Link's sword and shield just didn't gel with using echoes to fight foes. Series producer Eiji Aonuma stated the "the sword and shield got in the way." That's because they seemed more effective than copying and pasting other items. As such, this led to an opportunity for Zelda to get her first starring role in Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom.</p><p dir="ltr">"If that's the case, it must be someone who doesn't fight with a sword and shield, right? Who in the series would be a good fit for these powers and bring their insight to them? Well, that would have to be Princess Zelda," said Aonuma.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="2134932537" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

			<p>The rumored Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1-2 Remastered collection is real, and it is launching in just a few months, according to new <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/legacy-of-kain%E2%84%A2-soul-reaver-1-2-remastered-leaked-via-psn-december-10-2024.989865/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">information discovered on the PlayStation Store today.</a></p>
<p>The collection, which will be released to celebrate the Soul Reaver's 25th anniversary, is being developed by Aspyr Media and will allow players to experience the epic conflict between Raziel and Kain in its original form or with remastered graphics, which are showcased in a brand new set of screenshots. A trailer can also be watched <a href="https://vulcan.dl.playstation.net/img/rnd/202409/1119/453cd3c1f95ee30050e6f6c3935f8c091da1337fe28aaed0.mp4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>

<p>While the official announcement, which is likely to be made in a few hours during the PlayStation State of Play presentation, is rather welcome, it is hardly surprising, as Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1-2 Remastered was revealed back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/legacy-of-kain-soul-reaver-i-ii-remastered/">July</a> by two statues depicting Raziel and Kain that were on display during San Diego Comic-con with the unannounced remasters branding. Hopefully, the remasters will prove to be successful enough to spur the development of a new entry in the series. Following the release of Legacy of Kain: Defiance, the series has been pretty much dead, not counting the multiplayer game Nosgoth which never saw the light of day after multiple rounds of testing.</p>
<p>Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver 1-2 Remastered launches on December 10th. Platforms beside PlayStation consoles have yet to be confirmed.</p>
