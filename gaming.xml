            <p>
A new year means a new Call of Duty, meaning Activision Blizzard is going to have to get around to unveiling it at some point. Reports are suggesting that 'some point' will almost certainly be during Microsoft's Xbox showcase this June, but before then, the first teaser has seemingly now been spotted in an unassuming corner of the internet.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, a likely new Call of Duty 2024 teaser site has emerged (thanks <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1793301871429382299">Charlie Intel</a>) at <a href="https://thetruthlies.com/1/">TheTruthLies.com</a>, where visitors are able to fiddle with some buttons on a TV set and watch a quick blast of mysterious footage.
</p>
<p>
Currently, only one of the TV's six channels shows footage when selected, and there's no explicit Call of Duty branding to definitively confirm the connection - but it's an easy enough leap to make given the distinctive orange logo that appears in various places around the site.
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>TheTruthLies.com's first bit of mysterious footage.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mXJ3S3bLL4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Starting with the footage, though, it's a short jigglycam sequence - more The Blair Witch Project than Call of Duty, to be honest - that features a group of (gasp) activists scurrying through the woods at night. "This'll wake them up", somone says at one point, and we eventually see the results of their scheming when the footage cuts to daylight - revealing Mount Rushmore's four presidential faces now festooned with blindfolds and adorned with the words, "The truth lies".
</p>
<p>
Incidentally, the site's metadata has a longer version of that slogan, reading, "You might remember a better time. But it was false. Trust no one. Open your eyes. Find the truth."
</p>
<p>
It's the big orange logo squirted across Abraham Lincoln's noggin (and used as the site's favicon) that ties things together, of course; it's the same logo - a three headed dog - Microsoft previously used to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-with-mystery-game-direct">tease the mystery Direct event</a> that'll immediately follow its Xbox Games Showcase on Sunday, 9th June. Last year, it was reported Call of Duty 2024 was being developed by Treyarch under the codename Cerebrus, so there's your link.
</p>
<p>
As it turns out, we might know a fair bit about Call of Duty 2024 already. A report last November claimed it would be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-2024-a-black-ops-title-set-in-the-gulf-war-new-report-claims">Black Ops title set in the Gulf War</a> and featuring 'traditional combat technology' - one supposedly attempting "explore a nuanced narrative of the Gulf War, with a critical focus on different participants within the conflict."
</p>
<p>
More details will likely arrive on 9th June, and we can seemingly expect at least five more TheTruthLies.com teases ahead of then. There's no hint of a release date for Call of Duty 2024 yet - beyond claims of a "late fall, early winter" launch - but whenever it shows up, it'll reportedly be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-2024-will-launch-into-xbox-game-pass-microsoft-has-reportedly-decided">day-one title on Game Pass</a>.

            <p>We already know that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-cat-and-mouse-creation-of-hunt-showdown-and-why-there-may-never-be-a-hunt-2">a full-blown sequel</a> to swampy extraction shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crytek-will-never-replace-hunt-showdown-with-hunt-2-the-way-overwatch-2-did-overwatch-1">probably isn’t on the cards right now</a>, but developers Crytek appear to be lining up the next major update for the 2019 PvPvE cryptid-slayer as almost a whole new game regardless.</p>
<!--more-->

<p>The upcoming update due to drop this summer - August 15th specifically, as confirmed in a new developer diary - will bring the half-decade-old FPS over onto the shiny CryEngine 5.11 engine, with all the visual polish, performance improvements and overall whizz-bangery that allows for.  Helping to showcase the new engine will be the first new map and biome in over three years, but we don’t know what that’ll look like or where it’ll be set just yet.</p>
<p>While the underlying gameplay will remain the same, general manager David Fifield said that the update is big enough to be considered “a significant relaunch of Hunt: Showdown at a whole new level”, adding that it will kickstart a “whole new era of Hunt”.</p>
<p>Part of that era, for what it’s worth, will be a fairly literal generation change, as away from PC the engine update means that PlayStation 4 and Xbox One players will no longer receive official support (but will be able to carry over all their stuff to the new version for free when they do upgrade) - which might have at least some knock-on effect for those playing cross-platform on PC.</p>

<p>Looking ahead, Fifield highlighted the new user interface and the systems for recruiting hunters and earning prestige as among those that will “continue to evolve”, with the developers also taking a closer look at hunter revival, health chunks, restorations and the ability to burn downed hunters, as well as aiming to reduce match stalemates in favour of “more definitive fights”.</p>
<p>There’ll also be some separate tweaks behind the scenes to things like matchmaking and servers, joining a step up in efforts to tackle cheaters and other “exploitive play”, aiming to improve the overall multiplayer experience.</p>
<p>Crytek plans to tease out more details in a series of weekly updates between now and August, before the major update lands on the 15th.</p>

  <p id="l2rXdh">“<strong>Outbreak Refined</strong>” is a bonus quest in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough"><em>Destiny 2</em></a>’s reprised “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/24155578/zero-hour-walkthrough-outbreak-perfected-exotic-pattern">Zero Hour</a>” mission, which will allow you to unlock new perks for you to further customize your<strong> Outbreak Perfected</strong> Exotic Pulse rifle. To get these new perks, you’ll need to flip some hidden <strong>switches</strong> in the legend version of the mission each week. You can pick up “Outbreak Refined” from Ada-1 after you’ve completed “Zero Hour” for her once before.</p>
<p id="8fGt4X">In this <em>Destiny 2</em> guide, we’ll walk you through how to complete the legend version of “Zero Hour” and finish the “Outbreak Refined” quest. If you need to upgrade the Intrinsic perk for Outbreak Perfected and pick up the new Vimana Junker Exotic ship, check out our guide on the “Zero Hour” <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23925011">vault puzzle</a>.</p>
<p id="4UJqjH"><strong>Note</strong>: Only two of the three Outbreak Refined quests are available at the time of this writing. The final quest will become available on May 28, and we’ll update this guide to reflect the new switch locations.</p>

<hr id="8gjIbp">
<h2 id="jXpWbl"><strong>How to complete ‘Zero Hour’ on legend</strong></h2>
<p id="nBmNAL">Before I tell you where to find the switches, first you need to know how to complete “Zero Hour” on legend. Unlike “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-guide-walkthrough/24124313/whisper-walkthrough-worm-exotic-pattern">The Whisper</a>” mission, the route you’ll take in “Zero Hour” changes based on the difficulty, so you’ll need to learn a partially different path if you want to complete this quest.</p>
<p id="8sZJGj">Start up “Zero Hour” on legend mode and get ready to run. While the normal version of this mission gives you 40 minutes, on legend you only get 20, and have to fight against more difficult combatants.</p>

<p id="fx79mb">When you land, run forward and break the vent cover near the blue boxes. Go inside. Take a right and drop down the hole. Then go forward and drop down again.</p>
<p id="kfw9i9">You’ll now find yourself on a big, concrete lid, in a room with four other lids, numbered one through four. Ignore them for now and drop down to your left, into the watery drain. There’s a hole toward the bottom that will lead you to a platform. Stand on it and turn around to face where you jumped from. Go into the little pathway here.</p>

<p id="i6uzS3">Now you’ll be in a bit of a pipe maze, and there are switches on the wall for you to throw. These switches correspond to the concrete lids. The lid you need to open is three, and you’ll find the switch for it in the back left of this maze. Run forward, jump up to the scaffolding on your left, and then jump down to the left again, so you land diagonally from where you entered this area. Go down the path and flip the switch. </p>
<p id="6pI6Zt">Return to the concrete lids and climb on top of number three — don’t go in it. Use the lid as a jumping point to climb up the drain. At the top, take a left and head into the open vent on top of the boxes. Follow the path until you get to a big pit. Carefully jump into the cubbies here and kill the Fallen in your way. Jump from doorway to doorway until you can exit on the left side of the room, near the Captain. (If you throw the switch here, you’ll make this room much easier for your friends.)</p>

<p id="ggqoiA">Follow the path until you reach outside the Tower. Take a left and look for the very small footholds along the wall. Climb the pipes and be careful of the small metal platforms, as they’ll collapse after a few seconds of standing on them. Round the corner of the Tower and keep going. Climb up to the open vent and be careful of the exploding shanks inside. </p>
<p id="PYGl5y">Take a right and slide down the chute. Make sure to jump at the end so you don’t fall into the pit. From here, jump into the pipe room on your right and then climb the pipes up to a landing. From there, look left and shoot out the vent. You’ll now be in the fan room, which is where the points converge.</p>
<p id="CqirNw">Follow the normal route here until you reach the Cryptarch’s vault. Now you’ll need to know the secret vault path to stop yourself from being incinerated. Like on normal difficulty, this path changes every day, and is based on the burn for the mission (which you can check by opening your Ghost). </p>

<p id="DB9efC">Once you know your way through legend “Zero Hour,” finding these hidden switches is fairly simple. </p>
<p id="47j8kJ">After you’ve killed enough Fallen with Outbreak Perfected to advance the “<strong>Outbreak Refined 1</strong>” quest, head into legend “Zero Hour” and make your way to the <strong>concrete lids</strong> — the ones labeled one through four. Flip the three switch like normal. But this time, on your way back, stop by the scaffolding in the center of the pipe maze. On the sides of the room, you’ll see what looks like two big air conditioners. Above one of them, you’ll see a switch. Flip it and you’ll get a countdown on your screen that says “<strong>Catalyst Switch Primed</strong>” and then a short countdown.</p>

<p id="iTIETs">Run as fast as you can up to the number three lid and climb all the way to the top. Go through the doorway and turn left. Next to the shelf, you’ll see a switch on the wall. Flip it before your timer hits zero and you’ll finish this part of the quest. If the timer is a little too quick for you, have no fear, as you can do this route backward as well, and it’s actually a bit easier. Simply throw the switch next to the shelf, jump down the hole, and make your way back to the air conditioner switch.</p>
<p id="DmLsy9">Once you’ve successfully thrown the switches, you need to complete “Zero Hour” on legend. If you’ve already wasted too much time on the switches, you can restart the mission and you’ll stay on the same step — no need to do the switch puzzle again.</p>
<p id="vsKoo6">When you finish the mission on legend, you’ll be able to take the quest back to Ada-1, who will give you the <strong>Rapid Hit</strong> perk that you can now use to customize your Outbreak Perfected.</p>

Here’s what I’ve found so far when it comes to shaping Senua into the perfect warrior against the forces of darkness.</p><h2 id="h14233"><a id=""></a>You can put the combat on auto-pilot</h2><p>If you’re just here for the narrative and puzzle solving, you can either radically simplify the combat or put it entirely on auto-pilot, letting Senua do all the attacking and dodging on her own.

Combat in this game is very much about paying attention to each individual opportunity to strike or prevent a strike—especially on the higher difficulties.</p><p>Holding RB/Ctrl will see Senua block attacks. This allows you to withstand most normal blows fairly well, but enemies have a few tricks up their sleeves and can find ways to break Senua’s stance. One example is when an enemy’s weapon glows red before they strike: While you can still block such an attack, it will knock you off balance, leaving you open. <br></p><figure id="" data-id="e83d5fbe9fd3b1dc7b7b2d7833dd17b7" data-recommend-id="image://e83d5fbe9fd3b1dc7b7b2d7833dd17b7" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua parries an enemy's attack and follows it up with a fatal blow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Senua parries an enemy's attack and follows it up with a fatal blow." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e83d5fbe9fd3b1dc7b7b2d7833dd17b7" data-recommend-id="image://e83d5fbe9fd3b1dc7b7b2d7833dd17b7" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua parries an enemy's attack and follows it up with a fatal blow." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>However, if you block mere moments (and by moments, I mean milliseconds; the window to time this is incredibly small) before a strike hits, Senua will instead parry her enemy’s attack, which can leave them open for a fatal finisher from her. This includes the more powerful attacks where an enemy’s weapon glows red.</p><h2 id="h14235"><a id=""></a>Evading is as essential as blocking</h2><p>If you press A/Spacebar, Senua will take a step back. If you move and press A/spacebar, Senua will duck and move in the direction of your analog stick (or WASD input). This is the best way to deal with an enemy’s heavy attack (when their weapon glows red). You can also put some distance between you and a foe by holding back and hitting the evade button/key.</p><h2 id="h14236"><a id=""></a>You can cancel attacks by evading and blocking</h2><p>Canceling attacks is pretty important to the general flow of <em>Hellblade II</em>’s combat. Senua is perhaps most vulnerable while she’s in an attack animation that hasn’t yet landed its blow. Good news: blocking and evading cancels out an attack animation.</p><figure id="" data-id="8be235b257e137e2bbd6ec83db59ac15" data-recommend-id="image://8be235b257e137e2bbd6ec83db59ac15" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua parries an attack from her foe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Senua parries an attack from her foe." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Note how Senua blocks in the middle of a heavy strike, which results in a perfect parry.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8be235b257e137e2bbd6ec83db59ac15" data-recommend-id="image://8be235b257e137e2bbd6ec83db59ac15" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua parries an attack from her foe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This is perhaps most important for heavy attacks. When an enemy is in a block stance (or using a shield), fast attacks won’t do a whole lot. You’ll need to land a heavy attack, the wind-up of which is rather slow. If you’re trying to land a heavy attack but see that an enemy is about to hit you before Senua finishes her attack animation, simply evade with a directional input and a press of A or spacebar and you’ll cancel out the heavy attack. You can also block with RB/Ctrl and cancel out attacks. (It’s hard to know for sure, but I seem to pull off successful parries more often by canceling out an attack with a block, so perhaps the parry window changes during a cancel).</p><p>You can also cancel out fast attacks (X/Left mouse button), but these are usually so swift that you won’t need to worry about it. Still, it’s worth keeping in mind.</p><h2 id="h14237"><a id=""></a>Mash evade to get up or use Focus</h2><p>If an enemy gets the better of you and knocks you to the ground, you have two ways to get back up. You can either mash the evade button (A/spacebar) or activate your Focus ability to get up quicker.</p><h2 id="h14238"><a id=""></a>Evasion is the key to fire-breathers</h2><figure id="" data-id="f3a9d9942d37e779c3fb2a74bd5c59dd" data-recommend-id="image://f3a9d9942d37e779c3fb2a74bd5c59dd" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua dodges an enemy's fire breath attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Senua dodges an enemy's fire breath attack." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f3a9d9942d37e779c3fb2a74bd5c59dd" data-recommend-id="image://f3a9d9942d37e779c3fb2a74bd5c59dd" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua dodges an enemy's fire breath attack." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Fire-breathing enemies are a bit of a pain in <em>Saga</em> as you can’t block flames. Instead, you’ll have to evade their bursts of fire with a directional input + the evade button/key. Fire-breathers attack to their left and right as well as to the front. The latter is the most disorienting as the camera doesn’t make it obvious how to steer clear. In general, moving back with directional input combined with Evade is the best way to avoid the flames.</p><h2 id="h14239"><a id=""></a>You can sprint in combat too</h2><p>If you’re trying to close the distance between Senua and the enemy quickly, sprinting will help. Holding LB or Shift while moving in combat will see Senua sprint forward. If you hit the attack button while sprinting during Senua’s Focus ability (RT/E), Senua will perform a leaping attack.</p><figure id="" data-id="7ae7e717be071c38d2468f690a7b6310" data-recommend-id="image://7ae7e717be071c38d2468f690a7b6310" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua activates her Focus ability and delivers a leaping strike." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Senua activates her Focus ability and delivers a leaping strike." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Focus + Sprint + Attack results in a leaping strike.<br></figcaption><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7ae7e717be071c38d2468f690a7b6310" data-recommend-id="image://7ae7e717be071c38d2468f690a7b6310" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Senua activates her Focus ability and delivers a leaping strike." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h14240"><a id=""></a>Don’t waste Senua’s Focus ability</h2><p>Senua has a focus ability which slows down time and allows her to execute a number of rapid slashes. You’ll charge this ability by attacking, taking damage, and executing perfect parries.</p><p>But Focus isn’t a get-out-of-jail-free card for Senua. It is possible, particularly during the more challenging brawls, to miss your attacks while using this ability and you can also still be struck depending on an enemy’s stance. Also, if you activate it at a distance, make sure you’re sprinting forward to land a leaping attack on your enemy.</p><h2 id="h14241"><a id=""></a><em>Senua’s Saga</em> combat difficulty options explained</h2><p>In Settings &gt; Gameplay &gt; Combat Difficulty, you’ll find four options which you can change at any time (including during fights). Just how Dynamic adjusts the difficulty is hard to discern for certain, but easy, normal, and hard seem to influence how many hits Senua can take before she’s knocked to the ground, where an enemy can easily execute a coup d’état. Based on my research (which I did by allowing the first enemy in the Draugar Fight to attack me), Senua would get sent to her downed state after the following number of attacks: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><strong>Easy</strong>: five strikes<br><strong>Normal</strong>: four strikes<br><strong>Hard</strong>: three strikes</p></blockquote><p>It’s hard to tell exactly how difficulty affects the strength of Senua’s attacks. Without standard HUD elements like health bars and floaty numbers all over the place, we don’t have anything concrete to go on. That said, after running through the “Draugar Battle” a few times on different difficulties, I do feel like Senua’s able to chew through enemies a little faster on the easier difficulties <br></p><h2 id="h14242"><a id=""></a>Where to practice combat</h2><figure id="" data-id="ac2eb26be1f96549959193ef8948f051" data-recommend-id="image://ac2eb26be1f96549959193ef8948f051" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu shows chapter selection in Hellblade 2" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A menu shows chapter selection in Hellblade 2" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ac2eb26be1f96549959193ef8948f051" data-recommend-id="image://ac2eb26be1f96549959193ef8948f051" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A menu shows chapter selection in Hellblade 2" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As soon as you start making progress in <em>Hellblade II</em>, you’ll gain access to chapter selection. This is a great way to practice <em>Hellblade II</em>’s combat for subsequent runs on hard mode if you so desire. After you rescue Fargrimr, you’ll have access to the “Draugar Battle” sequence which features about four to five minutes of fighting. You can skip the cutscene at the start of this sequence by pausing and selecting “Skip Cinematic” (let the scene play out just a second or two for this option to pop in the pause menu if it’s not there). </p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ninja-theory-hellblade-new-game-greenlit-microsoft-1851490677&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ninja-theory-hellblade-new-game-greenlit-microsoft-1851490677"><em>Hellblade II</em> Studio Reportedly Already Working On Its Next Game</a></span></p><p>Starting from a specific chapter won’t override your current playthrough accessed by selecting “Continue” in the game’s main menu <em>unless</em> you play past the point where you last left off. So if you’ve played through chapters one through four, and go back to play chapter two, you won’t override your playthrough unless you progress through chapter four and on to chapter five.<br></p><hr><p><em>Hellblade II</em> is a game of mood and tone more than anything else. While it doesn’t contain long lists of combo moves or upgradable abilities and weapons, the combat is still very rewarding and energizing to play through once you get the hang of it. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

For example, while the Loot Reborn overhaul made Aspects permanent unlocks, applying them to new gear can still cost a lot in addition to the usual fees associated with repairs and rerolling items at the Occultist. But the biggest culprit has been post-campaign masterworking, a new system for slowly leveling up the stat affixes on a piece of gear.</p><p>Only available at World Tier 4, each new rank costs additional crafting resources and a ton of gold.

And because of the RNG involved, hardcore players will often find themselves resetting and starting over, which alone costs 5 million gold. It was creating a huge bottleneck as players farmed the new Pit of the Artificer boss rush mode for crafting materials, only to find themselves short on gold.</p><p>“While we continue to review the gold economy there is one change we felt we needed to make right away,” associate game director Joseph Piepiora <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/JPiepiora/status/1792315402716094907&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/JPiepiora/status/1792315402716094907" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> over the weekend.

Currently, you can get about 1 billion gold for around $25. That’s a nearly seven-fold increase from what gold was selling for just before season 4 went live. Some players have used this as evidence that <em>Diablo IV</em>’s current gold economy is still out of whack, while others argue that the action-RPG’s progression design shouldn’t be influenced by the illicit activities of high-end players.</p><p>Despite the recent massive gold cost nerfs, it sounds like Blizzard is still looking for other ways to give players a break. “Team made a change this weekend but we may turn some additional levers on this and a few other mat items players have noted to us,” global community manager Adam Fletcher <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/d4/t/too-much-gold-sinks-and-not-enough-gold/160911/118&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/d4/t/too-much-gold-sinks-and-not-enough-gold/160911/118" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> on the Blizzard forum yesterday.

<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-the-most-meat-week-rewards">How to Unlock the Most Meat Week Rewards</h2>



<p>To unlock the most possible rewards from Grahm’s Meat Cook during Meat Week, you must keep the meter during the event as high as possible. There are three ticks on the meter; the first indicates bad performance, the second indicates good performance, and the third indicates the best performance possible. You want to ensure the meter remains above the third tick.</p>



<p>To do this, complete the optional objectives, focus on the main objectives, and work as a team. </p>



<p>The stages of Grahm’s Meat Cook include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Wait for the event to start.</li>



<li>Help Grahm keep the camp clean, feed guests, and ensure the mood remains festive.</li>



<li>Extinguish bushfires (Optional)</li>



<li>Scoop Stinky Piles (Optional)</li>



<li>Clean Rotten Leftovers (Optional)</li>

<p>Again, you’ll want to prioritize all objectives, even the optional, to ensure the best performance!</p>

"We have to see what the future holds, but there’s nothing in the plans where we want to be acquired by somebody. I want to see how high we can fly. And bringing Shams on board, we have a good potential to realize that future of turning into the next From Software or Blizzard."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Helldivers 2 Polar Patriots Premium Warbond Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Jorjani added: "The goal of the studio is to make really great co-op games. We really want to turn Arrowhead into a flagship studio, where people who want to make these kind-of games say to themselves: ‘I want to work at Arrowhead.’ When we were growing up, we really wanted to work at Blizzard, it was one of the bucket list places to work at. I think Arrowhead has the potential to be that.”</p><p>Arrowhead will inevitably grow in size after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-is-playstations-fastest-selling-game-of-all-time-with-over-12-million-sold-in-12-weeks">Helldivers 2 sold 12 million copies in 12 weeks</a> to become the fastest-selling PlayStation game of all time. However, Pilestedt and Jorjani insisted Arrowhead wants to focus on “measured growth”, and has no plans to go public.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We have a good potential to realize that future of turning into the next FromSoftware or Blizzard.</p></div><p>“We don’t run the business for monetary gain,” Pilestedt said. “The humbleness and the desire to just make great games is the only reason we exist."<br>Meanwhile, Arrowhead has sald Helldivers 2's success <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-says-its-seen-a-horrifying-amount-of-threats-and-rude-behavior-from-some-in-the-community">has brought with it a huge amount of toxicity to deal with</a> even as it works to add more content to the game's live service.

And why wouldn't it? After the stratospheric success of the LEGO game franchise and its countless crossovers with huge franchises, the Funko Pop toy folks following the same path could prove to be an incredibly smart move. </p><p>And make no mistake: Funko Fusion is definitely bringing the pop-culture franchise thunder.

To wit:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Funko Fusion has over 3.2 million views on our TikTok account.</li><li>It's amassed over 600k views on our YouTube channel (over just two videos so far)</li><li>On Instagram, it's talled over 1.5 million views</li><li>And on Facebook (yes, <em>Facebook</em>!) it's hit nearly 1 million views.</li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Funko Fusion Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>We're looking forward to our first chance to play Funko Fusion, which should happen sooner rather than later.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/halo-infinite-gets-a-zombies-style-mode-courtesy-of-forge-creators/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=halo-infinite-gets-a-zombies-style-mode-courtesy-of-forge-creators<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="359" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After a long PvE content lull, <em>Halo Infinite </em>is getting an injection of some much-needed Firefight-esque action. Courtesy of the Forge Falcons, a community-led group of Forge gurus who focus on creating unique experiences using the robust toolset found in game, players are being treated to two weeks of, essentially, <em>Halo: Zombies</em>, called <em>Survive the Undead</em>.</p> <p data-characters="438" data-current-count="438" data-injectable="true">A <a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/combat-workshop-survive-the-undead" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post over on Halo Waypoint</a> details the new experience as a battle of attrition with a simple objective: survive. If that sounds familiar, you’re probably the target audience for this sort of thing. Players will earn points by slaying “zombies,” which can then be spent in typical <em>Call of Duty: Zombies</em> fashion on upgrades, perks, or a “mystery box.” It could contain anything, even upgrades or perks! </p>
 <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="423" data-injectable="true">It should be noted that while this mode will appear in matchmaking through the Combat Workshop for two weeks (from now until June 4), it isn’t an official game type, but rather a 343-sanctioned community Forge mode. What I mean by this is, expect some quirks, like the blog post’s warning that “while waiting to respawn, make sure you wiggle your sticks to keep from getting kicked from inactivity.”</p>
 <p data-characters="585" data-current-count="585" data-injectable="false">Still, the Forge Falcons have been cooking up unique <em>Halo: Infinite </em>experiences for quite a while, including their own twist on a Battle Royale, so it’s nice to see 343 giving them some well-deserved time in the spotlight. As for what this will do for <em>Halo: Infinite’s</em> steady but somewhat languishing player count remains to be seen, but hopefully it’ll spark more interest in additional PvE experiences. Since King of the Hill Firefight launched last December, we haven’t seen so much as a whiff of another game type of its kind from the developers themselves.</p>

<p data-characters="157" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Treyarch has players putting on their detective hats to piece together the puzzle after releasing a creepy teaser video for the upcoming <em>Call of Duty</em> title. </p> <p data-characters="479" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true">Treyarch created a new website domain called <a href="https://thetruthlies.com/6/">the truth lies</a>. When you go on to the website, a video on a CRT shows a group of people climbing Mount Rushmore and putting blindfolds over the former presidents’ faces with “the truth lies” written on the first three. The fourth blindfold has what will presumably be the logo for the next title. Since the TV on the website only goes up to Channel 6, this strongly hints at the title being <em>Call of Duty</em> <em>Black Ops 6</em>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="329" data-current-count="629" data-injectable="true">As <em>Call of Duty </em>fans play around more with the TV on the website and pick through the video with a fine-tooth comb, more teasers will undoubtedly be discovered. There will reportedly be a full reveal for the next<em> Call of Duty </em>at the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xbox-games-showcase-locked-in-for-june-with-a-rumored-cod-direct-afterwards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Games Showcase</a> on June 9 at 10 AM PT. Knowing Treyarch, more teasers are likely on the way.</p>
 <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false">This particular video coincidentally arrives one day after Ubisoft launched its 6v6 arena shooter, <em>XDefiant</em>. Ubisoft executive producer and former <em>Call of Duty</em> dev Mark Rubin has previously <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1670894140761214980" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shot down</a> any comparisons or competition between the two titles. Still, it’s hard to overlook the timing of the video, as <em>Call of Duty</em> briefly steals the spotlight back for a moment. </p> <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="674" data-injectable="false">As for when players can get their hands on the upcoming title,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-next-call-of-duty-will-reportedly-be-on-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors</a>&nbsp;suggest that&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6</em>&nbsp;will launch in late October. The new&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>&nbsp;is expected to be available on PlayStation, PC, and Xbox, and there’s a lot of speculation around whether it may <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-next-call-of-duty-will-reportedly-be-on-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">also come to Game Pass</a>.</p>

            <p>After a few set photo leaks earlier in the month, we now have an official first look at Liam Hemsworth as Geralt of Rivia in season four of Netflix's The Witcher series.</p>
<p>A new image along with a short piece of footage shows the former Hunger Games actor with Geralt's white locks and a suitably moody stare.</p>
<p>First up, that footage, which you can see below. The Netflix team has gone for the 'strong but silent' vibe with this clip, showing Hemsworth making his way through the misty landscape with Geralt's horse Roach, before he turns to look towards the camera.</p>

<p>"His look has been in development for over a year, so it's thrilling to finally share an official sneak peek of Liam Hemsworth as Geralt of Rivia," The Witcher showrunner Lauren S.

<p>"Cast and crew alike have been struck by the passion, energy, and embodiment Liam has brought to the character from day one -- scruffy beard, iconic scar, and all! We're having so much fun filming season four and are excited to welcome fans along on this journey with us."</p>

<p>Hemsworth was first announced to be joining the cast for the fourth season of The Witcher in 2022, when former Geralt actor Henry Cavill announced he was "laying down [his] medallion and [his] swords".</p>
<p>"As with the greatest of literary characters, I pass the torch with reverence for the time spent embodying Geralt and enthusiasm to see Liam's take on this most fascinating and nuanced of men," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-the-witcher-season-4-henry-cavill-replaced-as-geralt">Cavill wrote at the time</a>.</p>
<p>Hemsworth will portray the series' monster hunter for the show's fourth and presumably <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-the-witcher-season-5-will-be-its-last">fifth and final season</a>. And, he won't be the only new face on set when the next season airs. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-casts-laurence-fishburne-for-fourth-season-of-netflix-show">Matrix star Laurence Fishburne is also joining the cast</a> as Regis. Danny Woodburn, meanwhile, has been announced as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-the-witcher-series-adds-seinfeld-conan-star">Geralt's dwarf friend Zoltan Chivay</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24162520/the-witcher-season-4-liam-hemsworth-first-look<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="B0SFn8">The biggest question hanging over the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23809084/witcher-season-4-release-date-cast-news-liam-hemsworth">upcoming fourth season</a> of Netflix’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/the-witcher"><em>The Witcher</em></a> has, for better or for worse, been about casting. Liam Hemsworth has replaced <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23428458/henry-cavill-superman-man-of-steel">former Superman</a> Henry Cavill as the monster hunter Geralt of Rivia for the show’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24134071/witcher-season-4-netflix-season-5-final">final two seasons</a>, and naturally people want to know how well he slides into that snug leather armor. Netflix’s first season 4 tease is geared towards answering that question, and nothing more. </p>
<p id="D1F8pB">The one-minute clip slowly approaches nu-Geralt from behind in a foggy wood, closing in as Hemsworth looks over his shoulder to reveal that hey, he looks like Geralt! This is not that shocking, I suppose, as the people making this show have eyes and probably do want some kind of visual continuity here. Of course, in this very controlled and narrow glimpse, none of his co-stars or familiar haunts are present to register any dissonance, so seeing him — and more importantly, <em>hearing </em>him — in actual action is where the challenge lies. </p>
<p id="GpAWDV">As for when we’ll see any more, that remains to be seen. There’s still no official premiere date for season 4, but considering how the series left Geralt <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23809906/the-witcher-season-3-part-2-review">in a pretty pickle last season</a>, it’s hard to object to <em>The Witcher</em>’s creative team taking its time to get our favorite mutated monster slayer’s re-introduction right. </p>

<p id="35LpwG">Among the new cards coming in <em>MH3</em> is another addition to a small cycle of elder giant titans from the plane of Theros. Today Polygon can officially introduce Phlage, Titan of Fire’s Fury, a new take on a classic burn spell. It’s a card that could potentially be the crucial upgrade needed to revive one of the Modern format’s oldest strategies — especially with the help of the two other cards revealed in the story below!</p>
<p id="SEUTYv">That’s right: Burn decks could be coming back into fashion, after years on the sidelines of competitive and semi-competitive play.</p>

<p id="fNKPmS">When it first enters the battlefield, it immediately deals three damage to another creature or player, and gains its controller three life — an effect that already exists on a popular card called Lightning Helix, which for years existed as a cornerstone in Modern’s red/white burn deck. But like its Titan predecessors, Phlage then sacrifices itself and heads to the graveyard until its additional escape cost is paid. </p>

<p id="38md01">In order to move Phlage from the graveyard back to the battlefield, its controller must pay an additional four mana and exile five other cards from the graveyard – only then does it stay on the battlefield, triggering its Lightning Helix effect again upon entry, and repeatedly after that whenever it attacks.</p>
<h2 id="YvMgEG"><strong>The legacy and decline of Modern burn decks</strong></h2>
<p id="WV8QPe">Historically, red/white burn decks have been a mainstay in Modern, known for their efficiency, speed, and ability to run over opponents with a mix of aggressive creatures and cheap “burn” spells that perform direct damage to a player’s life total. Thanks to a critical mass of Lightning Bolts and similar spells, burn was considered one of Modern’s fastest-winning decks due to its realistic ability of ending a game on turn three.</p>

<p id="OaukYr">However, since the release of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22537203/magic-the-gathering-modern-horizons-2-best-cards-asmoranomardicadaistinaculdacar"><em>Modern Horizons 2</em></a> in 2021, traditional burn decks failed to remain competitive while other Modern decks received substantial upgrades and powerful new strategies emerged. Though many burn players continued to register their decks in tournaments, the strategy itself remained stagnant, struggling to keep up as the Modern format’s power level gradually evolved and pushed the deck out of winners’ circles. </p>
<h2 id="cwtugh"><strong>Synergies and metagame impact</strong></h2>
<p id="ZXR4lN">Not only does Phlage reapply the Lightning Helix effect on a new card type, it also fits well with burn’s current play patterns. Burn decks rely heavily on one-and-done instants and sorceries, which quickly fill the graveyard while executing on burn’s primary strategy, in turn making the titan’s escape cost a realistic endgame after the burn player exhausts their other resources. </p>
<p id="b3zfNB">Since casting and escaping Phlage presents six damage on its own, it’s easy to imagine the remaining 14 damage needed to kill an opponent might have been done already with the cards used to escape it from the graveyard. If casting the card twice isn’t enough to win the game by itself, each additional attack presents nine more damage, a formidable threat against even the players who managed to somehow gain life back after getting burned.</p>
<h2 id="xPCcDY"><strong>New outlets for energy tokens</strong></h2>
<p id="JBSlBI">Another exciting reveal from <em>MH3 </em>is the return of energy tokens, a mechanic first introduced in 2016’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/9/15/12935316/magic-the-gathering-kaladesh-exclusive-mtg-vehicle-preview-cards-set-spoiler"><em>Kaladesh</em></a>, but which hadn’t been used again until earlier this year in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24139124/mtg-fallout-best-selling-commander-set-ever">Universes Beyond<em> Fallout Commander</em> decks</a>.</p>
<p id="0TzFKC">Unlike most other counters in <em>Magic</em>, which are placed on creatures or permanents, energy counters are given to a player directly, often as an added perk of a card’s effect. Once a certain number of energy counters are collected, they can be used as an additional resource to enhance cards that care about energy payoffs. </p>
<p id="ePcENM">Case in point: Amped Raptor and Voltstorm Angel. </p>

<p id="KAxS3Z">The long-term playability of energy cards in <em>MH3 </em>remains to be seen, however, since they’ve essentially been nonexistent in competitive metagames in the years since they were first introduced. Although a powerful energy-based deck used to exist when <em>Kaladesh</em> was legal in <em>Magic</em>’s standard format, they never made the leap to more powerful environments such as Modern or Pioneer.</p>
<p id="czjEvl">Although Voltstorm Angel is likely designed for games of <em>MH3</em> draft, Amped Raptor might be worth keeping an eye on if a red energy deck exists. </p>
<p id="TDiYn6">The raptor’s effect when it enters the battlefield allows the player to cast additional cards for free, off the top of the library, by spending energy counters in place of mana. Pairing it with deck manipulation effects that can put specific cards on top of the library, along with other spells that provide enough counters to cast anything that’s revealed off the raptor’s initial trigger, could let you “cheat” powerful and expensive cards into play before you have enough lands to cast it with traditional mana. </p>

<p>TikTok is a touchy subject – and it has been so for at least the last four years. It started as a platform that hosted videos of teenagers dancing while miming songs but quickly became a melting pot of content creation, bizarre videos, pranks, gaming content, and everything in between. Today, it’s the biggest short-form video-sharing platform in the world, but it’s still a bit of a controversial application that angers the disapproving masses.</p>



<p>However, one category that excelled on TikTok was gaming. For the last three or four years, the application’s stranglehold on the gaming industry has gotten tighter, with creators leaning on the application to share short- and long-form videos, gain followers, and even live stream their gameplay.</p>



<p>Recently, data was revealed showcasing the top 500 games on the app. I’m willing to bet you’ll never guess the most popular game on TikTok.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-battle-royale-is-boss">Battle Royale is Boss</h2>



<p>In a data pull, a platform called mindGAME revealed the top 500 games on TikTok by total views and video counts. </p>



<p>At the top of the table sat Garena Free Fire, a mobile-based battle royale game that has never really excelled above the likes of PUBG, Fortnite, or Warzone in the general popularity stakes. It’s dramatically successful in some regions – such as Southeast Asia – and as an esports-focused game, it once held the record for the most concurrent viewers for an esports tournament <strong>ever</strong>.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/mindgame-data_free-data-as-part-of-the-composite-mindshare-activity-7197053706310197248-yLVx?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In the data</a>, it was revealed that <strong>in total </strong>on TikTok, Garena Free Fire has amassed a count of 888 <strong>billion </strong>views spread across 87.3 million videos. In second place sits Roblox with 595 billion views on 66 million videos. Fortnite has wound up in third place with 591 million views on 60 million videos.</p>



<p>By comparison, Call of Duty Warzone doesn’t even make it into the top ten – neither does Grand Theft Auto 5. The likes of Counter-Strike and Rainbow Six Siege were edged out by Among Us and Genshin Impact, and single-player epics like Red Dead Redemption 2, Elden Ring, and The Last of Us are sitting somewhere in the 30 – 40 range. </p>



<p>Some fast risers have entered the list in recent weeks. For instance, Manor Lords has hit 28 million views across 1,700 videos, and Arena Breakout: Infinite has secured 14.9 million views also with around 1,700 videos.</p>



<p>There’s a lot of gaming real estate to be secured on TikTok, that’s for sure.</p>

<p>Moments ago, a new website surfaced that’s reportedly the first teaser content for Black Ops 6 – if that’s indeed what the next Call of Duty game will be called. It’s called <a href="https://thetruthlies.com/1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘thetruthlies.com’</a>, and it’s a relatively confusing little thing. On the site, there’s a retro television – like a CCTV monitor of sorts – that showcases a ‘found footage’ style video. </p>



<p>In this video, we see unidentified operatives traversing a federal location through the night – which is later revealed to be Mount Rushmore. They deface the monument silently in the blackness of night, before filming from a distance as their work is uncovered. They’ve hung banners stating ‘the truth lies’ over the faces of Mount Rushmore, while a fourth banner shows the wolf symbol that was revealed recently to announce the upcoming Call of Duty showcase.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cryptic-teaser">Cryptic Teaser</h2>



<p>There are a few things you can do and learn from The Truth Lies:</p>











<p>If you turn off the TV using the power button, you hear a foreboding, pulsing soundtrack in the background – which doesn’t tell you much. </p>



<p>If you flick through the channels, you’ll see that there are six. That could be a nod to ‘Black Ops’, or it could mean that five further teasers are set to be revealed. </p>



<p>Hitting ‘REC’ allows you to download the video that’s currently playing, which is a nice feature that’s guaranteed to get shares on social platforms.</p>



<p>Inspecting the page source doesn’t give much away, and from what we can see, there’s nothing else of any importance on the site.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>What appears to be the first teaser for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/" data-ref-id="1100-6523361">next Call of Duty game</a> has arrived. Charlie Intel discovered a website for <a href="https://thetruthlies.com/1/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"The Truth Lies"</a> that appears to point to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-rumored-to-be-black-ops-5-is-coming-to-game-pass-report/1100-6523538/" data-ref-id="1100-6523538">rumored Black Ops 6.</a></p><p>A video on the website shows people climbing Mt. Rushmore to drape bandanas over the Presidents that say "The Truth Lies." A fourth bandana has what appears to be the Black Ops logo that was seen previously in Microsoft's announcement for a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-airs-june-9-followed-by-mystery-event/1100-6523072/" data-ref-id="1100-6523072">mystery event in June.</a></p><p>The Black Ops series is known for its many mysteries and for digging into conspiracy theories, so the messaging is certainly on brand for the franchise, if this is indeed a Black Ops 6 teaser. Activision is known for its elaborate and multi-stage announcements for new Call of Duty games, and this appears to be the first step in the announcement process for this year's Call of Duty game.</p><p>Black Ops 6, or whatever the game is, is likely to release in October, according to reports. It will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-rumored-to-be-black-ops-5-is-coming-to-game-pass-report/1100-6523538/" data-ref-id="1100-6523538">launch on Game Pass, according to The Wall Street Journal.</a></p><p dir="ltr">The story for Black Ops 6 is rumored to take place, at least in part, during the Gulf War. Call of Duty games are known to be globetrotting affairs that travel through numerous locations--and time periods. So if the Gulf War is part of the game's story, it could be just one element of it.</p><p dir="ltr">Rumors have suggested the new game has been in the works for a long time and will be the first game in franchise history to have been <a href="https://twitter.com/ModernWarzone/status/1782123698893279545">developed over a four-year period</a>. This lies in stark contrast to 2023's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III, which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-campaign-was-developed-on-a-very-rushed-schedule-report/1100-6519074/">reportedly made in just 18 months.</a></p><p dir="ltr">If this year's game is indeed a Black Ops title, it will be the sixth entry in the series since it debuted in 2010. The Black Ops franchise within Call of Duty has become one of the most popular of all, and lucrative, too. Dave Anthony, the director of the first two Black Ops games, recently discussed how he made <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-call-of-duty-boss-lists-bel-air-mansion-for-astronomical-price-see-inside/1100-6523192/">"incredible amounts of money"</a> during his career.</p><p dir="ltr">In terms of returning characters, it's rumored that Adler is coming back, but that's all we know so far. The Black Ops series is known for featuring real-life people, like Ronald Reagan (Black Ops Cold War) and Robert McNamara (Black Ops 1), so it wouldn't be surprising to see real-life military and political leaders from the Gulf War era appear in the new game.</p><p>A report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-gulf-war-campaign-open-world/" rel="nofollow ">Insider Gaming</a> said Raven Software is developing the game's campaign, with Treyarch--the creator of the Black Ops series--handling multiplayer and Zombies. Activision is known to recruit teams from across its entire network of Call of Duty studios to contribute to each year's new release in some fashion, and that formula is expected to continue this year.</p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's rundown of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6523361/" data-ref-id="1100-6523361">everything we know about the next Call of Duty. </a>Whatever the game turns out to be, it will join Call of Duty: Warzone, Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile, and Call of Duty: Mobile on the market at the same time.</p>

                <p>Super Smash Bros. players are well-known for their strong opinions on character balance, and it seems that Masahiro Sakurai is no different. In a recent video on game design, Sakurai says that trying to make everything "fair" will produce a less interesting game. Or, as he puts it: "Average and mediocre are the same thing."</p><p>In the video, Sakurai explains that having characters with different sets of strengths and weaknesses gives the game a sense of "push-and-pull." He cites an example of a Mario vs. Mario mirror match--while it resolves these "balance issues," it also creates a static experience. He also calls the internet an "echo chamber of sorts," stating that players tend to believe community opinions of relative strength, even when they aren't necessarily true.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW4x-_Y8BmM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/KW4x-_Y8BmM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>To support his arguments, Sakurai revealed some interesting data regarding the relative win rates of each character in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/super-smash-bros-ultimate/" data-ref-id="5000-480957">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> online matches. He reports that the highest win rate of a character in the game is 51.43%, while the lowest is 47.18%, a difference of around 4%. The director is clearly happy with this data, concluding it as follows: "any fighter has a shot at winning a match." So, the next time your hardcore Smash friend makes fun of you for picking a low-tier like Little Mac, try sending them this video.</p><p>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, the latest entry in the series, first came out in 2018 and received regular DLC updates until late 2021. While the future of the series is unknown, Sakurai said in a video released earlier this year that he's working on another project, which may indicate that Smash 6 is in development in some form or fashion. Sakurai did say he was going to step away from the series after Ultimate, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/smash-bros-creator-on-franchises-future-i-cant-imagine-a-smash-bros-title-without-me/1100-6516378/" data-ref-id="1100-6516378">indicated</a> last year that he "can't imagine [a Smash game] without me." So, if there is another Smash game, it's almost certain that Sakurai will be involved.</p>

        <p>But StreamElements reports Rust enjoyed 19 million hours increase thanks to Waves of Change update</p>

</header>  <div>



            <p>The latest StreamElements report reveals that Twitch users watched 1.64 billion hours of livestreamed footage in April.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/twitch-hours-watched-drop-another-5-in-march">Last month's report</a> put March's total viewing hours at 1.56 billion, but StreamElements and Rainmaker.gg have since updated the data, showing that April is actually 7% down on the 1.77 billion hours recorded in the previous month.</p>
<p>Similarly, daily hours watched were down 5% from 57 million to 55 million. In fact, the number of daily hours watched has dropped slightly each month this year.</p>
<p>The declines can be attributed to a quiet April, with no major game releases or events to deliver a boost.</p>
<p>While Fallout games have <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/fallout-4-jumps-to-no1-across-europe-following-tv-show-launch">rocketed up both the physical and digital charts</a> in the UK and Europe, these titles do not appear in the Top 10 most watched categories, which are instead led by Just Chatting (238 million hours watched) and Grand Theft Auto 5 (128 million), as well as live service games such as Fortnite, Counter-Strike GO and League of Legends.</p>
<p>Only two of the Top 10 categories saw an increase in hours watched, with Rust seeing the biggest increase month-on-month. The game's Waves of Changes update pushed viewing hours up by 227% — or 19 million hours to put it into context.</p>
<p>Total hours watched for Rust came in at 27 million, putting it at No.9. Call of Duty Warzone was at No.8 with 33 million hours — the only other game to see an increase at 19%.</p>
<p>"April was a slow month with few significant events and no major game launches, but Rust's massive update provided one notable peak among the valleys regarding viewership," said StreamElements co-founder Or Perry.</p>
<p>"Jynxzi was another highlight by being the first creator to be a top streamer twice in 2024 and putting him on the short list of recurring crown wearers, like xQc, Gaules, KaiCenat, and fps_shaka."</p>

In the last half-decade, Shiver has focused on bringing high-profile triple-A games to Nintendo Switch, including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mortal Kombat 11 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hogwarts Legacy</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Under Embracer’s ownership, Shiver also worked alongside Saber Interactive, a company with a renowned reputation for producing impressive Switch ports of games such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Witcher 3, Crysis, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Kingdom Come: Deliverance – </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">games</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">once considered not feasible for the platform.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nintendo notes that Shiver’s current focus will continue – that is, it will be involved in commissioning and producing ports of games to platforms including Nintendo Switch.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Omdia expects the next-generation “Switch 2” to continue aligning with the console software landscape. Unlike Steam Deck, which utilizes a translation layer (Proton) to enable compatibility with existing PC titles, Switch 2, like PS5, will require its own versions of games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Switch 2 is expected to provide a sizeable leap in hardware performance as the original Switch approaches its eighth birthday. This should help Nintendo fill the gap when it comes to attracting third party support of titles that would have been too ambitious for the original Switch.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nintendo has also hired Gio Corsi for its triple-A third party management team. Corsi previously led PlayStation’s third-party production and developer relation efforts, suggesting Nintendo is eager to attract third-party support of triple-A titles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nintendo can no longer rely on a library of unnoticed Wii U software to bulk out its first-party release schedule. With production timescales also increasing gen-on-gen, Nintendo will be more reliant on third-party content to fill the gap.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Shiver will help Nintendo bolster its third-party portfolio. Its alignment under Nintendo should give it access to the company’s hardware and software engineering teams, improving its capability to deliver quality conversions. It also secures their exclusive attention on working with Nintendo platforms, which may become less guaranteed as more players offer triple-A gaming on the go, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/apple-stakes-its-claim-to-aaa-gaming-on-mobile-with-iphone-15-pro-series">including Apple</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nintendo can also use its ownership of Shiver Entertainment as a bargaining chip when negotiating with publishers to bring their games to “Switch 2”, particularly where resources are scarce. Existing exclusivity agreements may typically involve support for funding, localization, marketing, and distribution – Nintendo could now promise assistance from a first-party specialist developer on top.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nintendo will have to navigate an extended cross-gen period</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Omdia’s </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Games Addressable Market Metrics Database </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">estimates that 104 million Nintendo Switch consoles will remain in active use by the end of 2024. With Switch’s successor estimated to land in 2025, a huge audience will need shepherding over to the next generation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is a challenge that competitor Sony continues to face even as PlayStation 5 enters the latter half of its cycle. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>1H24 Console Report </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">reveals that 50m last-gen PS4 consoles remain in active use (see Figure) as the PS5 active installed base outweighs the equivalent PS4 decline by a factor of 1.16.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Figure: Despite high replacement rate, active installed base for PlayStation 4 remains above PlayStation 3 gen-on-gen</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nintendo must prepare for a similarly prolonged cross-generation period – it needs to juggle onboarding players to Switch 2 with sustaining the software spend and engagement of the portion of its audience that has yet to make the transition.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That is where the acquisition of Shiver Entertainment could come in handy. With its audience split between new and old generations of hardware in the first half of its new console cycle, Nintendo may wish to release Switch versions of select titles originally planned for “Switch 2”. Shiver could be involved in bringing next-generation first-party content to its soon-to-be last-gen Switch.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Nintendo is about to enter a new generation where digital libraries provide software continuity, making exclusive next-gen content more important than ever. But it also cannot afford to ignore the portion of its audience that will be slower to upgrade. Nintendo’s acquisition of Shiver Entertainment could make for a potent weapon to help it navigate its next-gen transition.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Analyst, Games, Omdia</p><div data-testid="contributor-summary-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">James is part of Omdia’s games team, specializing in the markets for PC and mobile gaming.

The company, which owns a wide array of board and tabletop game developers, publishers, and distributors, took on €900 million in debt as part of the separation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Will that debt weigh down a company carrying a major chunk of the sector on its back? According to former Embracer interim chief operations officer Matt Karch, the answer is "no."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Asmodee's a company that can handle debt, and that's where all the debt's going to be" the CEO (and founder) of Saber Interactive said in a recent conversation with Game Developer about the past and future of former Embracer subsidiary Saber Interactive. He'd been in the midst of praising Embracer's split into a trio of companies, and opined that the decision to assign the debt to Asmodee was likely to pay off.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's more to glean from Karch's comments—what is it that makes Asmodee so good at handling debt, and what might it mean for its sibling corporations?</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/opinion-embracer-s-plan-for-the-lord-of-the-rings-is-bad-for-everyone" target="_self">Opinion: Embracer's plan for The Lord of the Rings is bad for everyone</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What does it mean that Asmodee is &quot;good&quot; at paying debt?">What does it mean that Asmodee is "good" at paying debt?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The news of Asmodee's financing made some industry observers nervous. It ostensibly resembled a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2023/04/28/opinion/private-equity.html">widely-criticized</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> corporate tactic: the private equity-driven practice of acquiring companies then saddling them with the debt needed to finance the purchase. The practice allows the new owner to extract value from the company's assets while forcing it to divert resources to paying down the debt.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even if you're not familiar with such financial mechanisms, it's possible to interpret this move as one that makes Asmodee responsible for the financial mishaps that put Embracer in such a precarious position. Is that actually the case?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Probably not, said Dr. Mejda Bahlous-Boldi, an associate professor at Ithaca College and director of School of Business' Investment Program. We'd asked Bahlous-Boldi to weigh in on Karch's comments and evaluate what it meant for a firm like it to be good at handling debt.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"A company is well prepared to handle or manage debt if they can generate enough cashflows to service the debt," he explained. "A company that doesn’t have already a lot of debt will more likely be able to manage a debt."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As part of the spinoff, Embracer reported that Asmodee saw net sales of SEK 14.8 billion (about $1.4 billion), and "adjusted EBIT of SEK 1.9 billion on a pro forma basis as per LTM[2] as of December 2023."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's about on par with the $1.22 billion in sales it reported in its 2023 financial release and the $1.27 billion it reported in 2021.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bahlous-Boldi explained that analysts paying attention to Asmodee's financial picture are studying D/E (debt to equity) and TIE ratios (TIE is equal to EBIT/ interest expenses of 1 year). If Asmodee is prepared to manage the debt, its D/E ratio should be lower than industry averages, and its TIE ratio higher than industry averages.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After reviewing Embracer's split, Bahlous-Boldi speculated that the deal was structured this way because "not all divisions are expected to be successful and the parent company is better off splitting into 3 companies." Asmodee's status as a profitable and successful division made it the best candidate to shoulder the burden.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That said, Bahlous-Boldi warned that Asmodee will need to generate even more profits to pay off the debt, as the company is using money raised from the financing to pay dividends to Embracer. "From my opinion, the tax motive is credible," he concluded.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What does this debt mean for the different arms of Embracer?">What does this debt mean for the different arms of Embracer?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If Asmodee is the most successful of Embracer's three children, which might be the least that it's covering for? That unfortunately may be Middle-earth Enterprises &amp; Friends.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Middle-Earth Enterprises &amp; Friends bundles together all of Embracer's triple-A studios and the company in possession of The Lord of the Rings brand. On paper, it has the most well-known and possibly most valuable franchises of the three companies.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In practice, it's shouldering some of the studios that faced arduous struggles in the last decade. These include Crystal Dynamics and Eidos-Montreal, two excellent former subsidiaries of Square Enix that released high-quality games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tomb Raider</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but were regularly dinged for "not meeting expectations" by its former parent company (who deserves more of a fair share of the blame for setting impossible expectations and pressing Crystal Dynamics to pivot to live service development with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel's Avengers</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Large franchises like Tomb Raider and The Lord of the Rings </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>should</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> be the strongest performers in the division, but games set in the latter franchise have been struggling with infamous, high-profile </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/lord-of-the-rings-gollum-devs-describe-alleged-hostile-work-culture">stumbles</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of late, and the Tomb Raider franchise will need time to reap the benefits of a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/fleabag-creator-phoebe-waller-bridge-to-produce-tomb-raider-show-at-amazon">Phoebe Waller-Bridge-produced series at Amazon</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

<p data-characters="436" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Diablo 4’s</em> fourth season introduced just a few crumbs of what could be called “seasonal mechanics,” but what’s there is still pretty fun. From the Profane Mindcage, which boosts enemy levels in Helltides by 10 to the Momentum Elixir that let’s you zoom across the battlefield after scoring kills, there’s no shortage of new twists to blasting enemies. But one seems to be standing out from the rest. </p> <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false">The <strong>Elixir of Holy Bolts</strong> asks, “what if Artillery Shrine, but all the time?” It causes damaging bolts to explode out of any enemy killed, (usually) dealing enough damage to kill another enemy, which <em>also</em> fires out bolts, killing <em>another</em> enemy and.. you get the idea. It’s essentially a cascade of death in any high-density areas. </p> <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true">This strategy excels most of all in The Pit, <em>Diablo 4’s</em> new endgame activity. Enemies are packed so tightly together that starting a Holy Bolt chain-reaction is sometimes enough to clear entire sections of the map at once. It’s so powerful it could be a “seasonal mechanic” in its own right, if only it didn’t last 15 minutes. </p>
 <p data-characters="461" data-current-count="461" data-injectable="false">The good news is that once your time’s up you can easily get more Elixirs by trading 350 Obols to the Alchemist under the “Seasonal Elixir” tab for another. It’s a hefty price, to be sure, but the power gains and time saved clearing Pit runs is worth it in my opinion. Of course, you can also score these as drops from Helltide Elites and bosses. Whatever you do, keep at least one in your back pocket for those broom closets of baddies.</p>

<p data-characters="421" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>The Final Shape</em>&nbsp;is almost&nbsp;upon&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>&nbsp;players, with the expansion launching on June 4. Bungie has already shown players the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/bungie-showcases-dread-forces-ahead-of-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Dread enemies</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/we-now-know-all-of-destiny-2s-prismatic-subclass-abilities/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prismatic Subclass</a>, but now, the studio is ramping up the spectacle with a preview of some Exotic weapons featured in&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape.</em>&nbsp;Hunters, take note: there’s a new sniper rifle that shoots Golden Gun Super shots.</p> <p data-characters="567" data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true">Bungie is using the time before the release of&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>&nbsp;to hype players up with glimpses at what’s to come in the expansion. Through social media and Bungie’s own&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twid-05-16-2024" rel="noreferrer noopener">This Week in Destiny</a>&nbsp;and Dev Insights blogs, the studio has covered everything from&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-weapons-and-perks-will-change-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape/" rel="noreferrer noopener">weapon balancing</a>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/bungie-shows-off-destiny-2-the-final-shape-exotic-class-armor/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Exotic armor</a>, and now new Exotic weapons are due for a sneak peek.

 <h2 id="h-still-hunt-exotic-sniper-rifle" data-injectable="false">Still Hunt Exotic sniper rifle</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Still Hunt Exotic Sniper Rifle Preview | Destiny 2: The Final Shape" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AhNlP9rIOoQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="668" data-injectable="true">The Still Hunt Exotic sniper&nbsp;rifle looks like it could be wild. Visually, it appears to be a hand cannon retrofitted to a sniper frame, harkening thoughts back to&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2s-broken-weapon-builds-were-the-games-best-bug-ever/" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Craftening</a>. In the short teaser, we can see a Hunter use the weapon to great effect, slaying a few Hive before triggering the weapon’s special ability, providing Golden Gun Super shots.</p>
 <p data-characters="497" data-current-count="497" data-injectable="true">From the looks of things, the Exotic effect is built up by achieving kills or precision kills. It also looks like Guardians must trigger the effect, typically done in-game with a special reload, as evidenced by the Hunter going into a unique animation just before shooting the empowered shots. While many Hunters’ first question might be whether this works with the Golden Gun-empowering Celestial Nighthawk Exotic helm, players will just have to wait until&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape&nbsp;</em>to see.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Microcosm Exotic trace rifle</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Microcosm Exotic Heavy Trace Rifle Preview | Destiny 2: The Final Shape" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/j0r0mUg1jck?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="681" data-injectable="true">The Microcosm Exotic is the first Heavy trace rifle. This meaty weapon is red and gold with a trident-like design at the end of the barrel. The Exotic Perk on this weapon lets it quickly decimate enemy shields, obliterating the foes shown in its preview. Interestingly, if viewers watch closely, they can see different elemental death animations for enemies defeated by the weapon.</p>
 <p data-characters="408" data-current-count="408" data-injectable="true">While the Exotic Heavy trace rifle looks to, and should, do quite a bit of damage, the unique trait initially seems&nbsp;a bit&nbsp;underwhelming.&nbsp;A bonus to shield damage won’t hurt anyone, but since&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>‘s removal of the Match Game modifier (making it much harder to destroy enemy shields that weren’t the same element as your weapon), shields aren’t really an issue.</p>
 <p data-characters="492" data-current-count="492" data-injectable="false">Of course, we don’t know what’s to come in&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape</em>, and there’s always the chance enemy shields could play a much more significant role than they do now. I don’t know what to make of the enemy death animations showing different elements. Microcosm may have another Exotic Perk like The Fundamentals (allowing Guardians to switch elemental damage types), or it could be something else entirely. Only time will tell after&nbsp;<em>The Final Shape&nbsp;</em>releases.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/card-en-ciel-brings-mega-man-battle-network-like-card-battling-in-october.878400/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/card-en-ciel-release-date-gameplay<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Inti Creates has revealed the release date for upcoming card battler&nbsp;<em>Card-en-Ciel</em>, which essentially looks like a less RPG-ified version of&nbsp;<em>Mega Man Battle Network</em>.</p>

<p>The game is launching in October, and in a new trailer, Inti Creates shows off some&nbsp;<em>Card-en-Ciel&nbsp;</em>gameplay, and it looks...well, a whole lot like&nbsp;<em>Mega Man Battle Network</em>, actually, right down to the grid style and isometric viewpoint.</p>

<p>However, where&nbsp;<em>Battle Network&nbsp;</em>also featured JRPG-style trappings, including an overworld in which you could talk to NPCs and watch the story unfold,&nbsp;<em>Card-en-Ciel&nbsp;</em>looks to be stripping things back for a more roguelite-inspired take on the genre.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/card-en-ciel-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=2sirlSf7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/card-en-ciel-release-date-combat.jpg?itok=mkRs-1Ax 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Card-en-Ciel&nbsp;</em>is, ahem, "inspired" by&nbsp;<em>Mega Man Battle Network</em>.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Card-en-Ciel&nbsp;</em>revolves around Neon, a "gaming detective" (yes, that's Inti Creates' actual wording) who must collect and utilize cards to do battle with a range of enemies.</p>

<p>The game will offer more than 10 different dungeons, each of which is full of monsters to fight, cards to collect, and new synergies to find. You can also look forward to special "Muse Cards", which activate special abilities soundtracked by 50 vocal tracks present in the game.</p>

<p>Along the way, you'll also discover the story of Neon and his friends, although it'll be told largely through visual novel-style static scenes rather than overworld exploration, it seems.</p>

<p>You can check out the trailer for&nbsp;<em>Card-en-Ciel&nbsp;</em>right here if you want to get a sense for what the gameplay is like.</p>




<p><em>Card-en-Ciel&nbsp;</em>comes to us from Inti Creates, the studio responsible for franchises like <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/azure-striker-gunvolt-2-review-its-mega-anime-man">Azure Striker Gunvolt</a>&nbsp;</i>and the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/blaster-master-zero-2-review-nostalgia-done-right"><em>Blaster Master&nbsp;</em>revivals</a>, as well as, uh, cheesecake-tastic games like&nbsp;<em>Gal Gun</em>.</p>

<p>It looks like the studio is essentially seeking to marry its two great loves in&nbsp;<em>Card-en-Ciel</em>; it's a very&nbsp;<em>Mega Man</em>-esque game with some pretty gratuitous-feeling anime fanservice in it.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Card-en-Ciel&nbsp;</em>when it launches across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2730540/CardenCiel/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo Switch on October 24th.&nbsp;</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/deadlock-footage-leak-characters-world-details/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deadlock-footage-leaks-showing-the-steampunk-world-and-characters-of-valve%E2%80%99s-new-shooter.878397/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/deadlock-footage-leak-characters-world-details/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last week details emerged that a new hero shooter from Valve, <a href="https://wccftech.com/deadlock-might-be-valves-upcoming-third-person-hero-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entitled Deadlock</a>, had secretly entered alpha testing. Needless to say, a new shooter from Valve is a <em>pretty big deal</em>, and there’s no way those alpha testers aren’t going to keep on leaking things. Case in point, a short clip of the game in action is now in the wild – Valve is trying to pull the footage down, but for now, <a href="https://streamable.com/gjm033" target="_blank" rel="noopener">it’s available here</a>.</p>
<p>As we’ve heard previously, Deadlock is a 6v6 team-based hero shooter, with a little bit of MOBA flavor mixed in as the game’s maps have multiple lanes with floating grapple lines that can be used for quick travel. The new footage shows a player using one of these grapple lines during training mode. We also get a better taste of the game’s BioShock-esque steampunk aesthetics, with various ads for cigarettes and other things adorning the environment.</p>
<p>The footage also provides a peek at Deadlock’s character select screen. At least in alpha, it looks like the roster will consist of 19 characters, which include steampunk-style robots like “Infernus,” more supernatural characters like the bat creature “Ivy,” and multiple highly-stylized human characters. It seems like many of the characters will have some sort of elemental theme – Infernus uses fire, “Kelvin” uses ice, and so on. While we don’t have details about all the characters, the footage hovers over the following heroes, providing us some details.</p>
<p><em><strong>Ivy</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sets up a power duo with a lucky ally</em></li>
<li><em>Ivy has disruptive combat tricks that slow and stun enemies. She's most effective when linking up with an ally, empowering her and her ally's guns as well as sharing heals.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Infernus</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Lights up enemies and watches them burn</em></li>
<li><em>Infernus has many ways to deal damage over time, burning foes before swooping in for the kill. Due to Infernus' blazing speed, his enemies won't be able to escape the flames.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Haze</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sneaks in and sprays bullets</em></li>
<li><em>When Haze fixates on a target she can hold her own in a firefight. She prefers to creates one-sided exchanges, avoiding damage then picking off unsuspecting targets up close.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Grey Talon</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Delivers long-range skill shots</em></li>
<li><em>A cunning predator, Grey Talon uses a combination of deadly accuracy, traps, and clever positioning to bring down the toughest opponents.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Kelvin</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Freezes enemies in their tracks</em></li>
<li><em>Timely heals and splitting a team fight properly is the difference between an easy victory or a ruinous defeat. Gliding around slowing enemies gives Kelvin's team the maneuvering advantage to make this happen.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Lady Geist</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Sacrifices health then drains it back.</em></li>
<li><em>Expending health to achieve devastating effects is the source of Lady Geist's power. When running low she can drain the life out of her rivals.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Seven</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Electrocutes crowds of enemies</em></li>
<li><em>Seven thrives in a skirmish waiting for the time to strike. Then he rolls into the fight like a storm and batters his enemies with a cascade of lightning.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Vindicta</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Snipes the unsuspecting</em></li>
<li><em>Vindicta has the mobility to engage at her leisure, picking at her prey and bleeding them out slowly. Injured enemies at any distance should fear being picked off when she is on the map.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Warden</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Weakens his enemies and chases them down</em></li>
<li><em>Warden leads from the front, jumping into the fray and hindering his opponents' ability to fight effectively. But what Warden considers brave, others consider reckless, and if he's not careful he can easily find himself in over his head.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Wraith</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Melts isolated targets</em></li>
<li><em>Excelling at one-on-one combat, Wraith isolates targets, eliminating them with ruthless efficiency, then teleporting away before anyone can retaliate.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Yamato</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Delivers charged attacks with finesse</em></li>
<li><em>Yamato uses precise strikes to decimate her rivals. However, such damaging attacks often will leave her exposed, so she needs to make every shot count.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Deadlock has not been officially announced by Valve yet, and there’s no word on when that may happen. Given the game is in alpha testing, an announcement likely isn’t too far away, although aspects of the game still look a bit rough, so we’ll see.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/make-the-most-of-grahms-meat-cook-in-fallout-76/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Following its rough launch, Fallout 76 turned around to become one of the most entertaining experiences in gaming today. I’ve spent countless hundreds of hours across multiplayer characters enjoying Appalachia, and a big part of that is because of the regular events and community. Now, it’s time for Meat Week! Here’s how to make the most of Grahm’s Meat Cook in Fallout 76!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-grahm-s-meat-cook-in-fallout-76">What is Grahm’s Meat Cook in Fallout 76?</h2>



<p>First and foremost, what the heck is Grahm’s Meat Cook? It’s a seasonal public event that takes place every so often as part of the Meat Week Community Event. During this seasonal event, players will take part in the Primal Cuts Event, which occurs every 15 minutes in there of the five regions across the map. If you take part, you’ll earn items and rewards to help Grahm’s Meat Cook—the second event of the season—succeed!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-grahm-s-meat-cook-start">When Does Grahm’s Meat Cook Start?</h2>



<p>As mentioned, you can take part in Primal Cuts every 15 minutes in three unique zones across Appalachia. As for Grahm’s Meat Cook, it begins on the hour, every hour.</p>



<p>You can find Grahm’s Meat Cook south of Fallout 76 and northwest of the Moonshiner’s Shack. It’s hard to miss, as everything is on fire and glowing. </p>







<h2 id="h-what-to-do-with-prime-meat-in-fallout-76">What to do With Prime Meat in Fallout 76</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Prime Meat is the key ingredient to Meat Week. You’ll accumulate as much as possible before bringing the entire lot to Grahm’s Meat Cook. There, during the secondary event, you’ll unlock Legendary Scrip.</p>



<p>You want Legendary Scrip, as it allows you to purchase Legendary Items and Components from Purveyor Murmrgh. </p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-prime-meat">How to Get Prime Meat</h2>



<p>To get Prime Meat in Fallout 76, you must take part in Primal Cuts. It appears on the map every 15 minutes in three different zones across the game world, so keep an eye out. Upon completing the community event, you’ll earn Prime Meat as a reward, which you’ll later bring to Grahm’s Meat Cook.</p>



<p>Primal Cuts tasks players with banging a drum in the center of the arena to attract predators. You’ll then fight waves of various creatures, with each wave becoming progressively larger and more challenging. The final wave culminates in a boss fight, which is typically a legendary monster.</p>



<p>Once finished, you’ll earn Prime Meat!</p>

<p data-characters="281" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Tomestones of Poetics are a type of currency in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> gained through running a myriad of duties. They’re easy to get, and you’ll frequently find yourself reaching the 2,000 maximum that you can carry. But what do you do with them? Well, you’ve got some options.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">You’ll start to earn Poetics after reaching level 50 in your first Job, and they’re earned by doing basically anything – The Hunt, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-deep-dungeon-how-to-unlock-palace-of-the-dead/">Deep Dungeons</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/every-ffxiv-raid-unlock-guide-coil-alexander-omega-eden-pandaemonium/">Raids</a>, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-loporrit-tribal-quests-in-ffxiv/">Tribal quests</a>, and even large-scale content such as <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-unlock-bozjan-southern-front-zadnor-in-ffxiv/">Bozja</a> or Eureka all reward Poetics, as long as they’re from a previous expansion. The only common content I can think of that doesn’t reward Poetics is FATEs.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="227" data-current-count="606" data-injectable="true">So with that in mind, you’ll very quickly reach the 2,000 maximum Poetics you can hold at any one time. Don’t be like me and exist with them permanently capped, it’s a good idea to spend them on <em>something</em>, but what?&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-augmented-gear" data-injectable="false"><strong>Augmented gear</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="623" data-injectable="true">If you’re leveling alt Jobs, you’ll need to kit them out in the best gear, and this is—without argument—the Augmented gear in each expansion. You purchase Augmented Gear with weekly capped Tomestones for its current expansion, but after a new expansion is released, older gear becomes purchasable through Poetics.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="100" data-current-count="100" data-injectable="false">This gear becomes available to you in stages, only unlocking after you complete a certain MSQ quest:</p> <figure data-found-rows="5" data-current-count="600" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Gear name</strong></td><td><strong>Level</strong></td><td><strong>Expansion</strong></td><td><strong>Unlock quest</strong></td><td><strong>Vendor</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Augmented Ironworks</td><td>50</td><td>A Realm Reborn</td><td>The Ultimate Weapon</td><td>Auriana<br>Mor Dhona<br>(X:22.7, Y:6.7)</td></tr><tr><td>Augmented Shire</td><td>60</td><td>Heavensward</td><td>A Great New Nation</td><td>Bertana<br>Idyllshire<br>(X:5.9, Y:5.2)</td></tr><tr><td>Augmented Scaevan</td><td>70</td><td>Stormblood</td><td>Stormblood</td><td>Enna<br>Rhalgr’s Reach<br>(X:13.9, Y:11.6)</td></tr><tr><td>Augmented Cryptlurker</td><td>80</td><td>Shadowbringers</td><td>Shadowbringers</td><td>Aymark<br>Eulmore(X:10.2, Y:11.8)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="221" data-current-count="221" data-injectable="false">Once <em>Dawntrail</em> releases on July 2, the current Augmented gear (Credendum) will become available to purchase with Poetics, so there’s not much point running Alliance Raids for coins if you’re still thinking about it.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="70" data-current-count="291" data-injectable="false">Augmented gear costs a fixed number of poetics, depending on the item:</p> <ul data-found-items="7" data-current-count="571" data-injectable="true"> <li>Weapons (600 Poetics) <ul> <li>Paladin weapons are sold separately, costing 430 Poetics for the Sword and 170 Poetics for the Shield</li> </ul> </li> <li>Helm (355 Poetics)</li> <li>Chest (510 Poetics)</li> <li>Gloves (345 Poetics)</li> <li>Legs (510 Poetics)</li> <li>Feet (345 Poetics)</li> <li>Accessories (280 Poetics)</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="99" data-current-count="99" data-injectable="false">To get a full set of Augmented gear for a single Job class, you’ll need a total of <strong>4,065 Poetics</strong>.</p> <h2 id="h-relic-weapons" data-injectable="false"><strong>Relic weapons</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="137" data-current-count="536" data-injectable="true">If you’re currently working towards either a Zodiac or <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-anima-weapons-guide-every-quest-item-and-duty-required-for-heavensward-relic/">Anima relic</a>, then you’re definitely going to need all the Poetics you can get.</p>
 <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">Both Zodiac and Anima relic weapons require large amounts of Poetics in order to complete a single weapon. Currently, other Relic weapons (Eureka and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-begin-ffxiv-manderville-weapon-quest-endwalker-relic-guide/">Manderville</a>) require no Poetics to complete and Resistance weapons (<em>Shadowbringers</em> relics) require only 1,000 Poetics to get started.</p> <p data-characters="194" data-current-count="477" data-injectable="true">Here’s how many poetics you’ll need to complete one Relic for Zodiac and Anima weapons, if you only use Poetics to complete the required steps, rather than the alternative options available:</p>

The items worth the most are always changing, but you can use resources such as <a href="https://universalis.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Universalis</a> to check how much items are currently selling for.</p>
 <p data-characters="312" data-current-count="312" data-injectable="false">If you want some <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ffxiv-grand-company-guide-how-and-which-to-join/">GC Seals</a>, the best method to do this is by purchasing the highest level of Augmented Shield available (at this time, that’s Cryptlurker), then turning them over to the GC. With these Seals, you can buy items that sell for a profit on the Marketboard, or take your chances with Materiel Crates.</p> <h2 id="h-increase-your-desynthesis-levels" data-injectable="false"><strong>Increase your Desynthesis levels</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="612" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="275" data-injectable="false">This is a bit of an obscure option, but that doesn’t mean it isn’t an option.

<p data-characters="195" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Keeping your parties at maximum efficiency isn’t always easy, and with lots of characters to pick from in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, you may want to have a little advice on where the real power lies.</p> <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="310" data-injectable="false">Now, tier lists are not easy, so feel free to read through the multiple disclaimers I always put on advice like this before you get to the meat of the article. I’ll break the characters into three main battlefield roles and let you know where I think they lie in the pantheon of power in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-wuthering-waves-character-tier-list" data-injectable="false">Wuthering Waves character tier list</h2> <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="675" data-injectable="true">Okay, let’s get down to it. Tier Lists are hard because characters have more nuance than just their primary function. Oftentimes, it is combinations of characters that will really take each other to the next level, or perhaps items or weapons can give them a new lease on life. For simplicity’s sake, this Tier List is judging the character kits alone. </p>
 <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false">We will be doing individual guides for the characters that detail weapons to use, Echoes to use, and team comps to really take advantage of them, but that is way too complicated to take into account here. So, this is really just about the basic kit for each character rather than their potential upper limit if you get perfect weapons.</p> <p data-characters="370" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true">The final thing to note is that a lot can change at launch. Some characters will be getting buffs or kit changes, so we will take that into account when we come back to this for an update. There is also a degree of theory crafting involved in these lists, so they will constantly be updated as we explore more of the game or discover some exciting nuance of a character.</p>
 <p data-characters="665" data-current-count="665" data-injectable="true">Ultimately, I advise you to treat this Tier List as it is intended, which is as a rough benchmark of a character’s power within their role only. I’ve limited each character to one role. I’m aware this is not the approach many folks take, but I tend to assume people are looking at these lists to decide where to invest their resources. If you are considering Yinlin as a main DPS, and she is not on that list, it is because I do not think she is a good option compared to other potential characters. The character I have broken this rule for is Rover, as everyone will have them and be trying to build their team around them, one way or the other.</p>
 <h3 data-injectable="false">Main DPS Tier List</h3> <figure data-found-rows="3" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"><table><thead><tr><th>Rank</th><th>Character</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>S</td><td>Calcharo (Electro), Danjin (Havoc), Jiyan (Aero)</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>Chixia (Fusion), Encore (Fusion), Lingyang (Glacio)</td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>Rover (Spectro)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/arctic-eggs-cooking-eggs-retro-egg-flipping-simulator-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There is a recurring question in <em>Arctic Eggs</em>, asked by several characters, and repeated almost like a koan: “Do you think you can you fry eggs on top of Mount Everest?” Sometimes the answer is practical, discussing the thermodynamics of the act. Other times the answer is social or existential, addressing the potential motivations behind someone attempting the act. But uniformly the responses are cryptic, haunting, and hilarious, which are not descriptors you would anticipate about a game whose primary verb is frying eggs.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>A balanced breakfast. Credit: The Water Museum</figcaption></figure><p><em>Arctic Eggs</em> is a low-poly, sci-fi cooking simulator. I would throw in the term cyberpunk as well, but in the original bleak sense of the genre, as the last few years have not been too kind to that descriptor. The backdrop is Antarctica in 2091, in a dire city that looks almost post-Soviet. Following your attempted escape from this place, the ruler of the area, known as The Saint Of Six Stomachs, had stripped you of your main functions, reducing you to a “Poultry Peddler” whose only abilities are to walk and cook. You may be granted your freedom, but only if you cook your way to the top, feeding 27 hungry people and potentially gaining an audience with the Saint themselves.</p><figure><figcaption>Moments of kindness. Credit: The Water Museum</figcaption></figure><p><em>Arctic Eggs </em>is a fairly simple game mechanically. You control a frying pan, a low poly version of a T-fal that you may own now, because nonstick pans disintegrate after 2-3 years so it doesn’t make sense to buy anything but the budget option. You tilt the pan back and forth by moving the mouse, and increase or decrease the sensitivity with the mouse scroll. Heat is generated by moving the pan, and you must cook items evenly on all sides by flipping them with a quick wrist flick.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>My boy can work a grill. Credit: The Water Museum</figcaption></figure><p>The game starts you off with eggs, but as you progress between hungry people, new food and non-food items are introduced, each with their own challenging behaviors, from pufferfish that behave like living basketballs to cigarettes that act like slowly burning timers and are added exclusively for flavor. As far as I can tell, this is one of the few games that makes you cook eggs alongside live rifle rounds. The game has multiple difficulty settings, but the only difference is the depth of the pan’s lip, with a wok being easy, and a crepe pan being hard.</p><figure><figcaption>This is more or less how I feel all the time. Credit: The Water Museum</figcaption></figure><p>Different meals are requested by different NPCs, and this is where the mood and writing in <em>Arctic Eggs </em>shines. Each of the character models is rendered with rough and undulating skin, like you’re playing a PC game from 1999 while dosed substantially. It’s deep fried <em>Deus Ex</em>. The characters themselves speak in beguiling and brusque language, oftentimes with intentional and self-correcting typos. I found myself laughing hysterically multiple times less because of jokes and more because of how sentences are phrased.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>That's so sweet of you. Credit: The Water Museum</figcaption></figure><p>The topics are broad. A man expresses regrets wasting his 20s raising a stingray. Another espouses the benefits of drinking early because it’s good to get your crying done before it’s dark.&nbsp; Some motifs repeat, like flamingos, dolphins, cigarettes, and having a Polish girlfriend. And then you get these beautiful, eerie moments of sadness and ennui. In one scene, a fisherman describes how his son is slowly replacing every organ in his body mechanically. He does not dwell over the loss of self, as he can recognize his son despite being mechanically replaced as well, but he is spending his remaining days savoring food because they’re taking his tongue next.</p><p>There are many games that <em>Arctic Eggs</em> reminds me of, but only in its parts. It is funny and abrasive like <em>Cruelty Squad</em>, features haunting vignettes with characters like <em>NieR: Automata</em>, and it’s mechanically absurd like <em>QWOP </em>or <em>Katamari Damacy</em>. But to the game’s credit, none of those comparisons alone capture the totality. Like the taste of an egg, a fish, and a cigarette fried in the same pan, <em>Arctic Eggs </em>has an unforgettable flavor unlike anything else. And it achieves this by sandwiching slivers of absurdity and sadness between slabs of the most absurd gameplay possible. These little scenes, unconcerned with how they would break the larger reality of the world they populate, are more affecting than writing in much larger games, in part because they are cryptic and leave the player to stew in their potential significance.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Egg question. Credit: The Water Museum</figcaption></figure><p>Can you fry eggs on top of Mount Everest? The game has an answer, but I can’t claim to know personally. I do know that it’s a funny thing to think about for a few hours, a terse hypothetical and a wonderful starting off point to one of the funniest and most memorable indie games I’ve played this year. And that’s high praise indeed given the <a href="https://aftermath.site/indie-games-pc-2024-may-hades-2-little-kitty-1000xresist-manor-lords" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">competition</a>.</p><p><em>Arctic Eggs </em>is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2763670/Arctic_Eggs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">available now on Steam</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/22/f1-24-preview-hands-on-the-dynamic-handling-circuit-updates-career/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The last couple of races have given Formula 1 fans a fresh injection of high octane excitement, with Max Verstappen and Red Bull’s inevitability suddenly in doubt thanks to a resurgent McLaren at the hands of Lando Norris. Throw a healthy step forward for Ferrari, and it this could turn into a very fun season to watch. You know what else is fun? Video games, and Codemasters will be glad of the real sport’s entertainment to drum up interest for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/f1-24">F1 24</a>, which is shaping up to be another big step forward for their motorsports series.</p>
<p><iframe title="F1 24 First Look at Gameplay" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YKbpm3LQppU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Once again, Codemasters has committed to making some significant changes to the game’s simulation and physics modelling. Coming under the capitalise branding of Dynamic Handling – something shared with last year’s excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/02/ea-sports-wrc-review/">WRC</a> – there’s a new suspension kinematic system that will more accurately represent how cars move around under the massive aerodynamic loads, modelling of how tyres heat up, improved aerodynamics modelling and more.</p>


<p>It’s difficult to truly quantify how meaningful the all-new suspension model is, but without any tweaking it presents a more challenging drive than F1 23, feeling twitchier and more abrupt than its predecessor. There’s a raft of options though to tailor the handling to your personal preferences, and I was able to dial it in to a point that felt comfortable and responsive.</p>


<p>Alongside the handling, there’s been several updates made to the accuracy of each track, but in particular the development team has focused on fan favourites Silverstone and Spa-Francorchamps, as well as giving recent additions Losail and Jeddah another pass, adding extra detail to both the track elements, and the wider setting. You can see this in Saudi Arabia with the arrival of the vibrant colours of the track limits and cut-off areas, making it feel closer than ever to the real thing.</p>
<p>That commitment to replicating the real thing extends this year to the inclusion of speech from each driver, so you can hear Daniel Riccardo’s downbeat response to Lance Stroll causing yet another pile-up, or Lando Norris congratulating his team on their work. Codemasters has been able to draw from broadcast archives for these soundbites, but don’t expect hours of additional dialogue.</p>
<p>Depending on the situation, be prepared to hear the same lines time and time again, and it’s a bit disappointing not to hear them respond mid-race to events that are playing out. It’s an improvement, but an undercooked one. However, your created player can gain additional speech options via the in-game shop, or more can be unlocked via the in-game VIP pass – a premium battle pass for the game which is included if you buy the more-expensive Champions Edition.</p>
<p>What doesn’t feel realistic is the way the game treats its wider simulation, and F1 24 can certainly spit out some very odd results. We’re not just talking about the occasional car failing or crashing out, but races where a driver can have won, despite suffering significant damage earlier on in the session.</p>

<p>As it stands, there are also some oddities to the more… impactful physics model. While the way rogue wheels behave has always caused some issues, they look particularly weird here. It’s a shame that a high-force crash doesn’t result in a realistic-looking wreck, and while the aim of the game is clearly not to crash, it definitely happens with enough regularity that you’ll witness some very odd physics at play.</p>
<p>The visuals have been given a good scrub-up for 2024, and many of the tracks look better than they ever have. One of my personal favourites, Monaco, just looks that much more eye-catching than it did last year, and that’s gratifying after 12 months with the previous game. Foliage, hoardings and track furniture are fuller, more detailed and just nicer to look at, and at this early stage in our F1 24 career it’s pretty enough to be distracting at times. Luckily, you can still rewind your mistakes.</p>
<p>As part of those visual improvements, the drivers themselves look genuinely phenomenal. If you compare them to the previous year’s versions, the improvements are deeply impressive, with revised skin, hair and facial detail ensuring that it feels as though you’re part of the Formula 1 world.</p>

<p>While the current raft of drivers are stars in their own right – particularly after Drive to Survive has made them household names, even in households that don’t like F1 – one of my favourite additions is the ability to take legendary drivers like Nigel Mansell and Ayrton Senna into the career mode. While F1 23 allowed you to choose a number of iconic racers as your teammate for the season, now you can play through a further career with them, perhaps returning them to the spotlight after many years away from the grid.</p>
<p>F1 24 brings VR support to PC players, but PSVR 2 will miss out once again this year, which is disappointing given that it’s the most accessible route into home VR. I really hope that this is an update that PS5 owners can look forward to, but there’s no word on that becoming a reality.</p>
<p>Thus far, PC performance is impressively smooth, with my GeForce 3070-equipped rig sitting right on the Recommended specifications. We were able to run nearly everything at ultra-high graphic settings while maintaining a framerate over 100 FPS, and even in the early review build all of the external options and menus operated exactly as you’d hope. One of the clear improvements is the cinematic view, and replays look and perform more realistically than ever before.</p>
<p>If you’re ready for a new season of Formula 1, F1 24 is already shaping up to be a clear step up from its predecessor, bringing smart changes and improvements to what was already an enveloping driving experience.</p>

<p>According to a press release, Mattel is looking for "top-tier" studios with which to work on video game adaptations of some of its most beloved IPs, and to that end, the toy giant has apparently settled on&nbsp;<em>Bluey: The Videogame&nbsp;</em>developer Outright.</p>

<p>In said press release, Outright's Stephanie Malham says her studio prides itself on expanding major IPs into "cherished video games", which <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/15882/bluey-the-videogame" rel="noopener" target="_blank">feels</a> just a <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/14459/peppa-pig-world-adventures" rel="noopener" target="_blank">touch</a> like an <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/13427/dc-league-of-super-pets-the-adventures-of-krypto-and-ace" rel="noopener" target="_blank">overstatement</a> to me, but hey.</p>

<p>Those games are&nbsp;<em>Matchbox Driving Adventures</em>, <i>Monster High: Skulltimate Secrets</i>, and&nbsp;<em>Barbie Project Friendship</em>. No prizes for guessing which Mattel IPs they'll all be based on.</p>

<p>According to the aforementioned press release,&nbsp;<em>Matchbox Driving Adventures&nbsp;</em>will offer "high-speed competitive driving adventures", while&nbsp;<em>Barbie&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Monster High&nbsp;</em>will provide "stories that emphasize teamwork and foster friendship".</p>

<p>Whether or not that means the latter two will be primarily co-op focused remains to be seen, but more information will be available in the coming months. Better get those tenterhooks ready.</p>

All the way <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/outright-games-partners-with-crayola-for-unnamed-upcoming-games">back in 2018</a>, Outright teamed up with Crayola for the&nbsp;<em>Tony Hawk</em>-esque&nbsp;<em>Crayola Scoot</em>, which is presumably <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/6754/crayola-scoot" rel="noopener" target="_blank">another one of the publisher's "cherished" titles</a>.</p>

<p>Mattel is also already pretty well-represented in the gaming space thanks to titles like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hot-wheels-unleashed-2-turbocharged-into-high-gear">Hot Wheels Unleashed 2 - Turbocharged</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-barbie-collab"><em>Forza Horizon 5</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Barbie</em>-themed content</a>, although Outright isn't involved with either of these, naturally.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what this collaboration yields, but I'm sure the three games outlined by the two companies will be all-time classics. Stay tuned for more.</p>
