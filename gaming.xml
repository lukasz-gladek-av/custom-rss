<section><p>Though Yars Rising pays tribute to its Atari roots with arcade-style hacking games, puzzles, action-packed gameplay, and anime-style character art help the game establish a new, modern identity.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Okay, I'll admit it: Outside of my brief love affair with Galaga and the small bit of Frogger I played as a child, I've never meaningfully engaged with the vast majority of arcade games. It's my weakest area in terms of video game genres I'm knowledgeable in and as such, I walked into my appointment to play Yars Rising only minimally aware of its first entry and the impact it had at the time.</p><p dir="ltr">Upon its release in 1982, Yars' Revenge--the first entry in the Yars series--became the highest-grossing original title for the Atari 2600. It's been included in more than a few Atari classics collections, a handful "Greatest Games of All-Time'' lists, and a display on video game history at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Though part of its popularity was due to Atari's status as a video game powerhouse at the time--thus giving the studio the necessary resources to actually promote Yars' Revenge and build "hype,'' as we'd call it here in the year 2024--it was also just an incredibly solid sci-fi shooter.</p><p dir="ltr">Yet, despite its success, a follow-up to Yars' Revenge (a rail-shooter called Yar's Revenge) didn't emerge for nearly three decades and was largely met with disdain--<a href="https://issuu.com/michelfranca/docs/retro_gamer____153#google_vignette" rel="nofollow ">even from series creator Howard Scott Warshaw</a>. But after <em>another</em> decade--and another stab at regniting the Yars fandom with Yars: Recharged--Atari has recruited a new studio, Shantae and River City Girls developer WayForward, to help revitalize the series. The first challenge for WayForward? Steering Yars away from flies and aliens and into a new, flashier direction. And based on my time spent with the upcoming reiteration, I feel confident that it's going to nail it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4332732-yr_screen9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4332732" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4332732-yr_screen9.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4332732"></a><figcaption>Emi takes on a robot lurking at QoTech.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4332732-yr_screen9.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Rather than stick to Yars' arcade-shooter roots, Yars' Rising reimagines the game as a cyberpunk metroidvania. However, the game still honors its past by incorporating arcade games throughout the game via terminals that protagonist Emi "Yar" Kimura must hack in order to enhance her abilities and gain new powers. This creates the main gameplay loop as well as that metroidvania feel, as new powers mean access to new locations that were previously just out of reach.</p><p dir="ltr">It becomes very easy to feel like Samus Aran herself as you traverse the futuristic QoTech laboratory--crouching, wall-jumping, and blasting your way through obstacles and enemies--although I'd say, from what I saw, Yars lacks the same tension, complex puzzles, and hyper-satisfying sense of progression and traversal as many other titles in the genre, for better or worse. In many ways, it feels like a great starting point for people who are newer to the genre: You have fast-paced arcade minigames that require decent reflexes and add challenge (particularly for those of us who grew up after their time), some light 2D platforming and combat, and that sense of accomplishment of unlocking a new power and knowing precisely what to do with it. But where Yars Rising truly shines is in its overall aesthetic.</p><p dir="ltr">It comes as little surprise that WayForward knows how to make a game feel stylish and lively, and this is what chiefly sets the game apart from other 2D action-adventure games. Yars Rising kicks off with a comic-style opening--an homage to the Yars comic series that was released shortly after the original game--in which our Ramona Flowers-esque protagonist, Emi, frantically dresses and leaves her house to work at a job she hates. It's easy to adore Emi immediately, with her spunky attitude and outfit to match, but she's not the only lovable character in Yars Rising.</p><p dir="ltr">During the 40 or so minutes I played, I met several cute, anime-inspired characters that I am positive others will thirst for; I myself was not immune to Mrs. Davidson's good looks, pink hair, and arrogant attitude. Nearly all the game's characters boast colorful hair, stylish techwear, and bold personalities, and alongside the game's neon-lit levels and bouncy techno-pop music, this creates an overall peppy and energetic-feeling to the game. Considering your main goal is to take down a corrupt and oppressive company, it feels like a fun and very conscious choice to keep things a bit more light-hearted and anime-esque. So while the gameplay might be familiar, there was enough style and playful banter to give Yars Rising its own sense of identity and keep me engaged.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4332731-yarsrising-officialannouncementtrailer0-20screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4332731" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4332731-yarsrising-officialannouncementtrailer0-20screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4332731"></a><figcaption>The world of Yars Rising</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4332731-yarsrising-officialannouncementtrailer0-20screenshot.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Yars Rising also implements a fun system that Nier Automata fans will automatically recognize and was a very intentional pull from the sci-fi action game, according to the developers I spoke with. Emi is able to Biohack herself and equip upgrades by inserting Tetris-like blocks--each one representing a different ability--into a slotted grid. Powers and upgrades will vary in size and shape, with more simplistic powers taking up one block of space whereas more complex powers are made up of multiple blocks in a more difficult-to-place shape. Something else I really enjoyed was how even small features--such as the ability to listen to music--were dependent upon equipping the right upgrade (in this case, Emi's Earbuds).</p><p dir="ltr">Overall, I had a great time playing Yars Rising. While I didn't get the sense that it was anything particularly novel or challenging, it was a fun experience that left me wanting to see even more of Emi's world and the cute characters who inhabit it. Yars Rising is slated to come to PC, Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S on September 10, 2024.</p>

            <p>
80s movie favourite The Karate Kid is being turned into a 16-bit-style side-scrolling beat-'em-up, and it's heading to PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC on 20th September this year.
</p>
<p>
The Karate Kid: Street Rumble comes from GameMill Entertainment, the publisher behind Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl, and is firmly setting its sights on the 80s era of Karate Kid rather than Netflix's Cobra Kai continuation - which has already spawned two games itself.
</p>
<p>
Street Rumble is, somewhat surprisingly, only the second game to be directly based on the 80s movie series (the first, Atlus' NES action game The Karate Kid, arrived in 1987) and promises to feature a whole bunch of familiar faces as its 80s-set mulitplayer action unfolds.

<p>
As per Street Rumble's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-karate-kid-street-rumble-a-pixel-art-beat-em-up-announced-for-pc-and-consoles">IGN reveal</a>, Daniel Russo, Mr. Miyagi, Kumiko, and Ali Mills are all playable across the game's 12 belt-scrolling-style stages, for instance, while the likes of Johnny Lawrence, John Kreese, and Terry Silver will feature as foes.
</p>
<p>
There's not a lot else to report at present, but The Karate Kid: Street Rumble is scheduled to release for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and Steam on 20th September - and you'll find some gamplay footage in the reveal trailer above.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-division-2-team-reconsiders-seasons-2-0s-seasonal-characters/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Division 2 team recently uploaded a <a href="https://x.com/TheDivisionGame/status/1811751120508764170/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new update to X</a> in which they discuss their plans for Seasons 2.0 and the addition of Seasonal Characters. This comes after the broad feedback they received from the gaming community.</p>
<p>This comes after they received heavy backlash after announcing that they planned for everyone's character to reset to level 1 with each new season. Ubisoft commented that this was so that it felt like there was still a challenge to the game and that they wouldn't be able to steamroll through new content.</p>
<p>However, the community did not enjoy this prospect. As a result, Ubisoft Massive has reverted its original plan, opting to go forward <em>without</em> seasonal characters, a massive change for The Division 2 community. The developers have assured fans that "this change will not affect Year 6 plans, but it will require us to assess the changes necessary to the new Seasonal Experience."</p>
<p>While unsure what changes they will make to make Seasons 2.0 successful, they promise to return with news once they have ironed out the details. Once they have the information, a live stream and public test server (PTS) will be available for players to check out to get thorough research and feedback on their changes.</p>
<p>The response to the X post has been positive. The audience is mainly happy that they have decided to remove the changes they planned to implement. Currently, there are no concrete details as to what changes Ubisoft has made, but it sounds like players can keep their characters between seasons and can steamroll through the content if that is what they desire.</p>
<p>For the vast majority, the players are happy with the fact that they have reversed this decision. However, some players remain on tenterhooks while waiting for information from Ubisoft regarding what changes will be coming next. Will they be able to have fresh characters for each season and their main character, or will they be locked strictly into using their main character for the season?</p>
<p>At the moment, the community has many unanswered questions regarding the changes for Seasons 2.0 and seasonal characters. However, six years on, The Division 2 is still going strong and has a solid community, and even drastic changes cannot deter them from continuing to play the game and invest hours into it. The journey for Ubisoft hasn't been easy in creating content for this game, and trying to keep a live service game fun and fresh for <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-2-year-6-begins-today-with-first-rogues-endgame-overhaul/">six years</a> is impressive. We eagerly await what changes Ubisoft will bring for the next season.</p>

After playing a dozen hours or so of the new online shooter myself, I came away unimpressed. Sure, the game is fun in the moment and looks nice, but its story and characters are forgettable and the endgame after finishing up the campaign is a slog focused on grinding for materials to unlock new characters and gear. </p><p>Yet, a fun free game with loot and a cool grappling hook seems to be enough to make <em>The First Descendant</em> one of the most popular games this month.

On Friday, Nexon responded to this controversy, saying they took it “seriously” and promised to change the icons while calling <em>Destiny 2</em> a “globally renowned looter shooter” that was “respected” by the developers and which also inspired them “during the development process.” </p><p>Meanwhile, complaints have been raised by players that <em>First Descendant’</em>s drop rates are too low for much-needed resources to craft and unlock new characters. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamer.com/the-first-descendants-drop-rates-are-fine/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-first-descendants-drop-rates-are-fine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nexon says that the drop rates are working as intended</a></span>, but did suggest it would make changes to the game to make farming and grinding easier. </p><p>There has also been criticism of the game’s microtransactions. One big complaint is that shaders or paints for cosmetics must be bought over and over for each new skin and character. Players have also connected the poor drop rate of materials used to unlock characters with the fact that Nexon will gladly take your money in exchange for skipping all that and unlocking new characters instantly. </p><p>For now,<em> The First Descendant</em> is still doing well on Steam with, as I write this, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/app/2074920/charts/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/app/2074920/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over 170k players</a></span> currently looting and/or shooting it up in the sci-fi game.

However, the particular details for the Olympic Esports Games, such as its city, date, qualifications for prospective players, and game titles, have yet to be hashed out.</p><p>“As a ‘first’ ever Esports Olympic Games, obviously there is still much to consider and plan with the IOC, but we are committed to hosting a special event that respects and celebrates the Olympic values while boldly seizing the momentum to drive esports forward with the international platform the sport and its athletes deserve,” Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki Al Faisal, president of the Saudi Arabian Olympic and Paralympic Committee said. “The world will have an open invitation to join us in 2025 and celebrate this moment together.“</p><p>“We are very fortunate to be able to work with the Saudi NOC on the Olympic Esports Games, because it has great – if not unique – expertise in the field of esports with all its stakeholders. The Olympic Esports Games will greatly benefit from this experience,” IOC President Thomas Bach wrote. “By partnering with the Saudi NOC we have also ensured that the Olympic values are respected, in particular, with regard to the game titles on the programme, the promotion of gender equality and engagement with the young audience, which is embracing esports.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/12/gssnmb-waaarlng-1720805563099.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The Inagural Olympic Esports Games will take place in Saudi Arabia in 2025.</figcaption></figure></output><p>In its announcement, the IOC also revealed plans for the International Federation and the National Olympic Committees’ “e-version” of sports to include in the Olympic Esports Games. According to <a href="https://www.engadget.com/the-first-olympic-esports-games-will-take-place-in-saudi-arabia-in-2025-154637804.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Engadget</u></a>, this edict coincides with the organization’s esports “trial event” from last year, which saw athletes compete in Gran Turismo, Just Dance, and <a href="https://in.ign.com/fortnite/183588/news/fortnite-to-feature-in-olympic-esports-series-2023" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Fortnite</u></a>.</p><p>While the Olympic Esports Games’ games have yet to be announced, the IOC is reportedly eying partnerships with prominent video game publishers like Epic Games, Capcom, and Riot Games to have Rocket League, Street Fighter, and League of Legends take part in the inaugural event, according to <a href="https://www.lequipe.fr/Esport/Actualites/L-arabie-saoudite-accueillera-les-premiers-jeux-olympiques-de-l-esport-en-2025-league-of-legends-envisage/1481996" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>L'Equipe</u></a>. </p><p>While the announcement of the first-ever Olympic Esports Games comes as an exciting surprise to gamers around the world, it also comes with a bit of dissent. Particularly with Saudi Arabia’s <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>controversial human rights record</u></a>, which includes allegations of unjust treatment of women and members of the LGBTQ community. </p><p>This isn’t the first time Saudi Arabia has invested heavily in the gaming sphere.

<!-- cache hit 33:single/related:70f9439d1b877eaae195c050e3aace95 --><!-- empty -->
<p>Analogue has released multiple variations of the Analogue Pocket, its Game Boy-style handheld console that can play old cartridges and game ROMs using its FPGA chip. But until now, all of those designs have been riffs on the regular Pocket’s black (or white) plastic shell.</p>
<p>The company’s latest Pocket iteration might appeal more to people who prefer the solidity and durability of anodized aluminum to the cheap practicality of plastic. <a href="https://x.com/analogue/status/1811777618447888740">On July 15</a>, the company will release <a href="https://www.analogue.co/editions/pocket-aluminum">a limited run of all-aluminum Analogue Pocket consoles</a> in four different colors: white, gray, black, and a Game Boy Advance-esque indigo. The company says that "every single piece" of these consoles is "entirely CNC'd from aluminum," including not just the frame but also all of the buttons.</p>
<p>The new material will cost you though: each aluminum Pocket sells for $500, over twice as much as the $220 price of a regular plastic Pocket.</p>
<p>The aluminum versions of the Pocket will run the exact same software as the standard plastic ones, and will be compatible with all the same cartridges and accessories. Analogue's site doesn't compare the weight of the aluminum and plastic Pocket consoles, though intuitively we'd expect the metal one to be heavier. The aluminum consoles begin shipping on July 17.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/analogue-pocket-metal-2.jpg" data-height="1200" data-width="1821" alt="An exploded version of the new Pocket; even the buttons are aluminum."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/analogue-pocket-metal-2.jpg" data-height="1200" data-width="1821">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> An exploded version of the new Pocket; even the buttons are aluminum.</p><p>Analogue</p></figcaption></figure>

<p>When the Pocket first launched in late 2021, ongoing supply chain disruptions and high demand led to monthslong wait times for the initial models. Things have gotten slightly better since then—you can't simply open Analogue's store on any given day and just buy one, but the basic black and white plastic models restock with some regularity. Analogue has also released multiple special edition runs of the handheld, including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/analogues-supercharged-modern-day-game-boy-now-glows-in-the-dark/">one made of glow-in-the-dark plastic</a> and <a href="https://x.com/analogue/status/1725544375134921084">a colorful series of models</a> that recall <a href="https://gameboy.fandom.com/wiki/Game_Boy_Play_it_Loud_campaign">Nintendo's mid-90s "Play It Loud!" hardware refresh</a> for the original Game Boy.</p>
<p>As much as we liked the Pocket in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/12/analogue-pocket-review-the-greatest-game-boy-ever-made/">our original review</a>, the hardware has gotten much more capable thanks to a series of post-launch firmware updates. In the summer of 2022, Analogue added OpenFPGA support to the pocket, allowing its FPGA chip to emulate consoles like the NES, SNES, Sega Genesis, and others aside from the portable systems that the Pocket was designed to emulate. Updates toward the end of 2023 allowed those third-party emulation cores to use their own display filters, replicating the look of classic CRT TVs and other displays.</p>
<p>The updates have also fixed multiple bugs in the system. The latest update is version 2.2, released back in March, which primarily adds support for the Analogue Pocket Adapter Set that allows other kinds of vintage game cartridges to plug in to the Pocket's cartridge slot.</p>

Including them in The Veilguard would mark a significant change in direction. However, Busche wouldn't reveal whether the game would also include "bottom nudity." Other games have, but that may still be a bridge too far for Dragon Age to cross.</p><p>Fans will be able find out for themselves soon enough.

			<p>NEXON's The First Descendant launched last week on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. The free-to-play looter shooter game immediately <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-descendant-enters-steam-top-10-chart-on-launch-day-despite-mixed-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">entered</a> Steam's Top 10 live chart (despite mixed reviews from users on Steam), and it looks like it has continued to perform well. Today, the official Twitter/X account of The First Descendant <a href="https://x.com/FirstDescendant/status/1811716560031215773" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrated</a> reaching 10 million players across all platforms in the first week.</p>
<p>We don't have split numbers, of course. However, SteamDB <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2074920/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registered</a> a concurrent player peak of 264K five days ago. Estimates of 'owners' on Valve's Steam range from 1.37 million players (<a href="https://vginsights.com/game/2074920?utm_source=SteamDB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to VG Insights</a>) to 3.19 million (<a href="https://gamalytic.com/game/2074920?utm_source=SteamDB" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as reported by Gamalytic</a>).</p>
<p>NEXON's game also caused some controversy when it was found (<a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/07/07/the-first-descendant-is-using-barely-changed-destiny-2-icons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Forbes</a>) to have employed several skill icons that resembled those used by Bungie in Destiny 2. The development team has now shared a statement <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-dev-nexon-promises-to-change-controversial-icons-after-destiny-plagiarism-accusations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to IGN</a> addressing those allegations:</p>
<p><em>The First Descendant, as a looter shooter game, was developed with a deep affection and respect for other games in the genre. Destiny 2, being a globally renowned looter shooter game, is also personally admired and respected by the team, and it has served as an inspiration during the development process. We have taken the concerns raised seriously and decided to make adjustments to ensure that the imagery that may appear similar clearly reflects the unique identity of our game. We will continue to improve the game for fans of the looter shooter genre.</em></p>
<p>Regardless of the inspiration for the icons, there's no doubt that The First Descendant drew a lot from what is still the king of looter shooter games despite Bungie's many ups and <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-destiny-2-total-sony-takeover-feared-soul-crushing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">downs</a>.</p>
<p>By the way, the developers deployed a hotfix (version 1.0.2) yesterday, adding the 'Start Public Operation' function (matchmaking) to Infiltration Operations (Hard). There's also a brief Director's comment on the changes:</p>
<p><em>The Dev Team acknowledges the community's concern about the monotonous patterns of Named Monsters and strives to enhance them. In particular, we've noted that the pattern involving breaking spheres in a specific order isn't appropriate for public matching and have decided to remove it immediately.</em><br>
<em>As new patterns are developed, we will soon update the patterns of existing Named Monsters one by one. As Named Monsters frequently appear in Hard difficulty and Special Operations, we will continue working towards diversifying their patterns.</em></p>
<p>On the optimization front, the developers at NEXON improved the stability of the shader preparation process by reducing the CPU load during shader generation. They also reduced GPU memory usage when set to&nbsp;High or higher quality.</p>
<p>Today, NEXON also announced the permanent ban of 3481 users from The First Descendant, with a publicly available list <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/news/2601613" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the official website</a>. These users either created, distributed, or used unauthorized software (e.g., cheats and hacks).</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Techland Is The Latest Dev To Issue a Return to Office Order]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/techland-return-to-work-order/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/techland-is-the-latest-dev-to-issue-a-return-to-office-order.926064/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/techland-return-to-work-order/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It has been reported by a Polish news outlet that Techland has issued a ‘return to office’ order ‘suddenly and without consultation’, requesting that remote working staff change their operating model and head back into bricks-and-mortar offices. The report claims that anonymous sources close to the company voiced their fair share of concerns about the move, citing inadequate office facilities, amongst other things.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-going-old-school">Going Old School</h2>



<p>COVID-19 forced a work-from-home revolution that saw hundreds of millions of people worldwide start logging into their workplaces from their living rooms and home offices. It was a prominent move for developers, with some games being built by fully remote teams – which at the time was an amazing thing. </p>



<p>However, now that times have changed, major developers are pushing their employees <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-return-to-office-mandates-are-about-control-and-nothing-else/">back into the office</a>. Months ago, Rockstar issued a return-to-office order, stating that security was the driving reason for the change. Ubisoft also requested that employees head back into the many offices located around the world.</p>



<p>As financial concerns rose for some developers, the lack of workers in the office meant that many studios and locations were shut down, with companies opting to scrap offices to recoup some losses rather than force employees back into them.</p>



<p>In a new report, it has been explained that Techland is bringing employees back into the office with a few caveats. This report was published <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/techland-moving-most-roles-to-on-site-or-hybrid-model" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by GamesIndustry</a>, with Techland explaining:</p>

<p>The First Descendant, a free-to-play ‘looter shooter’ from Nexon, was released on July 2 to mixed reviews. For many, it felt like it was a rehash of some other titles, namely Destiny and Warframe, and the most recent topic of debate is circulating around whether or not Nexon simply flipped assets or plagiarised Bungie’s sci-fi shooter in a few ways while creating The First Descendant.</p>



<p>Despite the meddling controversies, it seems The First Descendant has been a whopping success. Nexon recently revealed that 10 million players found their way into the game across all platforms in just one week.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-make-it-free-and-that-ll-happen">Make It Free and That’ll Happen</h2>



<p>Much of the success of The First Descendant can be attributed to the fact that the game doesn’t cost a penny to play. That alone will entice millions of players. The real test is keeping those players engaged – you can bet your last dollar that the player count will crash after just a couple of weeks on the market.</p>



<p>In a post on X, Nexon wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve reached 10 million Descendants in just 7 days! Thank you all for your tremendous support and love. It means everything to us. We will do our best to bring you great experiences. Can’t wait to continue this journey together!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This free-to-play, live-service title has had some teething issues, with players issuing mixed reviews across the board. It’s no big secret that The First Descendant operates a fairly expansive monetisation model that has packed the game to the brim with microtransactions, but by now, that’s part and parcel of the free-to-play life. </p>



<p>Plenty of comments have also been made regarding some of the character designs in The First Descendant. Instead of a solid story or satisfying quests, Nexon opted to include beautiful character models, some of which boast revealing outfits that rival Stellar Blade’s Eve. It takes more than an attractive group of playable characters to pull the wool over the eyes of the gaming community these days.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-xbox-game-pass-amazon-prime-cancel<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This week, both Microsoft and EA <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-game-pass-rot-economy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">embraced the rot economy</a>, purposefully enshittifying Xbox Game Pass and <em>Apex Legends</em>’ battle pass, respectively, in hopes that some number somewhere will continue to go up. It’s grim stuff, but there’s a silver lining: This strategy has a breaking point, and it’s within our power to decide where it lies. On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we talk about that.</p><p>This time around, we discuss the progressive worsening of services both in and out of games, but also the fact that we don’t need all of these things – many of which are redundant – and that it can be freeing to cut yourself loose from them. People are getting fed up en masse; milking the whales for every last penny only works when there are still whales left to milk.&nbsp;</p><p>Then we talk about the <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-australia-closed-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sudden death of Kotaku Australia</a>, a site which – contrary to popular belief – Luke does not and never has worked for. After that, we discuss some TV shows, one of which, <em>The Boys</em>, has <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-boys-season-4-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">really fallen off</a>, and the other of which, <em>The Acolyte</em>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-acolyte-star-wars-controversy-ratings-this-is-all-terrible" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">never really got going to begin with</a>. Lastly: Cubes.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that more people can hear the good word of Aftermath, a subscription-based service that will shut down before it succumbs to enshittification, largely because we are not competent enough business people to enact such a scheme.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> In the comments under my blog, some people were discussing how we’re not really trapped in this and you don’t have to use these services. You can cancel Amazon Prime, a thing I constantly think of doing because I never use it. I wonder if there’s a critical mass [where that starts to have an impact]. Remember when Kash Hill <a href="https://gizmodo.com/i-tried-to-block-amazon-from-my-life-it-was-impossible-1830565336" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote that article</a> never trying to use Amazon products for Gizmodo? And it was impossible. Her whole life toppled over. I wonder if you cancel all your services and you never use Google and you just get away from every enshittified service, where does that lead?</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>Yeah, I canceled my Amazon the day after <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lukeplunkett.com/post/3kwoqwvrqtq2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that ad thing</a> came up [on Prime Video]. I was just like “Fuck it. I don’t need it anymore.” I just felt like, on principle, that it was really time to stop having this shit shoveled to me. And that’s why I talked about it as the straw that broke my back. Now that I’m talking about it out loud, this is like therapy. It was a much bigger deal than I thought at the time.</p><p>I used to be a Game Pass subscriber a long time ago, and I was like “There’s no value for me in this versus what I’m paying.” I used to be a PlayStation Plus subscriber. Same deal. There’s a cost of living crisis, or my mortgage has gone up, or my bills have gone up, and you’re trying to squeeze me for more money for less stuff for fucking video games? Absolutely not.</p><p>It feels good to do it. It feels… liberating is probably too strong a word, but you don’t have to use any of these services. That Amazon blog that you talked about, you don’t have to use Amazon. You don’t have to use anything. You don’t have to use Uber. Life has long existed without these services and will exist without them again at some point in the future.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I think the only counterargument – and the sort of larger problem – is that those services destroyed what people were doing before. It’s much harder to find a taxi now because Uber showed up. It’s much harder to find reliable brick-and-mortar retailers because Amazon exists, and a lot of places have gone out of business.</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> Right, but here’s what I was getting to with that: If you extrapolate my breaking point to everybody else, everybody else is gonna have a breaking point. While these services have made life difficult – especially in the United States; I’ll grant that what I’m saying is tainted by my own experiences here [in Australia] where we have nowhere near that level of submission to these kinds of corporate elements – everybody is going to have a breaking point. This is what the whole “rot economy” is about: They can’t keep jacking up prices while offering less for everything, because everyone will break at some point. There will eventually be a point where you say “no.” That’s gonna come for all these services.&nbsp;</p><p>Is that exciting? Is it destructive? I don’t know. We’ve seen how destructive the slow inroads that Uber and Amazon and other huge line-goes-up corporations have made into our daily lives [are]. What happens when we stop using those, and they don’t work, but the things that they broke aren’t here anymore either? I don’t know.&nbsp;</p><p>But on a personal basis, I can’t vouch for it enough. It feels great to feel like you’re part of that move away, even if it’s the tiniest step. You sort of feel like “Well, it’s not just me. It’s not like I’m going vegan, and it’s an entirely personal decision.” It’s if everybody is making a decision that affects the bottom line of these companies, then eventually that does have an impact on them. I just wonder where everyone else’s breaking point will be. Is it when an Uber is $40 to go five minutes? Is it when Netflix costs $40 a month? I don’t know. But no one’s gonna keep paying more and more for everything, because that’s not how things work.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I think an easy starting point also is recognizing that a lot of these services are entirely redundant. A few months ago, I canceled Hulu and then realized that I was barely ever using it anyway. Once it was out of my life, I was like “What was I doing with it in the first place? Why did I spend hundreds of dollars on this thing that I barely ever use?” Recently I did the same thing with Netflix, and then I realized that I hadn’t used Netflix in, like, six months for anything of real substance. Game Pass I hadn’t used since <em>Starfield </em>came out. These things are built in part to just sort of sit around and not be used by you, but still extract money from you.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s also just the simple matter that you don’t need a Netflix and a Hulu. There’s so much content on both of them. You only have so many hours in the day. I barely spend any of my time watching TV or playing games relative to everything else that I do, because life is full of activities and obligations. Really, you just need, like, one service, maybe. And then half the time, you’re just gonna end up scrolling on your phone anyway, so you won’t use that either.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Call of Duty is getting another major crossover when Season 5 kicks off at the end of the month. In a post on social media, it’s been announced that Call of Duty and WWE are joining forces to bring the world of pro wrestling to Modern Warfare 3.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The simple tease that was posted mentions that more information is coming soon with them coming to the game “starting July 24.”</p>



<p>“It’s about to be a smackdown,” the official post reads.</p>



<p>It’s unclear exactly what will be a part of this crossover, but it should be expected that the game will get some sort of WWE operator. We’ll have to wait and see exactly what else comes when the reveal happens in the next couple of weeks.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time that WWE has done a crossover with games. Earlier this year, the company did a crossover with Fortnite to bring Bianca Belair and Becky Lynch skins into the game.</p>



<figure><figcaption>WWE has a history collaborating with popular games</figcaption></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/12/24197221/apex-legends-battle-pass-incorrect-esports-payments<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Apex Legends</em> can’t seem to catch a break. The game has been plagued with a pair of high-profile issues for the last few weeks.</p><p>First up, earlier this week, the hero shooter’s developer, Respawn Entertainment, announced <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/battle-pass-update">it was retooling the game’s battle pass</a>. For season 22 and beyond, the battle pass will now be split into two halves, with 60 levels for each half. Additionally, players will no longer be able to purchase a battle pass with AC or <em>Apex</em>’s in-game currency. “The decision to move from AC to real world currency is not one that we made lightly, but it does allow us to decrease the price of Premium+ for our community,” the announcement read.</p><p>Players responded negatively to the changes, accusing Respawn and publisher EA of nickel-and-diming its customers. Respawn touts that the new system is a way to “increase value” for players. But eliminating the ability to pay for the battle pass with currency earned in-game (previously, players could earn enough coins by completing the battle pass progression to purchase another one without spending more real money) is seen by many as a way for the studio to squeeze more money out of a dwindling player base. The backlash progressed to the point where players <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/battle-royale/apex-legends-gets-the-ol-steam-review-bomb-treatment/">began review-bombing the game on Steam</a>, taking its former, mostly positive rating down to mostly negative. </p><p>On the esports side, <em>Apex Legends</em> suffered another embarrassment as players participating in the <em>Apex Legends</em> Global Series tournament <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24196854/apex-legends-global-series-agls-pro-league-wrong-prize-payment">reported incorrect payments to their accounts</a>. One player received $100,000 in their account after only a few days of play. Other players reported similar erroneous payments totaling either too much or too little. The tournament’s organizer, ESL Faceit, took responsibility, calling it a “systems error” that resulted in incorrect payments. In a statement to <em>Polygon</em> a spokesperson for the tournament wrote, “As the partner responsible for prize fulfillment, we’re working to quickly resolve this issue and ensure that all players receive the correct prize payouts.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Playing as the eponymous character, you find yourself in Heaven, only you’re an assassin-for-hire helping to clean out all the demons in the lower levels of the kingdom of God. In order to do so, you and the other Neons—sinners plucked from Hell to earn a spot in Heaven for killing the most demons—must use Soul Cards scattered around nearly 100 levels to exorcize the demons and get to the bottom of what the hell is exactly going on.<br></p><p>This premise sets <em>Neon White</em>, a speedrunning first-person shooter, into motion. However, it’s even more complicated and fascinating than that. Soul Cards basically function as stand-ins for guns, and each has a set number of uses, as well as an alternate ability if they are discarded. For example, the pistol is a card called Elevate, because discarding it gives you an extra jump. An SMG can be discarded in order to do a ground pound, and discarding a shotgun propels you forward as a fireball. Eventually, levels become so multi-tiered, not to mention replete with mixtures of these cards, that it stops feeling like a shooter and much more like the wildest 3D platformer with the slickest movement mechanics.<br></p><p>If that sounds involved, that’s because it is, and it’s only one facet of a busy, <em>busy </em>game. <em>Neon White </em>also doubles as a visual novel with dating sim elements, including hunting down gifts to give to characters around the hub area, which unlocks personal side quests and missions themed for the character’s personality. This is how you get to know the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/neon-white-steam-reviews-pc-overwhelmingly-positive-1849089380&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/neon-white-steam-reviews-pc-overwhelmingly-positive-1849089380">exceptionally horny</a></span> cast of <em>Neon White</em>, which is composed of other Neons who White seems to know from his days in the world of the living. Among them is Neon Green, who serves as the game’s primary antagonist, the bro-ish himbo Neon Yellow, your incredibly sultry ex Neon Red, and Neon Violet, the poster child of DDLG relationship dynamics. No, I will not spell that out for you, that’s between you, God, and your Google search bar.</p><p>In tandem, it all makes for a game that is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/neon-white-fps-platformer-puzzle-speedrun-dating-sim-sw-1849107271&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/neon-white-fps-platformer-puzzle-speedrun-dating-sim-sw-1849107271"><em>delightfully</em> all over the place</a></span>. One moment you’re pulling the sickest shit in some level to try and get the best time possible—maybe even trying to outrank your friends on <em>Neon White</em>’s leaderboards—and the next you’re in a fan-service anime beach episode with Neon Red and Violet, complete with artwork of them in bathing suits. One second you’re in a life-or-death boss battle, and the very next you could be in a scene where White is canonically belting My Chemical Romance’s “Welcome To The Black Parade” at a karaoke bar in Heaven of all places.</p><p>All of this is set to one of the coolest electronic soundtracks composed by the duo Machine Girl, and did I mention that White is voiced by Steven Blum, the voice of <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>’s Spike Spiegel? So many aspects of <em>Neon White</em> feel wrapped up in this fevered Y2K aesthetic, which extends to many of the characters designs and direction, as well as its broader cringe-inducing tone. My advice? It <em>wants </em>to be that corny, so steer into the skid rather than fight it. You’ll enjoy the game so much more this way.</p><p>What are you waiting for? What part of all that <em>didn’t </em>sell you on the most buckwild game you’ll pick up on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866">Game Pass</a></span> all year? You have shootouts in Heaven alongside busty assassins who may or may not kill you. What else could you want out of a game, or art for that matter?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
