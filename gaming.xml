			<p>With <strong>Ubisoft's</strong> massive organizational shake-up and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/"><strong><em>"major reset</em></strong>"</a> officially revealed last month, there have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/">a lot of changes at the company</a>. Even before it was properly revealed, though, big changes had been made, with the establishment of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">Vantage Studios</a></strong> and the departure of the former head of the <strong>Assassin's Creed</strong> franchise, <strong></strong><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-marc-alexis-cote-sues-ubisoft-1-3-million/">Marc-Alexis Côté</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Today, we learned who would be replacing Côté, with three veteran Assassin's Creed developers <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-ca/article/3cKfpuehIapKJglmjn3EdM">at the helm of the franchise</a> for the foreseeable future. The first is the new head of the brand, <strong>Martin Schelling,</strong> who has been with Ubisoft since 2003. He has worked on the AC series since <strong>AC: Revelations,</strong> where he was a producer. He was also a producer on <strong>AC IV: Black Flag</strong>, and then a senior producer on <strong>AC: Origins</strong> and <strong>AC: Valhalla</strong>. He moved further up the ladder since then and was most recently the chief production officer under the old organizational structure.</p>



<p>Second, is <strong>Jean Guesdon</strong>, who has been named the head of content for the Assassin's Creed brand. Fans of the series may recognize Guesdon as the creative director behind both AC IV: Black Flag and AC: Origins. After 17 years with Ubisoft, he left the company in 2018 to become an advisor at Classcraft and then moved to <strong>Behavior Interactive</strong> to be the studio's senior creative director. That only lasted a year, and in 2024, he came back to Ubisoft to take on the director of strategic visualization role, before now becoming the head of content for the entire AC brand.</p>



<p>Last but not least is <strong>François de Billy</strong>, who will become the head of production excellence in this new structure. He has remained with Ubisoft since 2001, where he initially worked on the first <strong>Splinter Cell</strong> game on the original Xbox. He's also been with the AC series since its beginnings, working as a production manager on the first AC game, associate producer on <strong>AC II</strong>, and as production manager on AC IV: Black Flag, AC: Origins, and AC: Valhalla. His most recent role has been the global senior production director, which he has held since 2021.</p>

<p>"<em>It is wonderful to be back after all these years. Assassin’s Creed has been a defining part of my professional life and being back feels like coming home. This universe, these characters, these worlds, and of course the community have always meant so much to me</em>," said Guesdon in a post shared to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1rclibk/an_update_on_the_future_of_assassins_creed_meet/">Assassin's Creed Reddit page</a> from Ubisoft's official account.</p>



<p>"<em>I’m&nbsp;especially grateful to be sharing this journey with all of you&nbsp;again, and&nbsp;look forward to sharing more about the next steps ahead for the franchise.</em> <em>Until then...Nothing is True. Everything is Permitted</em>"</p>



<p>For all of Ubisoft's recent woes, the Assassin's Creed brand remains its <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-third-quarter-growth-thanks-to-assassins-creed-overperformance/">biggest driver of revenue</a> during its current troubles. Placing the franchise in the hands of three people who clearly have a lot of familiarity with it, including one person who was a key member in creating one of the most beloved entries in the series, should point to a brighter future for both Ubisoft and Assassin's Creed. That's the hope, at least.</p>

Helix: Descent N Ascent sounds like it should be a mascot platformer starring a jaunty DNA molecule with floating Rayman hands, whose special power is making stuff go up and down. Up and down the evolutionary ladder, even! A platform game in which you can evolve and devolve your character at will, to solve different puzzles? Good lord, we’ll make one million dollars out of this! Somebody get me the CEO of Midway. 
</p>
<p>
Alas for my career prospects, Midway is no more. And Helix is not a mascot platformer, probably to its benefit. As revealed by the new Steam demo, it’s a slow and atmospheric puzzler in which you investigate a fallen civilisation, while chasing your doppelganger. You being a lanky Area-51-looking lad, who acquires paranormal powers and must weave them into solutions for terrain puzzles of the Pressure Plate N Lever variety.</p> <!--more-->
<p>It all takes place in a monochrome world of scraped and sinuous thorns, pipes and spiral shells, whose touchstones span “1980s black-and-white indie comics, 1990s manga, and 1970s Franco-Belgian comics”. Do not strain your entorhinal cortex attempting to visualise these entangled references. Check out the trailer instead.

<p>
This is certainly far too swankypoo for Midway - immortal creators of Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Mis-Edventures, to say nothing of Jackie Chan Stuntmaster - but some of your powers do probably qualify as telekinesis, which means that Helix can be mentioned in the same breath as Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy without starting a pub brawl (I patronise a very specific kind of pub). The first power you get lets you conjure blocks and shove them around. Then you get the ability to fly a little explodable drone that resembles your head. There are games within the game, including an eerie little tribute to Donkey Kong.
</p><p>
The screenshots may suggest artists doodling at random, but those single screen rooms join up into a larger maze that has definite mystique, reminding me of Amanita’s creations here and there. The puzzles aren’t that brain-fizzing so far, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2736370/Helix_Descent_N_Ascent/">the Steam page</a> suggests that things will escalate. “Play in 25 distinctive ways, jumping between 3 levels of complexity while you explore the barren lands of Helix.” The full game is out later this year.

            <p>A trio of long-time Assassin's Creed developers will lead the series into its "next era" now that it's under the umbrella of Vantage Studios, Ubisoft's new sub-company partly funded by Tencent. Martin Schelling, Jean Guesdon, and François de Billy are being handed the reins.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As outlined in Ubisoft <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3cKfpuehIapKJglmjn3EdM/new-leadership-team-set-to-shape-the-next-era-of-assassins-creed">blog post</a>, Schelling's taking over the role of head of the Assassin’s Creed brand. He'll be responsible for the series "overall strategy and long-term vision" and has been credited in production roles on every entry since 2011’s Assassin's Creed Revelations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Guesdon's been appointed head of content with his responsibilities being to drive "creative direction, support individual games, and guide the future of Assassin’s Creed while staying true to its core DNA". He's worked on the series since Assassin's Creed 2, serving as creative director for both Black Flag and Origins.</p>
<p>Finally, François de Billy's been bestowed the loft title of head of production excellence, so naturally he'll be trying to sharpen up and evolve processes on that end of game making. His Ubi tenure in production jobs stretches all the way back to the original Assassin's Creed.</p><p>Martin, Jean and François have collaborated closely on multiple flagship Assassin’s Creed games throughout the years, across creative, production, and brand strategy," Ubisoft wrote. "Over the next few weeks, they will transition from their current roles to formally join the Assassin’s Creed leadership team alongside Andrée-Anne Boisvert, producer for Assassin’s Creed’s cross-brand initiatives and head of technological excellence, and Lionel Hiller, vice president of brand and go-to-market Strategy, where they are set to steer the brand’s ambitious new chapter."</p>
<p>LinkedIn profile updates for the exec masses it seems. These moves come after former Assassin's Creed series lead Marc-Alexis Côté <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ex-assassins-creed-lead-says-leaving-ubisoft-wasnt-his-choice-instead-down-to-restructure-musical-chairs">departed Ubisoft last year</a>. He's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ex-assassins-creed-lead-sues-ubisoft-for-around-1-million-alleging-his-exit-was-a-disguised-dismissal">subsequently sued Ubisoft for damages</a>, alleging he was left with no choice but to resign, having been offered new roles he viewed as demotions amid the round of corporate musical chairs that came with the formation of Vantage Studios.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-games-ranked/</link>
            <guid>1443976</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Resident Evil is one of those franchises that everyone knows worldwide. From the claustrophobic confines of the Spencer Mansion to a cold, isolated village in Romania, to a scorching setting in Africa, fans have seen and done it all. Thankfully, Capcom continues to make new games, and with new projects being developed, let’s tap into the past and rank the main Resident Evil Games.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming is not ranking <em>every </em><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil/" id="259" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil</a> game, as we’ll be here all day. No one wants to know if the mess that is Umbrella Corps has enough T-Virus in the tank to fend off competition from Operation Raccoon City! No, 10 Resident Evil games are the subject of this ranked list, and it’s predominantly what are considered the mainline games in the series.</p>



<p>Controversy and cold takes are sure to ensue.</p>







<h2 id="h-every-resident-evil-mainline-game-ranked">Every Resident Evil Mainline Game Ranked</h2>



<h3 id="h-10-resident-evil-zero">10. Resident Evil Zero</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are always two immediate bones of contention for a Resident Evil ranked list: Who comes out on top, and who collects the Wooden Spoon. For my money, Resident Evil Zero earns the cutlery because it just isn’t that good, and one of the main reasons it’s <strong>borderline unplayable is the inventory system</strong>, which decided to do away with the traditional, magic inventory box system and have items be strewn around the game—leading to excessive backtracking.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-xbox-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is Resident Evil Requiem On Xbox Game Pass?</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Billy and Rebecca’s storage space is so small that you’d think every item you were carrying was the size of a grandfather clock. It takes ‘survival horror’ to an exaggerated degree, and it doesn’t help that Zero has uninspired enemies and bosses and doesn’t boast a compelling story. Only a remake, making necessary gameplay improvements, could improve its future standing.</p>







<h3 id="h-9-resident-evil-6">9. Resident Evil 6</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>You thought this would be last, didn’t you? Resident Evil 6 is <em>hilarious</em>. <strong>It’s so unhinged and unashamedly bonkers that you have no choice but to laugh at how outlandish and unserious it is</strong>. It’s no secret that Capcom’s fourth and fifth numbered games veered away from the intense survival horror aspects of the originals, but Resident Evil 6 goes so far off the beaten path that it ends up in Narnia.</p>



<p>The idea of multiple campaigns and the chance to use several iconic fan-favorites is a wonderful idea, but the execution is woefully hit and miss (mostly miss). Leon’s campaign is the clear standout, paying homage to Resident Evil’s roots, and it can be unironically enjoyable. If you cut Jake’s and Chris’ campaigns and extended Leon’s and Ada’s, there would actually be a pretty good Resi game here. Instead, it’s seen as the catalyst for change—causing Capcom to go back to the drawing board afterward, and if you want to have this in the number ten spot, I don’t blame you.</p>



<h3 id="h-8-resident-evil-3-remake">8. Resident Evil 3 Remake</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Do you go with the remake or the original? Another question that applies to several entries on this Resident Evil games ranked list. For convenience and relevance, the remakes are getting the nod, which is why the Resident Evil 3 Remake ranks so low. There are just better games, for one thing, but the remake loses a lot of the heart and soul of the original—and content.</p>



<p><strong>The Nemesis encounters are terrifying</strong>, but few and far between, and feel quite inorganic. Also, why is one of gaming’s most distinguishable enemies wearing a giant bin liner? Jill is fantastic, and so is the narrative, and Nemesis will still make you change your underwear after every showdown. You might enjoy the original more, but here, the Resi 3 Remake comes in at number eight.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-resident-evil-village">7. Resident Evil Village</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>If Resident Evil 7: Biohazard was the game to get the franchise back on the rails, Village quickly gets bored and taps into the franchise’s bad aspects again. <strong>Village pretty much peaks once you finish up the Castle Beneviento</strong> portion of the game, and given how much hype there was for Lady Dimitrescu, her role is more stunted than it should’ve been.</p>



<p>Village looks and feels spectacular and leans more heavily into Resident Evil 4 for inspiration. You’re not short of action, but the game feels linear, and the story is somewhat disjointed. There’s also too much action again—we won’t even touch on Chris Redfield’s Call of Duty action sequence at the end of the game. Resident Evil Village is fine and fun, but it’s a definite step back.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-resident-evil-5">6. Resident Evil 5</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>It needs to be said: <strong>This is the most underrated Resident Evil game</strong>, and it’s not even close. Five unfairly gets the flak for being the first true ‘non-Resident Evil game.’ Indeed, the sun-scorched tropics of Africa don’t scream dark, despair, and desperation, but the intense Manjini sequences instil a different breed of scares and tension.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming:</strong> <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-trophies-achievement-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem Trophy List</a></li>
</ul>



<p>The game’s antiquated control scheme shows its age, though, making some battles far harder than they need to be and frustrating. Lots of Resident Evil 5 involves fighting multiple enemies in tight spaces, and the tank-like controls can leave you wanting to punch more than just boulders. I also have to say how much I love getting the tiniest scratch, only for Sheva to blast me with a full First Aid Spray. Still, the game’s mission structure is a blast, and there’s some seriously good gameplay here—plus a decent story with appearances from Wesker and Jill.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-resident-evil-7-biohazard">5. Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</h3>

<p>One of my biggest complaints with Resident Evil games is that they have a tendency to fall flatter than a pancake toward the end. The first two-thirds of Resident Evil 7 are nothing short of exceptional, and it’s unbelievable how much tension and panic the new first-person perspective adds. Jack Baker’s dynamic AI keeps you on your toes, and it has some of the best boss battles in Resident Evil history. If you really want to hate yourself, play this in VR!</p>



<p>So, where does it go wrong? Ethan Winters is the most boring and non-descript hero (he improves in Village), the delicate pacing descends into a tired slog of combat once you reach the ship, and the final boss fight and ending overall are just such a letdown from the game’s promising early hours. If you savor the first huge chunk of the title, you have the most survival-horror-driven entry since Resident Evil 3, and it might be the best atmosphere Capcom has ever delivered.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-resident-evil">4. Resident Evil</h3>

<p>It would be a crime to put this any lower. The original 1996 Resident Evil is the type of game that should adorn the hallways of any video game museum or archive. Its influence is immeasurable, and it managed to create a disgustingly tense and titillating experience with limited 90s gaming tech. However, this entry is based on the 2002 GameCube remake, as it remains the optimal way to enjoy it—for now.</p>



<p>The methodical pacing ensures you get a nice snippet of Zombie action with limited supplies before finding items, solving puzzles, and SNAKE-ing your way through the Spencer Mansion and beyond. The story is subpar as it’s finding its feet, and the legendary dialogue is so bad it’s…well, bad. Regardless, many of the games you play in 2026 have likely been influenced by Resident Evil in one way or another, and it remains a classic and staple of the survival horror genre it created.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-resident-evil-code-veronica-x">3. Resident Evil Code: Veronica X</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Resident Evil Code: Veronica was a system-selling monster that dwarfed many of its contemporaries at the time. Then, Resident Evil Code: Veronica X made some subtle additions, making it the most complete way to play Code: Veronica. There’s something special about getting a Chris and Claire story, and unlike Resident Evil 7 and 8, this is one of the best stories that actually gets better the further you progress.</p>



<p>Writing this list in 2026 is tricky because there’s a common complaint about the older games that rears its head again: Controls. It was a deliberate design choice by Capcom early on that grows very tiresome in subsequent releases—which is why recent games have been a delight with their freeing movement. The story really pulls its weight here and makes Code Veronica worth playing again…and again.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-resident-evil-4-remake">2. Resident Evil 4 Remake</h3>

<p>Now for bone of contention number two: Resident Evil 4 or Resident Evil 2? It all depends on what YOU are looking for in a Resident Evil game. As this is Insider Gaming’s list (and my thoughts), I prefer brains over braun, which is why Resident Evil 4 takes the second spot. The remake highlights why the fourth mainline game was so groundbreaking at the time and still holds up. It seamlessly blends action, survival sequences, and epic boss fights, and delivers a compelling (and kooky) story throughout its extended duration.</p>

</ul>



<p>It’s much longer than most Resident Evil games, giving you real value for money. Nearly everything about it is memorable: The opening village siege, the cart ride, the monster on the lake—it’s Resident Evil heritage. While the game is action-oriented, there’s still plenty of horror. Seeing a Garrador fills my body with panic, and hearing a Regenrator is still enough to make me want to turn the game off.</p>



<p>Babysitting Ashley does hurt the pacing, I’m not gonna lie. It’s one aspect of the game I always hate and dread, but regardless, this is a masterpiece.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-resident-evil-2-remake">1. Resident Evil 2 Remake</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another masterpiece is Resident Evil 2: I haven’t a single bad thing to say about this game. When it was revealed that Capcom was remaking Resident Evil 2 with a new third-person camera, the Resi community went into overdrive. Yet, the remake keeps everything that made the original game so amazing, and I would argue betters it.</p>



<p>The puzzles are perfect, every location feels meaningful and suspenseful, and Leon Kennedy is such a likable protagonist. Where Nemesis feels sporadic and watered down in the Resident Evil 3 Remake, Tyrant (more commonly known as Mr. X) is a constant menace that keeps you on your toes from start to finish. With potentially four unique playthroughs to experience as Leon and Claire, there’s content for days. Capcom nailed the Resident Evil 2 Remake, and it brings home the bacon for this list.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New details have been revealed for Forza Horizon 6’s campaign structure, giving players a clear picture of what to expect from the open-world progression system when the game launches in May 2026.</p>







<p>The latest blog from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/playground-games/" id="87661" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Playground Games</a> outlines how the campaign in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/forza-horizon-6/" id="2895" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 6</a> blends exploration and Festival challenges across a sprawling Japan setting. Rather than jumping in as an established festival Superstar like in previous titles, players begin their journey as a tourist with ambitions of joining the Horizon Festival and eventually becoming a Legend.</p>



<h2 id="h-campaign-focuses-on-growth-amp-exploration">Campaign Focuses On Growth &amp; Exploration</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Unreal graphics. Image by Playground Games.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Playground Games’ campaign approach emphasises progression through performance and discovery. To qualify for the Festival, you must complete Horizon Qualifiers and the Invitational to earn your first Wristband, unlocking access to curated races around Japan. As you earn more Wristbands by competing in Festival events, PR Stunts, and skills challenges, you will challenge increasingly demanding races featuring faster cars and varied terrain.</p>



<p>Progression isn’t limited to structured Festival competitions. Forza Horizon 6 also offers Discover Japan, a more free-form experience where you earn Stamps by photographing landscapes, completing side activities like Touge Battles or night street races, and exploring cultural hotspots. These activities reward cars, credits, and cosmetic items tracked in the game’s new Collection Journal.</p>







<p>Both paths—Festival Wristbands and Discover Japan—feed into campaign advancement, giving players flexibility in how they approach their journey. Reaching the highest tier grants access to exclusive locations like Legend Island, featuring intense events such as an extended Goliath race looping the full map.</p>



<p>The campaign is designed to play solo or in co-op with friends, with options to customise race conditions, vehicle selection, weather, and more once certain progression milestones are unlocked.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[WWE 2K26 Ringside Pass Pricing Details]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-ringside-pass-pricing-details/</link>
            <guid>1443970</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New details have been revealed about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26-2/" id="174969">WWE 2K26</a>‘s Ringside Pass.</p>



<p>WWE 2K26 has revamped the DLC process with a new Ringside Pass system. This is more akin to the Battle Pass in Fortnite than to the old WWE DLC model. Ringside Pass Season 1 will go live on March 6, when the game hits Early Access.</p>



<p>Players can purchase the premium track of the Ringside Pass via a premium pass, but they will still need to grind through and play the game to attain the unlockables instead of having the ability to unlock everything outright, as was the case in the past when players purchased premium editions of the game.</p>







<h2>WWE 2K26 Ringside Pass Tier Skips Priced Similarly to NBA 2K</h2>



<p>A new video from Smacktalks on YouTube reveals further details about Season 1 of WWE 2K26’s Ringside Pass. The season will be centered around the AAA Lucha Libre Mexican wrestling promotion and feature four new superstars: Psycho Clown, Lady Flammer, Mr. Iguana, and El Hijo Del Vikingo. There will also be new arenas and championships based around AAA.</p>



<p>However, it was also revealed that players can purchase tier skips. However, it was noted to be priced similarly to NBA 2K, which is $1.99 per tier. Therefore, it would cost nearly $80 ($77.61) to skip all premium-tier options in Season 1.</p>

</p></figure>







<h2 id="h-ringside-pass-seasons-don-t-expire">Ringside Pass Seasons Don’t Expire</h2>



<p>In some good news, players don’t have to rush to grind through and unlock everything, as the Ringside Pass Seasons do not expire. Therefore, players can still unlock everything at their leisure.</p>



<p>One of the game’s developers is confident that fans will enjoy the new DLC system overall. They believe that this allows for more content for the players. Read their full comments <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-dev-confident-fans-will-like-new-ringside-pass/" id="175166">here</a>.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming will provide more news regarding WWE 2K26 leading up to Early Access. Early Access is a little more than a week away, launching on March 6. The game will be available to the global public on March 13.</p>

            <p>There are nearly as many people playing Valve's unreleased and invite-only game Deadlock on Steam as there  are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-havent-been-this-excited-about-overwatch-in-10-years">people playing the resurgent Overwatch</a>. Deadlock was actually the sixth most played game on Steam in January in the US, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3mfcdhiexi62r">according to stat-tracking company Circana</a>. It's an indication, if such an indication was needed, that Valve's next multiplayer game is shaping up to be something big.</p>
<p>Deadlock is a team-based hero shooter, hence the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> comparison, but it's also a MOBA. It's a mash of Valve's other games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a>, really. You pick a kind of 1930s gangster-inspired fantasy hero, then you set about earning cash while killing computer-controlled characters in 'lanes' so you can buy upgrades and power yourself up, and overwhelm the opposing team of players.</p>
<p>Deadlock was softly launched a while ago, in the autumn of 2024, and being Valve's next game, naturally had a lot of interest. But player numbers dropped off until <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-major-update-new-characters-patrons">in January this year, a large Old Gods, New Blood update was released</a>. This brought six new characters to the game along with a new faster game mode, and overhauled a large part of the overall experience.</p>
<p>The effect of the update was dramatic, propelling concurrent player numbers from a highpoint of around 30,000 at the start of the year, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/#max">according to SteamDB</a>, to a peak of 125,000 concurrents 24 hours ago. Overwatch, by comparison, has a current peak Steam playerbase of 134,000.</p>

<p>Deadlock's numbers are all the more remarkable because you can't freely access the game. You need someone currently playing to invite you which, granted, is fairly easily done - plenty of streamers and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NyPdE6mL9s">Deadlock-specialising creators are handing codes out</a> - but it isn't open access. It's also not being advertised or pushed by Valve in any way. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/">The Deadlock Steam page</a> doesn't have much information on it at all. Yet, people are flocking to it.</p><p>In many ways, it's not surprising. Valve's pedigree is unquestionable, with Team Fortress 2 arguably creating the hero shooter - a formula Blizzard borrowed and honed for Overwatch - and Dota 2 being one of the most popular MOBAs (and games full stop) in the world today. Dota 2's current peak concurrent player base is 830,000, which is staggering. It's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed">the second most played game on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>Deadlock currently has no release date, nor is there any word when it will be available openly to test and play.</p>

<p>Potential upscaling issues are being called out</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="67abd8e026ba1"><a title="Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/67abd8e026ba1/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Colour us surprised, and delighted, when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> dropped last week. Silky smooth 60fps with updated textures and resolutions? Count us in.</p>
<p>And while, initially, we were in awe of how Mira looked on the newest Nintendo console, as time has gone on, and fans have been digging into the update, some are disappointed, reportedly asking Nintendo to refund the $5 NS2E, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-is-issuing-refunds-for-xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-poorly-received-premium-switch-2-edition-upgrade">Eurogamer reports</a>.</p>
<p>The problems are largely related to handheld play, where fans speculate that a "filter" or upscaler has been used to improve the textures. But it hasn't really worked in some cases, with some saying that the game looks worse that the Switch 1 version.</p><div><figure data-videoid="h10LJgMQyAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yth10LJgMQyAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/h10LJgMQyAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed562d82riqgzh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvMtsLXxXMM">GVG</a> has highlighted some shimmering and texture issues throughout, both in docked and handheld — though the latter is much more prominent. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHHuuGyOspA">SwitchUp</a> spotted some shimmering on character and enemy shadows. Depending on how sensitive you are to some of this, you might not notice too many issues, but there are some here, and many aren't happy.</p>
<p>Over on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Xenoblade_Chronicles/comments/1racsik/nintendo_is_refunding_xenoblade_x_upgrade_patch/">Reddit</a>, some have managed to snag a refund, with others claiming the Switch 2 edition looks worse than the Wii U version. We wouldn't go <em>that</em> far — and we think in docked the game looks and runs beautifully, for the most part — but it's clear people are unhappy.</p>

<p>Following our pretty glowing hands-on time with the game last week, we've since revisited Xenoblade Chronicles X on Switch 2 over the weekend and have spotted some of the larger issues ourselves; we've updated our thoughts on the upgrade since then.</p>
<p>Docked, the NS2E is great, and the 60fps boost might be worth it alone. And in handheld, we could eventually look past some of the bigger upscaling issues because we were running around so much. But when you start to focus in on some of the details, you can spot the problems.</p>

			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/tencent-timi-montreal-closed">Game File</a> points to the latest source of video game industry layoffs, this time coming from <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-reached-record-sales-generating-10-billion-in-revenue/">Tencent</a></strong> and its <strong>TiMi Montreal </strong>studio. In this case, the <strong>whole studio</strong> is getting <strong>shut down</strong>, leading to everyone on the team seemingly losing their roles nearly <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/TiMi-Studio-Group-Opening-Game-Development-Studio-in-Montreal">five years after the studio was founded</a> with the intention of creating "<em>AAA open-world multi-platform games</em>."</p>



<p>Game File's report comes after a now-deleted LinkedIn post from one of the studio's programmers shared that the studio had been shuttered, with employees having been aware of the situation "<em>for some time</em>." They also added that they are "<em>genuinely heartbroken that the public will never get to experience what this team was capable of producing</em>."</p>



<p>Tencent and TiMi Group have not yet commented on the closure, nor has anything surfaced regarding what the Montreal-based studio was working on beyond its initial disclosure that it would look to make "<em>a AAA open world, service-focused video game for players to explore across multiple platforms</em>."</p>



<p>What we did know about the studio was that it was led by the former head of the <strong>Assassin's Creed</strong> franchise, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/fired-ubisoft-director-ashraf-ismail-now-working-for-tencent"><strong>Ashraf Ismail</strong>,</a> who was fired from <strong>Ubisoft</strong> following an investigation into misconduct allegations.</p>



<p>This is now the latest bit of <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/layoffs/">layoff news </a>from the video game industry in 2026, and the fourth studio shut down this year after <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-shutting-down-bluepoint-games/"><strong>PlayStation's </strong>shuttering of<strong> Bluepoint Games</strong></a>, Ubisoft's shuttering of its <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/">Halifax Studio</a></strong>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hasbro-wizards-of-the-coast-reportedly-shut-down-g-i-joe-snake-eyes-game-makers-atomic-arcade/"><strong>Hasbro's </strong>shuttering of its <strong>Atomic Arcade</strong> team</a>. </p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-vets-leading-frnachise-series-vantage-new-games-2000672792</link>
            <guid>1443925</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Four months after the former head of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> abruptly exited the company <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-lawsuit-ubisoft-marc-alexis-cote-hexe-2000660833">after allegedly being forced out</a>, Ubisoft has tapped three veterans of the series who have worked on or led entries like <em>Origins, Black Flag, </em>and <em>Revelations </em>to take charge of the franchise inside its new Tencent-backed home at Vantage Studios.</p> <p>On February 23, <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3cKfpuehIapKJglmjn3EdM/new-leadership-team-set-to-shape-the-next-era-of-assassins-creed">Ubisoft announced</a> that Martin Schelling, Jean Guesdon, and François de Billy are being handed the keys to <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, the French publisher’s very successful and long-running historical-based open-world stealth action franchise. These three have been connected with <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> for many, many years and have been involved in some of the franchise’s most popular games.</p>

 <p>Schelling is now the head of the<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> brand. Ubisoft says he’ll be responsible for the “overall strategy and long-term vision” of the series. Previously, he was Ubisoft’s chief production officer after spending 17 years in various production roles on games like<em> Assassin’s Creed Revelations, Black Flag, Origins, </em>and <em>Valhalla.</em></p> <p>François de Billy has been named <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>‘ “Head of Production Excellence,” which is a wild title to put on a resume. François was the production director on <em>Assassin’s Creed Black Flag, Origins, </em>and <em>Valhalla.</em> Before that, he was an associate producer on <em>Assassin’s Creed 2</em> and later an executive producer of the brand. Ubisoft says that in this role he will “optimize processes and remove friction across complex production workflows” for the franchise. Sounds like François de Billy is here to help the series avoid delays.</p>

 <p>Finally, Jean Guesdon has been named the head of content for <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>. He’ll lead the franchise’s “overall creative direction” while supporting “individual games” and guiding the “future of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>.” Previously, Guesdon was the creative director on <em>Assassin’s Creed Black Flag</em> and <em>Origins</em>. Interestingly, this is essentially the same role he had at Ubisoft for many years while working on numerous titles.</p>

 <p>He previously left Ubisoft for Behaviour Interactive back in 2023. At the time, <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-origins-minecraft-ubisoft-1850095545"><em>Kotaku</em> reported</a> he had been leading development on a new, <em>Minecraft</em>-like voxel-based game called “Renaissance” that had yet to be announced. It was described by sources back then as being one of the more promising IPs incubating within Ubisoft at the time, with the possibility of appealing to existing fans of franchises like<em> The Sims</em> and <em>Animal Crossing</em>. But it later became <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250602045705/https://mp1st.com/news/report-inside-ubisofts-project-renaissance-a-cancelled-minecraft-like-voxel-game">a casualty of Ubisoft’s ongoing development struggles</a>, especially around creating new IP.</p> <h2>Ubisoft has multiple <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games in development</h2> <p>Schelling, de Billy, and Guesdon are now set to fill a void created by recent departures, including Marc-Alexis Côté’s break with the company in 2025 after leading <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> for nearly 20 years. He is <a href="https://kotaku.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-says-he-didnt-jump-ubisoft-pushed-2000636542">suing the publisher for a forced dismissal</a>, but Ubisoft claims he was offered a leadership role at Vantage Studios and declined it.</p>

 <p>It is very clear that Ubisoft leadership wants to ensure that arguably its biggest, most important franchise continues to be popular and grow. In recent years, the series has struggled to tell a larger meta-narrative and ship on time. There have also been plans to intertwine future installments as part of a larger initiative, but those plans have so far seemed half-baked. 2025’s <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> was a big hit for Ubisoft, helping keep the company afloat as it <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-earnings-layoffs-delays-canceled-ai-2000661869">limped towards a massive buyout with Tencent.</a></p> <p>The ramifications of that deal have been lots of layoffs and cancelled projects. It has also created new co-owned subsidiaries, like Vantage Studios, that are now in charge of Ubisoft’s big franchises like <em>Rainbow Six </em>and <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>. In a recent <a href="https://variety.com/2026/gaming/news/ubisoft-ceo-interview-yves-guillemot-layoffs-creative-house-1236667500/">interview with <em>Variety</em></a>, Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot said there are multiple <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games, including both multiplayer and single-player titles, currently in development. One of those is the<a href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-4-black-flag-remake-skull-bones-1850596271"> previously reported <em>Black Flag</em> remake</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/shrouded-sky-update-notes-arc-raiders/</link>
            <guid>1443919</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/embark-studios/" id="1161">Embark Studios</a> has unveiled what’s coming in the Shrouded Sky update with a full blog post that details <strong>all</strong>. This includes a new player project to build a Weather Monitoring Station, the previously revealed Hurricane map condition, <strong>two </strong>new minor ARC threats, a free Raider Deck, and <strong>more</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s the most substantial update we’ve had so far in 2026, and it’s the second of the four segments on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/arc-raiders/" id="790">ARC Raiders</a> roadmap released earlier this year.</p>



<p>Check out everything you need to know about Shrouded Sky below.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-coming-in-the-shrouded-sky-update">What’s Coming in the Shrouded Sky Update?</h2>



<p>The heart of Shrouded Sky revolves around the new Hurricane map condition, which presents inclement weather that impacts <strong>everything</strong>. That includes visibility, physics, movement, and environmental hazards. It’s a major map condition that will change how you interact with every environment it lands on.</p>



<p>That’s also where the new Weather Monitoring System comes into play. This is the Shrouded Sky player project, and it requires users to collect specific materials (not yet revealed) to build the system itself and ‘earn your Raider some rewards’. We’ll have the latest on what’s needed for that tomorrow.</p>



<p>What we thought was one minor ARC enemy has become <strong>two </strong>new ARC threats. Embark Studios has unveiled <strong>two </strong>ARC enemies, one that flies and another that buzzes around the floor, and both look equally troublesome. Here’s their blurb:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Firefly is a floating nightmare: an armored flying machine that emits a jet of flame, burning your Raider to a crisp unless you can move quickly or find cover.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Comet is a spherical ARC machine that calmly patrols the surface, until it comes across an unsuspecting Raider. You better not let this one get too close – once it sees you, it will lock on with a frightening focus before exploding with a seismic boom.</p>
</blockquote>



<figure></figure>







<p>Those looking for sweet rewards can bust their way through the new free Raider Deck, which is themed around the medical profession this time around. It’s called ‘Surgeon’, and it’s reminiscent of an old-timey doctor or nurse get-up. As always, you’ll get these cosmetics by completing the Raider Deck, made accomplishable by completing <strong>Feats</strong>.</p>



<p>Facial hair is also confirmed to arrive with Shrouded Sky on <strong>February 24</strong>, giving players everywhere a way to adorn their Raiders with a thick scruff. From the word go, you can get stubble, but a full beard can only be unlocked via the Surgeon Raider Deck. In the store, ‘stubble beard’ and ‘thick moustache’ will be available from tomorrow.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Dam Battlegrounds has received a major overhaul, and the team at Embark Studios has added the Controlled Access Zone, a high-value loot area. Presently, we don’t know where that is.</p>



<p>As you can imagine, the rest of the update is comprised of cosmetics bundles, quality-of-life improvements, and some other balancing tweaks.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[WWE 2K26 - Hands-On Preview]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/wwe-2k26-hands-on-preview</link>
            <guid>1443913</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Every year since WWE 2K22, it’s felt like I write variations of the same opening paragraph, that ultimately end with one simple question: How does an annual sports game top what they did the year before? That question becomes slightly more complicated, though, when some (including myself) consider last year’s entry to be the best it’s ever been. WWE 2K26’s answer is simple: you add more. Lots more. </p>This year, everything is expanded and built upon, and though no one thing feels like a particularly massive swing, every mode comes with incremental additions to make it worth your while. In fact, there was so much that not only does it feel like it’s impossible to summarise concisely, but there wasn’t close to enough time for me to sample everything in my few hours of hands-on time. So if you’re interested in all the new updates to universe mode, community creations, MyFaction or The Island, then I’d suggest this isn’t the preview for you. However, what I will do is focus on the central element that ties it all together and the iterations that interest me the most: the gameplay.<output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Small adjustments can be felt from the moment the bell rings. Last year’s addition of chain wrestling has been expanded, allowing you to create moments tailored to each wrestler’s sensibilities. With a quick press on the d-pad, you can now select to deploy unique motions, such as a handshake, a rush, or even drawing energy from the crowd. There’s also a more ambiguous ‘approach’ option, which in turn creates a sub-menu that allows you to begin trading blows, engage in chain wrestling, or just have an intense staredown. What may appear to be gimmicky actually works surprisingly well, providing more cinematic actions to appropriately begin anything from a friendly rivalry to a blood feud. Previously, my default was always just to run and attack, but these starting actions now add an extra sprinkle to the already-impressive spectacle simulation. It’s not going to change the way you play, but it successfully adds an extra layer of welcome immersion to each match opening.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once the match progresses, things feel very familiar. Match fundamentals work very similarly to WWE 2K25, aside from some subtle alterations to the reversal system (which is now more tied to the stamina wheels) and barricade combat, which now lets you both climb up and duke it out during a balancing act. Most notably for me, though, is the update to the collision mechanics, something that feels like it’s been neglected for a while now. Previously, discarded weapons lying around the ring served little purpose once they’d left your hands, often blending into the environment as decoration with no further impact on gameplay,  But gone are the days of characters clipping through them completely, as in WWE 2K26, dropping a superstar onto steel steps, kendo sticks, or steel chairs matters, with what I assume is a damage level increase and new, realistic reaction animations. Whip Sami Zayn into a cinder block, and it breaks under his weight. Riptide Bron Breakker onto the steel steps, and his body will crumple around its shape. Discarded weapons now have added value and contribute another step forward towards matching the WWE television experience. </p><p>Lift up the ring apron, and your weapon wheel will now have a bag of violence ready to deploy.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The standout of these interactive weapons, though, and my personal highlight of WWE 2K26 is actually a brand new addition for the series - something that feels like it should have been around forever, but finally makes its debut this year. Thumbtacks. Lift up the ring apron, and your weapon wheel will now have a bag of violence ready to deploy. Simply pour the dozens of metal pins onto the mat, and you're ready to turn your opponent into a human pin cushion. Tacks aren’t just reserved for finishing moves either. Any slam in the proximity of these nasty spikes will decorate their back, knees, and forehead in silver, helping you finally recreate gloriously violent WWE moments like Cactus Jack’s face-first descent into a pile of the violent objects by a sinister Triple H.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thumbtacks, better collision reactions and starting actions, although fun, are all in service of matching the WWE product, as are micro adjustments like the new blood splatter effect that splashes the screen when you or your opponent gets busted wide open. This<em> is</em> ultimately a fighting game, but one that knows which side its bread is buttered. Drama and storytelling are the name of the game, and this year also receives a vital upgrade in its voices, with the additions of Booker T and Wade Barrett to the commentary table. The latter not only offers a different accent to the soundtrack of your actions, but both bring a new sense of excitement that is hard to quantify, but vital to keeping the series sounding fresh.
</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">From playing, it quickly became clear to me that this year, the moment-to-moment match action has received small but welcome improvements to the already successful formula. But just like in real life, a WWE fan’s appetite for chaos is only satiated with new match types and WWE 2K26, much like last year, lobs four more onto the pile: Three Stages of Hell, I Quit, Dumpster and Inferno matches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Inferno match, which surrounds the ring in a wall of flames, is undoubtedly the most visually impressive addition. Much like its sporadic appearances on WWE over the years, it's certainly a spectacle and a worthwhile inclusion, although, like last year’s Underground addtion, it’s hard for me to invest too much time into a match type that limits your ability to use every inch of the ring, as it always feels less enjoyable to me to conclude a fight in anything but a pinfall or submission. Because of this, I didn’t spend much time in this fiery new mode, but its addition is a welcome one, even if it’s only from a WWE historical perspective.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The dumpster match also helps fill the gap in WWE’s legacy. In practice, it’s a reskinned version of the casket and ambulance brawls, but it’s hard to see what they could have done differently from a gameplay perspective. It’s also nice for 2K to tick off another match type as developer Visual Concepts slowly but surely works its way through all the crazy concepts we’ve seen throughout WWE’s history, regardless of their real-world success. Although saying that, I would be surprised if we see a Punjabi Prison or Kennel From Hell match anytime soon. Feel free to shock me, though, WWE 2K27.</p><p> The I Quit match doesn’t feel like just another match variation on the pile, but rather its own beast entirely.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to fresh match types, the most exciting addition for me, though, is the long-overdue return of the I Quit match. Notably different from the ever-present submission bout, which just limits the decision to a legal tap, rather than the all-out warfare and humiliation the I Quit match can deliver. Proceedings begin like any other hardcore match, but instead of pinfalls or traditional submissions, the fight will now only end when you or your opponents verbally say "I quit" into the microphone, with the referee also audibly making requests. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">How this works in practice is a quick-time event that demands you master timing on a spinning wheel full of green blocks, which will shrink over time based on the damage you take. Interestingly, unlike some of the other mini games in the series, the aggressor isn’t directly competing for these green blocks; instead, you can place pre-earner blockers to make the timing more difficult. There’s a deliberate strategy to this, and I immediately found myself considering my submission requests more thoughtfully, making sure I had enough banked blockers (earned by performing certain big attacks) before commencing the humiliation routine. You can also increase your chances by using weapons like the kendo stick or steel chair in the submission manoeuvre, once again harking back to classic WWE moments. The I Quit match doesn’t feel like just another match variation on the pile, but rather its own beast entirely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this year’s adjustments serve the wider presentation of WWE 2K26, and that ever-moving, monolithic WWE dragon they’re always chasing. Make no mistake about it, while the grappling has always and will always be the core of this series, the spectacle of WWE is just as important a part of the package. In my lifetime, we’ve gone from WWF Warzone’s soulless arenas (I can still hear that single voice in the crowd repeatably telling me to open a can) to 1-to-1 representations of pyro-infused, singalong entrances and accurate depictions of the ebbs and flows of a rabid live crowd. I have little doubt that WWE 2K26 is set to be the best the series has ever looked, sounded, and felt, and if you’re a WWE obsessive eager to replicate the pageantry at home, then you’ve never had it better.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Dale Driver is an Associate Director of Video Programming at IGN.

Not only does that include the popular Limit Break and Counter Blitz decks, but <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJ82Mq?object_uuid=8fce6d71-871a-4b64-a38d-843f27eb4c61&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>the new version of Limit Break</u></a> with a Promo Card and download code is discounted, too.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Get Final Fantasy Commander Decks at a Discount Right Now</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Starting with Limit Break, the new ‘Game Edition’ includes the 100-card Commander deck helmed by Cloud, Ex-SOLDIER, and an exclusive Promo Card, too. It also has a Steam code for the original Final Fantasy 7 (not to be confused with the remake). It’s now $72.99, down from $99.99 (which was admittedly steep anyway).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you already have that, or just want to save some Gil, <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yPX0n?object_uuid=8fce6d71-871a-4b64-a38d-843f27eb4c61&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>you can pick up the standard edition for $64.45</u></a>, discounted by around five bucks. The deck is equipment-focused, aiming to get your creatures powered up to trigger effects like token generation.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Whisper it, though: We still think Counter Blitz, the Final Fantasy X deck, is the best of the bunch. Its combination of Tidus and Yuna can use Summons for big power on the board, and manipulate the counters to keep them around indefinitely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/z3ORJR?object_uuid=8fce6d71-871a-4b64-a38d-843f27eb4c61&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>The deck is down to $48.99</u></a>, a 30% discount from its list price of $69.99.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/zj84Jp?object_uuid=8fce6d71-871a-4b64-a38d-843f27eb4c61&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Final Fantasy 6-themed Revival Trance</u></a> isn’t the most cohesive deck out of the box, but with the right upgrades, it could be really useful. It’s traditionally been discounted right from launch, and it’s got a 30% discount, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That brings it down to $48.75, meaning the only deck from the set not included in the current deals is Final Fantasy XIV’s Scions and Spellcraft - that one is out of stock at the time of writing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Magic: The Gathering’s Commander format, be sure to check out our rundown <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-commander-precons-best-decks"><u>the best decks you can buy right now</u></a>, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-tmnt-commander-deck-is-a-video-game-homage-packed-with-classic-characters"><u>an early look at the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles precon, Turtle Power</u></a>.

That's a fairly significant drop from what we were seeing near the beginning of the month ($140-$160), and back to the prices we were seeing across January.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans can only hope this doesn't reverse in the coming weeks, and perhaps even continues to drop further. But, in my view, the market price looks to be levelling out at around $115-$120, so if you're desperate and not looking to wait any longer, this is the best time to buy. <a href="https://zdcs.link/aoJXNY?object_uuid=15c4a37b-37cf-4ae2-aafa-e3462b71917b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Walmart also currently has the ETB in stock for $60</strong></a><strong>, with access limited to paid </strong><a href="https://zdcs.link/QW6wG7?object_uuid=15c4a37b-37cf-4ae2-aafa-e3462b71917b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Walmart+ members</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p></div><div id="192311"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="192311" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Walmart+ Membership</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Compare this to Phantasmal Flames, as that was settling at around $150-$200 in November last year, but has thankfully since come down to around <a href="https://zdcs.link/aX41Xm?object_uuid=15c4a37b-37cf-4ae2-aafa-e3462b71917b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$80-90 market price</a>, which is <em>much </em>better, a whole lot more what most fans would be happy/ expecting to pay for an ETB these days, even if it is above the original list price. We can only hope that Ascended Heroes follows a similar trend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of where to buy, TCGplayer is the most reliable option, but also the most expensive, so proceed only with the knowledge that you're paying a premium.

Still, at this price, I wouldn't be surprised if more than a few fans snap it up, as it's one of the better resale deals I've seen on a Pokémon Center exclusive ETB.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-ascended-heroes-most-expensive-cards">price of cards</a> on the resale market these days! I'm sure most of us are already quite used to it, even if it's still a mega pricey. That being said, in my opinion, you may be better off waiting for prices to come back down a bit a few months down the line, so a bit of patience may pay off if you can manage it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'd say anywhere around the $100 mark is a good time to buy the standard ETB, but if you can wait a few months longer, hopefully we can see these falling to around $80-$90 as well, just like the Phantasmal Flames ETB has.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is Senior Commerce Editor and IGN's resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.

            <title><![CDATA[New Report Claims No One, Not Even Those Internally at Xbox, Liked the “Everything is an Xbox” Strategy]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/sarah-bond-phil-spencer-no-one-liked-everything-is-an-xbox-strategy/</link>
            <guid>1443883</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This past Friday, the video games industry, and more specifically, <strong>Xbox </strong>and <strong>Microsoft</strong>, entered a new era. <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-phil-spencer-retires-sarah-bond-resigns-asha-sharma-takes-over-xbox/">A post-<strong>Phil Spencer</strong> and <strong>Sarah Bond</strong> era</a>, with the announcement of Spencer's retirement and Bond's resignation. Former Microsoft CoreAI chief executive officer, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-xbox-ceo-targeted-supposedly-using-ai-bot-x/"><strong>Asha Sharma</strong>,</a> took Spencer's place, while <strong>Matt Booty</strong> stepped into a new role as Xbox's chief content officer.</p>



<p>As the industry and consumers wrap their heads around the sudden shake-up, a new report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/883015/microsoft-xbox-new-ceo-shakeup-notepad">The Verge</a> looks to provide some insight into why it happened the way it did. Why is Sarah Bond leaving Microsoft instead of being <a href="https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-retire-following-next-gen-xbox-launch/">the one to replace Phil Spencer?</a> What does this new leadership mean for Xbox's future and its whole 'everything is an Xbox' initiative? Well, according to The Verge, the answer to those questions begins and ends with Sarah Bond and her departure.</p>



<p>Bond is pinpointed as the one who was pushing Xbox's 'Play Everywhere' campaign <a href="https://wccftech.com/sarah-bond-xbox-palworld/">more than anyone else</a>, and that its 'This is an Xbox' marketing strategy was the result of a few key people leaving Microsoft, leaving Bond directly in charge of the platform's marketing team. When the new campaign started to air, and those loyal to the platform on the consumer side were taken aback and even offended by it, they weren't the only ones.</p>



<p>The report claims that the campaign "<strong><em>offended many Xbox employees internally</em></strong>," and that the pivot away from a dedicated console to a broader approach focused on cloud and mobile was something that Bond championed under Spencer. It also adds that Bond's departure comes as a relief to employees remaining at Xbox, who claimed that she was "<em>tough to work with, and built a team structure that meant if you didn't follow the vision or questioned it, <strong>you were out</strong></em>." </p>



<p>That said, she was still praised by her colleagues for the ability to get big deals across the finish line, including the "<em><strong>crucial</strong></em>" role she played in securing the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-has-been-acquired-by-microsoft-for-70-billion/">Activision Blizzard King</a></strong> deal. But that's about all the praise the report mentions for Bond. </p>



<p>Everywhere else, she's reported to be the one behind Xbox's devaluing of its own hardware, and now that she and Spencer are out, Sharma's job is to usher in "<em>the return of Xbox</em>," which seems to include major changes and the admittance that what the team had been trying has not been working. </p>



<p>According to sources from the report, when it became clear that Bond's strategy under Spencer wasn't working after <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reports-a-9-overall-drop-in-xbox-revenue-for-q2-fy26-hardware-down-32/">declining hardware sales</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-revenues-see-113-million-decline-amid-hardware-sales-drop-and-limited-gaming-content-and-services-growth/">Xbox revenue dropping</a>, staff believed that the departures felt inevitable. </p>



<p>The report also adds that the author has "<em>the impression from sources that Microsoft wants a turnaround and is worried about losing Xbox, as it's one of its only remaining successful consumer brands</em>." Again, that's just a feeling the writer has based on their conversations with their sources at Xbox, but it's a more positive one than coming away from those talks with the feeling that Sharma is really here to start cutting away at Xbox to make more room for <a href="https://wccftech.com/satya-nadella-admits-transition-into-the-ai-era-could-be-messy-but-does-not-want-microsoft-to-be-left-behind-in-the-tech-race/">Microsoft's AI push</a>.</p>



<p>As much as this report sets the blame at Bond's feet, where it may very well deserve to rest, the buck stops with Phil Spencer before it stops with her. In a company as big as Microsoft, you'll almost never be able to say that someone acted alone in their mistakes; there's almost always someone else complicit to them. </p>



<p>If this report is accurate in its claims that Sharma's tenure will turn over a new leaf for Xbox, then the test of that commitment to players will likely come with the reveal of the next major first-party Xbox title, and whether or not it is actually a game exclusive to Xbox.</p>

			<p>Over the past few months, video gaming has become a rather expensive hobby, with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-ps5-pro-price-increases-us-tomorrow/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">hardware</strong></a> and game prices rising consistently, risking pricing out more and more gamers as the worldwide economic situation remains challenging. However, not every publisher is set to increase prices, and some, like <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a></em></strong>  publisher <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Kepler Interactive</strong>, are set to continue employing a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">pricing strategy</strong> that is respectful of gamers' money and time.</p>



<p>Speaking with the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@BBCNews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BBC</a></strong>, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Kepler Interactive's CEO Alexis Garavaryan</strong> commented on the company's pricing strategy, which has <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"kind of taken the opposite action"</em> to what most major publishers have done in recent years.</p>



<p>Elaborating further, <strong>Garavaryan</strong> said: <em>"When we decide on a release and when we price our video games, we try to think what do we think the price should be and then we price it lower so that when players buy a game from us they feel like they're getting a bargain. We want them to feel like we are respectful of their money, respectful of their time and that fundamentally every time they buy a game from us they're getting a great deal."</em></p>



<p><em>"We're excited for players to be able to play five, six different experiences with the same amount of money than a traditional AAA game would bring them,"</em> <strong>Kepler Interactive CEO</strong> concluded, delivering <strong>a small ray of hope</strong> amidst the general <strong>price hikes</strong> that show no sign of stopping.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Looking at the smashing success of <strong><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></strong>, whose art style is so convincing that some <strong>authorities in the Middle East</strong> believed the game's artbook <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-art-direction-is-so-authentic-it-triggered-a-national-antiquities-investigation/"><strong>belonged in a museum</strong></a>, <strong>Kepler Interactive's</strong> strategy has a high chance to make many of the games it will publish in the future quite popular. </p>



<p>While reaching the <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-most-awarded-game-wccftech-awards-elden-ring/"><strong>same level of popularity</strong></a> as the game developed by <strong>Sandfall Interactive</strong> will be a tall order, gamers have shown time and time again how they are willing to embrace all sorts of gaming experiences if they are of <strong>high quality</strong> and are <strong>priced accordingly</strong>. Hopefully, other publishers will follow suit and prevent video games from becoming something only a few can enjoy.</p>

Schelling will "lead the franchise team, as well as the overall strategy", according to Ubisoft. He's previously served as producer on games like <em>Black Flag </em>and <em>Valhalla</em>.</p><p>Joining Schelling at the helm of <em>Assassin's Creed </em>is Jean Guesdon, who was creative director on both <em>Black Flag </em>and <em>Origins</em>. He'll now be serving as "Head of Content", which will see him leading the franchise's "creative direction" and shaping its future "while ensuring it remains true to its DNA".</p><figure role="group">

              <p><i><span>Pokémon FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen </span></i><span>are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-fire-red-leaf-green-switch-pokemon-direct-price-2000671938"><span>getting Switch ports on Friday, February 27</span></a><span>. The 22-year-old Game Boy Advance remakes are widely considered the “definitive” editions of the original games thanks to quality-of-life changes and added areas and quest lines. The games aren’t readily available right now, so you’d think this announcement would have been met with universal excitement. But that wasn’t the case, as the $20 ports were deemed too expensive by some. Nevertheless, the games are </span><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Nintendo-eShop/Charts/Nintendo-eShop-charts-1396788.html"><span>topping the eShop charts</span></a><span> already.</span></p> <p><span>I gotta admit, I do find the pearl clutching about the $20 price tag a bit surprising, but in my experience, it’s impossible to have discussions about video game pricing because everyone’s perception of what a dollar is worth is so different. As the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-pricing-indie-steam-peak-content-warning-2000658886"><i><span>Peak </span></i><span>devs explained</span></a><span>, video game pricing is all weird, vibes-based psychology that some companies have figured out and others just kind of ignore.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>$20 is what you might pay for a nice meal that you’ll eat and then forget about, and here it gets you a 30+-hour game. But hey, I don’t know your economic situation, so I can’t speak to what $20 in your bank account means. I’m not here to judge anyone’s perception of money, I’m more concerned about how these conversations don’t seem to take that economic disparity into account.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">i lowkey dgaf them pokemon game ports cost 20 dollars i have a job why should i care</p> <p>— lil (@adifying) <a href="https://twitter.com/adifying/status/2024824271076233711?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="qst" dir="ltr">lol <a href="https://t.co/L4e7BSIGOL">https://t.co/L4e7BSIGOL</a></p> <p>— TAHK0 ☕️ (@TAHK0) <a href="https://twitter.com/TAHK0/status/2025167322160529765?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">How are both sides of this argument so fucking annoying <a href="https://t.co/moOgMlk9tT">https://t.co/moOgMlk9tT</a></p> <p>— Lost Levels Fan (@LostLevelsFan) <a href="https://twitter.com/LostLevelsFan/status/2025016667923730885?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 21, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">whispers: *i actually think $20 for firered is pretty reasonable* 😬</p> <p>— Bob Wulff (@BobWulff) <a href="https://twitter.com/BobWulff/status/2024920916556185689?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is literally all you are getting with Pokémon Fire Red and Pokémon Leaf Green.</p> <p>No changes, no online support.</p> <p>This is easily emulated on extremely low powered machines.</p> <p>$20 for a 20 year old Rom and Emulator is a wild price, buy what you want but don't defend it please. <a href="https://t.co/l3OfqiUz00">pic.twitter.com/l3OfqiUz00</a></p> <p>— Protomario (@Protomario) <a href="https://twitter.com/Protomario/status/2025614936450150869?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 22, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">People would have complained if FireRed and LeafGreen was put on NSO because they would have wanted to buy it separately. </p> <p>Even if they were $5, people still would have complained.</p> <p>Free or nothing</p> <p>— Johniibo (@johniibo) <a href="https://twitter.com/johniibo/status/2025702770762793441?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 22, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Pokemon Fire Red costs 13 Costco hot dogs.</p> <p>Hard decisions man.</p> <p>— Pory (@pory_leeks) <a href="https://twitter.com/pory_leeks/status/2025737366540009950?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>I remember once talking to someone about the </span><i><span>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition </span></i><span>remasters, and they flatly said the collection’s $60 price point placed it out of their budget…but $50? That could be the sweet spot. A mere $10 could be the difference between them playing some of their favorite games again on modern hardware and not doing so.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen </span></i><span>were $40 when they launched in 2004, but now if they’re anything short of free on Nintendo Switch Online, it’s the type of greed they talk about in the Bible. The irreconcilable way conflicting people talk about video game prices is born from those economic discrepancies, not everyone makes the same money, but also some people will just view any old game that costs money as a ripoff. It’s an unwinnable, unsolvable problem because everyone’s economic background is different, influenced by factors beyond their control, and is all based in a society that is wringing every cent out of all of us at any given moment. But that truth won’t stop the arguments from continuing, with anyone willing to pay $20 for an old game being deemed a shill and anyone unwilling being called poor. Whatever the case, many people are clearly willing to pay $20 to go back to Kanto again.</span></p>

<p>Iconic Capcom, PlatinumGames, and now Clovers dev Hideki Kamiya has commented on Resident Evil Requiem’s leaks, which arose after the game’s physical street date was broken by well over a week.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/" id="2693" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is 2026’s first major AAA game. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/capcom/" id="87630" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Capcom</a>‘s franchise returns to a decimated Raccoon City. The hype has been huge, and the expectations are bigger than a skyscraper made entirely of El Gigantes. Unfortunately, countless buyers were able to get their hands on the game early, and it began a huge wave of Requiem spoilers.</p>







<h2 id="h-hideki-kamiya-not-happy-with-resident-evil-requiem-spoilers">Hideki Kamiya Not Happy With Resident Evil Requiem Spoilers</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s not uncommon for a game’s physical street date to be broken, resulting in copies of the game being distributed days before launch, but Resident Evil Requiem went out roughly 10 days or more before launch. Leaks were inevitable, and social media was flooded with story spoilers and much more very quickly.</p>

</ul>



<p>Hideki Kamiya has shared his thoughts on the leaks and used a previous experience to summarize his thoughts. Here’s what he said, according to Google Translate:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I remember back with Bio2, the late-game plot twist got totally scooped by some photo weekly mag, right… For your own selfish satisfaction, you’re trampling all over the feelings of users who were looking forward to it, and the feelings of the creators who poured their all into making it—a detestable act that destroys everyone’s happiness and deserves a thousand deaths… May you be cursed to never play games again…</p>
</blockquote>







<p>Kamiya directed Resident Evil 2, the first Devil May Cry, and Bayonetta, and has attached his talents to many other projects. Needless to say, he’s not someone you should want to disrespect.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bungie Outlines Plans To Counter Cheaters In Marathon]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-outlines-plans-to-counter-cheaters-in-marathon/</link>
            <guid>1443862</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bungie has detailed its plans to combat cheating in its upcoming extraction shooter Marathon, outlining a firm strategy designed to safeguard competitive integrity ahead of the game’s March 5, 2026, release.</p>







<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/marathon/" id="98" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a> team confirmed that the title will rely on dedicated server-side systems and integrated anti-cheat tools to detect and prevent illicit behaviour. And if those safeguards fail, the studio says offenders can expect swift and serious consequences rather than leniency.</p>



<h2 id="h-cheaters-will-be-given-no-second-chances">Cheaters Will Be Given ‘No Second Chances’</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/bungie/" id="99" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bungie’s</a> stance appears uncompromising: players caught cheating will face decisive enforcement with little opportunity for repeat offences. This contrasts with the more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-devs-confirm-punishment-for-dupe-exploits/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-devs-confirm-punishment-for-dupe-exploits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forgiving approach</a> seen in rival extraction shooter <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-release-date-start-times-all-content-explained/" id="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-release-date-start-times-all-content-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, whose developer Embark Studios has historically leaned toward lighter penalties. Bungie’s stricter policy is intended to reassure players that losses during raids should come from legitimate gameplay, not unfair exploits.</p>



<p>Still, the studio’s primary goal is prevention rather than punishment. Structural design choices aim to reduce cheating opportunities altogether. Because Marathon uses authoritative servers that control player movement, actions, and loot, it should be significantly more resistant to common client-side hacks.</p>







<p>Additional protections include a Fog of War system that limits how much information each player’s client can access at any given time. By restricting what data is visible locally, Bungie hopes to curb tools such as wallhacks or loot-tracking cheats before they can function effectively.</p>



<p>Bungie also addressed technical disruptions, noting that players disconnected mid-run will be able to rejoin matches. If server-side issues prevent that, the studio says it will attempt to restore lost gear to affected players.</p>
