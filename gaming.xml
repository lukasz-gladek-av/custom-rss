            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/the-acolyte-star-wars-controversy-ratings-this-is-all-terrible<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Few things will make you more aware of how rancid online discourse has become than the headlines and discussions surrounding <em>The Acolyte</em>, the latest Star Wars show. It has well and truly become a culture wars flashpoint, not just between racist chuds and normal people, but normal people and Star Wars weirdos as well.</p><p>The toxic vibes have driven me away from <em>all </em>discussion about the show. I don't want to read reviews, I don't want to see tweets, I don't even want to talk to people in real life about this. The madness--going so far as sparking a controversy over <em>a character's date of birth being edited on a wiki</em>--has driven me very close to the edge:</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">its time to burn fandom to the ground. ban merch. close forums. no more cons. if you like something, from now on you gotta keep that shit to yourself. <a href="https://t.co/1M3sUbrOmP">https://t.co/1M3sUbrOmP</a></p>— Luke Plunkett (@LukePlunkett) <a href="https://twitter.com/LukePlunkett/status/1803587875004699031?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 20, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>All of which is a shame, because I want to talk about <em>The Acolyte</em>. I want to talk about how much it sucks! But I want to talk about the very normal ways that it sucks, and the wider internet has become such a cesspit that I don't feel like there are many spaces where I feel like I can have that discussion. So let's try it in here.</p><p>This is a bad television show. It has the energy of a daytime soap. Of a mildly competent fan film put together by cosplayers who know a guy who once did some VFX work on <em>Babylon 5</em>. From the flimsy sets to the crisp clothing to the sparse locations, it's <em>cheap</em>. The themes and ideas it's grasping at--the imperfection of the perfect Jedi Order, the elusive nature of the force--are admirable in their intent (which is seemingly enough for many critics) but executed shoddily.</p><p>The acting--despite a very capable cast!--is cardboard even by Star Wars standards, with Amandla Stenberg and Manny Jacinto the only exceptions, and every little twist or mystery it tries to pull on us (aside from Carrie Ann Moss' disappearing act) could be seen coming from miles away. These are all very valid complaints to make as someone engaging in some drive-by criticism of a TV show set in the world's premier fictional universe and made by a company worth billions. This is Disney, this is Star Wars,<a href="https://aftermath.site/call-duty-modern-warfare-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> there's no reason for it to be this shoddy</a>!</p><p>These are my primary takeaways from this show, but you know as well as I do that they're not what most people online are talking about. One side in a culture war has chosen this TV show about space wizards as a battleground, and so the other has met them there in defence. The wider discussions about <em>The Acolyte</em>, ostensibly a TV show, have thus become something <em>else</em>, not really about the series itself at all. It's no longer a fun little diversion in a fiction universe that people can tune into for 40 minutes a week. It has become a target for some, and a banner to rally under for others.</p><p>I'm not here to yuck someone else's yum; if you are enjoying <em>The Acolyte</em> for what it is--a breezy jaunt through an under-explored era of <em>Star Wars</em> lore--that's cool! This blog is not my review of <em>The Acolyte</em>. What I do want to talk about is how annoying and even dangerous it is that hateful criticism of this show has been elevated out of the depths of social media and onto websites that millions of otherwise regular human beings read, helping poison almost every visible interaction about it. Many of these are websites that, ten years into an online culture war, should know better:</p><figure><figcaption>I would bet $100 that most people found out about the "controversy" not by being frothing racist assholes on social media, but by reading about it on otherwise normal websites that are under no obligation to provide a platform for it</figcaption></figure><p>I'm tired of the way this discourse is continually framed and given oxygen, to the point that the thing so many folks are associating with this show is its "controversy", and not <em>the show itself</em>. We've been inundated with headlines for the past month about <em>The Acolyte</em>, pointing out the "division", listing bullet points behind the "hate", about space lesbians, and lore retcons, and it's like...we don't have to do this? Websites don't have to take this silly little TV show, which isn't even very good, and play a significant role in elevating it to the status of cultural flashpoint.</p><p>People who don't like a TV show because it stars a black woman are not worth speaking to. People who send death threats about wiki edits, or scream that the lore of a fictional movie series is suddenly inconsistent, are not worth listening to. User reviews, an entirely flawed premise, are not a serious subject matter. We don't have to "both sides" every piece of cultural work that hits the spotlight when one of those sides is an extreme, hateful, minority view. It's a failure of journalism; it failed us with the climate, it failed us with fascism, and it's failing us here. The media is under no obligation whatsoever to entertain the childish rage of a generation of (mostly) men who have turned Star Wars into a personality trait.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-instgrm-captioned="" data-instgrm-permalink="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8aorYEx2ZQ/?utm_source=ig_embed&amp;utm_campaign=loading" data-instgrm-version="14"></blockquote></div><figcaption>Star Amandla Stenberg put out this Instagram video as a response to not just the racist attacks on her and the show, but divisive media coverage of the whole mess as well</figcaption></figure></div><p>These people are losers.

<article id="post-6451">
  
  <div data-hide-featured-media="0">
<p>Everyone is rightfully sick of the FromSoftware difficulty conversation, most of all me, but I think there’s a perspective here we’re not exploring as thoroughly as we ought to as we settle into <em>Elden Ring</em>’s <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> expansion. Most mentions of this topic devolve into two sides which are riddled with baseless claims and exaggerated fears. And they all fixate on the perceived difficulty of the latest FromSoftware game.</p>



<p>I understand I’m kicking the proverbial hornets’ nest by daring to suggest the concept of difficulty is misunderstood on both sides, but as an avid fan of FromSoftware games, I’m tired of having to hide my love of the <em>Souls</em> genre, especially as a physically disabled player. So, allow me, one of the biggest supporters of <em>Elden Ring</em>’s design, to explore why difficulty and Easy Mode need to be left behind.</p>



<h2><strong>You’re Not Playing Incorrectly</strong></h2>



<p>FromSoftware games are notorious for encouraging the creation of unique builds. Whether it’s heavy armor with gargantuan hammers or naked Pyromancers with a wooden club, there is no wrong way to play – unless you’re a gatekeeper.</p>



<p>This side, often filled with toxicity, superiority complexes, and a penchant for trying to force others to not enjoy <em>Souls</em> games will be the first, and loudest, voice in the room to tell you that you are playing incorrectly. No, these people were not in developer meetings, nor were they playtesters for these games, but they sure like to act like they know what Hidetaka Miyazaki’s intentions were when creating titles like <em>Elden Ring</em>. Even though Miyazaki has stated<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-director-hidetaka-miyazaki-comments-on-game-difficulty/1100-6501104/"> numerous</a><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2022/01/28/an-interview-with-fromsoftwares-hidetaka-miyazki/"> times</a> that the point of these games was to create an experience that players are meant to overcome, not bash your head against an impossible brick wall, this group of rabid fans have misinterpreted his words to mean quite the opposite of his intent. This quote from a recent<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/interview/2024/06/24/from-softwares-hidetaka-miyazaki-discusses-the-studios-approach-to-difficulty"> Game Informer</a> interview perfectly encapsulates his belief in difficulty, not what the community believes.</p>



<p>“When players are killed, and they can understand why they were killed in an instance, and it feels justified – ‘Okay, yeah, that makes sense’ – that’s the game design we’re trying to achieve,” Miyazaki continues. “I know a lot of players out there are probably going to disagree: ‘What are you talking about?! This game doesn’t make sense! What the heck!’ But we try to make sure that there is a learning curve and a feedback loop that the players are able to extract from that they can then bring into the next attempt. We believe in difficult games, but not games that are unjustly or unfairly so. But, of course, there’s still room for improvement on our side, as well.”</p>



<p>Taking things even further, Miyazaki recently admitted to Keza MacDonald that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/article/2024/jun/26/pushing-buttons-meeting-hidetaka-miyazaki">he “absolutely sucks” at video games</a> and uses every tool at his disposal to conquer the very worlds he helps create.</p>



<p><em>Elden Ring</em>, like most <em>Souls</em> games, wants individuals to find a comfortable playstyle. In previous <em>Souls</em> entries, I gravitated toward heavy armor with great swords and faith-based spells. For <em>Elden Ring</em>, I prefer the flashy and downright chaotic style of sorceries. With my disability, Spinal Muscular Atrophy Type II, a progressive disability which weakens muscles, I found myself losing strength and energy from navigating the vast world of the Lands Between with my previous setups. After switching to the ranged capabilities of magic, I was able to play for extensive periods, continuously progress, and more importantly, enjoy myself far more. And all of this was done with tools that gatekeepers despise.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>My character’s very existence is an affront to people who want you to suffer. I can absolutely obliterate most enemies within seconds because of my spells, – though not as quickly as before with the DLC – and if I’m finding an encounter too challenging, I simply use spirits or other players to help. And people <em>loathe </em>me for it. If you spend any time on social media or forums discussing FromSoftware games, you are bound to stumble upon those proclaiming that any weapon or strategy that doesn’t involve a large two-handed sword and shield is cheating.</p>



<p>Using summons? That’s cheating. Magic of any kind that deals damage? Yep, you are cheating. Leveling up beyond the meta bracket – in <em>Elden Ring</em>’s case, 125-150 – you guessed it, you are a filthy cheater. But what is most perplexing about these arguments is that these systems are in <em>most</em> FromSoftware games. Aside from exceptions like <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em> and <em>Bloodborne</em>, magic, summoning, and extensively progressing your character are all crucial aspects with their own intricacies and pros and cons. It doesn’t matter if I rolled credits after defeating the final boss on every <em>Souls</em> game and <em>Elden Ring</em>, because I did so in a way that goes against their playstyles, I didn’t win. The sheer exuberance of seeing a final boss scatter into the wind and the absolute adrenaline rush of knowing I beat a challenging game mean nothing because I didn’t suffer the way gatekeepers did.</p>



<h2><strong>The Accessibility Issue</strong></h2>



<p>Difficulty is a core design of FromSoftware games. You are meant to die. You are meant to learn. You are meant to continuously try again. However, rather than the conflated difficulty that gatekeepers incorrectly assume Miyazaki wanted, for disabled individuals, inaccessible barriers make these games significantly more challenging.</p>



<p>The most common accessibility critique of FromSoftware games is their lack of difficulty options. Many conversations led by disabled people state the primary reason for being so inaccessible is the lack of “Easy Mode.” And while difficulty is subjective and can absolutely pose numerous barriers for a variety of disabilities, fixating on a singular setting does little to advance accessibility conversations, especially with so many barriers that need to be addressed.</p>



<p>For starters, there are no settings for blind/low vision players aside from increasing brightness. The game provides no prominently visible traversal markers, no auto travel on horseback, and most egregious of all, the game’s design is visually dark. While there are massive open landscapes, much of the optional content lies within tombs, caves, and cramped halls of decrepit, dark ruins or castles. Combine that with enemy patterns relying on the ability to see minute position changes, and boss fights can feel like impossible tasks. While there is a fairly accurate targeting system, blind/low vision individuals have no way to increase visual accessibility, making exploration and combat incredibly…well, difficult.</p>



<p>Deaf and hard-of-hearing fair marginally better, as most enemy attacks rely heavily on visual cues. Some optional bosses like the Black Knife Assassin, Astel, Naturalborn of the Void, and the Ancestor Spirit perform moves that either teleport them around the arena, or in the case of the Assassin, cloak themselves, with the sound of their footsteps on water alerting you to their position. While there are subtitles, they only work for spoken words, not environmental sounds. And unlike some games like <em>Fortnite</em>, there are no directional indicators of noise. If an enemy or boss is rapidly positioning around an area, deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals have no choice but to scan the arena until they find the opponent.</p>



<p>I’ve yet to mention mobility accessibility because I find it quite accessible. I’m fully aware that each individual experiences disability uniquely, but <em>Souls</em> games and <em>Elden Ring</em> offer more physical accessibility choices than I’ve seen in studios with dozens of options. There are customizable controls, target aggression mitigation through the form of co-op or summons to reduce physical fatigue, ranged playstyles with magic that can obliterate major bosses in under 10 seconds, and more importantly with <em>Elden Ring</em>, the capability to skip most bosses. Remember Malenia? She’s entirely optional. Defeating her does nothing to progress the main storyline. While I died on her over 50 times before finally acquiring her soul, I did so out of personal pride, not because I was forced to. And that is the ultimate accessibility tool, one that Miyazaki does very well – player choice.</p>



<p>Arguably, <em>Souls</em> games and <em>Elden Ring</em> particularly are nightmares for those with cognitive disabilities. FromSoftware games rely heavily on pattern recognition. From the movesets and timings of player weapons and spells, to the attack patterns of every enemy encounter, you are meant to memorize and recognize <em>everything</em>. Therein lies the overall design thesis of Miyazaki – you keep trying until you’ve memorized enough to beat the challenge. While this barrier can be mitigated through systems like magic and summoning, it’s impossible to avoid memorization. Further, there are no concise explanations on what pieces of gear such as talismans do. Many item descriptions give vague hints about their use, and it’s up to players to test their capabilities before discovering if they are useful on their build. And since cognitive accessibility is still a relatively new concept for many studios, there are no options to help.</p>



<p>Conversations around difficulty are so tiring and add nothing to arguments that continue to be brought up with every new FromSoftware release. Are these games difficult? Yes. Are they meant to be impossible? Absolutely not. And depending on your specific disability, arguing about the implementation of difficulty options will do little to fix glaring issues that continue to plague each entry. Difficulty settings are absolutely an important accessibility tool, but their weight and value are often egregiously conflated. For gatekeepers, I encourage you to listen to the words of the developer that you worship to understand these games are not meant to cause immense stress. And for disabled players, I ask you to openly talk about what you need to make this game accessible. Don’t assume that a single setting will erase every barrier.</p>

Unlike the Genesis Mini, the Mini 2 was not sold in stores. In fact, it was only available to purchase via Amazon Japan, and Sega manufactured significantly less quantities compared to the original.

That's a shame because the Genesis Mini 2 comes with a superior controller and has more built-in games, including some Sega CD gems, previously unreleased games, and a few new ports.

This is an Amazon Lightning Deal and stock is going fast, so we'd recommend grabbing the bundle you want before it's gone. In addition to getting a high-end handheld controller for your Switch, you'll also receive a hardshell case designed specifically for the Nitro Deck. All six Nitro Deck bundles feature nostalgic color schemes that nod back to old Nintendo consoles as well as the heyday of translucent gaming hardware. The GameCube- and SNES-inspired models are pretty awesome, but the four translucent models look great, too.

Retro enthusiasts will want to check out the SNES-style gray Nitro Deck. The other four colors--Crystal Pink, Emerald Green, Orange Zest, and Atomic Red--have translucent designs that nod back to the days when Nintendo made translucent Game Boy and Nintendo 64 models.</p>                      </div><p>The Nitro Deck acts as a cradle for your Switch. Compatible with both the standard Switch and Switch OLED, the screen slips into the U-shaped controller to give you controls on both sides of the display while also connecting to the USB-C port. This allows it to offer lightning-fast response times, as you don't have to rely on a wireless connection. The other benefit of the cradle design is that it feels extremely sturdy.</p><p>A number of features make the Nitro Deck stand out. It has full-size analog sticks and triggers, a conventional D-pad, four remappable back buttons, and curved handles that make it comfortable to hold. The analog sticks use Hall Effect sensors, which eliminates the components that cause stick drift. The analog stick caps are swappable, and each bundle comes with an extra set of caps.</p><p>It also has a built-in kickstand for tabletop mode and passthrough USB-C ports for charging and playing on a TV/monitor. You can't dock like your Switch like usual with the Nitro Deck, so the additional port is a nice perk. A companion smartphone app allows you to further customize the Nitro Deck's features. A button on the back of the controller lets you remap the four back buttons on the fly, too.</p><p>It's worth noting that while the Nitro Deck is comfortable to hold and the controls feel great, the right stick may be awkwardly positioned for you (depending on hand size). As you can probably see in the image, the right stick is located in a low spot, which requires some getting used to. And though the Nitro Deck has rumble, it's not as impressive as the "HD rumble" found in Nintendo's Joy-Con controllers.</p><p>The hardshell carrying case fits the Switch with Nitro Deck attached perfectly. It has a mesh pocket where you can store the included USB-C cable and analog stick caps. The carrying case also has an insert that holds eight game cartridges.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tRmXTNyQEo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0tRmXTNyQEo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-4k-blu-ray-box-set-amazon-preorder/1100-6524366/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Blu-Ray Steelbook Collection Is Back In Print, Preorders Live At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/official-xbox-controllers-get-significant-discounts-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6524341/">Official Xbox Controllers Get Significant Discounts At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-links-awakening-is-back-in-stock-for-40-at-amazon/1100-6511630/">Get Ready For Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom With This Great Link's Awakening Deal</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (2)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-big-on-nintendo-switch-joy-con-controllers-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6523566/">Save Big On Nintendo Switch Joy-Con Controllers At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inside-out-2-fans-should-check-out-the-new-lego-mood-cube-set/1100-6524400/">Inside Out 2 Fans Should Check Out The New Lego Mood Cube Set</a></li>   </ul> </div>

Now, I can do all of the puzzles right in the app over my morning coffee. It’s the little things!</p><p>Each <em>Strands</em> puzzle has a theme. That theme hints at the words you’ll need to find — including the “spangram” word that <em>spans</em> across opposite sides of the puzzle. Every letter in the puzzle is used for a themed word or the spangram. If you need some help, you can get hints by finding three non-themed words on the board.</p><p><em>Strands</em> is currently the <em>NYT</em>’s “third most searched game, behind <em>Wordle</em> and <em>Connections,</em>”<em> </em>and is “nearly as popular” as <em>Spelling Bee, The New York Times</em> says <a href="https://www.nytco.com/press/solvers-can-now-play-strands-in-the-new-york-times-games-app/">in a blog post</a>. Most people are actually finishing their <em>Strands</em> puzzles, too: “We consistently see 83% of <em>Strands</em> players finding the Spangram each day, and completion rate is around 81%, similar to the <em>Mini Crossword</em> and <em>Tiles</em>.” <em>Strands</em> will be added to the Game tab in the main <em>NYT</em> app “later this year.”</p><p><em>The New York Times</em>’ games aren’t always hits on the level of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/7/24151203/wordle-puzzle-archive-new-york-times"><em>Wordle</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/28/23848942/new-york-times-game-connections-iphone-android"><em>Connections</em></a>, or <em>Strands</em>. <em>Digits</em>, a math-based puzzle game, was only available in beta <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/18/23798932/the-new-york-times-digits-math-based-puzzle-game-shut-down">for a few months</a>. At least it had a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24186786/wordle-original-name-mr-bugs-wordy-nugz-wardle">clever title</a>.</p><p><em><strong>Correction, June 27th</strong>: An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the word that spans a </em>Strands<em> puzzle. The word is spangram, not spanagram.&nbsp;</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Amazon has unveiled the latest fist of games it's making available for Prime members to download and keep as part of its regular monthly offerings, with July's titles set to include Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition and Cat Quest 2.
</p>
<p>
In total, six titles are available for Prime members in July, with the full line-up as follow:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition</li>
<li>Cat Quest 2</li>
<li>Maneater</li>
<li>Midnight Fight Express</li>
<li>Masterplan Tycoon</li>
<li>YouTubers Life 2</li>
</ul>
<p>
So that's one stone-cold RPG classic, a casual action-RPG treat for co-op cat and dog lovers (honestly, the Cat Quest series is a delight), plus an open-world survival game about mauling everything you come across while playing as a massive shark.

<p>
As for the remaining three games, there's isometric beat-'em-up action in Midnight Fight Express, logistical resource management in Masterplan Tycoon, and YouTubers Life 2 - which, if I've learned anything from Eurogamer's Ian Higton, is basically: jorts.
</p>
<p>
In addition to the above, July makes a couple more titles available for streaming via Amazon Luna (for Prime members in the UK, US, Canada, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Austria, the Netherlands, or Poland, at least). Those games are Lego Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game, Spells &amp; Secrets, Strayed Lights, and A Little Golf Journey.
</p>
<p>
Amazon Prime Gaming's July line-up news follows the announcement it's giving away 15 additional games to Prime members in the run-up to Prime Day on 16th-17th July. These include Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder's Revenge, Card Shark, Hitman Absolution, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic 2 - The Sith Lords, and Alex Kidd in Miracle World DX. So there's some decent, varied stuff there.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, there's still time to snap up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-battlefront-2-free-with-prime-gaming-for-june-2024">June's Prime Gaming offerings</a>, which include Star Wars Battlefront 2, Weird West Definitive Edition, Mythforce, and Genesis Noir. Enjoy!

  <p id="rojhAZ"><strong>Thiollier and St. Trina</strong> are NPCs you’ll meet at the Three-Path Cross <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24182490/site-of-grace-locations-all-where-to-find-sote-dlc">Site of Grace</a> early on in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180113/dlc-walkthroughs-guides"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a><em> </em>DLC.</p>
<p id="Y5hlIX">At first, Thiollier is just a vendor for poison-related items, but his full story — along with St. Trina’s — will take the rest of your time in the Shadow Realm to play out.</p>
<p id="3dIGrn">Our <em>Elden Ring</em> DLC guide will walk you through <strong>where to find Thiollier and St. Trina</strong>, and all the steps you’ll need to take to complete their questline.</p>

<hr id="2LvuVn">
<h2 id="rMyjkp"><strong>Thiollier and St. Trina locations</strong></h2>


<p id="YVj8kz">You’ll meet Thiollier first near the <strong>Pillar Path Cross Site of Grace</strong> in Gravesite Plain. You can reach him there before you take on Castle Ensis.</p>
<p id="GxuHd2">Later, after you enter <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24180868/shadow-keep-walkthrough-dlc-sote">Shadow Keep</a>, you’ll be able to find St. Trina in the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24184742/cerulean-coast-how-to-get-to-route-dlc">Cerulean Coast</a> at the <strong>Garden of Deep Purple Site of Grace</strong>, and Thiollier will move to be with her there.</p>
<hr id="UBpJhk">
<h2 id="mdagQz"><strong>Thiollier first meeting in Graveyard Plain</strong></h2>
<p id="SszPua">There’s not really a rush to go find Thiollier at his initial location by <strong>Pillar Path Cross Site of Grace</strong>, but, since his questline overlaps with Moore’s, it’s probably best to get that initial meeting out of the way early before things get complicated. You can get there before tackling Castle Ensis by crossing Ellac Greatbridge, and then just taking the right inside the solider camp.</p>

<p id="VwKG1D">Ignore his warnings, and go talk to St. Trina. When you have the option, choose to <strong>imbibe nectar</strong>. Just like Thiollier said, this will kill you immediately. That’s the plan, though, so trust the process.</p>
<p id="Y1YD4s">Keep respawning at the site of grace and then <strong>imbibing the nectar over and over — four times in a row</strong> — until you start hearing St. Trina’s voice on the black screen before you respawn.</p>
<hr id="umo2fF">
<h2 id="qRbFQQ"><strong>Defeat Thiollier</strong></h2>
<p id="HEMnbC">Once you hear St. Trina’s words, head back and try to pass the message on to Thiollier. It’ll take two tries, and he won’t be receptive.</p>
<p id="09Yi8E">Imbibe the nectar (and die) again. You’ll hear a bit more from St. Trina in the darkness.</p>

As it stood, every three months, Bungie would launch a new season of content, including new storylines, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-fishing-removing-content-1851516335&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-fishing-removing-content-1851516335">activities</a></span>, and new gear. Narrative moments would be delivered piecemeal via weekly missions, radio chatter, and the occasionally rousing conclusion, but for the most part, seasons boiled down to the same repetition of events with different dialogue. Sometimes there wouldn’t even be new story content for weeks on end, leaving players to wonder when the narrative would pick back up.</p><p>By comparison, <em>Destiny 2</em>’s first episode, Echoes, concluded its first of three acts this week, and fans aren’t exactly thrilled with what they got. The bulk of Echoes content right now is a repeatable few activities, some new gear themed after the Vex enemy faction (who seem to be the focus right now), and the occasional cutscene or bit of dialogue. Now that the act has concluded, there’s nothing to really do but wait till the next one unlocks in a matter of weeks, meaning there’s basically a built-in down period now due to timegating. Sound familiar?</p><p>Suffice to say, seasons in <em>Destiny 2 </em>were often tiring, mind-numbing, and occasionally confusing to have to keep up with, and to make matters worse, every feature or mechanic introduced within them has been ripped out of the game once a new expansion launched. This approach has needed a change for a long time, and the new episodes should’ve been that. We’re off to a poor start if that’s the case, though, because things seem fundamentally the same as ever, if not a little worse.</p><p><em>Destiny</em> players have spent the past few weeks <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1dj28ia/i_was_really_hoping_with_the_switch_to_episodes/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1dj28ia/i_was_really_hoping_with_the_switch_to_episodes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">voicing these exact sentiments</a></span> and hoping that the best is still to come. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1djauvb/episodes_have_been_a_let_down_so_far/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1djauvb/episodes_have_been_a_let_down_so_far/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">One post</a></span> on the official <em>Destiny</em> subreddit called the structure of the first episode “a let down so far,” suggesting that “Echoes so far has just been an extended seasonal model with more time gating.” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1dobzux/episodes_are_worse_dripfed_content_that_seasons/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DestinyTheGame/comments/1dobzux/episodes_are_worse_dripfed_content_that_seasons/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Another</a></span> called episodes “worse dripfed content than seasons.” The assumption that some are running with is that since Echoes is wrapped up in the release of a new expansion, it’s also starting slow to not overwhelm players. If that just so happens to be the case, there’s now a lot of pressure on the rest of the episode to drum up some excitement.</p><p>Part of the problem is that Bungie never explicitly detailed what the difference here was going to be. While the studio touted episodes as a major shift that’d change the way it delivered content, it never broke down the model outside of a rough roadmap. Players understand that the three episodes following <em>The Final Shape </em>are going to be <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-episodes-next-year-1851530230&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-episodes-next-year-1851530230">more standalone stories</a></span>, rather than the connective seasonal narratives fans are used to, but what they really wanted to know was what to expect and when to expect it.</p><p>Instead, Bungie waited forever to follow up, and even when they did detail the subjects of the episodes, they still offered little in the way of a breakdown as to what players should expect to be doing. By offering little in the way of communication—a problem Bungie keeps running into and then amending for—expectations were allowed to build, and now many are disappointed to see that they’re seemingly getting even shorter bursts of content in their favorite ongoing game.

<p>Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has confirmed that XDefiant has passed 11 million players since its launch.</p>



<p>In the brand-new Ubisoft <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/E1e8T9q8rjZ4arsPNT1Xd/ceo-yves-guillemot-on-ubisofts-upcoming-portfolio-the-future-of-assassins-creed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">interview</a>, Yves touched on the company’s success with one of its GaaS titles, XDefiant. On XDefiant’s success, Guillemot said, “There’s a lot of work to do, but it was able to attract 11 million players in a short time. And that number will increase with all the work done by the team to ensure Season One brings a lot more to the existing experience. It’s about making the right choices and sticking to them.”</p>



<p>In May 2023, Insider Gaming exclusively reported that XDefiant became <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft’s fastest-ever title to reach one million players 2.5 hours</a> after its launch. After one week, the game achieved <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-8-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eight million unique players</a>.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, Ubisoft has since limited access to player data for all its employees, which is limited to a select number of people. Fortunately, though, Insider Gaming can report that the 10 million mark was passed in the first week of June, which suggests that new players coming to the game have drastically dropped. It’s also understood that concurrent player numbers have started to decline significantly, but there are hopes from the studio that the game’s first season will bring them back. By all accounts, though, XDefiant has surpassed all internal expectations and met its desired 10% retention rate after one month.</p>



<p>Continuing on XDefiant’s success, Yves said, “Well, outside of it being continually updated, with different experiences and optimized gameplay, I’d love to see it as a serious esport. But really, for a game like this, there’s no limit to its future. And we’ve got a fantastic team on it, who are listening to our players~~,~~ and communicating with them, which is so crucial. We’ve started off strong, but there’s still a long way to go, and I’m excited for us to step up to the challenge.”</p>



<p>XDefiant Season 1 is scheduled to launch on June 2, 2024.</p>

When asked if the company will continue to offer a variety of experiences from the franchise, Guillemot told players to get excited for “some remakes.” It’s not clear just how many remakes there will be or which Assassin’s Creed stories they will cover.</p><p>“Firstly, players can be excited about some remakes,” Guillemot said, “which will allow us to revisit some of the games we've created in the past and modernize them; there are worlds in some of our older Assassin's Creed games that are still extremely rich.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/09/16/ac-1-1663336669216.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Ubisoft has big plans for the future of Assassin's Creed.</figcaption></figure></output><p>He continued: “Secondly, to answer your question, there will be plenty of experience variety. The goal is to have Assassin’s Creed games come out more regularly, but not for it to be the same experience every year. There are a lot of good things to come, including Assassin’s Creed Hexe, which we’ve announced, which is going to be a very different game from Assassin’s Creed Shadows. We’re going to surprise people, I think.”</p><p>One remake contender that fans may already have their eyes on is 2013’s Assassin’s Creed 4: Black Flag. Last year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-4-black-flag-remake-skull-bones-1850596271" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Kotaku</u></a> reported that Ubisoft Singapore was heavily involved in the development of a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-is-reportedly-working-on-an-assassins-creed-4-black-flag-remake"><u>reimagining of the fourth mainline Assassin’s Creed game</u></a>. Now, more than a decade old, the pirate-themed action-stealth game remains a favorite among longtime enjoyers of the franchise, though the company hasn't gone as far as to confirm that a remake for this specific title is in the works.</p><p>Ubisoft has never released a full-on Assassin’s Creed remake before, but the series has a lot of options to pull from. The original Assassin's Creed launched in 2007 and was followed by the Ezio trilogy, which includes Assassin’s Creed 2, Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood, and Assassin’s Creed: Revelations. The company reexamined Ezio's three-arc story with a remaster bundle called The Ezio Collection in 2016.</p><p>Ubisoft is turning back the clock to reexamine Assassin’s Creed’s past, but its future holds a lot in store, too. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-assassins-creed-shadows-blends-new-and-classic-ideas-with-dual-protagonists">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> will transport fans to Japan when it releases its dual-protagonist story this November. In 2022, the publisher also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-infinity-announced-with-two-new-games"><u>revealed a project known as Assassin’s Creed Codename Hexe</u></a>. There company will also eventually release <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-assassins-creed-infinity-ubisoft-explains"><u>Assassin’s Creed Infinity</u></a>, a platform that is said to connect other experiences from the franchise under one umbrella.

The biggest is that, for the first time ever, Iron Banner will last two weeks, instead of the typical one.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie detailed the Iron Banner changes in its latest <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twid_06_27_2024" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This Week in Destiny blog post</a>. In the past, Iron Banner has come with a specific game mode for its week-long tenure; it used to be Control, but Bungie has been changing that up lately for some more dynamic, objective-based modes like Rift and Eruption. With the new two-week-long event, each week will feature a particular mode. For the first week, you'll play the king of the hill-like Control; in the second week, it'll be Tribute mode, which is similar to Supremacy, where you pick up crests dropped by players when they're killed.</p><p dir="ltr">Extending Iron Banner to two weeks should change some elements of it--namely, the grind should be a lot easier to rank up the event's reputation, gild its Triumph Seal, and earn its specific rewards. The week duration of past Iron Banners has meant that, if you really want to make the most of it, you have to play <em>a lot</em>. This longer version of the event should make it a little less of a pain for players who want to grab its special guns.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of guns, the upcoming Iron Banner will add two guns to the event's loot pool. The first is an updated version of Cimril's Dagger, a Kinetic hand cannon, which Bungie says has received a small boost to its stats and comes with a new pool of available perks. The second is Claws of the Wolf, the rapid-fire Void pulse rifle that has appeared in the event many times before. Claws can also roll with some of the new perks that have been added to the game in The Final Shape.</p><p dir="ltr">Alongside more time to earn those guns, Bungie has also made the grind to unlock them a little easier. First, you need to rank up your reputation with Iron Banner vendor Lord Saladin by playing in the event, hitting Rank 4 for Cimril's Dagger and Rank 7 for Claws of the Wolf. Once that's done, you'll be able to focus Iron Banner engrams you earn from playing into whichever weapon you want. You'll also receive more rewards just for playing matches, Bungie wrote. "Wins now guarantee a random Iron Banner weapon while also having a very high chance to award an Iron Banner engram on top of that. As for defeats, both weapon drops and engrams have a higher drop rate, too."</p><p dir="ltr">As in the past, you'll get a reputation boost for wearing Iron Banner armor, equipping Iron Banner emblems, and using Iron Banner weapons while playing matches in the event. That should make grinding out those new gun rolls less arduous than they have been in the past, but we'll have to see how the changes actually feel in practice when Iron Banner returns next week.</p>

			<p>According to Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot, Assassin's Creed remakes are coming. The Ubisoft boss said as much in a <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/E1e8T9q8rjZ4arsPNT1Xd/ceo-yves-guillemot-on-ubisofts-upcoming-portfolio-the-future-of-assassins-creed" target="_blank" rel="noopener">freshly-published interview</a> on the Ubisoft blog.</p>
<p>In the interview, Guillemot touched on Ubisoft's upcoming announced titles, XDefiant, the company's proprietary engines, and the Assassin's Creed franchise. Aside from saying that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-hexe-magic-powers-possession-fear-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin's Creed Hexe</a> will "surprise" fans, the CEO also confirmed the existence of several remakes of older entries in the series. According to Guillemot, the worlds in the older entries still have stories to be told. "Firstly, players can be excited about some remakes, which will allow us to revisit some of the games we've created in the past and modernize them; there are worlds in some of our older Assassin's Creed games that are still extremely rich", the Ubisoft boss said.</p>
<p>Guillemot then said that the upcoming project Hexe will be vastly different from the recently-announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-smaller-origins-sized-map-not-all-of-japan-covered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>.</p>
<p>"Secondly, to answer your question, there will be plenty of experience variety. The goal is to have Assassin's Creed games come out more regularly, but not for it to be the same experience every year. There are a lot of good things to come, including Assassin's Creed Hexe, which we've announced, which is going to be a very different game from Assassin's Creed Shadows. We're going to surprise people, I think."</p>
<p>Earlier this year we reported that development on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored Assassin's Creed Black Flag remake might very well have kicked off late last year</a>. Interestingly enough, outlet Insider-Gaming writes to have seen "brief" footage of Black Flag's main protagonist, Edward Kenway, in the remake. This footage, however, was shown to the outlet under the condition that it wasn't made public.</p>
<p>Many consider Black Flag one of the best entries in the popular Assassin's Creed franchise. The game was originally released as a cross-gen title in 2013 for PS3, Xbox 360, Wii U, PS4, and Xbox One. The game was later also released for PC and Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <p>
Ubisoft is cooking up multiple Assassin's Creed game remakes, according to company CEO Yves Guillemot. And while he hasn't revealed which ones yet, the news follows reports last year that Ubisoft's much-loved Assassin's Creed Black Flag is getting the remake treatment.
</p>
<p>
Guillemot made the comments in an <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/E1e8T9q8rjZ4arsPNT1Xd/ceo-yves-guillemot-on-ubisofts-upcoming-portfolio-the-future-of-assassins-creed">interview on Ubisoft website</a>, discussing the company's upcoming portfolio. And while it offered little in the way of surprises - Yves once again talked about generative AI NPCs, insisting they could be "more intelligent, more interactive" (and not just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-unveils-generative-ai-neo-npcs-and-the-spirit-of-peter-molyneuxs-milo-lives-on">dead-eyed creepy</a>) - he did manage to share a smattering of fresh information.
</p>
<p>
Which brings us to those remakes. In answer to a question about Ubisoft's future plans for the series, Yves revealed, "Firstly, players can be excited about some remakes, which will allow us to revisit some of the games we've created in the past and modernise them; there are worlds in some of our older Assassin's Creed games that are still extremely rich."

<p>
That lends credence to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-is-reportedly-remaking-rollicking-pirate-adventure-assassins-creed-black-flag">Kotaku report last year</a> claiming Skull and Bones studio Ubisoft Singapore was "heavily involved" in a remake of fan-favourite pirate-themed Assassin's Creed: Black Flag. However, the project was said to be "still in its earliest stages" and unlikely to be complete "for at least a few years". Of course, Guillemot has now confirmed <em>remakes</em>, opening up a world of possibility - although my money's probably on Assassin's Creed 2. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJcPc6OQ384">best joke in the series</a> deserves another chance to shine.
</p>
<p>
But Guillemot had a little more to say about Assassin's Creed, too. When asked if the difference in approaches between the leaner Mirage and more traditionally hefty upcoming Shadows was indicative of Ubisoft's future plans, Guillemot said, "There will be plenty of experience variety. The goal is to have Assassin's Creed games come out more regularly, but not for it to be the same experience every year."
</p>
<p>
"There are a lot of good things to come," he added, "including Assassin's Creed Hexe, which we've announced, which is going to be a very different game from Assassin's Creed Shadows. We're going to surprise people, I think."
</p>
<p>
Hexe, of course, is the one of several new series instalments that were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-explains-what-assassins-creed-infinity-actually-is">confirmed to be in development</a> all the way back in September 2022. It's set in 16th century Europe and appears to be targeting a 2026 launch, with the mobile-focused Assassin's Creed Jade expected first in 2025. As for this year's feudal-Japan-set <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, that's coming to PC, Mac, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S on 15th November.

He explains:</p><div><blockquote><p>“The metric we’re using to determine top-played is a combination of unique users and interest. <em>Hades 2</em> has only been out for a month, but so many Steam Deck players have it as one of their top played games for the entire year, that it was lifted in the rankings.”</p></blockquote></div><p>The new chart includes the current pricing and promotions for the top 100 titles (it’s launching on the same day that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/24/24185077/valve-steam-summer-sale-steam-deck-lcd-pc-deal-sale">Valve’s Summer Sale</a> is getting underway, which includes a discount on the LCD Steam Deck), day-to-day changes in each game’s ranking, and whether the title is verified for the console so it runs without compatibility issues.

R. Martin has been writing <em>The Winds of Winter, </em>the next book in his beloved fantasy saga. The HBO series inspired by the novels extended past his writing long before its final episode aired in 2019, though Martin did provide the broad strokes of how he intended to end his song of ice and fire. His last book, which inspired <em>House of the Dragon</em>, the <em>Game of Thrones</em>-spinoff currently airing on<em> </em>HBO, was published in 2018. Frustrated fans think <em>The Winds of Winter</em> will never come.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,195624,196773" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I was one of those frustrated fans until last week, when both <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-expansion-review-1851545505"><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a></span> and HBO’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/house-dragon-recap-season-2-episode-1-blood-and-cheese-1851560238&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/house-dragon-recap-season-2-episode-1-blood-and-cheese-1851560238"><em>House of the Dragon</em></a></span> simultaneously existed in our shared cultural consciousness, both shining beacons of Martin’s influence, mirroring or mimicking each other. Now I wonder, do I even need <em>Winds of Winter</em>?<br></p><p>For what it’s worth, it’s still unclear just how much Martin contributed to the story of 2022’s GOTY <em>Elden Ring</em>, though we know that game director Hidetaka Miyazaki reached out to him specifically for his fantasy expertise. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgCxVdsQH_k&amp;t=360s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgCxVdsQH_k&amp;t=360s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Martin has said previously</a></span> that he was in charge of building <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-goty-2022-dlc-fromsoftware-dark-souls-1849925353&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-goty-2022-dlc-fromsoftware-dark-souls-1849925353"><em>Elden Ring</em></a></span>’s world and the backstory of some of its key characters, but we have scant details beyond that. Does his writing exist in any form in the <em>Erdtree</em> DLC? We don’t know. But it doesn’t matter, as his influence is like the wind in The Lands Between—it’s everywhere.<br></p><h2 id="h13225"><a id=""></a>Martin, Monsters, Madness, and More</h2><p><em>Elden Ring</em>’s lore is as heady and dense as that in any Martin novel, but with clear themes that echo sentiments we’ve seen from him before: the burden one carries when ruling over a land, the danger of those twisted and gnarled by power, the horrors that the common folk face, the perils of religious extremism. The twisting narratives, the double-crossing, hell, even the gender fuckery is all stuff you’d expect from Martin, even if some of this was put forth by Miyazaki. It’s hard to put your finger on an essence, or a vibe, to carve it into something tangible like marble, but it’s there—Martin’s fingerprints are all over <em>Elden Ring</em>.<br></p><p>There are dragons, sibling rivalries, scorned lovers, weird religions, honorable (and dishonorable knights), dark magic, and a whole host of beautiful, dangerous-looking armor, diaphanous veils, and shiny-sharp weapons. If you had any doubt that Martin’s ideas are woven through <em>Elden Ring</em> like gilded yarn, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/BacklogReviewer/status/1794664734282915878&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/BacklogReviewer/status/1794664734282915878" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this X (formerly Twitter) thread</a></span> should convince you.<br></p><p>Diving into <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> while tuning in weekly for <em>House of the Dragon</em> has instilled in me a sort of cognitive harmony, a melding of the two worlds that then bleeds into my own. The latest episode, which aired on Sunday, June 23, featured a brief moment that felt like it was ripped straight from an <em>Elden Ring</em> cutscene.<br></p><p>Aemond, the one-eyed brother of the current king of Westeros (played brilliantly by Ewan Mitchell) is naked in bed with a woman he’s clearly paid for. His impossibly long, lithe limbs curl around themselves as he folds into the fetal position around her, his white-blonde hair cascading down his back—he looks, frankly, inhuman. We see for the first time that he’s replaced his missing eye with a sapphire. That eye has no lid, so as he lies there, curled up like some kind of half-human, half-deity with his good eye closed, it stares into the viewer, endlessly boring through us.<br></p><p>In this moment, he is strangely reminiscent of both <em>Elden Ring</em>’s straw-haired child-God, Miquella and his lanky, serpentine brother, Messmer, who was born with an evil inside of him that forced his mother to place a magical seal within his eye to keep it at bay. “Is this <em>Erdtree</em>?” I ask, jokingly, to no one.<br></p><p>While I’d still happily take a completed <em>Winds of Winter </em>before Martin departs this earthly plane, the last week has felt like a pretty damn good substitution for it. Watching a fantastic <em>Game of Thrones</em> story play out on-screen while playing a game inspired by Martin’s words is a sweet treat for fantasy fans, and I intend to gorge myself on both. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
