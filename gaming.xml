            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/once-human-faq-one-character<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>Once Human&nbsp;</i>developer Starry Studio has revealed that the game will only allow you to create one character per account at launch, with support for more coming later.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2139460/view/4230650600757463064" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new release FAQ</a> posted ahead of&nbsp;<em>Once Human</em>'s launch later today, Starry Studio says that once you've joined a server, you won't be able to create characters on any other server, nor will you be able to create additional characters on your main server.</p>
<p>However, the studio does say it's planning to add support for multiple characters per account in August, although it doesn't clarify whether this means multiple characters per server will also be allowed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/once-human-faq-character-restriction-rocket-launcher.jpg?itok=q2Q-4fxx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/once-human-faq-character-restriction-rocket-launcher.jpg?itok=Gp99O5mT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You're out of luck if you want to create multiple&nbsp;<em>Once Human&nbsp;</em>characters, at least initially.</figcaption></figure><p>The launch FAQ also contains a number of answers to other questions that might be relevant to your&nbsp;<em>Once Human&nbsp;</em>experience, including whether or not game accounts are cross-platform.</p>
<p>The answer to that one, in case you're wondering, is yes, although "some account types, such as Steam accounts", don't support cross-platform play "due to their inherent limitations". Crossplay, however, is fully supported between PC and mobile.</p>
<p>If you're wondering whether to choose PvE or PvP-style play for&nbsp;<em>Once Human</em>, Starry Studio says they're functionally very similar; all of the game's PvE challenges will also be available in PvP, but with the added spicy bonus of fighting other players.</p>
<p>You'll also see a ton of troubleshooting information for problems that might occur when you're installing or trying to play&nbsp;<em>Once Human</em>, so make sure to check out the FAQ if you're having any trouble later today.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what exactly&nbsp;<em>Once Human&nbsp;</em>is, it's a multiplayer open-world survival game inspired by the work of H.P. Lovecraft, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/once-human-is-weird-survival-game-you-can-try-soon">as well as the New Weird literary school</a>, which includes authors like&nbsp;China Miéville and Jeff VanderMeer.</p>
<p>The game takes place in a world ravaged by an apocalypse caused by a mysterious alien creature known only as Stardust. You'll have to battle monsters infected with Stardust to cleanse them and the world around you, all while gathering new weapons and building a base from which to stage your adventures.</p>
<p><em>Once Human&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2139460/Once_Human/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and mobile devices later today. It's free to play, so it won't cost you anything to download it and check it out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/07/09/playstations-pc-strategy-is-going-well-as-ghost-of-tsushima-was-the-best-selling<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>PlayStation's PC efforts are paying off, if the latest U.S. Video Game Market Highlights <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1810377988434964526">report</a> from analyst group Circana is any indication. That's because developer Sucker Punch Production's Ghost of Tsushima, which originally launched on PlayStation 4 back in 2020, was the best-selling game of May 2024 in the U.S. And that's almost assuredly due to <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/03/06/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut-rides-to-pc-in-may">the recent PC release of Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut on May 16</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut">Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut</a> hit PC almost four years after the game's initial launch on PS4, which speaks to PlayStation's PC release strategy it detailed last month. It said its live-service games, like this year's <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/helldivers-2/bullet-heaven">Helldivers 2</a> or the upcoming 5v5 hero shooter <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/concord">Concord</a>, will launch day-and-date on PC, but its tentpole single-player games, like <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/ghost-of-tsushima-directors-cut">Ghost of Tsushima Director's Cut</a> and God of War&nbsp;Ragnarök (<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2024/05/30/god-of-war-ragnarok-hits-pc-this-september">hitting PC this September</a>), will&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/30/playstation-says-live-service-games-will-launch-day-and-date-on-pc-but-single">launch at later dates</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nof3MBycrog" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p><strong>The rest of the top 10 for May 2024 looks like this</strong>:&nbsp;</p>

<ol>
	<li>Ghost of Tsushima</li>
	<li>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</li>
	<li>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III</li>
	<li>Helldivers II</li>
	<li>MLB: The Show 24</li>
	<li>Sea of Thieves</li>
	<li>Minecraft</li>
	<li>Elden Ring</li>
	<li>Hogwarts Legacy</li>
	<li>Stellar Blade</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>And here's what the top 20 best-selling games of the entire year look like:&nbsp;</strong></p>

<div>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Year-to-Date Ending May 2024 Top 20 Best-Selling Premium Games - U.S. (Dollar Sales, Physical and Digital from digital data sharing publishers, excludes add-on content) <a href="https://t.co/Wnacwg4ixw">pic.twitter.com/Wnacwg4ixw</a></p>
— Mat Piscatella (@MatPiscatella) <a href="https://twitter.com/MatPiscatella/status/1810378238876938258?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2024</a></blockquote>

</div>

<p>For May 2024, content spending fell 3% compared to May 2023, down to $3.6 billion, even despite a 13% growth in mobile content spending. However, that 13% increase in mobile spending was offset heavily by a 40% drop in console content spending, according to Circana executive director <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1810378018302603741">Mat Piscatella</a>. He attributes the May 2024 console spending decline (compared to May 2023) to the strength of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/such-great-heights">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's</a> launch last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elsehwere in the report, Piscatella says video game hardware spending declined 40% as well when compared to May 2023, down to $202 million. "Through May, all current generation hardware platforms are showing double-digit percentage declines year-on-year in 2024, with Switch showing the most significant drop," <a href="https://x.com/MatPiscatella/status/1810379249922331004">Piscatella writes on X</a> (formerly Twitter).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The PlayStation 5 led May 2024's hardware market in unit and dollar sales, with the Switch in second for unit sales and the Xbox Series X/S in second for dollar sales. Throughout each console's 43 months on the market, the PS5 is up by 8% compared to the PS4 and the Xbox Series X/S is down 13% compared to the Xbox One.&nbsp;</p>

<p>May spending on video game accessories dropped 8% when comparing May 2024 to May of last year, and the PlayStation Portal was the best-selling accessory in dollar sales for the month – it's also the best-selling accessory for the entire year.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-geforce-rtx-40-series-bundle-announced-by-nvidia-dlss-3-comes-to-wuthering-waves/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Black Myth: Wukong, Game Science's action roleplaying game due next month, will be bundled with GeForce RTX 40 Series products when acquired at select retailers.</p>
<p>NVIDIA announced the partnership with the Chinese developer today, revealing that purchasers of eligible products from select retailers and e-tailers (including GeForce RTX 4090, 4080 SUPER, 4080, 4070 Ti SUPER, 4070 Ti, 4070 SUPER, and 4070 graphics cards and desktop PCs, and laptops with a GeForce RTX 4090 Laptop GPU, RTX 4080 Laptop GPU, or RTX 4070 Laptop GPU) will receive a Steam code of the game to play when it launches on August 20. You may find out the full list of eligible partners in each country <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/campaigns/black-myth-wukong-bundle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on this dedicated page</a>.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong is one of the year's most anticipated games. It is loosely based on China's classic novel Journey to the West. Players will take control of a monkey called Destined One, based on Sun Wukong, a character from the novel, who can wield the Ruyi Jingu Bang staff as well as access several abilities and spells, including transformations. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, it will support full ray tracing (essentially path tracing), water caustics, and DLSS 3.5 (Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Ray Reconstruction). You can check out the system requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-delays-xbox-series-sx-version-opens-pre-orders-on-pc-ps5-shares-pc-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in this previous report</a>. It is currently unclear whether Black Myth: Wukong will be playable via GeForce NOW; however, console users may pick it up on PlayStation 5, while an Xbox Series S|X version will be launched later <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-delays-xbox-series-sx-version-opens-pre-orders-on-pc-ps5-shares-pc-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">following a delay</a>.</p>
<p>In other NVIDIA news, the free-to-play game <a href="https://wccftech.com/wuthering-waves-genshin-impacts-next-competitor-launches-on-may-22/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wuthering Waves</a> will upgrade its DLSS implementation. In addition to the already available DLSS Super Resolution, GeForce RTX 40 Series owners will soon be able to activate DLSS Frame Generation, too, granting them a performance boost. Of course, Wuthering Waves isn't exactly the most taxing PC game, having also been designed to run on Android and iOS devices.</p>
<p>Lastly, indie games Bears in Space and The Black Pool also recently added DLSS Frame Generation.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/microsofts-amazon-fire-tv-ad-declares-you-dont-need-an-xbox-to-play-xbox<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"No console? Don’t be scared."</h2></div><section><p>Microsoft is rolling out Xbox Gaming on Amazon Fire TV, and has released an advert that reinforces the message that you do not need an Xbox console to play Xbox games.</p><p>Xbox Gaming’s availability on Amazon Fire TV sticks means people can play games directly from the app via cloud gaming. It expands the potential audience for Xbox games and, crucially, the Xbox Game Pass subscription. All you need to play is a compatible Fire TV stick, a Bluetooth-enabled wireless controller, and an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription to stream Xbox games.</p><p>But it’s the accompanying advert that has raised the eyebrows of some hardcore Xbox fans. The clip, which seems to riff on the Scream movies, sees a woman answer the phone to an unnamed man who is disguising his voice.</p><p>“What’s your favorite video game?” he asks.</p><p>“Very funny. Who is this?” the woman replies.</p><p>“Somebody who wants to play Xbox.”</p><p>“Don’t you need an Xbox for that?</p><p>“You don’t need an Xbox to play Xbox.”</p><p>"What kind of game is this?”</p><p>“It’s not a game. It’s hundreds of Xbox games, now playable on Amazon Fire TV stick. [Laughter.]”</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Xbox (@Xbox) <a href="https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1810381884666556688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 8, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Microsoft is clearly trying to alleviate fears from some that they have to fork out hundreds of dollars on a console in order to play Xbox games. “No console? Don’t be scared,” reads the Xbox tweet. It taps into a feeling from some hardcore Xbox fans that Microsoft has deprioritized the Xbox console itself as it works to broaden the appeal of gaming across PC, mobile, and now devices like smart TVs and streaming sticks.</p><p>While Xbox executives insist consoles remain an important part of Microsoft’s video game business, the current models, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-shipped-almost-5x-more-than-xbox-series-x-and-s-during-last-quarter-analyst-reports">the Xbox Series X and S, are struggling in sales terms</a> and lag behind rival consoles the PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch. Indeed, Xbox boss Phil Spencer has admitted on multiple occasions that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-admits-xbox-has-lost-the-console-wars-as-it-battles-for-69-billion-activision-blizzard-buyout">Microsoft has lost the console war</a>, even as it readies the release of new models, a promised next-gen console, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-on-xbox-handheld-rumors-being-able-to-play-games-locally-is-really-important-ign-live-2024">a heavily rumored Xbox handheld</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>New Xbox Series X and S Models - First Look Images</h3></div></output><p>This latest advert, then, will do nothing to calm concern from the vociferous parts of the Xbox community that Microsoft is leaving consoles behind. Indeed some have already said it's little wonder why Xbox Series X and S have sold so poorly when Microsoft itself sends the message that they're not needed to play Xbox games. This, coupled with Microsoft's controversial decision to go multiplatform with some of its first-party Xbox games, has caused quite the stir within the Xbox community in the last year.</p><p>Microsoft, for its part, has made no secret of its big picture ambition to reach a billion gamers across the globe with Xbox. The recent $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard, for example, was as much about picking up Candy Crush maker King ahead of a planned mobile gaming store launch as it was snapping up Call of Duty. In truth adverts like the one above aren't about the future of Xbox, they're about the present. Perhaps with the launch of the next generation and similar moves from Sony, we’ll finally see the end of the video game console war and the start of the video game streaming war.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

In a quiet spell of the market, you and other merchants might decide to start playing a game while also discussing the state of commerce. All manner of people have been known to enjoy this kind of pastime and you are of course no different; after all, the Royal Game of Ur (known to you most likely by a different name) has really spread far and wide and enjoys popularity even beyond the borders of this region. Something occurs to you as you arrange the pieces on the board ready for play: although you have played this game hundreds of times it never feels like you are playing the same game over and over again. As you face off against your opponent and start to play, you both interlace your conversation about current topics with little remarks about the game strategy and then it hits you: the game itself is just a conduit for social interaction. Sure you could have the same conversation without playing the game, but the simple act of playing gives you both an activity to bond over, and the conversations seem to flow differently. The same game played in complete silence would not be as entertaining.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Looking at today’s society we are not much different from the people in Ancient Mesopotamia playing the Royal Game of Ur. Our means of connecting have changed a lot and so have our games, but the basic desire to connect with others has stayed the same. Human desires and needs are pretty much universal and have remained more or less unchanged throughout history. Learning from the past is of course crucial when it comes to any kind of innovation, but how we approach this can radically change the results we end up with.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Virality">Virality</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When we examine history and try to learn from it, it’s easy to overlook the details that don’t translate one to one into our current lived experience. Many terms have emerged in game design in the past decades that describe phenomenons as we see them in relation to video games, but sometimes these phenomenons have existed long before video games and definitely before we had words to describe them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For example, the pieces and boards for the Royal Game of Ur or similar-looking games have been found throughout the Middle East and India (Tam, 2008). This means that the game resonated with people so much that they took it with them on their travels and taught others how to play. In modern game design language, the term for this phenomenon is “virality”.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Virality is essential for multiplayer and social games, be they physical board games or video games; this is because they are limited to being played with other people. Apart from being a great method for the game to gain popularity, growing through virality has a host of other benefits: players will feel more attached to a game they play with friends, they will have fond memories of it and they are more likely to associate said game to social interaction, meaning they will in turn recommend it to others. And this is of course not a thing exclusive to this digital era. If we go back to the example of people playing the Royal Game of Ur, we would probably see a similar story written with a different pen. If your merchant friend showed you the game and taught you how to play, you would be more likely to try to get your own copy than if you just heard about it around the market. Similarly, today a recommendation from your favourite Twitch streamer weighs a lot more than a targeted ad because you trust the influencer and respect their expertise. A recommendation from a friend is even more valuable because it’s curated to your specific tastes in games. Even in circumstances where you might be a little sceptical about the game recommendation itself, the relationship between you and the person recommending the game is more likely to lead to you at least giving the game a proper try before you dismiss it. This means that a lot of people who would not otherwise be drawn to the game for its intrinsic value might end up playing anyway for the social value.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our means of sharing our favourite games with the people we like has changed a lot from ancient times; we can communicate across the world in seconds and video games are ready-made and easy to purchase online. But the desire that drives one person to convince another to play with them a game they enjoy has remained unchanged.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The social contract">The social contract</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Social and multiplayer games rely on the agreement between the involved parties to uphold a certain kind of closed group social contract. The term “social contract” (Shand 2015) is derived from political discourse and it refers to an implicit agreement to cooperate as part of a group in order to receive certain benefits in return. However, in this case, we use this term to refer to the tacit agreement between parties to follow a specific set of softly enforced rules, that while they might not be the letter of the law, they affect our adherence to the group. The way this contract is enforced is through social obligation, which is here used to refer to the way people may feel the need to act in specific ways in order to please others they consider friends. The term “obligation” here is not used to suggest the person responding is in one way or another reticent to doing these things, and it does not equate to terms like “peer pressure”, instead it’s about the intrinsic need we humans feel to please those we like through our actions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A game can encourage through its structure the establishment of such a social obligation in order to establish long-term social play. Because this kind of dynamic can be overused it is important that developers use this in good faith and sparingly, so the players feel in control of how often they interact with others but can still see the clear benefits of doing so.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let’s take, for example, Dungeons &amp; Dragons (D&amp;D) and how the game uses the social contract to its advantage while also being mindful of the kind of effect it has on players. Firstly, D&amp;D requires at least two people to play, a Dungeon Master (DM) and a Player Character (PC), though realistically the game is made for larger groups. The two sides of this structure must be present for the game to take place; a DM without players cannot proceed and neither can players without their DM. If the PC party is larger than one (which in most cases it is), all players must agree to join the game before the party can proceed with the adventure. If one of the PCs can no longer join the group on a regular basis, they need to make an agreement with the DM and potentially with the other players about what happens to their character; the same goes for someone new joining a running campaign. D&amp;D (and other similar tabletop roleplaying games [RPGs]) uses a couple of design techniques that enforce the need to uphold the social contract in the group that it is played in.</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Asymmetric gameplay</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: In D&amp;D each person has a class, and while one player could theoretically go through an adventure by themselves (provided the DM accommodated them), the strength of the game comes from the interplay of classes. Suddenly the issue of “John can no longer make it on Wednesday evenings” turns into “What are we going to do without a rogue?” Players are more likely to find a scheduling solution because the gameplay is more balanced and more interesting when the party is balanced. Similarly, the players are more likely to try to get others to join if they are looking for another class to join their party. The wonderful subtlety of asymmetric gameplay in Dungeons &amp; Dragons is of course that it’s all in the hands of the DM who can make decisions and adjust the difficulty and the nature of the quest to match the active players.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Accessible format</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Although D&amp;D is one of the more in-depth RPG systems out there, it still retains an impressive level of accessibility. You could argue that the books are a significant expense for those starting out, but a single copy can be enough for an entire group and it offers as many possibilities as the DM can dream up. Aside from the obvious investment in the source material, all players really need are pens, paper, dice and an active imagination.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Leverage power players</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: The DMs of D&amp;D (and really any tabletop RPG) are often the power players of the game. They know the game inside out, they are more likely to buy auxiliary material, and they are very likely to convince others to try the game. This works great for D&amp;D for a few reasons. Firstly, it makes the game less intimidating for new players; if their DM knows a lot about the game, then they can worry less about the subtleties of the game and focus on learning the basics. Secondly, it helps with the initial financial barrier to entry; your DM likely owns all the materials the group needs to play and others can just join. Last but not least, the DM has every intention to make others enjoy the game because a campaign is as much a reflection of their performance as a DM as it is a reflection of the game itself.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">D&amp;D has lasted through the years, and even though its popularity has risen and fallen, it still remains a cultural touchstone when it comes to tabletop RPGs. This is because D&amp;D evolves with its audience; the game you get to play today is not the same one as when it was first released in 1974, and this is not only due to the new editions of the rules. D&amp;D encourages player intervention and player-made rules; homebrews can take any shape and may even choose to ignore certain aspects of the game to make it more interesting for the group playing. This, in addition to keeping the game fresh, allows the player to adapt the context of play to the dynamic of the group, establish the boundaries of play and what everyone wants to take out of playing. In the case of Dungeons &amp; Dragons and other tabletop RPGs, it’s put to those involved how often they meet, what the expectations are when turning up at the gaming table and what is the amount of involvement one must have in order to be part of it. This flexibility allows the players to form a social contract, that in this case is easier for them to uphold because it’s expressly tailored to the group by the members of said group.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Social reengagement">Social reengagement</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Much like the Royal Game of Ur, multiplayer and social games rely on other people being active participants in order for the game to offer the intended experience. This means a couple of things: firstly, if the player can’t find someone suitable to play with them, the game will not take place and, secondly, the quality of the experience is highly reliant on the quality of the relationship the player has with their gaming partner. At first glance, this model seems to have some very strong disadvantages working against it, and yet time and time again throughout history it has been proven to work. This is because the same things that seem to hurt it can end up helping it succeed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of my earliest memories of people playing games together is of my grandfather and his neighbour playing backgammon and chess outside in the garden during the summer months. The way they played games was a bit like a ritual: they would finish a long day of work outside caring for the animals or tending to the orchard. After that, when the air was cooler and they finished their day’s work, they would get together over a glass of plum brandy, gossip, and play. In other words, the game was there as part of a routine and the social interaction gave them an excuse to play; this is what we call social reengagement.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This type of reengagement relies on the participants making a habit out of playing the game together, and it works very well as a method of getting people back to the game. To be able to take full advantage of social reengagement, the game in question has to become part of this kind of social contract between people, which means that the parties involved have a tacit agreement that they will follow a pre-established set of rules, and in this case a pre-established routine. There is nothing to stop one player from ditching the other, but they do it out of an implied agreement, and if one party bails, the others will get upset. Becoming part of someone’s social ritual is challenging, especially in a world with so much content, but once achieved, players will return to the game organically and will remind each other to play. To understand more about how this can be used to our game’s advantage, we need to take another look at history.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><br><span data-testid="content-text">Party games are exclusively social; their purpose is to engage people and entertain them during parties and gatherings. Unlike classic board games like Chess and Go where the agreement to play is between two people and the rules are very strict, party games have looser rules and they can be played with a large number of players. Take charades for example, the only immutable rule of the game is “do not speak while miming”. As long as the players keep that rule, the rest of the game can be rearranged to accommodate the group that is playing. For example:</span><br></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players can keep score or not, which lets them decide how competitive they want the game to be based on the kind of social situation they are in.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players can be split into teams making this more of a group activity or they can play as individuals in a free-for-all style making the game a lot more focused on the individual. 8 Designing games meant for sharing</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players can use syllable and number or word conventions or not, which allows the group to tailor the game’s difficulty.</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players can choose to play with a single category of subjects or go broad, which not only affects difficulty but it also lets the players tailor their game around their specific interests.</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the case of charades, the low barrier to entry and the flexible rules that can accommodate any number of players made it easy for the game to initially establish itself as the game to play at parties in early 19th century France. The historical context in which a game becomes popular is very important; if charades did not exist already and got invented, now you might see how it would struggle to become popular, but because it is an already widely known established game people still play to this day. This is because the game has been passed down through generations as an activity suitable for gatherings, so social reengagement is very strong. Even if a group of people have not played the game together before, they are very likely to have played it with others, and the simple act of getting together reminds them of the game and so the cycle continues.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Sociocultural context">Sociocultural context</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Entertainment and its value as seen by the public that consumes it has always had a strong connection with the state of society. This has many facets and it expands beyond the topic of games to other kinds of entertainment:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Appealing to current societal desires</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Accessibility in the current social context</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Appealing to current societal desires doesn’t always mean the game has to directly address current events but rather it has to fit in the current view society at large has. For example, Monopoly has been a popular board game for family nights for decades now, and throughout time countless reskins of the original concept have been created. But what really created such a long-lasting legacy for this game? After all, the game itself is almost entirely governed by chance; even the dominant strategies are not much to go off of in Monopoly, almost like the game is telling the player that winning in the game of fortune is ultimately determined mostly by luck and not smart investment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The case of Monopoly is interesting. The original creator, Elisabeth Magie, created The Landlord’s Game as a piece of social commentary. She designed the game to be a representation of her views on the ill effects of monopolism and presented in it novel ideas about how the land tax was a Chapter 1: A history of games as social interaction 9 way to solve this issue. The goal of the game wasn’t initially just acquiring wealth, but when Charles Darrow agreed with Parker Brothers to publish a game “very similar” to Magie’s Landlord’s Game, the goal of the game shifted to creating a monopoly instead, hence the name. While Darrow is largely recognised as having been falsely credited as the original creator of Monopoly, it’s worth pointing out that the changes he made to the overall goal of the game might not have been entirely unrelated to the success of the game over time. Making a statement about society in a game can be powerful and gather a lot of backing from people who are of a similar mindset, but the dream of becoming incredibly rich and powerful is a desire that can be sold to a lot more people (and has been for years under the guise of the American dream).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Accessibility in the current social context is also incredibly important, and video games of today are simultaneously incredibly easy to access and incredibly inaccessible. On one hand, we can argue that free-to-play mobile games have changed the way that we think about consuming entertainment and that even those that invest nothing in entertainment itself have access to some form of it. On the other hand, video games are still for the privileged who can pay the initial price of owning the hardware necessary to play in the first place. When creating games that are meant to be played socially, making them as easy to access as possible is a huge deal because the preposition to play a game turns suddenly from “let’s play this game together” to “can we both afford to play this game”. There are many ways video games have dealt with lowering the financial barrier to entry, one of the more obvious examples being couch multiplayer. Fighting games, for example, have proven that this model not only has staying power with franchises like Street Fighter or Mortal Kombat being still popular 30-plus years after their original release, but they are also incredibly financially successful. The crucial part of couch co-op is that once one of the players is convinced to play the game, there is no additional barrier or cost for their friends to join them in playing. This works brilliantly because it both offers access to the game to those who would otherwise not be able to play it, but it also functions as a promotional tool, for example, if the friend enjoys the game and can afford the buy-in price they are more likely to purchase it themselves. Of course this type of co-op is limited to players being in the same place at the same time, which does not seem to be very in keeping with the kind of communication and social lives we have nowadays. This is no doubt a reason why more modern games have started to move away from this multiplayer model or include an additional online component that allows players to join each other from anywhere as long as they have access to the internet. In Chapter 3, I will talk in more detail about the advantages and disadvantages of online and offline social play and how they can be used to achieve different results.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The living ruleset">The living ruleset</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Oral transmission of rules and players’ involvement in determining what the game ultimately becomes has been a key feature of games in the past. Oftentimes players will experiment with their own house rules in order to make the experience more entertaining for the context they are in. This might be seen by some developers as damaging to the integrity of the game rules, after all, players are not designers and they have not spent all this time learning about how to create the perfect system. But in reality, players have an advantage in this scenario: they know what the audience wants best because they are the audience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some players will always try to push the boundaries of what is possible in a game; some of them might even resort to cheating in order to get a different experience the game considers to be not intended. The real way to make sure that players can bend the rules to their desired experience and still keep it fair for everyone else is by encouraging the upholding of the social contract during the game. For example, if we think about a homebrew rule for D&amp;D the only people who need to agree to it and uphold it is the group playing that specific campaign. Similarly, if we are talking about a player using banned cards in a Magic: The Gathering tournament, which is something that all tournament-goers have agreed not to do, we can rely on the social contract and expect others to report the player for cheating.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Trading card games (TCGs) are an interesting example of what I like to call a “living ruleset”. A lot of physical games use revisions and reskins to update the ruleset of the game, but TCGs have a unique quality that helps them be a lot more flexible: they are built to be modular. The ruleset for such a game is comprised of multiple layers:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The basic table layout and goals</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The abilities of individual cards</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The banned and limited lists</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The table layout and goals are the glue that binds together the rest of the game. While not immutable, this part of the rules would be the last to change in order to accommodate new play styles and cards. Take, for example, Yu-Gi-Oh. In the 20-plus years it has been available in the West, the goal of the game has not changed at all: the player must reduce their opponent’s life points to zero before their opponent has the chance to do this to them. The table layout hasn’t changed drastically either, though a couple of new card slots have been added to accommodate the new mechanics described on new cards. The speed and dynamics of the game, however, have changed entirely since the first iterations of the game. In the beginning, the game was less focused on card synergy and had a lot more back-and-forth with the players relying on buying themselves time to summon their powerful monsters. In the most current meta, however, players aim to win in as few turns as possible, linking actions in the same turn and using card synergies to get extra actions. The reason why this is possible is because a significant part of the rules for Yu-Gi-Oh are contained by the cards themselves. While the broad-stroke rules for the game are less flexible, cards have incredible flexibility. As long as the original rules are kept in mind, there is a whole world of experimentation that can be created for each card; this includes introducing new mechanics, changing number balancing and adding new lore and flavour text. And if a new card turns out to be more powerful than originally expected and starts affecting the competitive aspect of the game, the creators can ban it or limit that card’s usage.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But how does this really affect the social component of the game? Well, at the core of a living ruleset is always the game’s community. In many ways, to be able to shift and evolve with your audience is something that requires a lot of effort, but due to the modularity of this system and the ability to easily add and subtract for it, it can help in theory to have a game that keeps the people interested engaged by catering to them with small changes. Of course there are also drawbacks to this system as in most cases; over time some of these systems become so complex that new players struggle to join, especially if they do not have someone to teach them the ropes. Ultimately, when a game desires to be long-lived it has to choose between entertaining its existing versus its new customers at times, and the living ruleset can help to independently address different parts of the demographic.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Social-added value">Social-added value</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s fair to say that even the most commonplace experiences can be made memorable in the right company. This is because the connection between people adds social value to whatever experience we are talking about. Games benefit a lot from this added social value, which can take a couple of forms:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Playing games as a bonding activity</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Using games to find like-minded people</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Using games as a status symbol</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A great example of a game that takes advantage of all forms of social-added value is chess. The game is played at a casual level among friends, and while the practical goal of the game is outsmarting your opponent and winning, the social goal of the game is to be a bonding activity. The players know each other and while the mechanics of chess force the two to be in opposition, the social aim for this is to become closer friends by the end of the game. At a more macro level, local tournament-goers have a stronger desire to win than those playing a friendly match; in this case, the practical goal stays the same, but the social goal changes. Players are looking for others who can match their skill level and while they might not end up winning the tournament, they are sure to make new acquaintances they will keep running into should they continue to compete in tournaments. Those competing in national or even international chess tournaments have a different social goal: they use their ability to play the game as a status symbol looking to prove to the other chess players that they are the best.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All players, from novices playing friendly games to national champions battling for the number one spot, play the same game, they abide by the same rules and they have the same practical aim to the game, but the social-added value for each of these people is completely different. The game achieves this with an easy-to-understand but hard-to-master gameplay because it allows players to have different levels of involvement with the game mechanics. The basic rules of chess are in theory very simple: each piece has a moving pattern, and each turn players can capture an opponent’s piece and eliminate it from the game. The win condition is a bit more vague but still pretty simple to understand: if a player’s king is in immediate danger of being captured by the opponent and they can’t make any valid moves to escape, the player loses the game. The wonderful thing about chess is that these simple rules create a huge possibility space for different strategies and outcomes. As a result, mastery of these mechanics comes from understanding the complex repercussions that a single move can have over the entire game, anticipating the opponent’s moves and crafting a strategy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While player skill seems to have a direct correlation with the type of social involvement a player seeks, it is not actually that straightforward; they are instead two separate aspects of the game that drive each other. The complexity of the game makes the competitive sphere for the game more meaningful for those who are very skilled, but whether a player competes is ultimately driven by their desire for a particular type of social interaction. It’s perfectly plausible that very skilled players will never join tournaments because their goal is to use the game as a bonding activity with their friends. Inversely, a prodigy might bypass the casual play phase entirely and learn more about the game with the sole purpose of competing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The demand for games as entertainment is now bigger than ever, and more games see social play as an attractive prospect. It’s important for us to analyse the games that came before to see what attributes made them successful. Even though the games we make today are very different from their precursors and they aim to be liked by a modern audience, the techniques they use can be adapted to the current environment. In the next chapter, I will talk more about a person’s adherence to a group, how that influences their choices and view of themselves and how this ultimately translates to in-game behaviours.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-trouble-of-tunnel-vision-gamers-and-developers-not-seeing-the-forest-for-the-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As someone who has had to bear witness to every game dev complaint cycle that has occurred on social media over the past decade, I can say that real life is a roguelike with how many times the same argument happens repeatedly. Recently on social media, I saw someone perfectly encapsulate one of the worst thoughts you can have about game design, and they’re not alone. A problem that a lot of developers and consumers have when it comes to understanding and analyzing games is when they only view games from&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>their</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;specific point of view, and it’s time to talk about why tunnel vision is bad for game design.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="My Way or the Highway"><span>My Way or the Highway</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tunnel-vision in this respect is only looking at the industry and games from one specific point of view — yours. We see this from critics, journalists, YouTubers, streamers, and consumers: “I don’t like game X, so X is just bad” or “I really like this, so it must be perfect.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We can also see this any time a game comes out as a surprise hit — your&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Balatros, Vampire Survivors, FTL,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;and so on. You will always hear a chorus of people declaring “Why is this game doing so well? It’s just X.” Game design analysis is still a mystery to people, not just those outside of the industry. Being able to examine the UI/UX, the progression, and the feel of a game to see how it resonates with people may sound like magic, but for people like me who do this daily, it’s as easy as breathing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The problem for a lot of people who try to talk about games is that they tend to view “videogames” as this monolithic term — one game is the same as all games — You get the same experience playing&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Call of Duty</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;as you would&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Elden Ring</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stardew Valley</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. So, if you just play one game, or like one game, then that’s all you need from the game side of things to build something. Or that one kind of game should be the definition for “the game” that all others should be judged by. This is the same crowd who will also discount genres that they don’t like or think that they can just jump into a completely different genre and make a best-selling game.</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8xSbfipsuYE" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And while the social media post may just be talking about specific games that just try to copy something that’s already been done, there are people on the consumer and developer side who take it to the extreme — that only their game, or particular style of game, matters, and everything else is just lesser or unimportant.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With that, it’s time to burn some bridges to talk about the kinds of tunnel vision I see that give me a headache every time.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Loathsome Wholesome"><span>Loathsome Wholesome</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A lot of videogames are about fighting or overcoming some kind of conflict, as I’m sure everyone of you reading this knows fully well. And there are people who, surprisingly, don’t want to play games with violence in them. And a few years ago, a new marketing term and movement was created around the “wholesome” brand — games that specifically are meant to be for people who don’t want violence in their games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That in itself is great, there have been a lot of cozy games released that explored different topics and themes without combat whatsoever. However, there are people and designers who have taken this too far and define wholesome as better than anything else. And if a game looks charming and cozy, but doesn’t meet their definition of wholesome, then the game is lying to them, the developers are trying to con them, and that there is something wrong with the game. Another problem for them is if a game looks wholesome but wants to talk about something dark or unsettling that’s important, then that doesn’t belong either in their opinion.</span></p><p>How (some) wholesome fans act when they get their way, and when they don’t</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Just as there is toxic negativity, there is toxic positivity — where something must only be good and pure and there can never be anything wrong or bad or any criticisms mentioned. And again, if a developer wants to make a game like that, that’s fine. The problem is when people demand that, or if a game doesn’t adhere exactly to their point of view, then it’s a problem with the game and the designers themselves.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As you’re going to see with the other examples, only focusing on the extreme examples that fit your point of view is not how you should digest videogames or make them.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Simple is Stupid"><span>Simple is Stupid</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Videogames have been around long enough that we have gone through multiple revisions and evolutions of design. The biggest was the move from 2D to 3D that occurred in the mid-90’s. Despite that, there was a 2D revolution among the indie scene in the 2010’s that led to some of the most amazing-looking, and playing, games released. However, there is this sentiment from both consumers and fans that 2D design is “simple”, it is meant to be a steppingstone to making real games: those that are 3D.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the biggest tells that someone can have when they don’t understand design is when they make fun of 2D games for being simple or easy to do. This is also part of the anti-casual crowd, who think that easy games are beneath them. The truth is that 2D design is very hard to do right, because there are so many examples of it out there. For every&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hollow Knight</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;or&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ori</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, there are countless games that feel and play wrong within the 2D space. If you think that you can just hit a button and turn a 3D experience into 2D or vice-versa, you are never going to make a great game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even the “simplest” game is anything but. Too many developers and consumers view complexity as a metric for quality and not a problem with the UI/UX. And don’t get me started on making an effective 2D camera for a game, as this post will turn into a short story at that point.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Wailing About Walking"><span>Wailing About Walking</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On the opposite side of the problem, there are people who only think that a game is something where you need to save the world/princess/universe at the end of it and be called a hero. Part of the evolution of design over the 2010’s was seeing games that weren’t like anything else that came before it. Titles that focus on storytelling, art, and cinematography, rather than on APM and combat.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can dislike walking simulators, visual novels, or any gameplay-less game that you want, but that doesn’t mean these aren’t games. And again, if you think that just putting sad music, text on a screen, and walking slowly, will make the videogame equivalent of a Picasso, that’s not going to work. Just as there is a huge difference between good and bad 2D design, there is also a wide line between good and bad story-driven games.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Games are ART (insert fancy font)"><span>Games are ART (insert fancy font)</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And now we turn to the endless debate about videogames — yes, videogames are art. This point is from people who when they think of “art” only think of something meant to trigger a core memory from their childhood and start weeping uncontrollably at a game — not the joy of landing a triple wall jump dive to find a hidden secret in a level.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are a lot of modern designers who look at games that focus entirely on story above all else as the perfect game. That if a videogame is not inspired by classic cinema, poetry, or makes references to Aristotle, then it’s trash for the peasants. This goes back to the previous point with viewing 2D design as lesser compared to 3D, and that it’s almost beneath them to play a game whose entire story can be summed up as “the president has been kidnapped by ninjas.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is part of the social media post that I read, that to them, designers these days are only being inspired by other games, and not by anything else, which is a problem for them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the end of the day, shockingly, you should be playing and studying videogames if you want to make a videogame. Not only are videogames art, but they are also an entire medium now, and just as a painter can be inspired by other paintings, designers can be inspired by other games. The reason why we see so many outstanding games from first-time developers and students is the fact that they played a ton of games, specifically the ones that they are inspired by, to study them and learn what they want out of their game.</span></p><p>videogames are playable art, and the “playable” part is important if you want a consumer base</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">And I hear this art argument a lot from designers who list their favorite games as those with a majority focus on storytelling —&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Return of the Obra Dinn, Pentiment,&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and more. I’m about to shock you with this next statement — both of those games are not shining examples of perfect games or even mass-market appeal games, and before you write me a message telling me I’m wrong or being a contrarian, I’m not the one who said that&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>their consumer bases said it</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. We see this a lot from critically well-received games, where the critics and other designers declare a game as the greatest thing ever, to only find that the consumer base is the exact opposite.&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/stats/653530/achievements">ROD</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/stats/653530/achievements">&nbsp;</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/stats/653530/achievements">lost 40% of its player base on steam before they even solved 6 fates</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://steamcommunity.com/stats/1205520/achievements">Pentiment has 54% churn on steam before beating the first act</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. I’ve said this before, just because you really like a game or think it’s the best thing ever, doesn’t mean that everything in the game worked for the consumer or that it was perfect. Part of understanding and growing as a designer is to look objectively at a game and find ways that you can improve the UI/UX.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Very artistic games are also very polarizing, and high churn for games with different gameplay is to be expected. However, you shouldn’t be treating a game that lost more than half the consumer base that bought it as the proof that games are art or that they were perfect in every way, nor should you view the sales of that as indication that another game would do just as well. While games are art, they are still a product that’s meant to be enjoyed by consumers, and if the consumer is not enjoying your game, then there was a problem with it that you should understand for your next one.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Hate the Game and the Gamer"><span>Hate the Game and the Gamer</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For the final point, there’s been these rumblings on social media looking at “creatives” in the game industry. Just as there are people who view 2D as a steppingstone for 3D, there are some people who seem like they view videogames as a steppingstone to “real art” — movies, TV, etc. Some of this can be seen in the AAA space, as designers and studios of the biggest-budget games are now being recognized and celebrated outside of just their game’s fanbases. When they talk about the games they make, they don’t talk about the design, the team behind them, or the implementation, but focus only on the cultural impact of the game and the honor it was to make it.</span></p><p>A misconception people have about Hideo Kojima’s games is that the story trumps his gameplay, but he always designs original gameplay to fit his original stories</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We see this when people try to translate videogames to other mediums, and either slavishly try to make the game 1:1 or take out everything in the game to the point that it doesn’t even look recognizable. They’re not understanding the medium of a videogame, and that it is legitimate and different from everything else. There are still people, both in and outside of the industry, who simply don’t like videogames. Just as every other medium had this period of people treating it as just the lesser version of something else. Cartoons and anime for the longest time was viewed as “lesser” to TV and film: that you go do cartoon VA when your career is at rock bottom. It really wasn’t until the mid-2000s, maybe early 2010’s, that voice acting in cartoons and games was given the respect and admiration alongside hiring some famous actor to be in the latest&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>GTA&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">or the voice in an animated film.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At this point, the Game Industry makes more money than other “famous” mediums, and its way past the time that it should be treated with respect and stand on its own.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Gaming Variety"><span>Gaming Variety</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Videogames are not monolithic — a videogame that is about jumping on bunny rabbits to collect carrots while listening to K-Pop is just as legitimate as a game exploring grief after the passing of a loved one. There’s nothing wrong with only liking one particular style of game or genre, but when you feel that is the only one that’s “allowed” and anything else is “wrong”, then we have a problem. And for designers who suffer from tunnel vision as I’ve mentioned, you need to get out of your own head and understand that just because you think your game is amazing, or your fellow friends and designers do, doesn’t mean much if every consumer quits your game after 40 seconds of playing it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>If you would like to support what I do and let me do more daily streaming, be sure to check out my&nbsp;</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="http://patreon.com/gwbycer">Patreon</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-players-are-escaping-death-by-performing-aerial-salutes-and-hugs<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
According to the wikihow page <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Fall-Safely">“how to fall safely”</a>, the best thing way to minimise injury while falling is to stay loose, keep your arms and legs bent, and roll on impact. According to ragdoll-prone shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, however, it’s better to stand to attention in mid-air and perform a crisp salute. It’s long been known that the game’s emotes confer unexpected defensive advantages, with emergency hugs sometimes shielding you against artillery fire, but now, one redditor has proven via careful scientific experimentation that they also protect you against the force of gravity.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
The redditor in question is the heroic 21471824781, whose doings have been passed along by <a href="https://www.vg247.com/helldivers-2-players-dont-want-arrowhead-to-patch-out-lifesaving-salutes">VG247</a>. As the below clip demonstrates, saluting or, if you’re more of a lover than a patriot, hugging the air while falling will reduce the red-tinting on impact. Other redditors speculate that this is due to Helldivers 2’s unexpectedly in-depth simulation systems, with damage to your head counting for more than damage to other body parts. Spreading your arms or sticking out your elbow rather than ragdolling means that you’re less likely to strike the floor headfirst.</p>
<p>On this count, at least, Helldivers 2 is in broad agreement with Wikihow (which advises falling people to protect their heads, albeit not in a patriotic way). On the other hand, it could be that developers Arrowhead have applied a general damage nerf while emoting so that emoting under fire is slightly more practical. Whatever the answer, it's an enjoyable quirk for a game that has "diving" in the title.

There’s a rich tradition of people using emotes in videogames for tactical gain, though I can’t think of anything else quite like this. Personally, I use them as tools of misdirection in PvP shooters – attempting to confuse and charm an attacking player with a hearty Cheer emote only to callously gun them down the second they return the gesture. In Dark Souls 3, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sL99DrR5lhg">you can use the Curl Up emoji to dodge boss attacks</a> if you want to sabotage all sense of theatre and make poor Pontiff Sulyvahn look like an absolute prize fool.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/09/zenless-zone-zero-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/honkai-star-rail/">Honkai Star Rail</a> were both games that proved that free-to-play doesn’t mean lightweight and frivolous. While you can question the business model of their ‘gacha’ style setup, miHoYo’s differing gameplay styles across both games have hit home with players. Zenless Zone Zero is the latest title from the developer, and once again gameplay is the star of the show, though at times it doesn’t make enough of the standout parts of it.</p>
<p><iframe title="Zenless Zone Zero Official Release Teaser | The Person You Are Calling Is in a Hollow" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KGOynaQoofc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Zenless Zone Zero is set in the futuristic city of New Eridu. This world has been beset by Hollows – areas of frozen time that are polluted with Ether, a substance that’s capable of mutating people into terrifying monsters known as Ethereals – but which have also proven to hold substantial wealth, if you have the means to collect it.</p>


<p>You play as a Proxy, choosing between the siblings of Wise and Belle. Proxies can send their consciousness into the Hollows within a Bangboo – a strange combination of Rabbid, Pokémon and a robot – and from there direct teams of Hollow Raiders who can fight off the Ether monsters on their way to whatever target they’ve been set. It’s a suitably sci-fi/anime setting that draws in and builds successfully on ideas we might have seen or heard before, but Zenless Zone Zero does an incredible job of selling them via its stellar presentation.</p>


<p>Put simply, Zenless Zone Zero looks and sounds incredible. I might be a sucker for anime-styled games, but the art style and overarching design of New Eridu and its inhabitants is simply breathtaking. It looks like a comic that’s come to life, and at points, it actually is a comic, with cutscenes and dramatic moments told via pages of a graphic novel. Beyond that, interactions between characters are often fully voiced, and as you spend more and more time with them you’ll come to love them, especially the opening trio made up of the emotionless Anby, street-smart Nicole and the Deadpool-lite Billy. You unlock new team members via the different gacha machine-style mechanics, each with their own personality as well as unique weaponry and appearances, virtually guaranteeing that you’ll find a favourite amongst them.</p>
<p>Zenless Zone Zero is much smaller scale than Genshin Impact, and where that aped <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review/">Breath of the Wild</a> and its sprawling landscape, ZZZ is closer to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/26/neo-the-world-ends-with-you-review/">NEO: The World Ends With You</a>, with its central elements happening across a much more limited area. It’s more approachable to newcomers, and makes more obvious sense on mobile as well as console or PC, placing it firmly between miHoYo’s expansive Genshin Impact and the smaller-scale Honkai Star Rail.</p>

<p>While it might sit somewhere between the two gameplay-wise, it shares the same ‘gacha’ elements as both its forebears, meaning it’s built to try and make you spend actual money. You’ll likely know whether this business model works for you, but this is a game that is fundamentally fully playable without spending anything. You do, however, rely on RNG to gift you the most powerful versions of each character, and their equipment, so if you want to maximise your chances you have to spend some cash. I’ve spent 99p though, and the game is certainly worth more than that.</p>
<p>The thing that shines brightest of all here, and the element that’s worth a pretty penny, is Zenless Zone Zero’s combat. Entering a Hollow sees you choosing a team of three Hollow Raiders, and then fighting off an increasingly dangerous set of Ethereals. Hack-and-slash combat is built around standard and special attacks, but the game’s <em>coup de grace</em> is the ability to switch between all three members of your team on the fly. If you time it so you dodge an incoming attack you’ll perform a more powerful switch attack, and you can chain these together, creating a spectacular anime battle in real-time. It feels powerful and natural, and the visuals back it all up wonderfully. This is the consistent highlight of the game, and it does not wear thin.</p>

<p>What might wear thin is that you’re not always involved in that delicious combat. At the moment, the weakest elements of Zenless Zone Zero lie in its focus away from the exciting and vibrant battles, especially in the board game sections that seem to stand in your way for very little reason other than to have you do something before hopping back into the fray. These happen within the proxy’s HDD computer, with you exploring a route tile by tile, collecting information, different materials and currency while facing whatever foes you can’t avoid. The thing is, you won’t want to avoid these enemies, because that gets you back to the best bit.</p>
<p>Depending on the type of person you are, you can get heavily involved in the levelling up, unlocking and collecting of each character’s equipment. As a free-to-play title you’ll probably be familiar with the fact that literally everything has a notification next to it, and you can complete challenges at an impressive pace, gaining more and more material to pile into every possible slot. miHoYo are masters of this art, and I rarely found it getting in the way, especially when I was enjoying it as much as I was.</p>

<p>At launch, there are little quality-of-life things that we can hope miHoYo implement, like your characters having an auto-speech option during cutscenes, which would make everything feel just that little bit smoother, and improving or minimising the amount of loading or updating it does every single time you start the game. Still, as a free-to-play title, this is a generous and hugely enjoyable package that will hopefully grow into another success for the company.</p>

From <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/zenless-zone-zero">Zenless Zone Zero</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-first-descendant">The First Descendant</a>, we seem to be experiencing a free-to-play explosion. Despair, ye time-constrained adults, for your carefully engineered shortage of pocket money offers no bulwark against the onslaught of games that want a slice of your evening or weekend. Today's big release, Once Human, at least features a giant schoolbus on monster legs, together with a less exciting but customisable van that just has wheels. In this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> survival shooter, you are a "Meta-Human" making your way around a landscape corrupted by Stardust, which has warped the scenery and will slowly drive you nuts.

You'll get to chop down trees, build bases and craft/obtain weapons of colour-coded rarities. It's a familiar blend, but I'm intrigued by the touches of Control-esque and Ghostwire-adjacent monster and level design in the trailers. I'm going to try the game out this evening. I'm hoping it'll be a bit like The Division 2's Dark Zones but New Weird. On which note, developers Starry Studio have done <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2139460/view/4230650600757463064?l=english">a launch FAQ</a> in advance of the probably inevitable release day bugs.
</p>
<p>
Let me pack it down for you: at launch, you only get one character per account. Once Human is cross-platform, but not on Steam accounts, for the moment, "due to their inherent limitations"; the developers suggest using NetEase's Loading Bay launcher instead, which I don't have much experience with myself. The game also doesn't officially run on Steam Deck right now. More vexingly, it doesn't yet support controllers either. "Our development team is actively working on changes to bring controller support as soon as possible," the FAQ promises. "We expect to complete this by August."
</p>
<p>
Once Human will get seasonal updates with new scenarios offering different rules and environments, with players able to carry resources between seasons via their "personal domain" at Eternaland, which sounds like the name of a web3 Second Life rip-off but is seemingly just a customisable base. There will be separate PvE and PvP servers at launch, with a tiny quantity of PvE stuff exclusive to the PvE server. 
</p>
<p>
Now then, how about some system requirements! The below are apparently what you'll need to run Once Human at 1080p. 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<strong>Minimum</strong>:
</p>
<p>
OS: Windows 10 (64-bit)
</p>
<p>

<strong>For 60 fps performance</strong>:

</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
RAM: 16GB RAM
</p>
<p>
GPU: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 3060 or AMD Radeon RX 6650 XT
</p>
<p>
DirectX: Version 11
</p>
<p>
Available Storage Space: 70GB SSD
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Sound a bit demanding? The developers are aware. "Once Human offers a high-quality audiovisual experience," the FAQ explains. "This requires a large amount of storage space for HD images, textures, sound effects, and map files. Additionally, as an MMO survival game, we aim to render long viewing distances so that players can see structures in the world as far as possible. We are continuously working to optimize the game for the best possible experience."
</p>
<p>
On a similar note, Once Human doesn't yet support DLSS "due to the ongoing optimization and integration of certain features". It does support DirectX 12, but this might cause "a slight frame drop" compared to DirectX 11.
</p>
<p>
Starry Studio have also put together some elementary tips to improve performance - in particular, lowering the resolution, lowering texture quality and special effects, and lowering the rendering quality. The developers further note that if you do try to plug in a controller - including "pedals and gearbox controls for driving games, or joysticks for flying games" - there may be compatability errors that lead to crashes.</p>
<p>If you are reading this in a distant future of a few hours from now, after Once Human goes live, I hope the advice has helped. Past experience of free-to-play launches suggests that there will be many a gremlin to exorcise. And beyond that, who knows? Once Human was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-next-fext-2024s-most-popular-demos-include-goblin-maid-sims-horror-shooters-and-a-chinese-game-about-an-unmarried-no-lifer">the most popular demo during Steam Next Fest 2024</a>. Again, there's no shortage of competition right now in the loot-ridden realm of F2P, but perhaps it'll be another one of this year's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">breakout</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/manor-lords">hits</a>.

<p>MissMikkaa has done it again, beating Shadow of the Erdtree on the dance pad, and some players need help to pass the first boss using a standard controller. </p>



<p>Miss Mikka’s Shadow of the Erdtree journey lasted seven days, with 325 deaths (69 of them were thanks to all the falls). The last boss, Radahn, Consort of Miquella, was the biggest hurdle in her dance padding escapades, taking 52 tries and seven hours of dancing to take him down finally.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I DID IT! ALL bosses of my dance pad Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree run have been deFEETed!</p><p>The last boss fell after 52 tries and 7 hours of dance-padding (my feet hurt). DLC took me 7 days in total with 325 deaths; 69 of them to gravity, nice.</p><p>I hope Miyazaki is proud of me. <a href="https://t.co/DqbgLxTCXz">pic.twitter.com/DqbgLxTCXz</a></p></div>— MissMikkaa (@MissMikkaa) <a href="https://twitter.com/MissMikkaa/status/1810415598108581941?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>MissMikka isn’t unfamiliar with the Elden Ring scene and has done several dance pad challenges with FromSoftware’s open-world RPG. The most notable was the <a href="https://x.com/MissMikkaa/status/1611104473698701313" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ultimate Challenge Run</a>, where she played two Elden Ring games simultaneously, one with a controller and the other with a dance. She had to kill bosses on the same try for both games, which was the most difficult aspect of this challenge. However, Miss Mikka could best Malena 3 days and 199 tries later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players should know that Shadow of the Erdtree is no piece of cake. Players from all around have been complaining about difficulty, with the DLC feeling much more challenging than the base game. This makes beating the DLC with a dance pad much more astonishing and a testament to MissMikkaa’s perseverance. Now we wait for other players to finish their alt runs for Shadow of the Erdtree.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Ever since the hat was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tf2s-classless-udpate-hats-maps">invented by Valve Corporation in 2009</a>, mankind has grappled with questions of fairness, worthiness, and pride – at least as they pertain to microtransations in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free-to-play</a> games. Shooty battle royale  <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-best-guns-tier-list-weapon-stats">Apex Legends</a> is the latest to posit an answer, that being "the Battle Pass should cost more money".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/apex-legends/news/battle-pass-update">post</a> detailing BP-specific changes to expect in Apex’s upcoming Season 22, publishers EA announced that the Premium Battle Pass will, from Season 22 onward, only be sold for $10 in real-world cash – a major change from previous passes, that were buyable with in-game currency that could be earned through play. There’ll also be two separate Premium Battle Passes per season, taking the total cost per-season to $20. Cue outrage, the game’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/apexlegends/comments/1dyblr3/apex_legends_battle_pass_updates_season_22/">subreddit</a> filling in minutes with players announcing their immediate uninstall.</p>
<p>In fairness to the <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disgusted_of_Tunbridge_Wells">Disgusted of Tunbridge Wells</a> crowd, this change could represent a major price hike for regular players when Season 22 launches on August 6th. Previous Premium Battle Passes cost 950 Apex Coins, the aforementioned in-game currency, but by progressing through the pass’s tiers, you could eventually earn that amount back in rewards. Which could then be spent on the next season’s Battle Pass, and so on, potentially daisy-chaining BP purchases without ever needing to buy a fresh pile of Apex Coins with real money.</p>
<p>Now that the Premium Battle Pass is going cash-only, that self-funding cycling is broken, and what replaces it ain’t cheap. At $10 a pop, with two per season and usually four seasons in a year, that’s an annual cost of $80 – just four bucks shy of a standard Netflix sub. For skins and taunts. Yeesh.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, EA’s post argues that the new system will in fact "up the value" for players. While each individual Premium Battle Pass will only have 60 levels apiece, down from 110, when completed they’ll fork over more crafting materials and Apex Pack loot crates than previous passes did. And since there’ll be twice as many passes per season, one per 'split' (basically each half of the season), the total per-season haul of potential unlocks is effectively doubled. In the first two weeks of season 22, there’ll also be the one-off chance to unlock the first split’s Premium Battle Pass rewards for free, by completing "a set of challenges".</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/apex-legends-aerith-skin.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>EA/Respawn Entertainment</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That’s cool and all – more crafting materials is a good way to gain the specific unlockables you want, offsetting the randomness of Apex Packs – but even as someone whose interest in Apex Legends was only <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-season-20s-skill-trees-see-the-battle-royale-take-a-surprising-moba-turn">recently rekindled</a>, I wouldn’t pay ten quid for even twice as many cosmetics. Not when I’ve spent the past five years getting Battle Passes who what felt like nada.</p>
<p>Such reticence has, it must be said, likely been calculated by EA. Like January’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/apex-legends-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-crossover-arrives-on-january-9th">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth crossover</a> event, and its $360 deathbox skin, this whole thing smacks of an appeal to <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0306460321000368">whales</a> – dedicated big spenders who’ll pay up regardless. Meanwhile, more numerous but also more frugal players are considered acceptable losses. Which from a purely business-y standpoint, is a logical enough plan for F2P games that are already facing a dwindling playerbase.</p>
<p>From a player standpoint, though... hmmmmm. We can get as snooty as we want about the cosmetic-based concept of Battle Passes, but it’s a fact that they incentivise play, through the simple pleasures of seeing a level counter tick up as much as the desire for the cosmetics themselves. Erecting a higher paywall for them can and will remove this source of progression, and with it, the ability to feel like you’re getting wins even when you’re eating shit in the actual arena. That’s surely not good for Apex Legends’ health, even if it does prove good for its coffers.</p>

            <p>Video game hardware spending in the US was down 40 percent in May compared to 2023, numbers company Circana reports.</p>
<p>Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S sales all saw "double-digit percentage declines year-on-year" comparing figures up to May. Switch saw the most significant drop in spending, which Circana's boss and industry analyst Mat Piscatella said could be "partially attributed to the strength of the launch of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom in the May 2023 comparable period". The game was a smash hit for Nintendo, and launched alongside a themed Switch OLED model.</p>
<p>PlayStation 5 was the top selling console in units and dollar sales in May. The console's unit sales lead those of PlayStation 4 by eight percent.</p>

<p>The decline wasn't just for hardware sales. Spending on game "content" - games, in-game currency and items - also fell three percent compared to a year ago. Meanwhile, spending on gaming accessories also dropped eight percent compared to last year. PlayStation Portal was the best selling accessory in May. </p>
<p>Ghost of Tsushima was the best selling game in the US for May. Previously a PlayStation console exclusive, its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-ghost-of-tsushima-on-pc-is-another-excellent-nixxes-port">PC port launched</a>, and quickly became <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-tsushima-is-playstations-fourth-biggest-pc-launch-to-date">PlayStation's biggest single-player PC launch in terms of concurrent players</a>.</p>
<p>Fortnite has maintained its popularity, with the free-to-play game boasting the highest number of active users across PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in May. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/70-of-developers-concerned-about-sustainability-of-live-service-games-new-study-suggests">recent study highlighted the prevalence of free-to-play games and their sustainability</a>, with these new sales figures proving their continued popularity above new full releases.</p>
<p>"Projected US total spending on video game hardware, content and accessories fell six percent in May 2024 when compared to a year ago," Piscatella said.
</p>
<p>According to Piscatella, this comparative yearly decline can be attributed - at least in part - to last year's arrival of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, released on Nintendo Switch in May 2023. On its launch, Tears of the Kingdom sold over 10m units worldwide in just three days, making it the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-fasted-selling-game-in-series-over-10m-units-sold-worldwide-in-three-days">fastest selling Zelda release to date</a>.</p> <div>

<p>Nintendo, Sony and Microsoft are all set to launch new hardware in the not too distant future.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-reveals-three-new-xbox-console-variants">Microsoft revealed three new Xbox console variants</a> with increased storage capacity, which will be available at the end of the year in select markets. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-df-weekly-new-ps5-pro-gpu-details-emerge-including-a-235ghz-max-boost-clock">Sony is also reportedly planning to release a PS5 'Pro' console</a>, which will run games at 60fps with ray-tracing.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Nintendo has said it will announce the Switch's successor - dubbed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-makes-first-switch-2-announcement">later this financial year</a>, before March 31st 2025. It's expected to be actually <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-now-q1-2025-report">released at some point in 2025</a>.</p>
<p>Each platform has a number of bigger video game releases still to come this year, as well, with the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-finally-playable-in-the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom arriving on Switch</a> this September, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-announces-new-astrobot-game">Astro Bot coming to PS5 also in September</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indy-heads-to-the-himalayas-in-new-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-teaser">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle slated for a 2024 debut</a> on Xbox and PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-ball-kakarot-next-dlc-name-discovered-in-game%E2%80%99s-latest-update.922374/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dragon-ball-kakarot-next-dlc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The name of the next Dragon Ball Kakarot DLC has been discovered in the game files, revealing how it will be based on the next iteration of the franchise.</p>
<p>As reported by Josou Kitsune on<a href="https://x.com/Josou_Kit/status/1810164580615590381" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> X/Twitter</a>, the game's latest update, which introduced a new side quest, includes in its files references to its next DLC expansion. Unlike what most expected, the next expansion won't be based on Dragon Ball GT or Dragon Ball Super, but on Dragon Ball Daima, a new anime series, and Akira Toriyama's last work, which is set to release this Fall.</p>
<p>Dragon Ball Kakarot proved to be rather successful on the market, so much so that Bandai Namco decided to continue supporting the game well past its first round of DLC expansions. Even without additional content, the game is well worth the time of any fan of the series, despite some issues, as it is an accurate recreation of the Dragon Ball Z story, as we highlighted in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-ball-z-kakarot-authentic-ambitious-adequate/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot is a mixed bag. If you're a Dragon Ball fan, this game will offer so many nice moments and make you occasionally beam from ear to ear. But then during exploration and combat, things quickly become tedious. At full price, it's hard to recommend this game, but when it becomes affordable in a sale, it'll be hard for fans to resist.</em></p>
<p>Dragon Ball Kakarot is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

Hard mode on these Infiltration Operations offers an improved drop chance for certain loot, which means players are inclined to play them on hard rather than normal difficulty.

For example, the company has yet to address <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-enjoys-big-player-numbers-on-steam-despite-microtransaction-hell">The First Descendant’s ultra aggressive monetization</a>, nor has it explained <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-first-descendant-hit-with-destiny-icon-plagiarism-accusations-but-theres-seemingly-more-to-the-story">the remarkable similarities between icons used in The First Descendant and Bungie’s rival looter shooter, Destiny</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The First Descendant Screenshots </h3></div></output><p>Still, The First Descendant is pulling in players, with a peak Steam concurrent player count of 264,860 so far — enough to break into the top five most-played games on Valve’s platform.

            <p>
An impressive new mod for The Witcher 3 lets players customise their own character and even wield magic as a sorceress.
</p>
<p>
Modder nikich340 has been working on the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/5940">Custom Player Characters mod</a> for two-and-a-half years and it's now available on NexusMods (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/witcher-3-mod-lets-you-play-as-fully-customizable-witcher-or-sorceress-with-new-magic-combat-system">IGN</a>).

</p>
<p>
The mod allows players to create a custom character instead of protagonist Geralt, choosing between a Witcher, a Witcheress, and even a Sorceress with a new magic combat system and questline.
</p>

<p>

While it's not a full character creator in the traditional sense, the mod essentially takes body elements from all NPCs and allows players to mix and match to style their own character.
</p>
<p>
Players can then choose between three classes. The Witcher will play the same as Geralt, while the Witcheress is the same but with a female character. So yes, you could re-skin the character as Ciri for the entire game, or a more custom character.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps most interesting, though, is the Sorceress class, which not only includes a brand new magic combat system but a unique questline to unlock skills. Yes, that means you can finally play through The Witcher 3 as Yennefer (or Triss, if you really must).
</p>
<p>
Oh, and on top of blasting enemies with lightning, you can transform into a cat!
</p>
<p>
Animations have been tweaked for female characters, plus - through a separate mod - female voice lines can be added in.
</p>
<p>
In short, it's a very cool mod that will satisfy wish fulfilment for some players looking for a Geralt alternative. You can see it all in action in the video below.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/09/apex-legends-season-22-is-doubling-up-on-paid-battle-passes/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> Season 22 is bringing big changes to how battle passes and rewards are doled out to players, with developer Respawn Entertainment announcing that each season will now have two shorter battle passes in place of one, and that they’re removing the ability to use the premium in-game currency to buy them. As you’d expect, the community is in uproar over the effective price hike to premium battle passes for the free-to-play shooter.</p>
<p>From Season 22 in August, Apex Legends will now have two half-season battle passes, one of which will be available at the start of the season and the second then at the season’s “split” in the middle. Each will have 60 levels of rewards for a total of 120, which is an increase to the previous system’s 110 rewards, and will mean that there’s a reduced grind to reach the end-tier rewards and the most special skins.</p>


<p>However, this comes at a cost. There will still be a free battle pass reward track, but each half-season premium battle pass will cost $9.99 USD in real currency, effectively doubling the price where a premium battle pass previously cost 950 Apex Coins. Those were available as part of a 1000 coin bundle priced at $9.99 USD, or could be earned through playing and completing a previous battle pass, making it a reward for your continued engagement and keeping the servers stocked with players.</p>
<p>In addition to a standard premium pass, the new ‘Premium+’ tier will replace the existing ‘Premium Bundle’. This costs $19.99, has 10 level skips and double the Exotic Shards, as well as special Premium+ character skin variants and grants access to all characters through a battle pass’s duration. Over the course of a full season that works out to $40 compared to 2800 Apex Coins (coin bundles available in 2150 for $20 or 4350 for $40), though Respawn are saying that “The decision to move from AC to real-world currency is not one that we made lightly, but it does allow us to decrease the price of Premium+ for our community.”</p>
<p>Yes, a “decrease”.</p>

<p>One element that’s not clear is how long battle passes will be available for. Will the first pass of a season expire at the “split”, or be valid through to the end of a season? Each pass has roughly half the rewards, but there’s also potentially half the amount of time in which to complete them, which will mean there’s still that&nbsp;fear of missing out (FOMO) and grinding to reach the final tier rewards.</p>
<p>This has obviously gone down like a lead balloon with the fanbase, in large part for effectively doubling the cost, but it has also called into question how healthy Apex Legends is as a game, if EA is resorting to this kind of tactic. It’s equivalent to how Netflix, Disney+ or PS Plus have increased price over time, as their ability to draw in new subscribers has tapered off, as a way to boost quarterly revenues. EA will be gambling that having more battle passes will mean that devout players will spend more, making up for any players that are pushed away from spending or playing by this decision.</p>
<p>There’s another side to this, though, which is that having more shorter battle passes in general (free and paid) shortens the cadence of play and engagement that seasonal structures have. Instead of having that big refresh every 3 months, it’s now ever 1.5 months, which they will hope will help to even out the peaks and troughs that they might currently be seeing.</p>

            <p>
Chinese and Russian Pokémon Go players have reported a brief window of regular gameplay this week - despite long-standing geo-blocking that typically makes the game inaccessible across most of these regions. 
</p>
<p>
Reports collated on top Pokémon Go reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheSilphRoad/comments/1dxy6x6/pogo_in_mainland_china_so_pogo_got_ungeoblocked/">TheSilphRoad</a> show players able to send in-game postcards from Beijing's Tiananmen Square, site of the 1989 student protest and massacre now subject to strict censorship by the country's government. 
</p>
<p>
For years, Pokémon Go has been unplayable in large swathes of China - and various tourists have recorded their experiences trying to load the smartphone game when visiting. No Pokémon will appear to catch, and no locations will appear on the map.
</p>
<p>
This changed, briefly, on Sunday evening, as an apparent glitch brought the game back to life across the country. 
</p>
<p>
In Russia, where developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-will-suspend-gameplay-in-russia-belarus">Niantic suspended Pokémon Go gameplay in March 2022</a>, the same glitch saw gameplay return there too. 
</p>
<p>
Intriguingly, in-game locations remain in Niantic's database for both of these countries - although it seems unlikely either will return normally any time soon. 
</p>
<p>
"We stand with the global community in hoping for peace and a rapid resolution to the violence and suffering in Ukraine," developer Niantic wrote in a statement published via X in 2022.
</p>
<p>
"Niantic's games are no longer available for download in Russia and Belarus, and gameplay will also be suspended there shortly."
</p>
<p>
Niantic declined to comment on Sunday's brief window of gameplay when contacted by Eurogamer. 
</p>

Beyond that, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-looks-set-to-add-gen-8s-dynamax-mechanic">game looks set to finally go big on Pokémon's eighth generation of monsters</a>, including the likely arrival of Dynamax.</p>

            <p>The studio-killing fallout of Embracer's acquisition frenzy continues to fall like ash on the industry. The publishing giant has reportedly closed Piranha Bytes, the studio known for cult RPGs like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gothic">Gothic</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/risen">Risen</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elex">Elex</a>, according to a worker who spoke to Polish games site <a href="https://www.cdaction.pl/newsy/piranha-bytes-zamkniete-to-koniec-tworcow-gothica">CD-Action</a>. The studio's existence had been under threat since early this year, after being targeted in Embracer's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-group-to-close-studios-and-cancel-games-as-part-of-restructuring">purgatorial studio massacre</a>. At that time the German studio were hopeful to avoid being closed down, insisting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/piranha-bytes-devs-of-gothic-and-elex-are-next-on-embracers-chopping-block">"don't write us off yet!"</a> Unfortunately, it looks like those who worked at the studio have since been laid off.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The former head of Piranha Bytes, Björn Pankratz, confirmed the news on a Discord server for Pithead Studio, a newly established games company co-founded with his wife, Jenny Pankratz.</p>
<p>"As you sure noticed, the gaming industry was not doing well last year," says a message in the Discord,  as spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/embracer-has-reportedly-closed-elex-developer-piranha-bytes-as-former-creative-director-announces-a-new-indie-studio/">PC Gamer</a>. "This was also the case for the Embracer Group, to which THQ Nordic and Piranha Bytes belong. A lot of studios had to close, thousands of people in the gaming industry worldwide lost their jobs. Sadly, Piranha Bytes was also affected by this."</p>
<p>Images in the CD-Action report also show the <a href="https://www.cdaction.pl/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.cdaction.pl%2Fimages%2F2024%2F07%2F08%2F47e10678-9580-460e-8a37-46151afd5289.jpeg&amp;w=1920&amp;q=75">Piranha Bytes offices</a> in a state of relative abandonment, with unused desks, chairs and lamps piled up in a room. </p>
<p>The RPGs of Piranha Bytes were known for being somewhat janky but spirited. Gothic was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gothic-retrospective">more believable than modern RPGs</a>, according to Sin. The Risen games had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/risen-2-review">"heart and soul"</a> even if they were sometimes wobbly, said Alec once upon a time. And although Elex II was not Alice B's cup of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elex-ii-prevew-a-weird-science-fantasy-rpg-that-doesnt-care-about-you-at-all">sci-fi lizard battering</a>, she could still clearly see why people would gel with it. </p>
<p>As brands, Gothic, Risen and Elex still belong to publisher THQ Nordic (owned by Embracer), according to another message on the Pithead Studio Discord. But it's hard for even those who spent their lives working on these games to know whether the franchises will continue in any meaningful way in the future.</p>
<p>"All we know is that Alkimia Interactive from [Spain] is working on [a] Gothic Remake," say Pithead. "We are not included in the making of the remake in any form, and therefore have no influence on it."</p>
<p>The closures brought about by Embracer have greatly impacted the industry, putting a huge number of people out of work, and killing dead a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-embracers-cuts-killed-a-potential-red-faction-sequel-and-gutted-a-promising-studio">potential Red Faction sequel</a>. They say <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-say-their-restructure-is-over-but-its-too-early-to-start-acquiring-studios-again">their "restructuring programme" is over</a>.</p>

            <p>I gaze with alarm and approval upon the recent phenomenon of "dark <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a>" or "horror strategy" games, a devilish parade of top-down drag-clickers, from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-fabulous-fear-machine-out-today-is-a-strategy-game-of-engrossing-evil">The Fabulous Fear Machine</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/out-now-in-early-access-the-tribe-must-survive-is-frostpunk-for-people-who-love-being-afraid-of-the-dark">The Tribe Must Survive</a>, that strive to find the fear in a genre that typically places you at a managerial remove. The best-known is probably <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a>, with its perpetual raging against the dying of the light, its ceaseless scrape for coal and wood as the temperature falls. Anoxia Station, announced this month, is similarly driven by the gathering of fossil fuels, and similarly shaped by questions of worker death and morale, but it takes you deep underground - into a sumptuous, brutal world of quartz crystals, salt caves, magma lakes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moonmilk">moonmilk</a> rivers, swirling gases and, judging from the below trailer, enormous maggots and centipedes. Larva lakes, amirite.</p><!--more-->

<p>Anoxia Station is set in 1988, but not the 1988 you may remember. The Earth's surface has been devastated by a supervolcano and, in a shocking display of wildcard speculative world-building, humanity is now dependent on petroleum for survival. You take charge of a group of Terranauts, sent into the guts of a festering world in search of a fabled ocean of oil. You'll excavate a path to this mega-deposit, sector by sector. Along the way, you'll need to extract smaller pockets of oil for the benefit of the world above, expand your mining facilities and keep your (irreplaceable) crew alive, sane and at peace with each other. </p>
<p>This is easier said than done, because this is 1988, the height of the Cold War, and your miners hail from different sides of various Iron Curtains - there are people from the Soviet Union, the United States, the German Democratic Republic and Japan, among others. Some are enemies within who have hidden agendas, others just hate each other instinctively. You'll have to look after all of them, regardless. "Crewmen might become despicable, but if they fall, entire production lines might be extinguished, spelling hardship, if not death for the whole mission," explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2924310/Anoxia_Station/">the Steam page</a>. Sounds challenging! And that's before we start talking about those massive insectile lifeforms, which look like they've wriggled out of the catacombs of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/scorn">Scorn</a>. The Steam page trails off ominously here.</p>
<p>Anoxia Station has "a uniquely isometric style grounded in real physical processes", with audio design that consists of "a mix of the deafening roars of shifting rock, the harsh sounds of mining and welding, the distant clicking of something clearly inhuman, and a familiar scream". It's the work of Yakov Butuzoff, whose other works include visual novel Loretta, with Abylight Studios publishing. There's no release date yet.</p>

Twitch streamer MissMikkaa has completed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree with a dance mat controller.
</p>
<p>
Fans of the streamer won't be surprised by this news, after Mikkaa previously not only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-streamer-dancing-through-elden-ring-with-a-dance-pad">completed the base game on a customised dance mat</a>, but played <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitch-streamer-defeats-elden-rings-malenia-in-dance-pad-and-controller-simultaneous-challenge-run">two games simultaneously on dance mat and controller</a>.

</p>
<p>
Of course, the release of Shadow of the Erdtree means she's back at it. And, after a week of dancing, she's completed the DLC. There's a video of the feat below so <strong>spoiler warning</strong>.
</p>

"I did it! ALL bosses of my dance pad Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree run have been deFEETed!" she posted on X, formerly Twitter.
</p>
<p>
"The last boss fell after 52 tries and 7 hours of dance-padding (my feet hurt). DLC took me 7 days in total with 325 deaths; 69 of them to gravity, nice. I hope Miyazaki is proud of me."
</p>
<p>
A video alongside the post shows the streamer defeating the final boss, so <strong> final spoiler warning</strong>. "I'm so tired," she says at the end, collapsing to the ground. I'm not surprised.
</p>
<p>And when so many players are debating whether the DLC is too difficult, here's a streamer finishing perhaps the ultimate challenge. A true expert!</p> <div>

As we previously reported, the release of Shadow of the Erdtree has meant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/streamers-continue-to-play-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-in-weird-and-wonderful-ways">the return of streamers playing the game in weird ways</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fallout-unreal-engine-5-prototype/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A fan recently created a Fallout Unreal Engine 5 prototype, providing a glimpse at what possibilities the future holds for the popular series by Bethesda.</p>
<p>The prototype, which was made by Milwaukee Games, takes advantage of the latest version of the game engine by Epic to recreate the atmosphere the series is known for. The moment the Vault opens, in particular, looks great, as do the open wasteland and the recreation of the iconic Pip-Boy.</p>
<p><iframe title="I Made a Fallout Prototype in Unreal Engine 5 (Gameplay)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SQK1VjUL3l4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It has been a while since the release of Fallout 4, so this Fallout Unreal Engine 5 is definitely making us hunger for another proper new entry in the series even more. A statement from Xbox head Phil Spencer suggested the success of the Amazon Prime Video TV Show may have <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-5-release/">sped up plans for a new game</a>, but Todd Howard later confirmed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-fallout-games-wont-be-rushed-says-howard-bethesda-game-studios-had-25-million-players-last-month/">new entries in the series won't be rushed out</a> just to take advantage of the franchise's current popularity.</p>
<p>The latest entry in the series is Fallout 76, now available on PC and console. The game is currently available for a very low price as part of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1151340/Fallout_76/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam Summer Sale</a>, so there's no better time than now to join the many Vault Dwellers roaming post-nuclear America and experience the largest and most dynamic world created for the franchise.</p>

			<p>The launch of Parasol Stars: The Story of Bubble Bobble III on PlayStation means that for the first time in many, many years, all three Bubble Bobble games are available on one platform. Both <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP8908-CUSA46390_00-HAMPRDC000000001">Rainbow Islands</a> and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP8908-CUSA03943_00-HAMPRDC000000001">Bubble Bobble</a> were released as part of the Arcade Archives series, direct ports of the arcade games, but Parasol Stars has had a few extra tweaks thanks to developers ININ and this one is actually published by the original arcade machine manufacture, Taito.</p>

<p>The game – also confusing known as Rainbow Islands II even though there are no rainbows – features the same elements as the previous two instalments but with an added twist. The basic gameplay is still the same, with mostly single screen levels that have a bunch of enemies moving in fairly predictable paths, where one touch from any of them will cause you to lose a life. The twist here is that Bub and Bob (still in human form) have parasols which they can use&nbsp; in a number of ways.</p>


<p>Get close to an enemy and flourish you parasol and you can stun the creature, pick it up and throw at other enemies. You can also use the parasol to block incoming attacks, and collect bubbles that drop from the ceiling. Throw a single bubble and it will knock out an enemy, but collect five and it will turn into a super weapon – either a pool of fire, an electric bolt, or a torrent of water – which you can use to knock out multiple bad guys at once.</p>


<p>Like all the Bubble Bobble games the premise is quite simple, and unlike it’s predecessors, Parasol Stars is actually much easier and you can breeze through the first couple of levels without much thought. However, thinking is exactly what you need to do if you want to score the big points.&nbsp; Hitting multiple enemies at once brings showers of point giving fruit, and there many secrets hidden in the levels, just throwing a bubble in a certain direction may produce enough ice creams and eclairs to keep anyone happy. As the enemies always start in the same position and you have just a brief second before they start moving, the key is to work out the best path through the level, hitting as many enemies at once and uncovering all the delicious goodies.</p>
<p>At the end of each of the eight levels you will face a boss fight and the mechanics change. Now you can spawn bubbles by floating around, charge up a super burst and hit the boss. There are also two hidden bonus levels that can be unlocked… if you know how.</p>

<p>As mentioned this isn’t a direct port of the arcade game, and while the core game is exactly the same ININ have tweaked a few things. The control scheme has been modified for our modern controllers and I have to say it works like a dream, so much better than the controls from the previous games. The graphics, while still in the 16-bit pixel glory, are superbly crisp and colourful and make Rainbow Islands look rather washed out in comparison. The colours also help make the game look a lot less dated; it could be an indie game from 2024.</p>
<p>The game also has the usual modern features including a rewind button, load and saves, and filters. There’s also options for those who are colour blind and a hilarious if totally useless feature to change the screen size to the original GameBoy version, which results in the game running in a 3cm square in the middle of a 4K screen.</p>
<p>The jewel in the crown is the two player mode, as unlike the previous games you can work together, or be a dick. Do you help the second player, giving them a boost up on your brolly and working together to clear the screen, or do you hide on your side and throw enemies at your pal, stunning them so they can’t move and get smacked in the face by a sentient trombone?</p>

		
		

<p>So the big question, is as good as the the other two games? Well yes and no. It’s still a brilliant game but perhaps lacks the “one more go” factor of Rainbow Islands, but if you have two players then this is by far the best in the series.</p>
