<p>Let's play hide-and-seek!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're looking for a little bit of lightness this holiday season for you and the kids, then hopefully you've been saving up a bunch of those <strong>It's Me, Mario!</strong> shorts. Nintendo has been sharing these on its family-friendly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@playnintendo">Play Nintendo YouTube Channel</a> since August 2025.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkVH3EaHbL4">Episode 5</a> dropped overnight and features Mario with Yoshi and Toad, who are playing a simple game of hide-and-seek. Mario must find both of his friends, who have found devious places to keep themselves out of the plumber's eyesight.</p>
<p>And look, we're extremely partial to stop-motion animation, but Yoshi and Toad look particularly adorable; we love the little Super Mario World nod with the trees and the fruit, and Toad is... well, Toad! He can hide in some pretty easy places in the Mushroom Kingdom.</p>
<p>All five shorts have some lovely little callbacks to the Mario series as a whole, so while the kids might delight in the lovely colours and animations, parents (or grandparents, or uncles, aunts — whoever!) can get all nostalgic. You can see all five currently released episodes in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLngvvr1C2bLGRo0H8Lwl33utYqofaMDT3">this playlist</a>.</p>
<p>The It's Me, Mario! shorts are actually designed to promote the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/gallery-nintendo-updates-its-my-mario-product-line-with-multiple-new-yoshi-items-heres-a-look"><strong>My Mario</strong> range of toys for young children</a>, which were <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/gallery-nintendo-shows-off-its-new-my-mario-product-line">released in Japan back in August this year</a>. A selection of these are coming to the US in 2026.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-cold-snap-update-blueprint-drop-rate-2000654257</link>
            <guid>1386454</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Extraction shooter and recent Game Awards winner </span><i><span>Arc Raiders </span></i><span>just dropped a massive, winter-themed update. Cold Snap, as it’s called, adds a map condition that can cause frostbite, a timed event that lets players earn rewards (including Raider Tokens), a Candleberry Banquet project that also offers up some currency and cosmetics, and, apparently, way more generous </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-blueprint-locations-night-raid-map-2000650966"><span>blueprint drops</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>A </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1pom4pm/keep_the_blueprint_drop_rate/"><span>popular post on the official </span><i><span>Arc Raiders </span></i><span>subreddit</span></a><span> titled “Keep the blueprint drop rate” argues for developer Embark Studios to make the alleged changes to said drop rate permanent. “</span><span>Instead of sitting on gear and going with free loadouts, this incentivizes players to use loadouts with safe pockets and get some skin in the game,” the post reads. “What this game needs is to better incentivize bold play.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>In </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span>, you have the option to venture up to the dangerous surface with either a free loadout of random, low-tier loot that you won’t mind losing if you get jumped by another player or zapped by a Hornet, or a custom loadout that often includes a safe pocket, in which you can store one precious item in case you die aboveground or fail to extract. The benefit of the custom loadout is that you’re guaranteed to leave with </span><i><span>something</span></i><span>, so long as you put it in your safe pocket, but the downside is that you run the risk of losing an upgraded gun or a higher-quality shield.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Many </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span> players prefer to play conservatively, avoiding conflict with enemy squads at all costs. I can understand this, as I often run around the game with proximity chat on, yelling, “I’m doing a quest, please leave me alone!” But if there’s an elusive blueprint tucked away in my backpack, I can feel my trigger finger itching—this might mean that the next few weeks of </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span> gameplay are more ruthless than ever before…</span></p>

 <p><span>I played a bit yesterday after the Cold Snap update and got three blueprints over the course of a few matches, which is definitely more than I’ve seen before. In one match, I was in a pure panic trying to get to an elevator with a shiny new gun, several stacks of Candleberries (which are found outside in the cold), and </span><i><span>two</span></i><span> blueprints, all while frostbite steadily depleted my health and a damn Wasp flitted overhead. I made it out, knuckles whiter than the layer of snow covering my backpack.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>When asked if the blueprint drop was adjusted, a spokesperson for </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span> pointed me to two bullet points in the </span><a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/cold-snap-patch-notes"><span>most recent patch notes</span></a><span>:</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Increased some item and blueprint spawn rates in Stella Montis.</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Expanded blueprint spawn locations to improve availability in areas that were underrepresented.</span></li> </ul> <p><span>It’s not clear if this change is intended to be permanent, but of course Embark Studios may adjust the blueprint drop if it finds it’s become </span><i><span>too</span></i><span> easy to grab them. After all, avarice is a sin, and the greed on display by </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1po80ca/yeah_so_they_have_changed_the_blueprint_droprate/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>this player with 15 blueprints in their backpack </span></a><span>sickens me.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>For now, there are more blueprints out there. Go forth and be merry, Raiders. Please don’t shoot.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <guid>1386451</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span> hasn’t received a major update since 2021, and Nintendo previously showed no interest in continuing development on the five-year-old game. It was a huge surprise when Nintendo, in October, announced that </span><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </span></i><span>would get not only a Nintendo Switch 2 edition, but a 3.0 content update, too. On Oct. 30, Nintendo dropped </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-update-free-2000640118"><span>a 12-minute video breaking down the new details</span></a><span> and gave press an early, hands-off look earlier in December.</span></p> <p><span>Nintendo previewed the update in a 25-minute demo </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-30-first-impressions-of-the-switch-2-version"><span>covered by </span><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span>, which said the update is largely focused on design and decor and Nintendo Switch 2 quality-of-life improvements. Here’s what we know so far.</span></p> <h2><strong>When’s it coming out?</strong></h2> <p><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span>‘ 3.0 update and Nintendo Switch 2 edition will be released on Jan. 15, 2026. The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition costs $64.99 on its own, or $4.99 for people who already own the game on Nintendo Switch. All players will get the 3.0 update content for no additional cost.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654254" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654254"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654254">Image: Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <h2><strong>What’s new in the Switch 2 version?</strong></h2> <p><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span> on the Nintendo Switch 2 will benefit from the console’s mouse controls, which will make placing decor a bit less fiddly. And that makes sense, paired with a content update that’s largely centered on decor. Using the Joy-Con 2s as a mouse makes clicking and dragging stuff around the map much simpler.</span></p>

 <p><span>IGN said the </span><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span> Switch 2 edition also has an exclusive device—a megaphone. It’s used to call out to villagers and other visiting characters so they’re easier to find. To do so, you literally have to say a character’s name into the Switch 2 microphone, </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-updates-preview/"><span>according to </span><i><span>Polygon</span></i></a><span>. However, the megaphone can only be used for characters that are outside of buildings—ones that would actually “hear” you—so it isn’t as useful for anyone inside a structure, </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span> said.</span></p>

 <p><span>One initial draw is the upgraded multiplayer; up to 12 people can congregate on an island. But </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span> reported that this feature requires everyone to be on a Switch 2. Plus, the edition makes use of the new camera system to display a player’s face near their character.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654253" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654253"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654253">Image: Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <h2><strong>How about the 3.0 content update?</strong></h2> <p><span>The big addition in </span><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span>‘ 3.0 update is the Kapp’n family’s hotel—your </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> island is now a destination not only for your friends, but visiting </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> characters. Leilani, Kapp’n’s wife, runs the hotel and gives you the opportunity to decorate up to 10 rooms, per </span><i><span>Polygon</span></i><span>. </span><i><span>IGN </span></i><span>said it’s something to be unlocked, but it’s tied to the pier—not optional or moveable. It’s similar to the </span><i><span>Happy Home Paradise</span></i><span> DLC, IGN said, in which you’ll decorate rooms, just by theme and not to a specific character’s interests.</span></p>

 <h3><span>Designing hotel rooms</span></h3> <p><i><span>IGN </span></i><span>said that you’ll be able to design around themes—like, say, seaside—but don’t have to. You’ll be able to choose from different items, but aren’t required to use anything in particular, unlike in </span><i><span>Happy Home Paradise</span></i><span>. You’ll have your full catalog of items to use, as well as items related to the specific theme.</span></p>

 <h3><span>Hotel shopping and new items</span></h3> <p><span>You earn hotel tickets by designing rooms, and then use the tickets to earn more things from a hotel-specific shop manned by Gran. </span><i><span>Polygon</span></i><span> said that a number of new items were left out of the preview, but that it’s a “very large amount of furniture.” There are new Nintendo-themed items, too, like the Ultra Hand and different NES games playable on classic consoles purchasable from the hotel lobby shop. (These need a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to play.)</span></p> <p><span>Other new items include </span><i><span>Splatoon</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Lego</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda</span></i><span> stuff.</span></p> <h3><span>Crafting tweaks</span></h3> <p><span>One of the quality-of-life adjustments in the 3.0 content update is the ability to craft several items at once, using materials from storage instead of inside a player’s pockets, Nintendo announced during its October preview. Simply put, crafting could be a pain in the ass before; this should help, especially when you’ve got a lot to make.</span></p> <p><span>With so much new design and decor content, easing the pain of crafting a lot of stuff feels essential to the experience. Making things easier once again, there’s also a Resetti “reset” service to quickly clear a part of your island.</span></p> <h3><span>Slumber Island</span></h3> <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/845242/animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-update-switch-2-edition-features"><i><span>The Verge</span></i></a><span> described the Slumber Island feature, seen in the December preview, as “extra sandboxes” to decorate and play in. You’ll be able to set the time of day and weather to create whatever vibe you’re into—without messing about on your permanent island. </span><i><span>The Verge</span></i><span> said it looked like a “quicker and smoother” way to dream up a design and build it all out: Items from your in-game catalog appear immediately, and terraforming has a little quality-of-life improvement, it seems, to help make the process less painful. Plus, Lloyd can build bridges and inclines immediately, according to </span><i><span>The Verge</span></i><span>. No waiting around.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Physical Video Game and Hardware Sales In November In the US Were The Worst They’ve Been Since November 1995]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/physical-video-game-sales-hardware-sales-november-2025-lowest-in-the-us-since-november-1995/</link>
            <guid>1386439</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>December might be home to Christmas, Boxing Day, and the rush to buy presents for loved ones for a significant portion of the world, but November is no slouch, particularly because of Black Friday. This year, however, November was not a booming and bustling month for game sales in the US, at least for physical game sales and hardware sales, according to the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6t4juhvs2w">latest Circana report from executive director Mat Piscatella</a>.</p>



<p>In fact, physical game sales and hardware sales were the lowest they've been in the US since November 1995, as total spending across video games, hardware, and accessories came in at $5.9 billion, a 4% drop compared to November 2024.</p>



<p>Hardware spending specifically dropped to $695 million, a 27% drop compared to last year. November 2025 is now the second-lowest spending total for video game hardware in the US since November 2005, when the total spend on hardware was $455 million.</p>



<p>The number of hardware units was also down to 1.6 million for the month, with the only lower unit total coming from November 1995, when 1.4 million hardware units were sold. When it comes to specific consoles, sales for <strong>Xbox Series X/S consoles are down 70%</strong> compared to November 2024. <strong>PlayStation 5 console sales were down 40%</strong>, while Nintendo Switch console sales were down 10%, and that's even including the fact that the Switch 2 is now available.</p>



<p>Spending on accessories also fell to $327 million, a 13% drop compared to November 2024, with spending on controllers specifically dropping 19% compared to last year. Content, which encapsulates actual video game sales, DLC, etc., was the only area that actually went up compared to November 2024, with a 1% growth overall.</p>



<p>That said, physical game sales were down 14% compared to last year, another "<em>all-time low for a November month since tracking began in 1995</em>," Piscatella wrote.</p>







<p>So, what happened to make video game spending drop so much with regard to hardware, accessories, and physical video game sales? Well, according to Piscatella in a statement given to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-physical-software-and-hardware-sales-just-had-the-worst-november-in-the-us-since-1995">IGN</a>, it's the fact that the cost of everything, including video games, has skyrocketed in recent years, <a href="https://wccftech.com/okay-dont-panic-but-hdd-prices-are-rising-faster-than-they-have-in-years/">and with rising RAM prices</a>, things don't look good for the future.</p>



<p>"<em>Retail spending had been holding up relatively well until now, despite the pressure from higher prices we've been seeing in the market. More affluent consumers have kept on spending so far, which has made up for some of the declines in spending from the less affluent portions of the market. Perhaps this is a sign that those higher prices are beginning to impact purchases of pricier items, like consoles. Perhaps not.</em></p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>However, if the crunch on RAM pricing continues, if we see rising prices on consoles and gaming PCs over the coming months it could, theoretically, be potentially devastating to the dedicated gaming device market. Which would, of course, have potential carryover effects on the content side. I certainly see some of the relationships between hardware unit sales and pricing we're seeing in the November results as a red flag.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tariffs-rising-costs-us-consumers-spending-less-video-games/">Piscatella gave a presentation at Summer Game Fest</a>, where he outlined how the rising cost of essentials in the US would likely impact video game market sales, because consumers would simply have less money to spend on video games when they're worried about paying rent and buying food.</p>



<p>Now, as Piscatella points out, it's not just the rising price of essentials that people need to live on that is driving down video game spending, but the cost of the games and the hardware themselves. In November 2019, the average cost of a console was $239. Now, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-ps5-pro-price-increases-us-tomorrow/">as console prices have risen</a>, not dropped, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">since the new generation launched</a>, even for<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-us-price-changes-nintendo-switch-2/"> what is now officially previous-gen consoles</a>, the average price for a console in the US is $439.  </p>



<p>It's still too early to tell if this is a one-off bad month or if this is the beginning of a growing trend. We won't know how the December 2025 numbers look until January 2026. That said, these numbers aren't exactly inspiring, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-is-now-rumored-to-reduce-the-production-of-rtx-50-gpus/">as memory shortages continue to turn the entire tech industry upside down</a>, it doesn't look like prices will stabilize anytime soon. Unless everyone starts getting paid more, the majority of consumers will continue to be priced out of buying the latest tech, in video games or elsewhere.</p>



<p>Lastly, an update on the best-selling games of 2025 in the US, a figure that we've been tracking most of the year. <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-pokemon-legends-z-a-tops-us-sales-charts-october-2025/">For October 2025, it was Battlefield 6 that stood at the top</a> of both the monthly charts and the year-to-date charts. </p>



<p>While Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was the best-selling game in the US for November 2025, it doesn't even crack the top five for the year-to-date premium game sales charts, with Battlefield 6 still atop that list. Battlefield 6 was also the second-best-selling game for the month of November 2025, a clear sign that it has not slowed down its sales momentum in the US.</p>







<p>It's still early to call it, but perhaps Battlefield 6, not Call of Duty, will be the best-selling first-person shooter in the US at the end of 2025. We'll find out next year.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-wordle">What Is Wordle?</h2>



<p>Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

<p>The Direct will be a late one for UK and European folks, with the stream kicking off on <strong>23rd December 2025 at 1am GMT / 2am ET</strong> — that's <strong>22nd December at 5pm PT / 8pm ET</strong> for those in North America. It'll be available on both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SEGA_West">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/sega">Twitch</a>.</p>
<p>As for what to expect, well, it's a deep dive — that's basically all we know! "This Direct will dive into new features, experiences, and gameplay from the upcoming two-in-one title" Sega says. So expect a little bit of everything.</p>
<p>We wonder whether we'll get any hints as to what this enhanced version of the 2009 PS3 title means for the future of the series RGG Studio director Yokoyama Masayoshi <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/yakuza-kiwami-3-is-more-than-just-a-remake-and-it-contains-major-hints-for-series-future">teased this himself a few weeks ago</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6-tgRjOehk" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Dropout and Dimension 20 have released the trailer for their next TTRPG mini-series: <em>Dimension 20: Gladlands</em>.</a> This season welcomes back D20 series regulars to Dimension 20 while also inviting two new faces to the dome. <em>Dimension 20: Gladlands</em> will be led by Brennan Lee Mulligan as the GM over a shorter, six-episode, season.</p><p>The cast of <em>Dimension 20: Gladlands</em> will include:</p><ul><li>Ally Beardsley (they/them) as Quinn Wedbush (she/her)</li><li>Kimia Behpoornia (she/her) as Tess Tube5 (he/him)</li><li>Vic Michaelis (they/she) as Hugi (she/her)</li><li>Oscar Montoya (he/him) as Poppy Persona (she/her)</li><li>Zac Oyama (he/him) as Connor Kawasaki (he/him)</li><li>Jacob Wysocki (he/him) as Kokomo (he/him)</li></ul><p>While we don't get too much information about the system that's being used from a behind-the-scenes photo released it does look to be a homebrewed variant of Kids on Bikes. Each character has the following 'Virtues' that have an assigned dice.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The virtues are as follows:</p><ul><li>Charm (Rapport, Persuasion, Small Talk)</li><li>Warmth (Empathy, Connection, compassion)</li><li>Creativity (Wonder, innovation, artistry)</li><li>Awareness</li><li>Resilliance</li><li>Determination</li></ul><p>The mutations that each of the characters contribute to their specialization or mutation. Specializations are areas of expertise or heightened skill, while Mutations are 'functional apocalyptic mutations' that give a mechanical bonus such as additional damage, resistances, etc. A character is able to be more specialized by reducing the dice that they use for a particular skill.</p><p>Players can also be working on pet projects for the betterment of the community, that will also provide a mechanical benefit to the player.</p><picture>

  </picture><p><em>Dimension 20: Gladlands</em> is a mix of classic post-apocalyptic fiction like <em>Mad Max</em> and <em>Fallout,</em> where the party is made up of survivors of the wastelands. Some characters have quite human forms like the plague-doctor meets camp counsellor character of Michaelis, while others like Behpoornia's ant-headed human show that some level of radiation and mutation has also taken over the lands.</p><blockquote><p>In the before times, when water was plentiful and the high buildings towered over endless green adn growing gardens, they got so bored and angry that they blew up the world!</p></blockquote><p>The twist on the post-apocalypse comes from every character being incredibly nice and wholesome to one another. Instead of characters being out for themselves there's lots of talk of helping out one another and working together positively.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/d20-gladlands-dm-kimia-character.jpg?itok=fnsqIGvE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1919" height="1079">

  </picture><h2><em>Dimension 20: Gladlands</em> Hidden Mechanic</h2><p>As with many Dimension 20 seasons it seems that there's more going on mechanically behind the good nature of the characters. Each player is set up with a gauge at their seat, similar to a pressure gauge we see the numbers 0-3 in green, 3-6 in yellow, 6-8 in orange, before a break in the color, and 8-10 in red. At different points in the trailer we see these gauges going up and down too.</p><p>Brennan Lee Mulligan sits with a larger gauge in front of him. When Vic's character is introduced in the trailer they start by saying "We started at a 10 [...] let's just take it down a second" and the shot quickly moves to Mulligan looking to have adjusted his meter down from 10 to a 7 or 8.</p><p>Dimension 20: Gladlands will take place over the course of six-episodes beginning on January 7th. The day after each episode releases there will also be an in-dome Adventuring Party where the players will all discuss the events of the episode.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>We here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> have…complicated, multifaceted feelings on Mega Starmie. The Mega Evolved starfish started out being seen as one of the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-starmie-patrick-star-jokes-2000636057"><span>silliest new transformations</span></a><span> in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>, then turned out to be </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-starmie-jokes-memes-videos-art-2000638556"><span>one of the MVPs of the RPG</span></a><span>. Despite all the endearment I feel toward Mega Starmie and its weird long legs and arms now, seeing the thing in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>anime series has reawakened my innermost disgust reflex. I have many questions about this creature, but as far as the show goes, one comes to the forefront: Why does it look like Mega Starmie has been oiled up?</span></p> <p><span>The latest episode of </span><i><span>Pokémon Horizons</span></i><span>, titled “The Catcher in the Sky,” premiered in Japan last week, and in it, one the new series’ main characters, Friede, was revealed to have captured a Starmie that is capable of undergoing Mega Evolution. When the starfish is in this state, it stands as tall as its trainer and moves its arms and legs in a very uncomfortably human-like manner. Friede seems to be hamming up the human characteristics of Mega Starmie by calling it “Instructor Starmie,” though it’s unclear just what instructing it’s supposed to be doing.</span></p>

 <p><span>Anyway, the creature is shiny, as if Friede oiled it up before he reunited with the rest of the cast, and </span><i><span>Horizons</span></i><span> does a great job of exaggerating its animations to make it unnerving. Put it all together, and you’ve got a Pokémon that is just awful to look at. Way to go, team. You nailed it.</span></p>   <p><span>I haven’t been keeping current with </span><i><span>Horizons</span></i><span>, but I </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-horizons-anime-netflix-liko-roy-captain-pikachu-1851326504"><span>really enjoyed what I saw of the show when it made its English debut</span></a><span>. The series’ storylines have more of an arc compared to those in the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-anime-ash-ketchum-pikachu-final-episode-netflix-1850805389"><span>previous series</span></a><span> which was led by Ash Ketchum and kind of written for the series to have no real end goal and for episodes to stand alone. It seems like </span><i><span>Horizons </span></i><span>has been sticking with that storytelling approach as it enters its third season. The episodes that have been dubbed in English are streaming on Netflix.</span></p>

While you can't see the full details of the operator skins, the silhouettes clearly hint at operators for Lucy, The Ghoul, and Maximus in his power armor. Call of Duty's big IP collaborations also usually come packed with events for players to participate in. It's uncertain if the skins will be included in an event pass or as shop bundles for purchase.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty's paid event passes are usually 1,100 CoD Points ($10) and operator packs usually feature a price of 2,800 CoD Points ($25) for each bundle.</p><p dir="ltr">This collaboration is well-timed with the debut of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-episode-1-kicked-off-with-a-bang-literally/1100-6537031/" data-ref-id="1100-6537031">Fallout TV show's second season</a>, which began on December 16.

However, the statement didn't confirm the future plans for operator skins, and the authenticity of the game seems to only apply for the launch window of Black Ops 7.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 1's midseason update arrives sometime after the holidays.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Pendleton Ward, the creator of a little show you might’ve heard of called <em>Adventure Time</em>, worked on a new Adult Swim animated special called <a href="https://gizmodo.com/the-elephant-adult-swim-review-cartoon-network-2000698360?ref=aftermath.site"><em><u>The Elephant</u></em></a>. He didn’t make it alone—Ward teamed up with longtime friends and Cartoon Network alumni Rebecca Sugar (<em>Steven Universe</em>), Patrick McHale (<em>Over the Garden Wall</em>), and Ian Jones-Quartey (<em>OK K.O.! Let’s Be Heroes</em>). The show, which saw the Avengers’ line-up of cartoon legends craft something without knowing what each other would contribute, gave Ward the jitters over whether their collective, experimental tale would coalesce into something worthwhile. What frightens Ward the most, though, is his thoughts about AI and how it may leave the animation industry as we know it as a hollow, not-so-exquisite corpse.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tli7vrSE28Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="The Elephant | OFFICIAL TRAILER | adult swim"></iframe></figure><p>Over the course of his career, Ward has built a strong body of work as both a creator who shaped a formative part of an entire generation’s childhood and a champion of animation itself. Through <em>Adventure Time </em>alone, <a href="https://youtube.com/shorts/HdUKAvl4jGE?si=g5VrH57PzmuAq0dK&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>creatives like Sugar</u></a> got a rocket strapped to their back, launching them into their own career, all while carrying the flame of crafting bold shows of their own that spoke to adults and kids. The gravitational pull of <em>Adventure Time</em>’s elevated arthouse approach to animation—often serving as a cultural bridge, exposing Western audiences to international talent like former Science Saru creative <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LoT3h7c6tLY&amp;pp=ygUcbWFzYWFraSB5dWFzYSBhZHZlbnR1cmUgdGltZdIHCQk8CgGHKiGM7w%3D%3D&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Masaaki Yuasa</a>—embraced creative freedom without hesitation. Ward can easily be credited as one of the bricklayers of this era of highly creative animation, which <em>The Elephant</em> harkens back to. It’s an era that feels on the precipice of dwindling, piece by piece, under the guise of AI as the supposed end-all, be-all of artistic innovation.&nbsp;</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/queer-cartoons-elon-musk-libsoftiktok-dogs-in-space-netflix/"><div><p>The Rise And Fall of Queer Cartoons</p><p>Long before LibsofTikTok and Elon Musk called on parents to cancel Netflix, cartoons were already on the tail end of their queer renaissance.</p><p><span>Gareth Watkins</span></p></div></a></figure><p>After reviewing <em>The Elephant</em>, I walked away with the stark feeling that the special emphatically reached out from beyond my screen, cupped my face, and said, “fuck AI.” When I asked him if that was at all the intent, Ward reminded me that the collaboration was a bit of a misnomer, since he and his peeps couldn’t communicate about what they were contributing to the special’s three acts, not knowing how the whole thing would come together, but trusting that it would be fun.&nbsp;</p><p>“What you’re describing is the magic of this piece of art. That there is a meaning [that] emerged from our blind connection of pieces. But in the beginning, all I knew was that I could only get close to feelings of things and not anything too specific,” Ward told me. “‘Cause if you get too specific, you’re creating a wall that may not be passable.”</p><p>When I raised the elephant in the room—AI’s looming role in the industry—Ward characterized the magic of <em>The Elephant</em>’s existence as a very cool “last squirt of human creativity.”</p><p>“It’s gonna be weird. I think people are gonna like AI, though,” Ward told me. “It’s gonna be heinous in many, many ways, and it’s gonna destroy the industry—but I think people are gonna like it, ultimately.”</p><figure><figcaption><span>Adult Swim</span></figcaption></figure><p>Whenever Ward thought about the state of the art in the rise of AI, iron bars came to mind, he said. Ward clarified that&nbsp; it was less about prison and more about the lost appreciation of artistry in our day-to-day lives.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“People used to craft everything. Now, when we look at drywall or something, it means nothing to us. Walls used to be crafted. I think about shaping iron bars. Now, when you walk by those things, they mean nothing because they’ve been industrially manufactured along the factory line,” Ward said. “I feel like that’s going to happen to art at some point, where art’s gonna be this thing that you barely have any appreciation for because it’s all just been generated by machines that have no feelings.”</p><p>While there will still be artists, Ward fears it’ll become a niche hobby, with artists reduced to people who whittle wood, making small things that take hours to make.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’ll have value in that way, the way that all original works still have value. But it’ll just become a smaller and smaller group of people doing it for a living ‘cause you won’t be able to make money,” he said.&nbsp;</p><p>With major animation companies like Disney playing both sides—<a href="https://gizmodo.com/google-has-taken-down-ai-generated-content-following-disneys-cease-and-desist-2000698254?ref=aftermath.site"><u>pearl clutching over protections against AI</u></a> while <a href="https://gizmodo.com/disney-openai-sora-deal-slop-2000698409?ref=aftermath.site"><u>partnering with OpenAI for profit</u></a>—Ward and his motley crew of animators are living through a time when the integrity of their craft is under constant threat. Sure, there’ll always be an animation industry, like there’ll always be journalism. But if you want to break through and be a part of it, you’re gonna have to be okay with being poor and deal with <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-journalism-microsoft/"><u>AI debasing your craft</u></a> and calling it progress.&nbsp;</p><p>Ward sees an inkling of a silver lining in AI—at the very least—creating new jobs for humans willing to work there. But he can’t help noticing how broken a future is where artists push their creativity beyond its limits while still trying to sell commercial art, created in a way that is generic enough for people to relate to, only to have that blow up in their face.</p><p>“If we're just hired to push the boundaries of art so that AI can eat up all of our ideas and spit them out in different ways, those jobs will become like incredibly creative jobs, because we'll be needing to push the limits of all styles to feed the AI beast and give it more imagination,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Notice how the left lacks all the soul and whimsical charm that makes the right one so pleasing to look at </p><p>AI can copy movements but art comes from the human heart <a href="https://t.co/MlXmyFXKY7?ref=aftermath.site">https://t.co/MlXmyFXKY7</a></p></div>— ☝️💥 (@krystalmelodie) <a href="https://twitter.com/krystalmelodie/status/1999957712449437873?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">December 13, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>Despite <em>The Elephant</em> embodying the spirit of a work that’s preserving the soul of animation where human creativity served as the bedrock of its bold and frightening existence, Ward couldn’t help but stifle a laugh when I bluntly asked him if he thought we were cooked. His response, while dour, was brutally honest.&nbsp;</p><p>“Kudos to Adult Swim for making cool stuff and having cool choices like making <em>The Elephant</em>. But yeah, we’re cooked,” Ward said. “AI will be implemented at some point because it saves studios money. It just has to happen at some point, and it just keeps getting better. Time’s a changing.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Larian's admission that they are using generative AI in specific tasks (concept art, placeholder text, and PowerPoint presentations) while making the <a href="https://wccftech.com/divinity-is-a-turn-based-rpg-will-be-way-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-says-larian/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Divinity game</a> turned into <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-responds-backlash-over-genai-use-divinity-baldurs-gate-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a massive controversy</a>, between the backlash of many fans who swear they won't touch their games unless they backtrack and the studio's own rebuttal and clarification that no AI-made content will reach the final game and no human will lose their job because of it.</p>



<p>Now, the founder and creative director of a fellow RPG developer, Daniel Vávra of Warhorse (the makers of Kingdom Come: Deliverance), has <a href="https://x.com/DanielVavra/status/2001335767499669728" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared his own thoughts on the topic</a>. Vávra is not one to mince words (see <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-director-criticized-the-outer-worlds-2-obsidian-hasnt-innovated-since-fallout-new-vegas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his recent open criticism of Obsidian for The Outer Worlds 2</a>), and he went all-out in this case, stating that Larian has just voiced what literally every developer is doing and adding that AI is, at this point, a reality we can't really come back from, despite a hysteria that he likened to people 'smashing steam engines' back at the time of the industrial revolution.</p>



<p><em>This AI hysteria is the same as when people were smashing steam engines in the 19th century. Larian said they were doing something that absolutely everyone else is doing and got an insanely crazy sh*tstorm. I've even seen someone accuse us of using AI in KCD2. I don't know anything about it, except that I used Topaz Labs to upscale some of the AI elements from KCD1 and some of the old low-res textures.</em> <em>I'm no fan of AI generated art, but anyway, it's time to face reality. AI is here to stay with us. As frightening as it may be, that's the way it is.</em></p>



<p>Vávra then went on to say that he hates how long it takes, not to mention how many people and how much money are needed, to make videogames nowadays. </p>



<p><em>If AI can help me make an epic game in a year with a smaller team like in the old days, I'm all for it. That game will still have an art director, writers, programmers, graphic designers, but they won't have to do the tiresome and boring tasks, they'll have to focus on the essentials. I have ideas for lots of games, but I'm fifty years old and so far it's taken me seven years on average to make one game. If AI helps me realize those ideas faster, I'm all for it.</em></p>



<p>This is essentially what Larian and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ai-can-speed-up-game-development-human-intention-is-what-makes-our-stuff-special/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other developers</a> want to use it for. The gaming industry faces a significant challenge with rising budgets and increasingly long development timeframes, and the only viable solution is to smartly apply AI-powered tools where possible to reduce time spent on tedious, repetitive tasks. There is another potential course of action, of course: to greatly reduce either scope, quality, or both. For obvious reasons, none of the developers or publishers believe this would be a winning formula.</p>



<p>In his lengthy X post, the Game Director of Kingdom Come: Deliverance also mentioned other potential use cases of generative AI in gaming, such as RPGs allowing players to ask certain NPCs anything (like in <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-mod-adds-inworld-generative-ai-for-immersive-dialogues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that Skyrim mod powered by Inworld AI technology</a>) within the context of that game world. Moreover, he notes that soon AI will do the programming in games, with software architects overseeing that work, and 'resisting this is probably as meaningful as resisting the use of sewing machines in the textile industry.'</p>



<p>Vávra concludes noting that AI may well ultimately bring about the demise of humanity as foreseen in Terminator, but it could also mean that virtually 'anyone, at a fraction of the current cost, will be able to implement virtually any grand idea. Making a game will be as easy as writing a book.' Either way, he says, there's no stopping it.</p>



<p>Needless to say, this is the hottest topic not only in gaming but across most industries. Larian's reveal only served to bring it to the forefront of discussion, given their status as a revered developer after Baldur's Gate 3 (though a new attack on the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-writers-call-out-larian-studios-for-poor-hiring-practices-amidst-genai-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just came in from several writers who criticized their hiring practices</a>).

<p>It makes sense for Activision and Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 to capitalize on the Fallout Season 2 Amazon launch, and Black Ops 7 Season 1 Reloaded will see the two massive franchises collide.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-2-rotten-tomatoes-score-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout Season 2’s Rotten Tomatoes score is higher than Season 1</a>. The brand is hot stuff once again, and this comes hot off the heels of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-4-patch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Fallout updates</a>. So, why not bring Call of Duty and Fallout together to deliver an epic crossover in Black Ops 7 Season 1 Reloaded?</p>



<p> That’s precisely what’s happening.</p>







<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-season-1-reloaded-welcomes-fallout-to-its-lands">Black Ops 7 Season 1 Reloaded Welcomes Fallout To Its Lands</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Return. Image via Prime Video</figcaption></figure>



<p>The official Call of Duty X channel announced the Fallout crossover and gave everyone a clear timeframe on when to expect it—Season 1 Reloaded.</p>







<p>Black Ops 7 carries on where previous CoD titles have left off by offering new seasonal updates every few weeks. Slapped in the middle of this is a ‘Reloaded’ update, offering new maps, modes, and guns, and sometimes special crossovers and events.</p>



<p>We know that Fallout has eyed up a primetime spot during this period, per the social media message:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Okie dokie – stay focused, stay alive. @FalloutonPrime is coming to Call of Duty in Season 01 Reloaded.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There was a lot of talk before BLOPS 7 launched about the nature of unrealistic skins. It was revealed back in August that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-content-will-no-longer-carry-forward-into-black-ops-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 content would not carry forward into Black Ops 7</a>. But Activision has never ruled out crossovers with brands.</p>



<p>Certain <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-skin-collabs-were-cancelled-after-player-feedback/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 skin collabs were cancelled after player feedback</a>, but Treyarch senior director of production, Yale Miller, has previously stated that the game will have “Grounded” skins that “Make sense for Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>It’s not explicitly confirmed that the crossover includes Fallout skins, but it’s a logical assumption.</p>



<figure></figure>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/game-writers-call-out-larian-studios-for-poor-hiring-practices-amidst-genai-backlash/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>When Larian Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-announces-divinity-the-game-awards-2025/">announced Divinity</a> at <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-where-to-watch-all-nominations-what-to-expect/">The Game Awards 2025</a>, players couldn't be more excited for the studio that brought them Baldur's Gate 3 to return to the other fantasy RPG series under its belt, which is actually bigger than Baldur's Gate. Days later, Larian is embroiled in controversy after its chief executive officer, Swen Vincke, admitted that the studio uses generative AI technology in its development pipeline.</p>



<p>Vincke has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-responds-backlash-over-genai-use-divinity-baldurs-gate-3/">responded to the first wave of backlash that has hit him and the studio with criticism</a> for using GenAI, though the blunt nature of his response has done anything but quell the backlash he and the studio have received. Amidst all of this, game writers and narrative designers have popped up online to speak out against Larian, not just for its GenAI use, but for what they find to be poor hiring practices.</p>



<p>It's common across several industries that when applying for a job, besides submitting a resume and being the subject of potentially multiple rounds of interviews, you'll be asked to perform a test to show your prospective employer your work on something they've assigned you. If you're a writer applying to a writing position at a game studio, you should probably expect a writing test at some point in the interview process.</p>



<p>But writing tests as a practice are themselves a point of controversy, because writers are sometimes asked to do these tests for free. Usually, if you're being asked to do a writing test for a studio, it's because you're one of the few finalists for a potential role, so it's common for studios to pay those few writers for their time to submit the test. Yes, these people are applying for a job, but no one likes to work for free. Larian, however, according to writers like Zoë Quinn, a game writer who most recently was the lead writer on <a href="https://wccftech.com/alien-rogue-incursion-part-one-evolved-edition-launch-trailer-xbox-series-x-s-release/">Alien: Rogue Incursion</a>, does not offer to pay writers for writing tests.</p>







<p>Quinn spoke out about their experience being recruited by Larian, an avenue they ultimately turned down due to Larian Studios' disallowing remote work and asking for an unpaid writing test that Quinn would also have to make playable.</p>







<p>Bruno Dias, a game writer who has worked on titles like<a href="https://wccftech.com/pathologic-2-out-may-23rd-pc/"> Pathologic 2</a>, Neo Cab, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-mod-gets-new-rabbit-and-pork-dlc/">Fallout: London</a> chimed in to add "<em>Larian's horrible hiring process is an open secret int he industry - insane amounts of unpaid work in 'writing tests,' excessive numbers of interviews, months and months of back and forth, etc. Everyone in games narrative circles has heard the stories at this point, probably from multiple people</em>."</p>







<p>Julie Muncy, a writer on Interstate 35, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/julie.radiantarray.io/post/3ma4wbovt3s2p">added</a>, <em>"If you see narrative people being meaner about larian than it sounds like they deserve, trust me, we've been waiting for this one</em>," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/julie.radiantarray.io/post/3ma4xg5lazc2p">and</a> "<em>the thing about larian is that i think a lot of us were biting our tongues out of respect for the writers working there and the stuff they did make. but if larian doesn't respect those either, then, like, that incentive disappears</em>."</p>



<p>Cat Manning, a narrative designer at Firaxis, also through their voice to the fire, hinting at a "<em>throughline</em>" between Larian Studios use of generative AI and a misunderstanding of proper hiring practices when it comes to unpaid writing tests.</p>







<p>Other writers, like <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/babelfishwars.bsky.social/post/3ma4s6kx3z227">Olivia Wood</a>, spoke up to say that the reason game writers and narrative designers haven't spoken out about these poor practices before is to try not to burn bridges among the narrative and game writer community, since jobs for everyone are scarce.</p>



<p>Wherever you may land on Larian Studios using generative AI, it's clear that the studio's use of the technology and its response to the backlash have only emboldened the studio's critics to be louder. That's not to take anything away from their valid complaints, just a point to say that Larian is not necessarily the industry darling we might've once believed it to be.</p>



<p>That said, Daniel Vávra, founder and creative director of Warhorse Studios, the team behind Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, has, at least so far, <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-said-they-were-doing-something-absolutely-everyone-is-doing-ai-hysteria/">been the only major studio to come to Larian's defence regarding its use of GenAI</a>. </p>

If it’s been a while since you checked in with Verso, Maelle, and the rest of the expedition, maybe, I dunno, go practice your parrying before you head into the new content, because even the sickos who were already dodging the game’s most elaborate onslaughts are having trouble with these challenging fights.</span></p> <p><span>The “Thank You Update,” as Sandfall Interactive is calling it, includes an Endless Tower, which features revamped boss battles from the base game for an extra challenge. </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>’s late-game boss fights and secret battles were already daunting tasks, and now the game has added a plethora of new fights that are exhausting just to watch. Look at how long this combo goes on in the new Duollistes fight:</span></p>

   <p><span>Some of the update’s challenges come from a seemingly never-ending barrage of attacks, but a lot of its fights are pretty standard </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>fare in that they </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscure-parry-sakapetate-chromatic-troubadour-1851781507"><span>trick you with multiple fakeout attacks</span></a><span>, baiting you into dodging and parrying before an enemy actually strikes, throwing off your rhythm and leaving you open to attack.</span></p>

   <p><span>Oh, and one boss will just straight up nuke your team. Good luck parrying that one.</span></p>   <p><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span> fans are no strangers to challenging boss fights, but some feel that the Thank You Update’s boss run is too much. This account from </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1pnn1se/im_officially_done_with_this_update/"><span>Reddit user Maggot_6661</span></a><span> sums it up:</span></p>

 <p><span>“I love this game, truly,” they wrote. “This update is great, but these bosses are too much. Unless I spend a full 9 to 5 learning the reaction times only a robot can reach, I will never beat them. I already have to spend the day searching for a job and going disappointment after disappointment, I’m not mentally strong enough to suffer through these bosses afterwards, all it’s doing is making me not like the game… which is something I don’t want to happen.”</span></p> <p><span>Sometimes walking away from the biggest challenges a game has to offer is the right call. To this day, I’ve never played through some of the secret bosses in </span><i><span>Final Fantasy X</span></i><span>, and I have art from that game tattooed on my arm. I think I’d rather just enjoy the game I played than bang my head against a wall on some of its more challenging fights, so I won’t judge anyone who walks away from </span><i><span>Clair Obscur</span></i><span>’s Endless Tower. To those of you who do beat them, thank you for your service. “For those who come after.”</span></p>

                <p>For three decades, the Tekken series has brought players together as they control of some of the best fighters in the world. Now, a 92-year-old Japanese woman named Hisako Sakai has carved out her own legend in the King of the Iron Ring battles by winning a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tekken-8/" data-ref-id="5000-572026">Tekken 8</a> tournament.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/92-year-old-grandma-wins-tekken-8-tournament-trophy-in-japanese-senior-citizen-esports-league/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>, the tournament of senior citizen Tekken 8 players was put on by the Japanese eSports association Care. The mission statement of that organization is to "create an environment in which the elderly can casually participate in eSports." Care has been running tournaments since 2019 while treating them like a major event with livestreaming and official commentators. A video from the event can be seen below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cj0XFWPkA8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/5cj0XFWPkA8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Sakai made it all the way to the finals while playing as Claudio, when she went up against 74-year-old player Goro Sugiyama, who used Lili as his character. The match between Sakai and Sugiyama can be found two hours and 25 minutes into the video above. Despite the advantage of Sugiyama's relative youth, Sakai appears to have a superior button-mashing technique and enough mastery of the game to execute an effective path to victory.</p><p>Tekken development chief Katsuhiro Harada <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tekken-boss-katsuhiro-harada-is-leaving-bandai-namco-after-30-years-of-iron-fist-tournaments/1100-6536752/" data-ref-id="1100-6536752">recently announced his departure</a> from Bandai Namco after three decades with the company. Harada is not retiring from the video game industry, and his farewell message indicated that he has taken into consideration the "time I have left as a creator."</p><p>Earlier this year, Harada expressed his desire to bring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tekken-director-is-trying-to-bring-the-game-to-waffle-house-but-to-no-avail/1100-6531496/" data-ref-id="1100-6531496">the Waffle House chain of restaurants into Tekken</a>. There have been several viral videos of fights in Waffle House restaurants that have given the chain a reputation that it probably wants to shy away from. That may be why Waffle House turned down Harada's request.</p>

<p>Oh look, zombies. And in full colou...ah, they're eating me!</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Back in the middle of 1999 (a weird time for everyone, rest assured), British developer HotGen attempted something that was considered to be somewhat of an impossible task. Namely, porting the full glory of 32-bit <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/resident_evil">Resident Evil</a> to the dinky little 8-bit Game Boy Color. In the end, not only did these maestros manage to do it, but they did it in a way that, judging by the gameplay vid above, makes for a more than decent stab at the "impossible".</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the port was then cancelled and thought lost to time before popping up online in various states throughout the years - though none of these were anywhere near playable from start to finish. That is until now, thanks to <a href="https://x.com/fgasking">Games That Weren't</a> (thanks to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-98-complete-version-of-the-cancelled-game-boy-color-resident-evil-port-has-been-shared-online/?utm_source=onesignal&amp;utm_medium=push">VGC</a> for the heads-up).</p>
<p>Indeed, over on their official social media, the video game preservationists have made a very exciting post revealing a 98% complete version that seems to be fully playable and completable. Hooray!</p>

<p>The above post links to <a href="https://www.gamesthatwerent.com/2025/12/resident-evil/">an excellent article about the entire affair</a> surrounding the game's almost-completion and subsequent cancellation, so do make sure to give it a full read.</p>
<p>One little nugget of note in said article comes from assistant programmer Pete Frith, who recalls that the team were told their game would be cancelled because the creator of Resident Evil (they haven't disclosed exactly who they mean here) "didn’t feel the GBC was worthy of his creation, and that he had personally instructed the cancellation." That's gotta hurt!</p>
<p>Instead of this port, M4's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/resident_evil_gaiden">Resident Evil Gaiden</a>, a completely new game, was greenlit instead.</p>
<p>Frith is also noted as the source of this latest build, and he seems confident, with some added content now in there, that it <em>should</em> be fully completable.</p>


<hr>
<p><em>Who amongst us is brave enough to find out if this latest version of the cancelled Game Boy Color port is fully completable? You sir? Madam? Let us know in the comments!</em></p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/17/turn-off-the-engine-and-retire-the-car-turn-10-signals-end-of-forza-motorsport-support/</link>
            <guid>1386289</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Turn 10 has announced the end of active support for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/04/forza-motorsport-review-xbox-series-x/">Forza Motorsport</a>, two years after the game’s release, with no more plans to introduce new cars, tracks, features, or make regular bug fixes.</p>
<p>The game will go into a more basic support mode, so online servers will remain active, there will be special events and competitions in game, but the live service content beyond that will see Featured Tours and reward cars being recycled month-to-month. We’d expect them to tackle any critical issues with patches as well.</p>


<p>The team writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>As our team shifts its focus toward delivering the best possible experience with Forza Horizon 6 in 2026, we do not plan to introduce new cars, tracks, features, or regular bug fixes for Forza Motorsport. However, we will continue supporting the game by keeping online servers active, hosting special events and competitions, and reintroducing previously released Featured Tours and reward cars on a monthly basis, until all content is available for you to enjoy anytime.</p>
<p>We hope you continue racing with us on Forza Motorsport in 2026 – see you at the track!</p></blockquote>
<p>This announcement was somewhat inevitable after Microsoft chose to gut the studio earlier this year, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/02/perfect-dark-everwild-cancelled-by-xbox-the-initiative-shutdown-rare-turn-10-affected/">laying off roughly half the team</a> during a wave of layoffs across the gaming business and company as a whole. This was a result of a fairly underwhelming release for the latest Forza Motorsport, which had been years in the making and sought to bring the series up to the level of Gran Turismo and others as a longer-term racing game platform. Following the game’s release in 2023, they<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/09/heres-how-forza-motorsport-car-progression-is-changing-in-march/"> overhauled car progression</a>, added <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/13/forza-motorsport-update-adds-road-atlanta-circuit-and-multi-class-racing/">major new track and multi-class racing</a> and more, but it wasn’t enough to keep the studio secure.</p>

<p>It means that all that remains of what was a staple of the simcade racing genre will be the more arcade open world action of Forza Horizon, which is heading to Japan with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/25/forza-horizon-6-is-heading-to-japan-in-2026/">Forza Horizon 6</a> next year.</p>

            <p>We factory sim perverts have all known the joy of combing a mile of conveyor belt tagliatelle for that one empty hopper or unplugged furnace that’s stalled the entire production line. Now, imagine that the stalled production line is producing plasma swords for your army of murder droids.</p>
<p>You need your army of murder droids to fight another army of murder droids, but unfortunately, all of your murder droids are now swordless, and therefore murder droids no longer. They advance placidly into the firestorm, falling like mown dandelions, while you run your cursor desperately over the hexagonal smokestacks. There it is! A misfiring 3D printer, right in the centre. </p><!--more-->
<p>This is a hypothetical scenario, based on fervent perusal of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3396160/Warfactory/">Warfactory Steam page</a>. As you’ve hopefully guessed, it’s a mix of “lite” 4X, factory sim and real-time strategy game. You play an ancient AI, possibly a cousin of Destiny’s Warmind, who wakes up after humanity’s extinction and decides to conquer the galaxy, planet by planet.</p>

<p>“Your factory assembles every robot warrior part by part,” explain developers Terricon Games. “Hulls, weapons, and propulsion systems are fully interchangeable. Link different production hubs to create new unit types in seconds. </p>
<p>“Retool your factory on the fly,” it continues. “Need mobility on broken terrain? Swap legs for treads. Facing armor? Switch to armor-piercing loadouts. Your production line becomes your strategy.”</p>
<p>Please can I make just the one robot huge enough to sit on all the others, Terricon? It shouldn’t matter too much if there are some modules missing. I will dedicate entire planets to the fabrication of Dat Ass. Its name shall be Godzillass - a name that can only ever be whispered in dread or screamed in terror, as the enormous, sexy shadow descends.</p><p>Going by the trailer, those planetary maps consist of regions with their own fog of war, which seems like it’ll make the early game less frenetic and more incremental-feeling than it clearly could be. The visuals blend “sci-fi with Japanese and East Asian aesthetics”, and the Steam page is accordingly sprinkled with steely industrial haiku.</p>
<p>There’s a choice of hand-crafted story and open-ended roguelite modes featuring an upgradeable mothership. Multiplayer features should follow after launch in 2026. If that’s too long to wait, the developers are also hosting a playtest - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3396160/view/543376693580006978?l=english">find out how to sign up here</a>.</p>
<p>This is far from the only factory sim in which you have to maintain a military alongside your production lines – <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dyson-sphere-program">Dyson Sphere Program</a> players will be perfectly at home, I’m sure – but I like the emphasis here on a single bottleneck breeding catastrophe. It’s also quite a grim project in context. Terricon are a new Ukrainian team, as are publishers Palaye, and naturally, I’m wondering how much the full mobilisation ethic of Warfactory reflects life in the country right now, as the Russian invasion continues.</p>

"Fallout 5 will be existing in a world where the stories and events of the show happened or are happening. We are taking that into account."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Fallout TV show, which is set after all the existing Fallout video games, has sparked much debate within the fandom. Questions on how it fits into the overarching Fallout timeline and whether it makes particular video game endings canon have dominated discussion in the run up to each season’s release. Indeed, Fallout Season 2 had left fans wondering about the fate of New Vegas following the events of the video game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-2-takes-the-fog-of-war-approach-to-avoid-making-any-new-vegas-ending-canon-creators-say">although the show’s creators have avoided making a clear call</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What Howard is confirming here is that TV show characters such as Lucy, Maximus, and The Ghoul and the events of the show must now be factored into Fallout 5, although we don’t know when or where the game will be set. Could either actually appear in Fallout 5? It sounds like it’s possible, but we’ll have to see what happens in the show itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth remembering that we’re guaranteed Fallout Season 3, and the hope is there will be more seasons after that. There’s a long way to go before the show wraps up, and there’s a long way to go before Fallout 5 comes out. In the meantime, could Bethesda follow The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered and release a remaster of Fallout 3 or New Vegas, or perhaps even a Fallout: New Vegas 2 as a stop gap? In a recent interview with IGN, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-chief-todd-howard-says-fallout-is-the-franchise-that-were-doing-the-most-in-right-now-coy-on-potential-return-to-new-vegas-or-a-fallout-3-remaster-while-fans-wait-for-fallout-5">Howard remained coy on the possibility</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fallout Season 2, Episode 1 Video Game Details - Characters and Factions</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on the Fallout TV show.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Superheroes, ronin, insect warriors, and postal service workers. Whatever your fantasy this year, PlayStation could deliver it. But which PS5 game was the best? We at IGN have voted and picked out what we think are the five most worthy of recognition from across 2025, naming one of them the very best PlayStation game of the year, as well as shouting out a few honourable mentions that were very close to making the cut.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an era where console exclusives are a dying breed, as Sony’s competitor, Microsoft, has shown us more than ever over the past few months, we’ve made the decision this year to branch out and open up the criteria for what can win our platform-specific awards. These aren’t the top five Sony exclusives, but the top five games that were released on PS5 in 2025, full stop. So, without further ado, let’s get on with it and crown the best PlayStation game of 2025 before we all die of old age.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PlayStation Game of 2025</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Honorable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the best games from early in the year was Hazelight’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>, the endlessly inventive co-op action platformer that just narrowly missed out on a top-five spot. Also just missing out are a pair of 2025’s breakout indie hits, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/blue-prince">Blue Prince</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ball-x-pit">Ball X Pit</a>. These two couldn’t be more different from each other, though, with the former brain-bending mansion full of puzzles a much calmer affair than the brick-breaking chaos of the latter. And then there’s two big shooters that came along at the end of the year. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>’s multiplayer has seen it return to the glorious, huge-scale carnage that fans wanted, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> has proven a massive success thanks to its “just one more extraction” nature. Rounding out on honourable mentions are a pair of games that like to do things a bit differently when it comes to narrative: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/atomfall">Atomfall</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>. Both create uneasy worlds in their own ways, and we admire them for their freeform and steadily revealing approaches to storytelling, respectively.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/best-playstation-hollow-knight-silksong-1765293248214.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It finally happened. 2025 was the year that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> saw the light of day, and what a relief that we not only got to play it, but it was also extremely good. Team Cherry’s much-anticipated sequel may be a whole lot more punishing than the original, but it is still home to that same magic, which can be found all over its sprawling, bug-sized world full of secret nooks and crannies. The platforming pathways to get to those places are tight and challenging, with new lead, Hornet, showing off a fresh batch of skills stemming from her fundamentally game-changing diagonal dart. But it’s in combat where she really comes into her own, promoting a more aggressive style of play which lets you take the fight to Silksong’s bestiary of bosses. These tough creatures of all shapes and sizes with nasty tricks up their sleeves may have presented some of 2025’s biggest roadblocks, but persevere, and the glory waiting behind them leads to one of this year’s greatest games.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Dispatch</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/best-playstation-dispatch-1765293264231.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Superhero drama <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dispatch">Dispatch</a> manages to recapture the magic of those Telltale-esque episodic visual novels that we all fell in love with a decade or so ago. Following the story of Robert Robertson, a hero who is nothing without his now-destroyed mech suit, it's a heartwarming tale of redemption that isn’t without its fair share of bite, too. Managing your many relationships, both personal and professional, as they intertangle at Robbie’s place of work, the Superhero Dispatch Network, is key, as is making sure your team of down-and-out supervillains successfully try their hand at crime-stopping. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This half of the game adds a real-time sim management wrinkle to each chapter, as you boost the skills of your squad and send them out on missions that match their skillset. From the hot-head Flambae, to the internet’s new favourite demon Mommy, Malevola, you’re in command of a vibrant and varied bunch that each offer a fun dynamic to each and every scene they’re in. But it's outside of the SDN office monitor that Dispatch really comes to life, as Robertson’s life crumbles around him, and your best attempts at rebuilding it are hidden behind dialogue choices. What comes of its cast of characters, headlined by Breaking Bad’s Aaron Paul as Robbie, and with Laura Bailey’s Invisagal stealing most scenes, is up to you. One thing that is guaranteed, though, is a great time.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/best-playstation-death-stranding-2-1765293281611.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In many ways, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> finally fulfilled the promise of its flawed predecessor. Creator Hideo Kojima’s second slice of post-apocalypse delivery adventures dialled up the action, echoing his past Metal Gear Solid successes, whilst still maintaining that singular, lonely vision of a disconnected world. Taking Sam Porter Bridges to Australia, On the Beach hands you a much expanded range of combat options, from silenced sniper rifles to homing missile mechanical dogs, and permits you to go about completing its many, many postal orders however you’d like. This freedom is not just a combat feature, but is reflected in how you go about navigating each of these treacherous delivery routes, too, with new ways to travel over stormy deserts and raging rivers, including huge, looming monorail systems and bonkers coffin hoverboards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the weirdness is just one aspect of Death Stranding — and there’s no shortage of it this time around, thanks to Troy Baker’s excellent return as villain Higgs — as its themes of love and loss ultimately dominate, no matter how large the spectacle on screen. Lea Seydoux is subtly brilliant as Fragile, and drives the story from start to finish as the connections between herself, Sam, and baby Lou are steadily revealed. It’s a fantastic example of a vision come to life, and easily one of the best PlayStation games to have come out in 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Ghost of Yotei</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/best-playstation-ghost-of-yotei-1765293296489.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Following up on 2020’s Ghost of Tsushima was always going to be a challenge, but developer Sucker Punch rose to it impressively well with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a>. This sword-slashing epic borrows everything that we loved from its predecessor, but improves on almost all of it in a multitude of fun little ways. The pulsating combat opens up further, with new weapons and skills introduced to deepen its familiar dodge, block, parry, and swing system. Among those additions is the highly satisfying disarming mechanic that has your protagonist, Atsu, send her enemies' blades flying from their grasp. But it's this wandering ronin’s story that drives Yotei’s momentum, turning a simple tale of revenge into something much more beautiful as you explore each corner of its historical Japanese map and soak in both the audio and visual majesty on show</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winner - Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/09/best-playstation-clair-obscur-expedition-33-1765293315016.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Surprise! <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> has won another award. It really is that good, though, isn’t it? Sandfall Interactive’s ode to Final Fantasy of years gone by takes that age-old formula and thrusts it firmly into 2025 with lashings of style, soaring music, and a battle system that melds classic turn-based RPG mechanics with exciting real-time elements, making each and every encounter a thrill. All of that style would be nothing without substance, though, and while its combat excites from moment to moment, it’s Clair Obscur’s poignant story and layered cast of characters that make it live long in the memory. Jennifer English is pitch-perfect as Maelle at the heart of Expedition 33’s plot, with Ben Starr’s Verso a wonderful foil as its twisted themes of grief and what it is to love are untangled. All played out in front of a ticking backdrop of the Gommage — a yearly tolling doomsday clock for anyone of a certain age — it’s wonderfully cinematic, making it fit right in alongside many of Sony’s first-party blockbuster offerings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking inspiration from the original PlayStation’s library of Japanese RPGs and bringing those ideas into the future, thanks to an all-timer video game story supported by a combat system as satisfying as it is nuanced, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is the clear winner of our award for Best PlayStation Game of 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What was your favourite PS5 game of 2025?
