			<p>Star Wars Outlaws launched last week, but it has already received criticism from casual and die-hard fans. The scores from critics are incredibly varied, with some giving it high praise while others provided plenty of reasons to dislike it. Currently, the Metacritic score stands at 76 for Star Wars Outlaws. Star Wars Outlaws Director <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/star-wars-outlaws-director-is-a-little-disappointed-with-the-metacritic-score-but-plans-to-keep-improving-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Julian Gerighty spoke with GamesRadar</a>, and shared his thoughts and feelings on how the audience has received the game. "I'm a little disappointed with the Metacritic. Of course, recognition from press and critics is very important to us, but players are really connecting with what we did."</p>
<p>However, it seems that the vast majority of the criticism the game has received is warranted. Those who purchased the early access version of the game had to start their file from the very beginning or had their fair share of game-breaking bugs. Although the Star Wars Outlaws Director admitted that he wasn't too impressed by the score it received, he is still hopeful for the overall presence of the game, saying: "This will be a game that millions of people are going to play for years and years, and we're never going to stop improving it."</p>
<p>Although Star Wars Outlaws scored 76, that isn't necessarily bad news. It's still considered a good score. It's clear that Gerighty had high hopes for this game and expected a higher score overall from the critics. However, that isn't the only issue for Ubisoft, the game's publisher. After the launch of Star Wars Outlaws, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/game-developer-ubisoft-slides-amid-muted-reception-star-wars-outlaws-2024-09-03/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft shared</a> that they have hit a 10-year low. This doesn't spell good things for Ubisoft, as this game has the biggest marketing campaign in the company's history. Although Star Wars Outlaws has a vast amount of responsibility in this, they also were behind Skull and Bones and XDefiant, which didn't last very long for the players.</p>
<p>While the full base game of Star Wars Outlaws has been officially released, the Season Pass is still yet to come. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-post-launch-roadmap-revealed-including-season-pass/">Season Pass</a> provides new cosmetics and alternative storylines for players to complete, even if it means caving in and purchasing a microtransaction to access them. Whether they will continue adding more to the Season Pass after the initial releases are done remains to be seen and will most likely depend on whether the game picks up in sales.</p>
<p>Although the game has had its fair share of hardships, Gerighty says that there's a "level of pride, happiness, and sense of accomplishment amongst the team. Outlaws was in development for roughly four years and the team literally reached for the stars."</p>

I can’t speak to the possible features of a new platform, but the Nintendo Account is a strong basis for having that communication as we make the transition.”<br></p><p>Anticipation for a Switch 2 reveal has been heating up ever since Nintendo CEO Shuntaro Furukawa <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1787736518762881197&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/NintendoCoLtd/status/1787736518762881197" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote back in May</a></span> that a Switch successor <em>wouldn’t</em> be mentioned during the company’s June Nintendo Direct. Naturally, fans took this to mean that a mention <em>would</em> be coming sometime later in the year. Time is starting to run out, but knowing the <em>Mario</em> maker, the first news of a Switch 2 could be shadow-dropped any day now in something as simple as a single press release or a trailer suddenly shared to social media. </p><p>And as manufacturing of the devices gets underway, the pressure will be on for Nintendo to reveal the console itself before grainy cellphone footage from a Chinese warehouse that looks like it’s from 2007 reveals it instead. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Balatro, one of the biggest hits of the year, is heading to a new platform. Developer LocalThunk <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1831695226886300045" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has announced that</a> Balatro Mobile is launching on September 26th.</p>



<p>The game will be available via Google Play, the App Store, and Apple Arcade. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The reveal of Balatro Mobile is the third of three recent announcements from LocalThunk. In addition to the new platform, Balatro received a free <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-collaberations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Friends of Jimbo” update</a> last month. It was also announced that a major free gameplay update with “new ideas and strategies” will come to the game in 2025.</p>



<p>More details on that update will be revealed at a later date. Pre-orders for Balatro Mobile are now open.</p>

<p>Maximum Football, the free-to-play football game from Maximum Entertainment, is launching in Early Access <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1691280/Maximum_Football/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">starting November 7</a>. The game will first be available in Early Access on PC with its Xbox and PlayStation release planned for Spring 2025.</p>



<p>In addition to the release date announcement, Maximum Entertainment put out a new trailer for the game.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>When it does launch in Early Access, Maximum Football will have a number of modes for players to enjoy right from the bat. Modes such as Exhibition (vs. CPU, multiplayer, and spectator), Practice Mode, and even Dynasty Mode (college football rules) will be available. Also available will be the Maximum Pro League and the full player customization system.  </p>



<p>Post-release, the plan is to add Franchise Mode (professional football) and a Career Mode to the game. The developers also say that “much more” is planned in the months and years after the game’s release. </p>



<p>As mentioned, Maximum Football will be a free-to-play title. While the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/maximum-football-loot-boxes-in-its-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t have loot boxes</a> within the game, no updates on  how it plans to monetize the title have been made public just yet.</p>

			<p>The latest list of games to be added to GeForce NOW has been updated, and many top games have been added. To play games via GeForce NOW, you need to own them on the specified client listed by NVIDIA. GeForce NOW is compatible with multiple clients, such as Steam, Battle.net, and Epic Games Store. This month, GeForce NOW users can expect to see games such as Final Fantasy XVI, Age of Mythology, and Epic Mickey: Rebrushed as some of the titles coming to GeForce NOW.</p>
<p>This month, 19 new titles are added to GeForce NOW, with a dozen of them being day-and-date titles, meaning you can stream them via GeForce NOW as soon as the game is officially released. As well as those games that will be available this month, those who are eager to play the Open Beta for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be able to play it via GeForce NOW as long as you are a member. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-beta-will-be-playable-on-geforce-now-via-cloud/">Open Beta</a> will be available between September 6 through September 9, and as long as you are a member, you can jump into the beta instantly through Steam or Battle.net.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/astro-bot-dlc-post-launch</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/astro-bot-dlc-post-launch-will-include-challenge-levels-and-speedrun-stages.972876/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/astro-bot-dlc-post-launch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you've been hoping for some&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>DLC that you can check out after you've finished the main game, then it sounds like you're in luck, as extra stages are planned for the game after launch.</p>
<p>That's according to a <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/astro-bot-dlc-will-include-challenge-and-speedrun-levels/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new report from VGC</a>; the site's journalists apparently visited developer Team Asobi's offices last month, and while there, they were told that&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>would be getting some extra content in the weeks and months following its release.</p>
<p>According to the VGC report, Team Asobi is currently planning to add around ten challenge levels and five speedrun-focused levels to the game after its launch. VGC does, however, say that it's not sure "if those numbers are still accurate".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/astro-bot-dlc-post-launch-enemy.jpg?itok=ZpTUpQAZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/astro-bot-dlc-post-launch-enemy.jpg?itok=sMYjrrHZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll have more&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>to enjoy post-launch.</figcaption></figure><p>If Team Asobi does decide to bring more content to&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>post-launch, then it seems to me that'll be a very wise decision.</p>
<p><em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>is set to launch tomorrow as a PlayStation 5 exclusive (although Team Asobi does say it's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-director-leaves-door-open-for-pc-version-shuts-down-playstation-vr2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">interested in hearing from players</a> regarding a PC version), and the reviews are already in.</p>
<p>Of course, the only review you really need to read is the one <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/astro-bot-review-90s-platformer-done-right">written by our very own Andrew Stretch</a>, who describes it as "a 90s platformer done perfectly" and praises its gameplay mechanics, difficulty, and celebration of PlayStation's history.</p>
<p>Lest you think he's an outlier, though, think again; the game's currently <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/17118/astro-bot" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sitting at a coveted 95% rating on OpenCritic</a>, with 100% of critics giving it a positive score overall. Looks like this one's going to be a hit.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what exactly&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>is, it's a 3D platformer that acts as a sort of pseudo-followup to the PS5 pack-in game&nbsp;<em>Astro's Playroom&nbsp;</em>(which remains one of the highlights of the console's software lineup even now).</p>
<p>Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em>celebrates PlayStation by including a wealth of cameos from Sony IPs both old and new. Obviously, it's too early to extrapolate a narrative, but the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds">failure of&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds">Concord</a>&nbsp;</em>and the success of this game feel like they should be sending a message to Sony.</p>
<p>You can pre-order&nbsp;<em>Astro Bot&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/astro-bot/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here via the PlayStation Store</a>.</p>

The platformer pays tribute to PlayStation’s past with cute little robot cameos representing nearly every video game hero from every era remotely associated with the brand. It was more or less a guided tour through the legacy of one of the big three, and after the PS4 solidified Sony as top dog in the console landscape, I was certainly in the mood to look back at how we got here when the PS5 launched in 2020. Now we have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280"><em>Astro Bot</em></a></span>, the excellent follow-up that builds upon all the tight platforming, adorable robo aesthetics, and PlayStation nostalgia of that pack-in game. But it’s been four years since the PS5 launched with <em>Astro’s Playroom</em> installed and the new game also inadvertently spotlights the fact that, despite four trips around the sun, the system has remarkably little to show for it.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,193348" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>As of this writing, I’ve seen <em>Astro Bot</em>’s credits roll and collected 250 of its 300 hidden robots, which are tucked into every corner of its levels. Most of these are generic white and blue bots not meant to resemble any hero PlayStation fans have embodied or foe that they’ve faced. Some, however, are based on classic PlayStation characters, from OGs like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/crash-bandicoot-5-spyro-crossover-cancelled-activision-1851632213&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/crash-bandicoot-5-spyro-crossover-cancelled-activision-1851632213">Crash Bandicoot</a></span> to more recent additions like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/horizon-forbidden-west-the-kotaku-review-1848524470&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-forbidden-west-the-kotaku-review-1848524470">Aloy from <em>Horizon</em></a></span>. There’s a pretty exciting range of characters to be found on Astro Bot’s adventures. I was grinning ear to ear when I found the Sly Cooper bot locked up in a cell for his kleptomaniac crimes. I was stoked to see some characters like Aigis and Joker from the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-remake-review-ps5-steam-pc-xbox-1851201927&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/persona-3-reload-remake-review-ps5-steam-pc-xbox-1851201927"><em>Persona</em> series</a></span> after they’d been omitted from <em>Astro’s Playroom</em>. But after finding a couple hundred, I realized something was off. By my count, I’ve only encountered one that originates from a PlayStation 5 exclusive in those 250: Rivet from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-the-kotaku-review-1847047303&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-the-kotaku-review-1847047303"><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em></a></span>. But I look at a list of Sony’s output this generation, and ask myself what else would they pick from? What has Sony released for the PS5 that has had any cultural impact that stands alongside characters like Kratos or Nathan Drake? Is it really that surprising that <em>Astro Bot </em>has a dearth of works to draw from?</p><figure id="" data-id="5ccf25eda6332d5b833b82a10356eae7" data-recommend-id="image://5ccf25eda6332d5b833b82a10356eae7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Astro presses a button while Kratos, Aloy, Nate, and others stand next to him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Astro presses a button while Kratos, Aloy, Nate, and others stand next to him." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->PlayStation / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5ccf25eda6332d5b833b82a10356eae7" data-recommend-id="image://5ccf25eda6332d5b833b82a10356eae7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Astro presses a button while Kratos, Aloy, Nate, and others stand next to him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There may be more I have yet to uncover, but the fact that the PlayStation 5 has almost nothing to showcase in <em>Astro Bot</em> becomes more stark as the game goes on. <em>Astro Bot</em> has a series of levels in which its titular hero dons the garb and weapons of different characters from throughout PlayStation’s life. Each of these levels spotlights a character from a different console era (though the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-valhalla-dlc-review-1851097244&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-valhalla-dlc-review-1851097244"><em>God of War</em></a></span> one is a little iffy considering it spotlights the modern, Norse-inspired era that began on PS4 instead of the original Greece-based PS2 games), and there’s is no such level for a PS5 character. There are points when each console era and its respective heroes get their time in the spotlight with a dedicated sequence for each generation. The PS5 is conspicuously skipped over, however, as if there wasn’t enough material to merit it.<br></p><p>Throughout <em>Astro Bot</em>, you’re rescuing marooned PlayStation characters as you all attempt to repair your PS5-shaped ship that’s crash-landed on a remote planet. As I look back at Sony’s latest console generation, there’s something morbidly poetic about watching Astro Bot run around trying to repair and salvage a console that has taken a serious beating. It’s not a PlayStation-exclusive problem, as Microsoft is taking its own beatings across the aisle, but this console generation has been a black hole for PlayStation.</p><p>Four years in, the PlayStation 5 has been characterized by remasters and remakes banking on old ideas from better days, the upheaval of decades of legacy through <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-layoffs-london-studio-closure-1851289547">studio shutdowns and job losses</a></span>, the disappearance of beloved series that don’t fit a specific prestige framework Sony’s leaning into these days, and a live-service focus that has panned out exactly once. Just days before <em>Astro Bot</em>’s launch, Sony and Firewalk Studios announced plans to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/concord-shutdown-playstation-offline-delisted-store-1851638956&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutdown-playstation-offline-delisted-store-1851638956">shut down <em>Concord</em></a></span>, one of the biggest pillars of Sony’s focus on forever games, two weeks after it came to stores. <em>Astro Bot</em> is a celebration, but what are we celebrating? Our collective endurance?

So there may certainly be the big, generation-defining games on the way. But <em>Astro Bot</em> reflects so poorly on everything Sony’s done since we last played as its robot hero. It is perhaps the most joyful thing to come out of Sony since the last <em>Astro Bot</em>, but so much of that joy comes from looking back rather than existing in the now because all we have now is a wasteland. I’m scared about what that says for the future.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Hooded Horse, the publisher behind </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Manor Lords</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, has been loudly advocating for better contracts. Earlier this year, co-founder and CEO Tim Bender said publishers should </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hooded-horse-co-founder-says-publishers-should-ditch-horrible-recoup-clauses-to-help-devs">ditch "horrible" recoup clauses</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to help devs and suggested companies like Hooded Horse should be </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hooded-horse-ceo-forget-success-judge-publishers-on-how-they-respond-to-adversity">judged on their failures–not the big hits</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you can navigate the pitching slalom to eventually secure a publishing deal that's right for you, what comes next? Hooded Horse chief product officer Ashkan Namousi says developers should treat publishers like an open book. As advice goes, it might sound like a no-brainer, but Namousi says developers often fail to make the most of deals because they're perhaps too sheepish.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The one thing I always would like developers to do is to just ask," he says, speaking to Game Developer at Gamescom 2024. "I think, especially in a new relationship, there's a bit of coyness maybe. A bit of uncertainty and insecurity. That exists in any new relationship, but as a publisher we really think of ourselves as at your service.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We have developers coming to us and asking completely random questions like 'hey, I've run into this antivirus program issue and I don't know how to handle it.' We can spend five hours researching how to tackle those issues. We have a network we can talk to. A lot of indie developers don't have that network of specialists and partners, so we can open new doors for them."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Namousi says nothing hurts more than watching developers suffer in silence-whether because of practical hurdles or contractual difficulties–purely because they were afraid to reach out and ask for help.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We have all these capabilities we can offer. I would love to see more braveness. Asking [questions]. Being vulnerable," he continues. So, what should developers be asking? He feels some of the biggest quandaries facing indies include deciding when to staff up, how to expand (should they hire freelancers or full-timers?), and how to manage projects that are ballooning.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Namousi feels publishers can offer "qualitative, situational advice in relation to their growth and how they should attack those issues." He agrees that deciding how, when, and indeed whether or not to scale is perhaps one of the biggest existential questions facing developers in the current climate, so there's no harm in sourcing another opinion.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There's always this balance of 'should I [scale] before launch? Before I have secured my income. Before I have secured my income or know the sales trajectory of the game.' On the one hand, that's putting the cart before the horse," Namousi continues. He says that plan could work provided success follows, but if it doesn't? Well, you're going to be in a bind.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That's why I think we can have these conversations–and also to tackle the financial aspects. 'Can [my publisher] help me get money? Can they provide the money for that or not? These are all very situational, complex conversations we should be having."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can hear more from Namousi and other industry experts in the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/patch-notes-2-how-does-the-game-industry-survive-beyond-2025-">latest edition of Patch Notes</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, where we asked how developers can survive beyond 2025 in a fraught market.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> has released a new trailer for the second season of Arcane. Season two of the acclaimed animated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> spin-off is set to release later this year, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-now-describes-arcane-season-two-as-the-final-chapter">will conclude the series</a> (something that is deeply disappointing).</p>
<p>That said, if this trailer is anything to go by, it sure seems like the show is going out with a bang. With explosions, dialogue such as "I want to tear that laugh from her throat forever" and a backing track that is sure to leave you feeling pumped up for the afternoon ahead, this trailer has nicely whetted appetites for the upcoming season. It focuses on Jinx, Vi and Caitlyn's rivalry, although there is a distinct lack of Jayce and Viktor. We also get a proper glimpse of Singed and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-season-two-teaser-reveals-a-big-new-character-and-sets-fan-tongues-wagging">a bit more of Warwick</a>.</p>
<p>"Watch it all burn," Netflix says in the description. Oh, I am sure we will. You can check out the trailer below.</p>

<p>Arcane's second season has been in the works for several years now, with the show first making its Netflix debut back in 2021. The first season told the story of sisters Jinx and Vi, each caught on different sides of a conflict between the rich city of Piltover and the oppressed underground city of Zaun.</p>
<p>Our Chris called the series "a thrill, full of welcome colour and life" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arcane-act-1-review-riots-glossy-animated-netflix-series-opens-with-a-striking-if-familiar-bang">Eurogamer's Arcane season one review</a> (which was based on the first four episodes), although he still had a few reservations. Following its debut, Arcane subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/acclaimed-league-of-legends-animated-show-arcane-wins-an-emmy-for-outstanding-animated-program">won the Emmy for Outstanding Animated Program</a>.</p>
<p>Arcane's second season is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-confirms-arcane-season-two-will-launch-in-november-2024">set to air this November</a>. Other animated video game-related shows also coming to the streaming service in the future include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tomb-raider-netflix-show-will-help-lara-deal-with-her-grief-so-she-can-finally-start-working-on-other-sht">Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-next-animated-witcher-movie-will-star-doug-cockle-as-geralt">The Witcher: Sirens of the Deep</a> and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/minecraft-animated-series-announced-for-netflix">Minecraft series</a>.</p></div>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/god-save-birmingham-preview-a-fun-twist-on-the-zombie-genre.972825/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/god-save-birmingham-preview-fun-twist-on-zombie-genre<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I've been over zombies for quite a while, after consuming far too many season of <em>The Walking Dead</em> for my own good. Still, I'm always open for new ideas featuring zombies, and <em>God Save Birmingham</em> looks like it might just be the thing to reinvigorate my interest in the genre.</p>
<p>We got some hands-on time with Ocean Drive Studios' <em>God Saves Birmingham </em>at PAX West 2024. I was told it's been in development for just five months, but there's a solid foundation for something big with the ideas at play here.</p>

<h2>Medieval Zombies in <em>God Save Birmingham</em>!?</h2>
<p>It's medieval Birmingham, and the year is roughly 1340. You wake up and find your town is full of zombies. You don't have modern firearms or any technology to speak of, just whatever existed in 1340. How is one to survive? Well, you can start by grabbing that pitchfork on the wall, snag some food, and hope for the best.</p>
<p>I'm sure there's media out there that have explored the idea, but medieval zombies feels fresh, especially with such a focus on historical accuracy. Ironic, I know, since zombies aren't historically accurate, but one developer at Ocean Drive Studios explained to me the vision of this title, and I can't help but get excited.</p>
<p>The town of Birmingham is being faithfully recreated to how it would look hundreds of years ago. The developers are looking at actual buildings from that time period and putting them into <em>God Save Birmingham</em>. Here's another super intriguing idea: There's only as many zombies as there were people in 1340 Birmingham.</p>

<p>Records of the town's population vary, but Ocean Drive plans to add around 1900 to 2000 zombies and that's all there is. Though, not all zombies are the same, as some will be clad in armor, for example.</p>
<p>My demo was considered pre-Alpha, showing the progress and concepts at play. The town of Birmingham is coming along and certainly looks like how one would imagine a medieval village. <em>God Save Birmingham</em>'s demo included tons of items to pick up, as this is a survival title. Eggs, bread, cheese, meat, various weapons and the like will come in handy.</p>
<p>You'll contend with meters for hunger, exhaustion, and thirst -- it's not my favorite thing to have in a game, but for hardcore survival enthusiasts, I'm sure this will hit the spot. I'm most interested in how Ocean Drive will expand the combat, since what I saw led to some hilarious (and horrifying) moments.</p>

<p><em>God Save Birmingham</em> has this "de-limbing" system, as I'll call it. Aim your pitchfork at a zombies arms, and it'll fall off. Do that to any other limb and you're met with a similar result. I ended up creating this horrifying legless, armless zombie and it still tried to crawl and bite me!</p>
<p>There's a physics system that's also pretty goofy, so when you get swarmed by zombies, your body is contorting in weird ways to get out of their grip. <em>God Save Birmingham </em>is still early on in development, but if these details are improved upon, it's going to be a blast to play.</p>
<p>I'm looking forward to <em>God Save Birmingham</em>'s development, but it's a long way off. Nonetheless, I was told armor can prevent zombies from biting you, you'll be able to use swords, shields, and other medieval weapons. There's even a story with multiple endings. Sounds like some good ol' fashioned zombie-slaying fun, if you ask me.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/state-of-decay-2-updates-to-end-later-this-year.972822/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/state-of-decay-2-updates-ending<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Undead Labs has announced that the next major&nbsp;<em>State of Decay 2&nbsp;</em>update will be the game's last as the studio pivots towards working on&nbsp;<em>State of Decay 3</em>, but don't worry -&nbsp;<em>State of Decay 2&nbsp;</em>isn't going anywhere.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.stateofdecay.com/an-end-to-content-updates-for-state-of-decay-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">news post on the game's official website</a>, Undead Labs says that&nbsp;<em>State of Decay 2</em>'s Update 38 will be its "final update", and that it'll "fix some longstanding issues", bring extra quality-of-life improvements, and "permanently unlock seasonal or otherwise previously-gated content".</p>
<p>Additionally, although updates and content drops for&nbsp;<em>State of Decay 2&nbsp;</em>are coming to an end, that doesn't mean the game itself is shutting down. Undead Labs says that whether you own the game or you're playing on Game Pass,&nbsp;<em>State of Decay 2&nbsp;</em>will "continue to be available".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/state-of-decay-2-updates-ending-car.jpg?itok=h7vmoyV6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/state-of-decay-2-updates-ending-car.jpg?itok=3BnS9YUc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>State of Decay 2&nbsp;</em>is driving off into the sunset, so to speak.</figcaption></figure><p>With that said, Undead Labs does say it "won't be creating new content or supporting"&nbsp;<em>State of Decay 2&nbsp;</em>after Update 38, so if something does go wrong, it might not get fixed.</p>
<p>Bounties from the Bounty Broker will continue to cycle, and all of your saved games and communities won't be affected. However, if you do find a bug that's messing up your game after the shutdown, Undead Labs says it won't accept bug reports, so you're on your own.</p>
<p>We don't have a release date for Update 38 yet, but Undead Labs says it's coming "later this year". There may also be "at least one hotfix" following the update, but only if Undead Labs deems it necessary.</p>

<p>Undead Labs closes out its FAQ by commenting on&nbsp;<em>State of Decay 3</em>, which was first announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/state-of-decay-3-shambles-on-to-xbox-series-x">all the way back in 2020</a>&nbsp;(and which we also got to see more of during this year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-xbox-showcase-2024-announcement">Xbox showcase in June</a>).</p>
<p>Per Undead Labs, more info about the game and its release will be shared "at a later time", which isn't much to go on, admittedly. In the meantime, you can check out&nbsp;<em>State of Decay 2&nbsp;</em>on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/495420/State_of_Decay_2_Juggernaut_Edition/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/state-of-decay-2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox One</a> (and on Xbox Series X|S via backwards compatibility).</p>

From the debut of a fan-favorite character to a series of delightfully daft dialogues, the latest episode of <em>Rings of Power</em> is a strong one—something the wildly expensive (yet mostly middling) series could use right now.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197209" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="319" data-playlist="197209,196923,196922" data-current="197209"><div><p>The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22759.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>After <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power-season-two-op-1851634812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-rings-of-power-season-two-op-1851634812">watching the first three episodes of season two</a></span> back-to-back, it’s clear that the showrunners sought to streamline the disparate plots in the wake of a very disjointed first season. And though <em>Rings of Power</em> has been mostly successful in focusing its runtime on the strongest stories (Galadriel and the elves’ fight against Sauron and The Stranger’s quest for self-discovery), it can still feel a bit spread thin as it tries to cram in tales of the dwarves and humans of Middle-earth. But this latest episode feels like it’s truly starting to pull them all together in a sensible way, and often does so with a playful glint in its eye that feels so decidedly Tolkien, capturing the same giddy, childlike wonder that Peter Jackson so effectively imbued his films with. </p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Though there is a lot of proper drama and spookiness going on in this episode (including a scary trek through some haunted woods and the capture of Galadriel by Orc leader Adar), two storylines stood out to me: The Stranger’s quest to reunite with Nori and Poppy, and the Harfoots encountering the other race of hobbits, Stoors. </p><p>The Stranger, having conjured up a dust tornado to ward off attackers, is wandering the lands in search of the two missing girls when he stumbles upon a goat. He follows that goat to a hut, and sitting in front of it is a man humming gently to himself. When he tries to get his attention, the man turns and swiftly throws a branch at his face. The plucky music only adds to the scene’s playfulness, and it soon becomes clear exactly who The Stranger has just met: Tom Bombadil, the iconic and mysterious <em>Lord of the Rings</em> character who has seemingly lived longer than anyone else in this world. Bombadil is played brilliantly by Rory Kinnear, who imbues him with a kind of absentminded sageness that is a joy to watch. Seeing him play off of Daniel Weyman’s stranger has the lightheartedness and fun that you’d expect from any Gandalf scene in the original films. There’s whimsy, there’s wonder, there’s wisdom—I couldn’t stop smiling anytime the two of them were on screen.<br></p><p>It’s clear that Bombadil has incredible power and that The Stranger is meant to learn quite a bit from him, though getting information out of the notoriously spacey, singsongy character might be difficult. He keeps trying to get answers about the star map they’ve been following this entire time, but Bombadil turns the map into a loaf of bread, and hands it to The Stranger to eat. And rather than give him concrete facts or advice, he can’t stop waxing poetic about the sands of time, saying: “Tom was there before the river and the trees, Tom remembers the first raindrop and the first acorn. He knew the dark under the stars when it was fearless. This whole place used to be green, now it’s all sand. I had to come see for myself to believe it.”<br></p><p>Eventually, The Stranger asks Bombadil if he’ll help him learn how to wield the kind of power he’s been casually throwing about (while Bombadil is adorably holding a baby goat). The Stranger wonders aloud if he was meant to meet Bombadil all along, rather than find a staff, then asks if it’s his task to face Sauron and the riders working for the dark wizard we’ve been seeing. He wants Bombadil’s help fighting against the darkness threatening to take over Middle-earth, but the hermit replies that he’s “a wanderer, not a warrior.” When The Stranger asks if it’s his task to stop the fire spreading through Middle-earth, or to stop Sauron, Bombadil replies solemnly, “Your task is to face them both.” It’s a powerful and poignant scene, which feels thoroughly Tolkien.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="0e8eaa11c9520bfe58cb4d466de7cf18" data-recommend-id="image://0e8eaa11c9520bfe58cb4d466de7cf18" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Merrimack holds a torch.

Though they quickly run into who they believe is another Harfoot who’s just been stealing water from a well. We get a hilarious back-and-forth between the three of them, with the newcomer (who first introduces himself as “nobody”) agreeing to take them to his village after Poppy threatens to turn him in for being a thief. He can bring them there, but he says they have to follow the four rules: “One, never look her in the eye. B, always stand three steps back, 4, don’t ever ever, no matter what call her the Gund,” he says solemnly. “Was that three rules or four?” Nori asks. “I wasn’t really paying attention,” Poppy quips.<br></p><p>It’s a hilarious and light scene that leads directly to the girls learning that there are other races of hobbits out there, known as Stoors. Though it seems that both of them come from the same ancestors. The Gund tells Nori that a man with the same last name as the Harfoot’s former leader set out from this place ages ago, searching for a land where cold water always ran through rivers, where a family “could dig a hole and live in it for a month.” She’s talking about the people who eventually become known as the Hobbits, the same ones who live in Bag End. It’s a lovely little connection to the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> we know and love, and it’s done so with a pitch-perfect tone that feels like sipping a warm cup of tea on a cold day.<br></p><p><em>The Rings of Power</em> season two episode four felt tonally perfect for a tale inspired by Tolkien, and it gave me a ton of hope for the rest of the season. The next episode airs on Amazon Prime on September 12. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>In the 18 months since its release, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/hogwarts-legacy-review-sleight-of-hand/1900-6418032/" data-ref-id="1900-6418032">Hogwarts Legacy</a> has emerged as one of the biggest hits of Warner Bros. Discovery's video game division. To date, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-sells-22-million-copies-series-of-other-harry-potter-games-in-the-works/1100-6520172/" data-ref-id="1100-6520172">24 million copies of the game</a> have been sold across all consoles and PC. Although a follow-up game hasn't been formally announced, WBD isn't being ambiguous about its plans. According to one executive with the company, getting a sequel to the Harry Potter-inspired title is at the top of WBD's wish list.</p><p>"[The video game industry] is, just like the film business, a hit-driven business," explained WBD CFO Gunnar Weidenfels via <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/warner-bros-discovery-cfo-hogwarts-legacy-sequel-1235991714/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. "Obviously a successor to Hogwarts Legacy is one of the biggest priorities in a couple years down the road."</p><p>Weidenfels didn't offer any other details about a potential Hogwarts Legacy sequel, but his remarks seem to indicate that the next game is still years away at the earliest. The original game was developed by Avalanche Software and the story was set roughly a century before the life of Harry Potter. Players were given the freedom to create their own characters, who are students at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and that proved to be very enticing to action RPG gamers.</p><p>Unfortunately, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/harry-potter-tv-series-aiming-to-release-in-2026/1100-6521317/" data-ref-id="1100-6521317">the upcoming Harry Potter TV series</a> on HBO, Hogwarts Legacy has been haunted by franchise creator J.K. Rowling's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/jk-rowlings-anti-transgender-stance-and-hogwarts-legacy/1100-6501632/" data-ref-id="1100-6501632">anti-trans views</a>, which she reiterated as recently as the Paris Olympics. Rowling's stance has put her at odds with several of the actors from the Harry Potter films, as well as a large number of her fans. </p>

                <p>Black Myth: Wukong blasted off in August with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-is-now-one-of-the-fastest-selling-games-ever/1100-6526082/" data-ref-id="1100-6526082">10 million copies sold in its first three days</a>, and the figure has since climbed to 18 million copies sold in two weeks.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/balancing-creativity-and-deadlines-in-game-development<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In game development, striking a balance between creativity and deadlines is a challenge that every team faces sooner or later. We’re all passionate about building worlds, crafting stories, and pushing the boundaries of what’s possible in games, but we also have to think about the business side — staying on budget, hitting milestones, and ultimately delivering a game that not only excites gamers but also meets financial goals so that we can make more games after. It’s a constant juggling act — keeping the creative spark alive while ensuring we don’t miss our delivery dates. This isn’t just a project management issue; it’s about finding a workflow where creativity doesn’t end up being a luxury we can’t afford. The reality is, if we don’t get this balance right, it can lead to a host of issues including projects that never see the light of day. And that’s something every developer wants to avoid.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="1. Establish Clear Milestones and Goals">1. Establish Clear Milestones and Goals</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">to avoid scope creep and create engaging experience</span></p><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text">To keep a game development project on track, especially when balancing creativity with deadlines, it's crucial to set clear, actionable milestones with specific deliverables. Breaking the project into distinct stages not only helps maintain momentum but also ensures that each aspect of the game is developed in harmony.</span></p><p><span data-testid="content-text">Here’s how a typical game development project might be structured:</span></p></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Setting clear, actionable milestones from the start is key, but it’s just as important to approach these milestones with an iterative mindset. By developing features incrementally and refining them through successive iterations, you ensure that each part of the game is tested, polished, and well-integrated.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This Agile approach allows for flexibility, enabling the team to adapt to feedback and changing requirements without derailing the project. Regular reviews of progress help keep everyone aligned and address any roadblocks early.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="2. Prioritize Features and Content">2. Prioritize Features and Content</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">to make gamer’s experience excellent.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><br><span data-testid="content-text">In game development, you can't include everything. Prioritizing features and content from the start ensures that the core experience is solid, even if time runs short.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ">●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>Core Features First.</span> Start with the critical features that define your game. Ask yourself: What does this game need to have for gamers to fall in love with it? Focus your team’s efforts on these essential elements first — anything else can be added later if time allows.</h4><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ">●&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span>Rank Features. </span>Once core features are locked in, rank the rest by how much they contribute to the core experience. This helps ensure that the most impactful non-essential features are prioritized next, while less critical ones can be pushed down the list.</h4><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="3. Foster a Collaborative Environment">3. Foster a Collaborative Environment</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">to stimulate creative contributions and enhance empathy</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The collaborative environment goes beyond just teamwork — it’s about ensuring that creative ideas are nurtured without losing sight of business objectives.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Through</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Open Communication</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> teams can discuss both creative ideas and their practical implications early on. For instance, if a proposed visual effect could delay the timeline, this should be openly addressed, allowing the team to weigh its value against the project’s constraints.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cross-Disciplinary Collaboration</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is critical for different departments to understand each other’s limitations and strengths. Suppose the design team proposes a highly detailed environment that could strain the game engine. The programming team might suggest alternative optimization techniques, such as level of detail (LOD), to achieve the visual quality without compromising performance or exceeding memory budgets. Involving marketing early also aligns the game’s unique features with market demands, blending creativity with commercial strategy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Regular Check-Ins</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> serve as recalibration points, where teams reassess the balance between creative goals and business needs. If a visual standard threatens to push the project over budget, these meetings offer a chance to simplify or cut non-essential features, keeping the project on track without sacrificing core quality.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="4. Allocate Time for Creative Exploration">4. Allocate Time for Creative Exploration</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">to enhance performance and reduce stress</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Integrating creative exploration into the development process can be achieved through structured Agile practices that align with both technical goals and business needs.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Scheduled Creative Time</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> can be formalized within the Agile framework, often through the use of designated </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Innovation Sprints</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">which emphasizes rapid prototyping, testing, and iteration within a defined time</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sprint Zero</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> periods, that refers to a preparatory phase before the actual development sprints begin.

			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro is going to be revealed early next week, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Lunatic Ignus, who proved to be a somewhat reliable leaker in the past few months, correctly revealing, among other things, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-4ZM3jxhdE">May's State of Play</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-dlc-expansions/">Black Myth: Wukong expansions</a> before the official announcements, revealed today on their Discord server that the mid-generation refresh system from Sony is getting revealed next week, possibly on Tuesday or Wednesday. The console's reveal will be followed by a State of Play presentation later in the month, which will feature first-party games and potentially a "world premiere", although there's the chance this premiere may be set for this year's The Game Awards in December.</p>

<p>Though the reveal timings are still unknown, there's little doubt that Sony is gearing up for the release of the PlayStation 5 Pro. Last week, well-known leaker billbil-kun revealed they managed to take a look at the system's packaging, releasing <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-design-reveal/">a sketch</a> showcasing the new system's design. During Gamescom last month, developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-was-an-open-secret-at-gamescom-2024/">openly talked about the system</a> as well, so, at this point, it's only a matter of when the console will be revealed and released.</p>
<p>Despite the original system launching in two different editions, there's a good chance that only a PlayStation 5 Pro digital edition will be released. This would help Sony <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-digital-model-price/">keep the price down</a>, as the Japanese company seems to be having trouble containing the production costs, as highlighted by the recent base model's price increase in Japan.</p>

						<h5>Astro Bot</h5><p><span>September 6, 2024</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Publisher</h5><p><span>Sony Interactive Entertainment</span>
						</p></div></div></div>
					<p><span>Team Asobi has been out there making names for themselves as creators of perhaps Sony’s most iconic mascot in recent years. While Astro Bot himself has only been around across two PlayStation platforms, he’s rapidly become the face of Sony Interactive Entertainment for anything with than a Mature rating to which Kratos or Ellie might hold those honors for the age rating. Now the third title featuring Astro Bot is finally here in a 3D platformer of the same name and he’s brought a few hundred friends along with him.</span></p>
<p><span>While Astro Bot’s last adventure through Astro’s Playroom served as a tech demo and advertising piece for the unique features of the Sony PlayStation 5, the hero’s <a href="https://wccftech.com/astro-bot-ditched-open-world-design-to-provide-optimal-variety/">latest adventure</a> is more of a celebration of the past thirty years of Sony heritage. Despite Sony’s recent doubling-down on live service or mature cinematic centerpieces, there are still decades of mascot characters that helped propel the PlayStation into the household name it is today. The hundred-plus cameo bots aren’t limited to just Sony’s single-party output. There are collectible characters of everything from Vib-Ribbon to Shin Megami Tensei Persona 4 to even Bandai Namco’s Klonoa series. Having Mature-rated protagonists the likes of Raziel and Kain right alongside Katamari Damacy’s Prince or the black-furred mascot cats can be quite the culture shock in a children’s game, but Astro Bot really is about bringing together the five-console lineage, even if so many of these mascots don’t call PlayStation the only place to play.</span></p>
<p><span>Astro Bot can punch, run, and jump to solve most of his problems, but each playable stage brings a new gimmick to utilize, typically in the form of a unique collectible. In one stage, Astro Bot might call in his DualSense-shaped airship to navigate through some narrow corridors (which happens in quite a few levels) or knock out a rogue bot to unlock a chest bearing some new ability for that stage. In the last level I replayed as I was penning this review, Astro collected a pair of frog-faced gauntlets that would launch out on spring-loaded arms and punch enemies away from a safe range away from any spiky bits while also being resilient enough to withstand being punched into a bar of pink sticky goo and used to swing Astro across pits.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ASTRO-BOT_20240902104127-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>Everything that Astro Bot touches is filled with whimsy and amusement. The titular hero’s every animation is tinged with a sickeningly sweet charisma, from the way he carries himself throughout the stage on his own two feet or floating through the air via his high-tech jet back, going a few rounds to knock out rogue bots, and the idle animations that are unique to each level. All of the backdrop and tertiary characters of Astro Bot similarly share that wonder and charm and even the simple interactions between one mascot bot to another would never fail to put a smile on my face. Despite the serious unspoken story of having an alien hijack your PlayStation 5 rocket ship and disassemble it across the entire galaxy, each denizen of the galaxy, both synthetic and organic, lives their best carefree lives even when Astro Bot is about to bounce on their heads to reach some out-of-sight cache of coins or puzzle pieces.</span></p>
<p><span>Each stage brings a new gimmick or ability to pick up and use along with their own set of collectibles. On their own, each stage of Astro Bot can easily be cleared in less than ten minutes with a majority of collectibles obtained, if not all. For those that might have missed a bot to recover for the homeward bound crews, at the start of each level replay is an optional perk that can be purchased. Costing 200 coins (which may sound like a lot, but that’s equal to two pulls on the in-game gacha machine and could easily be recouped in a single mission playthough), players can acquire a bird companion that follows Astro Bot around and chirps when there is a hidden collectible about. I won’t deny that I used this feature on a few times, especially in instances where there may be a one-way path that essentially blocks off backtracking to find that one missing collectible.</span></p>
<p><span>There are moments in Astro Bot where the challenge doesn’t quite match the childlike wonder that Team Asobi is going for. With no difficulty options or ways to mitigate incoming damage, taking a single hit brings both Astro Bot and the player back to their previous checkpoint, leaving all of those hard-earned coins behind to be collected once more (thankfully, any proper collectibles such as puzzle pieces and fellow bots are retained between checkpoints). Astro Bot is generous in its checkpointing that players won’t necessarily have to lose more than two or three minutes at a time, but for stages with tricky back-to-back platforming segments or extended encounters against a large wave of hostile foes, Astro Bot can be an exercise in frustration for younger players not accustomed to the more challenging 3D platformers out there.</span></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/ASTRO-BOT_20240902182449-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><span>Much like Astro’s Playroom showcased what the DualSense could accomplish in players' hands for the first time, Team Asobi has designed Astro Bot to take full use of the controller with an additional four years of time to learn about the tactile capabilities. Every step the hardy little robot takes is translated to the player through both vibration and audio response from the integrated speaker. There’s a distinctive enough sensation to each material that you can easily close your eyes and feel the difference between running across grass and a cobblestone trail. All of these added sensations come at a cost, however, as the DualSense’s already minimal battery life and be cut down to the point where players might have to swap controllers to charge in the middle of an afternoon session.</span></p>
<p><span><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/astro-bot/">Astro Bot’</a>s soundtrack, while charming with its various arrangements of the main vocal theme and leitmotifs sprinkled throughout, is one of the few low points to the whole package. There are only so many ways to sing-speak the words Astro Bot and make them sound unique and upbeat without becoming grating to the ears. That being said, Kenny Young has still recreated the magic of Astro’s Playroom with a few earworms that will stick with you long after hitting Rest Mode on your PlayStation 5.</span></p>

<p>As one of the few platformers to keep me grinning from beginning to end, Astro Bot is some of the most fun I've had working on a review all year. There's a profound sense of whimsy and wonder to everything that plucky little robot can do while the worlds he visits inhabit such a diverse set of environments and abilities. Astro Bot's adventure still may be far from over, but this time he's brought a few hundred friends along for the journey.</p>
