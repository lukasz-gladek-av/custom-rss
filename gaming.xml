            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-2m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA and Hazelight Studios have announced that sales of their genre-hopping co-op platformer&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>have hit another big milestone just a single week after the game's initial launch.</p>

<p>Per a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hazelightgames.bsky.social/post/3lkbeztsqbs2b" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media platform Bluesky,&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>has managed to break the two million sales barrier, a feat the studio describes as "simply amazing". Hazelight also thanks "all of [its] new and old fans", describing itself as "blown away" by the milestone.</p>

<p>As a quick reminder,&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-sales-1m-48-hours" rel="nofollow">hit one million</a> within the game's first 48 hours on sale, which means the game has picked up another million sales for itself in the interim. This one looks like it's going to run and run.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction-sales-2m-combat.jpg?itok=xMxZU07h 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction-sales-2m-combat.jpg?itok=qFZjcNvj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>sales have hit another milestone, which will be good news for EA and Hazelight.</figcaption></figure><p>It took&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>'s predecessor&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em><a href="https://x.com/HazelightGames/status/1405499693438808064" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">almost four months</a> to reach the same milestone, so it's clear&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>is continuing to strike a chord with players, perhaps because of&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two</em>'s positive reputation.</p>

<p>Again, as a reminder,&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>went on to sell <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hazelight-josef-fares-new-ip-it-takes-two-sales" rel="nofollow">over 20 million copies at last count</a>, so it's not unrealistic to imagine that&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>might do even better than that over the next couple of years.</p>

<p><em>Split Fiction</em>'s performance also throws into sharp relief EA's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-the-veilguard-shared-world-elements" rel="nofollow">apparent suggestion</a> that recent flop&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>didn't do well because it lacked "shared world elements"; after all, Hazelight's latest isn't a live-service game, but it's already sold <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-ea-sports-fc-25-underperformed" rel="nofollow">more than&nbsp;<em>Veilguard&nbsp;</em>did</a> within its first three months on sale.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, it's a co-op action-adventure game from&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>A Way Out&nbsp;</em>developer Hazelight Studios, headed up by industry personality Josef Fares.</p>




<p>The game revolves around Mio and Zoe, two writers who must work together in order to escape a nefarious machine that wants to drain them of their ideas. Like the aforementioned games, it's co-op only, so grab a friend or partner for this one.</p>

<p><em>Split Fiction&nbsp;</em>is available to buy right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2001120/Split_Fiction/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/split-fiction/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/split-fiction/9N1WXXD1RL8D" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[PowerWash Simulator 2 Announced, Coming Later This Year]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-2-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/powerwash-simulator-2-announced-coming-later-this-year.1133592/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/powerwash-simulator-2-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher FuturLab has announced&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>, a followup to the popular 2022 work sim. It's coming to PC and current-gen consoles sometime later this year.</p>

<p>Unlike the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/powerwash-simulator" rel="nofollow">original game</a>,&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will be a self-published affair; it is, after all, the studio's first new game since being snapped up by mobile and browser game giant Miniclip <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/miniclip-futurlab-acquisition" rel="nofollow">back in April last year</a>.</p>

<p>As you'd probably expect from a&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator&nbsp;</em>sequel,&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will task you with cleaning a whole new set of environments. You'll be able to explore more of Muckingham, and a number of new locations will also be available to you in a brand new campaign.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-cleaning.jpg?itok=NbY_6b1l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/powerwash-simulator-2-cleaning.jpg?itok=KrNJ1b7w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>is coming sometime this year.</figcaption></figure><p>When you're not cleaning, you can kick back and relax at your home base, which you can also fill with "furniture and trinkets" to make it a more homely place.</p>

<p>You'll also be able to share your campaign progress with another player online, but if you don't fancy playing together at a distance, you can also team up in split-screen co-op. It's not yet clear whether&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will support crossplay.</p>

<p>Of course, some improvements have also been made to gameplay mechanics; FuturLab says you can expect "enhanced soap that clings to stubborn stains and annihilates dirt", making cleaning feel "even better" than in the game's predecessor.</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>, which gives a sense of what the game will look and play like, right here. Of course, if you've played&nbsp;<em>PowerWash Simulator</em>, you'll probably already know what to expect on that score.</p>




<p><em>PowerWash Simulator 2&nbsp;</em>will launch for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2968420/PowerWash_Simulator_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S later this year.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-copilot-for-gaming-announced/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-copilot-for-gaming-announced-as-the-%E2%80%9Cultimate-gaming-sidekick%E2%80%9D.1133577/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-copilot-for-gaming-announced/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Microsoft has unveiled Xbox Copilot for Gaming, a new tool aimed towards being a the “ultimate gaming sidekick” for players. </p>



<p>In an appearance on the official Xbox Podcast, Xbox Corporate Vice President of Gaming AI Fatima Kardar unveiled the AI-powered tool to the world. The announcement also included a detailed post on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/13/new-copilot-for-gaming-save-time-help-get-good/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a>.</p>



<p>“This AI-driven sidekick is designed to be your personalized gaming companion, helping you get to your favorite games faster, coaching you to improve your skills, and connecting you better with your friends and communities,” Jeff Rubenstein, director of Xbox editorial, said. “Copilot for Gaming will be there when you need it but out of the way if you don’t.”</p>



<p>During the podcast, an concept example of how the new tool could work was shown using Minecraft.  In the game a player picked up wood and entered a prompt asking “Okay, I’ve got some wood. What do I do with that?” Copilot for Gaming answered by explaining how to turn the gathered oak logs into wooden planks.</p>



<p>Another example shown involved Overwatch. A player asks the tool for help on who to pick after the hero they wanted, Echo, was already selected.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Copilot Is Coming To Gaming, Xbox Play Anywhere Updates, And More | Official Xbox Podcast" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZoUDVNjDUSw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>“Echo’s taken, but Cassidy would be a solid pick with this team,” Copilot says. “His mid-range hit scan and Mercy’s damage boost will work great on Ilios Ruins. Plus you’ve done great with him on this map before.” </p>



<p>After the player dies during the game, Copilot explains that it happened because they stayed in the fight for too long and suggested to regroup with their team the next time they are in a similar situation.</p>



<p>The tool will even let you pull up situation-specific advice for the game and moment you are in, according to Microsoft.</p>



<p>Everything shown during the podcast were proof of concepts and not actual gameplay uses. As far as a release date, Copilot for Gaming will start in a slow rollout on mobile devices for members of the Xbox Insider Program “soon”. A release on other devices and then to the general public will happen “gradually”.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-the-first-berserker-khazan-pc-system-requirements%E2%80%94minimum-recommended-specs.1133574/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-pc-system-requirements-specs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The First Berserker Khazan looks as beastly as the creatures that inhabit the game. But it could be bad news for Khazan’s PC specs and various system requirements. Let’s take a look and see if it’s as powerful as it looks.</p>



<p>It wouldn’t be a year in gaming without one or two AAA titles fighting for the Soulslike crown. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-platforms-free-demo-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a> is looking to challenge <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> in 2025. The latter is established, but Khazan looks promising. Featuring a story of revenge and retribution, The First Berserker Khazan has a clear-cut and combat-heavy tale to tell.</p>



<p>It’s a huge step forward for developer Neople, and I’m here to reveal whether Khazan’s system requirements will trouble your hardware.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-first-berserker-khazan-minimum-requirements-on-pc">The First Berserker Khazan Minimum Requirements on PC</h2>



<figure><figcaption>With great power comes great specs and requirements. Credit to NEXON</figcaption></figure>



<p>The minimum PC specs are probably what you need to consider if you crave more souslike action and don’t care how it looks. It also goes without saying this only applies to PC players. You need to remember Khazan’s trailer and gameplay footage has likely been rendered with the highest-possible settings.</p>



<p><a href="https://khazan.nexon.com/en/main" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The First Berserker Khazan</a> may not look as pretty using minimum PC requirements, but it’s better than nothing. Here’s every minimum spec and what you need to be able to play it.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">The First Berserker Khazan Minimum PC Spec</th><th data-align="center">The First Berserker Khazan Minimum Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Operating Software</td><td data-align="center">Windows 10 64bit 22H2</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Ryzen 3 1200 / Intel Core i3-6300</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">Arc A580 / GeForce GTX 970 / Radeon RX 580</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">12 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX</td><td data-align="center">Version 11</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">70 GB</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-the-first-berserker-khazan-recommended-requirements-on-pc">The First Berserker Khazan Recommended Requirements on PC</h2>



<p>The minimum settings are quite generous. I think most (if not all) players should have no problem running The First Berserker Khazan. They should also be able to make it pop—even with inferior gear. But if you have an impressive rig running a lot of juice, you’re probably here for the recommended specs.</p>



<p>Here’s each setting and what it would be handy to have to ensure Khazan is smoother than a hot knife through butter.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">The First Berserker Khazan Recommended PC Spec</th><th data-align="center">The First Berserker Khazan Recommended Requirement</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Operating Software</td><td data-align="center">Windows 11 21H2</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">CPU</td><td data-align="center">AMD Ryzen 5 3600 / Intel Core i7-6700K</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">GPU</td><td data-align="center">Arc A750 / GeForce RTX 2070 / Radeon RX 5700XT</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Memory</td><td data-align="center">16 GB RAM</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">DirectX</td><td data-align="center">Version 12</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Storage</td><td data-align="center">70 GB</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/03/epic-games-is-addressing-one-of-windows-on-arms-last-big-app-compatibility-gaps/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Using a Windows PC with an Arm-based Snapdragon processor in it feels a lot like using a regular-old Intel or AMD PC these days, thanks to the work developers have put in to get their apps running natively on Arm chips and the work Microsoft has done on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsoft-says-prism-translation-layer-does-for-arm-pcs-what-rosetta-did-for-macs/">Windows' Prism technology for translating x86 apps to run on Arm processors</a>. But some of the old compatibility gaps remain.</p>
<p>For example, while many PC games will run well enough on an Arm PC without any changes from the game's developer, online multiplayer games that rely on kernel-level anti-cheat software generally don't work. Drivers and other lower-level Windows software can't be translated by Prism, and in many cases, the Arm PC user base is still small enough that developers haven't put in the work to get Arm versions of their software up and running.</p>
<p>Epic Games is taking a step in that direction later this year—today, the company <a href="https://onlineservices.epicgames.com/en-US/news/windows-on-snapdragon-support-is-coming-to-epic-online-services-anti-cheat-and-fortnite">announced</a> that it's bringing its <a href="https://onlineservices.epicgames.com/en-US/services-games">Epic Online Services Easy Anti-Cheat</a> software to Arm PCs, along with official Windows-on-Arm support for&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>. Both are coming to Arm PCs "later this year."</p>
<p>"In addition to releasing Windows on Snapdragon anti-cheat support for <em>Fortnite</em><em>,</em> we will bring this support to developers through an Epic Online Services SDK release," the company's blog post says. "This will enable developers using Easy Anti-Cheat to bring this compatibility to their own games."</p>

This year, Game Developer sat down with the finalists&nbsp; for the IGF’s Nuovo and Grand Prize nominees ahead of GDC to explore the themes, design decisions, and tools behind each entry. Game Developer and GDC are sibling organizations under Informa.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Caves of Qud</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, one of the nominees for the Seumas McNally Grand Prize at this year’s IGF, offers players the ability to explore, meet characters, and do just about anything in its vast, deep simulation of its sci-fi world. Filled with thousands of years of lore and culture that have been written and built alongside systems designed to inspire player creativity, this years-in-the-making game offers a great deal to discover depending on how you choose to explore it.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer had a chat with Jason Grinblat and Brian Bucklew, the game’s co-creators, to talk about the challenges involved in creating so many opportunities for player creativity in the game, how they managed to create the game’s written descriptions when the player is capable of acting in so many different ways, and the challenges that come from making a game for almost twenty years.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/inside-indika-s-powerful-bleak-exploration-of-religion" target="_self" data-discover="true">Inside Indika's powerful, bleak exploration of religion</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Who are you, and what was your role in developing </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Caves of Qud</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Jason Grinblat, co-creator:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> I’m Jason Grinblat and I also have Brian Bucklew here. We’re the co-creators of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Caves of Qud</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Originally it was just the two of us working on the game, but since our Steam EA launch in 2015 the team has grown considerably.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Broadly speaking, I head up the creative/design side and Brian heads the technical side, but it’s a much more mixed bag than that, in reality. Each of us does a lot.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What's your background in making games?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grinblat:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> We came up as hobbyists and we still sort of are. We grew up together playing and making games. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Caves of Qud</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is actually the first one we put out to the public (as an early alpha back in 2010). We took a break from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Qud</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> development to make </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sproggiwood</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (release date 2014), and we’ve done some AAA consulting work. But most of our serious time in games, actually, has been spent making </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Qud</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you come up with the concept for </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Caves of Qud</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grinblat:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> It was the confluence of several things. Around 2007, we were making a tabletop roleplaying game with an expansive, far-future science fantasy setting. We were also toying around with the design for a turn-limited exploration-based webgame. We were ALSO developing a roguelike engine. At some point these projects merged and became the genesis of Caves of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Qud</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/making-a-life-in-the-funky-plant-filled-world-of-starship-home" target="_self" data-discover="true">Making a life in the funky, plant-filled world of Starship Home</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What development tools were used to build your game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Brian Bucklew, co-creator:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Caves of Qud</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was originally a raw C# .NET 2.0 application. For the Steam release we ported that codebase into Unity. We started on Unity version 4, and 1.0 was released last December on Unity 2022.3. The team devs use either Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code and also Linear, Confluence, Git, and Bitbucket for collaboration and planning.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Caves of Qud</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> gives players the means to do just about anything they want in the game's world, capturing the chaotic freedom of a tabletop roleplaying game. What thoughts and challenges go into accounting for (and allowing) so many different possibilities of player interaction with every object, surface, and character?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grinblat:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> It’s a big technical and design challenge. For both those domains, we tend to think in terms of modularity—how can we break components down so they can be freely combined in expressive ways. And then we try to make sure each module has a personality. For instance, the concept of door carries a lot of weight with it, and so you get to import and play with that whole network of cultural associations when you, say, cast that door as a sentient creature and allow it to be talked to, traded with, played as.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/ghostrunner-2-deep-dive" target="_self" data-discover="true">Feedback and experimentation: the foundations of Ghostrunner 2</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The game is filled with excellent writing to cover its many varied moments and events. How do you create well-crafted writing when there are so many different possible actions and activities? When so many different things can all feed into a single moment? How do you account for the varied possibilities while still preserving the great writing?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grinblat:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Again, I’d say our process is twofold. On the one hand, we do a lot of "traditional" writing a la RPGs or interaction fiction like handwritten NPCs, dialogue, quests, object descriptions, etc. This forms a kind of trellis for the more procedural stuff to grow on. Procedural content always needs something stable to be read against or else it doesn’t cohere into something meaningful.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In writing for the procedural modules themselves, we try to leave enough degrees of freedom so that the gestalts feel good when the modules are combined. For example, in writing creature descriptions, I shy away from depicting what they're wearing or where they’re located, since those things are subject to change in the free-for-all of play. I want something that is resonant but movable between contexts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally, we’ve developed a rich, offbeat science fantasy setting that acts as a soft landing for all the wild combinations that show up. For a game world that wants meaningful replayability, a good setting is like a wet sponge. It gives with another squeeze; there’s something in its network of symbols that benefits or enriches from thinking through at another angle. This is the type of setting </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Qud</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> grew into.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The game features many wild things players can do or experience, and you walked us through how you come up with these ideas in a previous </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/tapping-into-the-potential-of-procedural-generation-in-caves-of-qud">interview with Game Developer</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>. Can you tell us of a personal favorite mechanic/ability/action and walk us through how you designed and implemented it into the game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grinblat:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Some spoilers here. By late game, for inscrutable plot reasons, you’re tasked with creating a golem. To do it you have to bring together an assemblage of bizarrely thematized components: the body ("as a model"), the catalyst ("to charge the sanguine fluid"), the atzmus ("as deistic direction"), etc. This is a craft project that pulls together several systems and facets of the game world you’ve been inhabiting for hours and hours at this point.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Just like character creation, it was important for this to feel expressive—to provide a broad palette that didn’t feel prescriptive that acts like a raw physics for you to build on top of. Over our years and years of development, we’ve amassed a trove of rich, authored data on our game objects—creatures, furniture, items, fluids, body parts, journal entries. There are several thousand game-things each with a distinct personality. We realized we could attach thematically-aligned effects to each of those and feed them into a giant crafting metasystem that felt commensurate with the scale of the quest and the real-world symbology it’s drawing from. The result: players ferreting out all sorts of wild designs for making the weirdest and niche-est golems possible. One player went on a personal quest to discover a way to give his companion (a tree) wings so they could ferry them to the mound of scrap and clay where crafting happens and create a tree golem. The game allowed it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Caves of Qud</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> was in development for seventeen years. What challenges came from working with decades-old code and systems you had previously created? How do you ensure the game's old code plays nice with stuff you've made more recently, and how do you ensure it all works well together on modern systems? Can you tell us some of the work you've done to make everything run together?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bucklew:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Caves of Qud</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a large legacy system. One of the things we've done at least semi-successfully is pay down technical debt at a modest but consistent pace. Our weekly public patch cadence leading up to 1.0 was focused primarily on paying down debt to make sure we weren't buried in it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unity helps us keep our game running on the latest systems by saving us the bulk of core engine platform support work. This is a huge cost savings in terms of ongoing technical maintenance. The technical gap bridged across Windows, Linux, and MacOS from Unity 4 in 2014 and Unity 2023 is huge and Unity paid the bulk of that technical cost.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even with that, though, some of the biggest challenges were in converting a game that was originally a console-only roguelike to a modern game that could be run on the Steam Deck. This meant adding a whole new UI, a whole new input system, tiles, subsystems for sound and music, and more. Each of these was an enormous development effort involving the creation of new systems and the refactoring of old systems to meet the new requirements, and there was no real trick to it other than just putting in the elbow grease to get each one done. Knowing it would be a long project, at each step we made our best effort to ensure each one was a solid foundation that we could build the next increment on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How has the game changed (or not changed at all) over the many years you've been working on it? What prompted some of the changes (and what were those changes), or what made you stay the course this whole time?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grinblat:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> The broad vision of the game has remained remarkably consistent over the 17 years. This last Fall we were finally implementing some of the plans we hatched back in 2007. It felt wild. Of course, the game has changed as well; we’ve grown as designers, as thinkers, as people. What interests us now, in our 40s, looks a bit different than what interested us in our 20s. But, as several of our players have pointed out, the resulting layer cake of development history has some convenient resonances with the history-as-a-layer-cake themes of the game itself.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Having spent the better part of a lifetime working on this game, what feelings came out of reaching the 1.0 release? When you work on something for this long, how did you even decide that you had done enough that it was time for a 1.0 release? How did you decide that this massive game was finally "complete," and how does it feel now that you've reached that milestone?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grinblat:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Sublime, surreal, hazy from exhaustion. It’s honestly almost too much to process, and we still need more time to land on what it feels like to be "done."&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for how we chose the 1.0 target, for a long time our roadmap was pointing to three big milestones, where we'd 1) have rewritten the UI to the modern, friendlier RPG UI you see in the game now, 2) have some sort of tutorial or new player funnel, and 3) have finished the main quest and have the game be beatable. We got there; that’s 1.0. Now beyond that…. ????</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Psychological RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> is set to come to mobile devices courtesy of original studio ZA/UM in a "reimagined" form.</p>
<p>The aim of this adaptation is to make the game accessible for mobile devices and playable in short bursts.</p>
<p>"We intend to captivate the TikTok user with quick hits of compelling story, art, and audio, ultimately creating an all new, deeply engaging form of entertainment," said studio head Denis Havel, an original member of the Disco Elysium development team.</p>

<p>As you can see from the trailer above, the original's isometric gameplay has been adapted to fit a vertical phone screen, with players swiping through dialogue options. It looks more like a visual novel.</p>
<p>"With this adaptation, Disco Elysium becomes more accessible than ever. This reimagination is now structured to fit the way people play on mobile, making it effortless to enjoy in short bursts. It's what audiobooks wish they were," said narrative lead Chris Priestman.</p>
<p>Added Havel: "Mobile players deserve deep, story-rich experiences, like Disco Elysium. With profound respect for the original's artistry and meaning, we move forward as both custodians and creators, bringing this masterpiece to new and returning players alike. We want you to fall in love with Disco Elysium on your phone - all over again."</p>
<p>The game will launch in summer 2025 on Google Android devices, so it's not long to see how this adaptation will live up to the original. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ZAUM.M0_stable">Pre-registration</a> is now open.</p>
<p>What's more, the first two chapters will be available for free, with the rest of the game unlocked with a single purchase for ad-free gameplay.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studio-zaums-new-rpg-c4-is-part-espionage-thriller-part-psychedelic-sci-fi">ZA/UM announced its follow-up to Disco Elysium</a> - a new RPG called C4 that's part espionage thriller and part psychedelic sci-fi.</p>
<p>However, following messy drama after the release of Disco Elysium and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studio-says-lawsuits-from-former-members-have-been-resolved">number of now-resolved lawsuits</a>, many of the original developers have dispersed.</p>
<p>There are now a number of different projects competing to become the foremost successor to the celebrated RPG.</p>
<p>That includes new studio Longude, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-disco-elysium-alumni-join-former-staff-at-longdue-working-on-spiritual-successor">also this week provided an update on its new game Hopetown</a> that includes key Disco Elysium alumni.</p>
<p>Other projects include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/detective-rpg-in-the-works-from-breakaway-group-of-former-disco-elysium-developers">XXX Nightshift from a new UK-based studio Dark Math Games</a> formed of a "breakaway group from the original development team of Disco Elysium", as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-former-zaum-devs-have-set-up-another-studio-but-they-are-definitely-not-working-on-a-disco-elysium-sequel">new studio Summer Eternal</a> from Disco Elysium worldbuilding co-creator Argo Tuulik.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/628666/microsoft-xbox-copilot-for-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> <span>is a senior editor and author of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter"><i>Notepad</i></a>, who has been covering all things Microsoft, PC, and tech for over 20 years.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft is preparing to launch an AI-powered Copilot for Gaming soon that will guide Xbox players through games and act as an assistant to download and launch games. Copilot for Gaming, as Microsoft is branding it, will be available through the Xbox mobile app initially and is designed to work on a second screen as a companion or assistant.</p><p>Microsoft <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/13/new-copilot-for-gaming-save-time-help-get-good/">is positioning Copilot for Gaming</a> as a sidekick of sorts, one that will accompany you through games, offering up tips and guides and useful information about a game world. During a press briefing, Sonali Yadav, product manager for gaming AI, demonstrated several scenarios for what Copilot for Gaming could be used for. One involved a concept demo of Copilot assisting an <em>Overwatch 2</em> player by coaching them on the mistakes they made when trying to push without teammates.</p><p>In the <em>Overwatch 2</em> demo, Copilot could even recommend good hero picks to complement the rest of the team and tell you more about why you’d want to pair up particular characters, detailing their strengths and weaknesses. Another demo involved using Copilot with <em><em>Minecraft</em></em>, where you could ask Copilot questions about how to craft objects. Copilot can see your screen, so it can guide you and see exactly what you’re doing in a game. The demo also included the option to enable cheats in <em>Minecraft, </em>so Copilot could even tell you where certain crafting materials are located in the world.</p><p>The demos felt very concept in nature, and they won’t be available during the initial launch of Copilot for Gaming next month. Instead, Microsoft will test early versions of Copilot with Xbox Insiders through the Xbox mobile app in April, before eventually bringing Copilot to multiple devices.</p><p>Microsoft also has a slick marketing video for its Copilot for Gaming effort, but none of it looks real world to me, so it’s difficult to understand exactly what the company will deliver to testers in April. It looks like Microsoft has the vision for where it wants Copilot on an Xbox to be in the future, and it says it will iterate based on feedback. But right now, I’ll be interested to see how this launches in a more limited fashion on mobile devices.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Sure, Stitch, the not-dog alien that sets the events of the film into motion, looks fittingly hideous. I’m glad to hear they let the original movie’s director and lead actor, Chris Sanders, reprise his role as the little blue guy. However, one change that’s being made for this adaptation feels like it was done both to cut corners in the animation department and to allow for a cowardly pivot away from one of the original film’s best bits. I’m talking about swapping alien dynamic duo Jumba (Zach Galifianakis) and Pleakley (Billy Magnussen) out of their improvised human disguises into a more straightforward hologram that lets the film simply use the human actors.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196123" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond The Day Before | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="125" data-playlist="196123,196789,197298" data-current="196123"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond The Day Before | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196123/196123_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21655.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In the original film, Jumba and Pleakley are sent to Earth to retrieve Stitch, who escapes to the planet and crashlands in Hawaii. The two are very clearly alien and have to carry out their mission incognito. They do this by grabbing whatever human clothes they can to create disguises. The joke is that the two are clearly still aliens, but while Jumba looks like he just rolled out of bed and grabbed whatever was nearby, Pleakley is seen in elaborate outfits, typically in drag, with the two cosplaying as a married couple to blend in. He’s putting in the effort and can lip sync for his life at the drop of a hat.</p><p>Now, Disney is going a much more straightforward route for live-action. It looks like Jumba and Pleakley will be using holograms to appear human for parts of the film, allowing Galifianakis and Magnussen to be on-screen as the aliens’ “human” forms rather than just voicing the characters. The trade-off here is that not only is one of the original movie’s running gags lost in translation, but fans are annoyed that Pleakley is seemingly no longer in drag in the live-action adaptation. Some are saying this might just be a way to lower animation costs for the film, while others are more suspicious that it could be in reaction to something that was seen as a harmless gag 20 years ago but could now be read by the worst people you know as some kind of “woke” propaganda promoting same-sex relationships, drag, or cross-dressing.</p><p>Alongside the usual tomato-throwing from classic Disney fans who consider these live-action remakes uncreative cash grabs that devalue the original animated films, the <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch </em>remake has also been the subject of a fair bit of bespoke controversy, with some <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.businessinsider.com/lilo-and-stitch-casting-sparks-online-debate-colorism-hollywood-2023-4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.businessinsider.com/lilo-and-stitch-casting-sparks-online-debate-colorism-hollywood-2023-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">accusing the film of whitewashing</a></span> its Native Hawaiian characters. Inevitably, the movie will make half a billion dollars at the box office and no lessons will be learned. At least we’ll always have cunty Pleakley in the animated movie. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/why-one-photo-on-linkedin-has-warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-fans-excited<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000 real-time strategy series Dawn of War has been dormant ever since Relic Entertainment ended support for its failed 2017 effort, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iii">Dawn of War 3</a>. Still, the first two games remain much-loved by fans, who have wondered ever since whether a Dawn of War 4 or maybe even remakes of either Dawn of War 1 or 2 might be in the works.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, after a single photo was published to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dominik-dolenec-57153146_emonacapital-activity-7302358433092030464-x6t8?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAJnrdMBkTuB_VYNNnFKqq9kwmzjliqcGN0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>, Dawn of War fans have hope that something new in the series is finally on the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with Relic Entertainment itself, which recently gained independence from prior owner Sega via investment from Emona Capital. Emona managing partner Dominik Dolenec published a selfie to LinkedIn showing him standing outside Games Workshop’s Nottingham headquarters and the mecca that is Warhammer World. Yes, that’s a statue of a Space Marine in the background. It’s awesome.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The foreground is more interesting, however. Dolenec is wearing a Relic Entertainment T-shirt for his trip to Games Workshop, and so it can be reasonably assumed that he’s in town representing the developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Great visit to Games Workshop PLC in Nottingham,” Dolenec said. “Many thanks to Owen Rees for sharing the Warhammer magic with us! Looking forward to deepening our partnership in years to come. 💪🎮”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Owen Rees is Group Head of Licensing at Games Workshop. He’s worked on a number of Warhammer video games, and leads the licensing of video games and consumer products for all Warhammer products. It’s also worth noting those emojis at the end of Dolenec’s comment. This very much reads like a video game business meeting.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You can imagine the speculation. Dawn of War 4 is top of the wishlist, it seems, but perhaps remakes of Dawn of War 1 and / or 2 are on the cards instead. Let’s be optimistic and suggest a brand new game and remakes are all in the works. Why not?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s what we know: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-made-millions-for-games-workshop-now-its-on-the-hunt-for-the-next-big-warhammer-video-game">Games Workshop is on the hunt for the next big Warhammer video game hit</a> after the hugely successful, 5 million-selling <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-ii">Space Marine 2</a> changed everything for developer Saber Interactive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In January, reporting results for the first half of its financial year ending December 1, 2024, Games Workshop CEO Kevin Rountree hailed the success of Space Marine 2, which contributed significant royalty revenue to the business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, licensing revenue from royalty income increased in the period by a whopping £18 million (approx. $21.9 million) to £30.1 million (approx. $36.7 million). Earned income, which is the key figure here, was £26.1 million (approx. $31.8 million), up from £5.9 million (approx. $7.2 million), an increase Games Workshop said was mainly from Space Marine 2. 98% of Games Workshop’s total licensing revenue came from PC and console games (Space Marine 2 launched on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A win all round, then, but Rountree also expressed a degree of caution on potential future video game success, admitting hits like Space Marine 2 are few and far between.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the statement:</p><blockquote>During the period, our licensing partners launched two new video games; Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, a third person shooter for PC and console and Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks, a combat racing game. Established games continue to contribute, alongside royalty income earned following the success of Space Marine 2. We recognise that successes like these for Warhammer are not a given in the world of video games. Clearly we are looking for the next one. We remain cautious when forecasting royalty income.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">So, where could this big Warhammer video game hit come from? It seems inevitable that Saber Interactive will get the chance to continue the Space Marine story with Space Marine 3, and indeed has said it has ideas for a third game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000 has never been bigger. Amazon’s Space Marine 2 animation, released as part of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tv/secret-level">Secret Level</a> anthology series, went down well with fans. And there’s huge excitement about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-workshop-and-amazon-finalize-deal-for-henry-cavills-warhammer-40000-cinematic-universe-but-production-may-take-a-number-of-years">the Henry Cavill-fronted Warhammer 40,000 projects in the works for Amazon</a>, although they're years away. Creative Assembly is reportedly working on a Warhammer 40,000 Total War game (finally!), although it is apparently years away. Could a revival of Dawn of War scratch that strategy itch in the meantime?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <title><![CDATA[Why Did No One Tell Me Duolingo Is Like This]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/duolingo-gamification</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-did-no-one-tell-me-duolingo-is-like-this.1133487/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/duolingo-gamification<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You might recall that I’m taking an <a href="https://aftermath.site/irish-now-youre-talking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Irish language</a> class. In our first class this week, the teacher suggested getting Duolingo for vocabulary-building; while the general consensus seems to be that Duolingo is <a href="https://thegeekygaeilgeoir.wordpress.com/tag/duolingo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shit</a> for Irish pronunciation, it <em>is</em> full of words, and I don’t know very many words yet and would like to know more. So I got Duolingo. I hate Duolingo.</p><p>I might be the only person in the world who has never screwed around with Duolingo, the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/02/26/nx-s1-5309785/duolingo-owl-mascot-lives" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">owl-based</a> language-learning app that I mostly only know from when people post funny sentences from it on social media. I actually didn’t even know it was free until our teacher told us it was, which definitely made it more appealing. So I installed it on my phone, selected “Irish,” and dove in.</p><p>To my deeply limited knowledge, the Irish pronunciation is hit or miss. Some words sound fine, while others are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duolingo/comments/12dfegv/new_irish_voices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">computer voices</a> that even I, a total beginner, know aren’t quite right. I spend a lot of time checking any new word Duolingo says at me against <a href="https://www.teanglann.ie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Teanglann</a> or <a href="https://abair.ie/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Abair</a>, which provide pronunciation in the different dialects. Additionally, some of the grammatical things it’s shown me so far feel under-explained– I was thrown by the app’s “Labhraím Gaeilge” for “I speak Irish” instead of the “Tá Gaeilge agam” (literally, “I have Irish”) that I’ve heard before; looking up <a href="https://duonotes.fandom.com/wiki/Irish#:~:text=When%20talking%20about%20languages%20in,of%20the%20English%20%22speak%22.&amp;text=2)%20%22I%20speak%20Irish%22,the%20knowledge%20of%2C%20the%20language." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why it’s different</a> actually taught me useful grammar information. But this learning feels like a side effect of me being a nerd rather than Duolingo’s intention, especially since it <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duolingo/comments/18qenxv/has_duolingo_removed_all_learning_material/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t give me</a> any of this context in the app itself.</p><p>Anyway, I am a complete beginner at this language and will not presume to correct a long-standing app with facts I’ve Googled, so I’ll move on to what I can confidently hate about Duolingo, which is: everything about Duolingo. Why did no one tell me it’s like this?! When I opened it for the first time I was instantly inundated with <em>shit</em>: XP and stars and gems and hearts and flames, many of which, like the Irish lessons themselves, it doesn’t really explain. At first, I kept trying to figure out how to <em>use</em> my XP to, I don’t know, level up, before realizing it functions more like points. I did not understand why I was pursuing these chests full of “gems” or what the gems were for. When I first started using the app, I didn’t understand what counted as completing an activity toward my “streak,” since each little circle has multiple lessons attached to it, so I just kept going until I asked a friend online when I was allowed to stop.&nbsp;</p><p>The whole concept of “hearts,” lives that you lose if you make a mistake until you lose them all and can’t go through lessons anymore, makes a kind of sense for a video game or a gamified app, but as a learning tool just makes me afraid to fuck up. While they do encourage you to slow down and think about your answer, they also feel like bad design for a <em>learning</em> app, and one that sometimes teaches you new words through guessing. I feel like I’m being punished for being a learner, and I will thoroughly cop to cheating on occasion by doublechecking the spelling challenges before committing to them. Irish is a difficult language to spell, especially as a new learner coming from English, and it pissed me off to no end to have to stop learning new words because I couldn’t spell the Irish word for “salad,” a word that God willing I will never have to spell. (It’s “sailéad,” which I suppose Duolingo has indeed taught me to spell, but only through fucking up, the thing Duolingo punishes you for!)&nbsp;</p><p>People on social media and in our Discord warned me away from Duolingo’s <a href="https://www.cnet.com/culture/internet/duolingo-turned-me-into-a-monster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaderboards</a> and “leagues,” which only made me want to know about them more. I’m currently top of the “Bronze” level Irish leaderboard thanks to my amount of XP, and I can see its insidious appeal; I absolutely do not want to engage in this cursed feature and turn my learning into a competition against strangers, but also damned if I’m not gonna beat the person below me. There are apparently all kinds of <a href="https://103percent.blogspot.com/2023/12/competitive-duolingo-is-miserable.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tricks</a> you can employ to game the leaderboards, which I feel mostly confident I am never going to do, but I <em>have</em> found myself clicking the ugly brown trophy icon multiple times a day to check if I’m still comfortably ahead of the second-place user. But the only way to increase my distance is to get more XP by playing more, and the only way to play more is to not fuck up and lose all my hearts, which just incentivizes me to cheat.</p><p>Or, as Duolingo so obviously wants me to do, to pony up for its paid version, which has unlimited hearts and other features. This is clearly the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duolingo/comments/1fprso6/duo_lingo_has_officially_ruined_their_app_by/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">real reason</a> Duolingo is like this; rather than offering me something good for my money, it makes the free version so crappy that the paid version sounds like the “real” app. There are <em>so</em> many ads, mostly for the paid version of Duolingo, but others for <a href="https://aftermath.site/so-i-dont-totally-hate-those-hero-wars-ads" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shitty mobile games</a>. You can watch ads to earn more hearts, and some of them ask you to interact with them, playing parts of mindless mobile games. Perhaps unpopularly, or as a side effect of being an old person who used to watch TV before streaming, I don’t as a life rule hate ads; my time is not so valuable that 10 seconds makes a difference to me. But the ploy is so naked, the app so clearly enshittified, that the ads infuriate me, because the actual thing being advertised by every ad suggesting I pay for Duolingo is just how to have a less shitty experience with Duolingo.</p><p>But the real problem is that, despite yelling “what the fuck?!” in my first five minutes with a program I always imagined was a regular learning tool and not some kind of gamification limbo, I am already utterly trapped in its stupidest bits. I don’t care about its XP beyond my growing obsession with the leaderboard, but I absolutely <em>crave </em>pressing the buttons and hearing the sounds and watching the circles fill in. It feels like the dumb mobile games it foists on me in ads, mindless and shallow and disgustingly satisfying. I keep using it? playing it? even when it’s long stopped “teaching” me anything and I’m just repeating things I’ve been shown in previous lessons or choosing an answer from the only new word on offer. My nerve endings <em>love</em> the stupid chime sound of getting an answer correct; I feel like I’m good at Irish when I 100% a lesson, even though the achievement comes from the app’s design instead of actual language knowledge. It is the most naked, blatant bullshit, and I am disgusted with myself by how I’m <em>so</em> fucking here for it.</p><p>Right now, I have one heart left that I’m determined to bank, but I keep picking up my phone and poking impatiently around the app for something to do, the kind of compulsion I’ve never felt for other apps on my phone. I fucking <em>hate</em> it; the whole thing is vapid and greedy and aimless, but <em>jesus christ </em>I want to keep pressing the buttons. I resent–&nbsp;</p><p>OK, literally in the middle of typing the above sentence I got an alert purporting to be from the person below me on the leaderboards, who has apparently overtaken me. The alert told me to “Earn more XP to reclaim your reward chest” (what is my reward chest? Is it something to do with the leaderboard?) and I did so <em>immediately</em>, without even thinking about it and even though I was busy doing my actual job. I played through a tedious review, and in my impatience I got something wrong and lost my last heart. I actually gasped in shock, while Duolingo immediately told me I could pay to keep playing, <em>which I am not going to do no matter how much it asks</em>. But now someone else is sitting above me on the leaderboards, and I am furious at them, even though I 100% do not actually care about this in any way.&nbsp;</p><p>Fuck you, Duolingo, and the five hours and 41 minutes until I idle my way into a heart to keep playing you. (<em>Playing?</em>) The most useful thing you’ve taught me so far is what a fucking rube I am, though also where to find the accent marks on my iPhone keyboard.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/tim-sweeney-epic-ceo-elon-musk-brainworms"><h3>Log Off, Tim Sweeney</h3></a><p>Again, if I had $5 billion you would never see or hear from me ever again</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/severance-theories-lumon-goats-clones-instagram-threads"><h3>Threads Won’t Stop Showing Me Dogshit Severance Theories</h3></a><p>"I think I know what Lumon does.

		<p>We’ve always been huge Futurlab fans here at TheSixthAxis, and it’s nice to have a bit of Thursday action from the team behind Velocity and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/powerwash-simulator">PowerWash Simulator</a>. For fans of spraying things down, bringing things up to a sheen and climbing on small footladders to see onto ledges, today is a good day, with the announcement of PowerWash Simulator 2, coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and PC in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="PowerWash Simulator 2 | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cFwqxoF7MwM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>First and foremost, all that soaking action will look better than ever, with an improved set of visuals, a whole new campaign and, of course, new locations and items for you to clean down. The new campaign will have you uncovering more of Muckingham’s mysteries, as well as have you visiting grime-coated locations like Sponge Valley, Power Falls and Lubri City.</p>
<p>There’s going to be a new home space – presumably you can clean this up too – and here you’ll be able to display awards and trinkets that you’ve gained while doing a hard days cleaning.</p>
<p>If that’s not enough, you can now share campaign progression online together for the first time, and in addition to online play, split-screen co-op will be available as well, meaning you can clean digital homes together, while neglecting your own.</p>


<p>We loved the original Powerwash Simulator, awarding it an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/08/22/powerwash-simulator-review/">8/10 for its original version</a>, and 9/10 for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/13/powerwash-simulator-vr-review/">excellent VR rendition</a>. Talking about the original we said, “PowerWash Simulator is a rare example of a game that more than lives up to its expectations. If the calming loop of the gameplay gets you then you’ll easily find hours of your life disappearing along with the dirt and grime. Add in some interesting challenge modes and a story that caught me by surprise and you have a game that more than deserves your time”. We then called the VR version, “the ultimate evolution of Futurlab’s astoundingly satisfying smash hit, effortlessly translating the calming clean ’em up to virtual reality.”</p>
<p>Futurlab have promised more details in April, so stay tuned to TheSixthAxis for all your PowerWash Simulator 2 news.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-shows-off-its-ever-shifting-deep-desert-map/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Funcom has published a new exploration trailer for the upcoming massive multiplayer survival game Dune Awakening. The video goes through the basic progression every character will have to go through after crash-landing on Arrakis: first, surviving, crafting a stillsuit, founding a home base, and making vehicles to roam the desert planet.</p>
<p>Eventually, players will venture to the biggest and most dangerous map, the Deep Desert. As <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-unveils-mmo-structure-and-overland-map-confirms-persistent-closed-beta-is-now-ongoing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> earlier by Game Director Joel Bylos, this huge map can house hundreds of players at once and is always PvP enabled.</p>
<p><em>The Deep Desert is this massive area, a minimum of 500 square kilometers. It's actually a bit larger than that. That's where you can meet hundreds of other players in Dune: Awakening. There is probably going to be a player cap if too many people go there, but it should be able to handle quite a lot of people, and that's a completely seamless set of servers that are all connected together.</em></p>
<p><em>It's generally a PVP map with a strip of PVE as people enter so that they can be safe when they come into the map and don't get ganked. The cool thing about the Deep Desert map is that we have this thing called the Coriolis Storm, which every week wipes the Deep Desert and sets it with a new landscape and new points of interest, so it's an infinitely explorable space and a really cool place to hang with your friends.</em></p>
<p>In today's trailer, Funcom also remarked that the Deep Desert map will reset every week, explained in-world by the massive Coriolis Storms, which will sweep over the map and change it. This also means Dune Awakening players will then get to explore as if it were new when it comes to its points of interest and resource nodes. It's even possible for explorer types of players to get in there just after the reset, survey the map, and then either share it with allies and clan members or sell it on the Exchange, the game's version of the traditional MMO-style auction house.</p>

<p>The Unreal Engine 5 powered game will launch on PC in a little over two months. Its benchmark and character creator tool are already <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-is-out-on-may-20-for-49-99-benchmark-and-character-creator-live-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available</a> on Steam, though.

Crikey, it's still looking rough out there in the industry at the moment, isn't it folks? Yesterday unfortunately brought the news that another online game is shutting down, with the studio alongside it. In this version of the story that we've heard all too often recently, it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spectre-divide">Spectre Divide</a>, a tactical free-to-play first-person shooter whose whole gimmick is that you control your own character and a clone, allowing you to switch between them on the fly.</p>
<p>It was certainly a fresh take on the genre, but our former reviews editor Ed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/spectre-divide-is-a-new-tactical-shooter-with-one-big-gimmick-controlling-two-bodies-at-once">did wonder if that was enough to set it apart from Valorant or Counter Strike</a>. As evidenced by developer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/mountaintop-studios">Mountaintop Studios</a>' imminent closure only six months after the game launched, it was not.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The studio shared the news on the official Spectre Divide X (formerly Twitter) account, with a lengthy message explaining that the game hasn't found enough growth in the two weeks since season 1 launched. Essentially, it all came down to the fact that there simply weren't enough players and revenue to "cover the day-to-day costs of Spectre and the studio." 
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
As of right now, Mountaintop expect to take Spectre offline sometime within the next 30 days, with new purchases now disabled, and if you've spent any money on the game since season 1 launched you'll be getting a refund too.
</p>
<p>
Mountaintop also noted that they did everything they could to keep the game going by bringing on a publisher, finding additional funding, or even getting themselves outright acquired. The post also points to some "tough stumbles" at Spectre Divide's launch that may have contributed to the closure. There was clearly some <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2641470/view/4570678714934677865?l=english">strong feedback early on in relation to the cost of things like weapons and characters</a>, which prompted the developer to apologise and make price cuts.</p>
<p>
Still, there's no denying that it's a bad time for live service projects like this, even if you do all the right things, and have a genuinely unique idea. Spectre Divide has at least fared better than Sony's paid hero shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hero-shooter-concord-taken-offline-as-sony-say-its-initial-launch-didnt-land-the-way-wed-intended">lasted a whole three weeks before being taken offline forever</a>. Here's hoping all the Mountaintop devs can land on their feet.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ea-skate-microtransactions-range-from-e5-e99-in-closed-alpha/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On Tuesday night, Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-adds-microtransactions-to-skates-closed-alpha/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was the first to report</a> of microtransactions being added to the closed alpha playtest of EA Skate. Now, just a couple days later, we have an idea at what EA is charging for their San Van Bucks (SVB) within the game.</p>



<p>Thanks to a Reddit user by the name of <a href="https://postimg.cc/gallery/CkGNDr3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">sm1one_out_there</a>, it appears that EA is charging users a range of €5-€99—the prices shared are in Euros, but the conversion for microtransactions is usually similar to USD, so expect $5-$99—for the in-game currency. </p>



<p>At €5, you get 500 SVB. At €9.99, that jumps to 1050 SVB including a 5% boost in the amount you receive. The rest of the options are as follows:</p>



<ul>
<li>€24.99 – 3,000 SVB</li>



<li>€49.99 – 6,250 SVB</li>



<li>€99.99 – 13,000 SVB</li>
</ul>



<p>Based on other images shown, as well as previously announced plans by EA, all of the microtransaction purchases go towards in-game cosmetics. There are no pay-to-win mechanics coming to EA Skate.</p>



<p>An example of item costs include 200 SVB for socks, 300 SVB for board art, and 400 SVB for a tank top.</p>



<p>It’s also worth noting that the microtransactions are currently only being added to PC and PlayStation players during the playtest. EA and Full Circle will also cease giving players “random grants of SVB” that it had been doing in prior playtests. </p>



<p>They also reaffirmed that “any SVB purchased will be credited back at Early Access launch” provided you are using the same EA account for both playtests and Early Access. Lastly, it was confirmed that items acquired during the playtest will also be reset at Early Access launch, but not during the playtest itself.</p>

We’re really excited to see players dust off their power washers and get stuck into this brand-new campaign, that brings you even more to clean, and even more ways to release the pressure.”</p><p>FuturLab chief operating officer Chris Mehers added, “We couldn’t be more thrilled to finally announce the sequel to one of our most successful titles.

Nintendo will open an official Nintendo store in San Francisco this May, and it's just the second Nintendo store in the United States. The other one is in Rockefeller Plaza in New York City.</p><p>The San Francisco store is located in the city's Union Square area at 331 Powell Street. The store will be stocked with Nintendo game consoles and games, along with accessories, apparel, home goods, and souvenirs that are only available at the San Francisco location.</p><p>It seems fans won't just be able to walk into the store when it opens on May 15. Nintendo said there will be "reservation requirements," and more details will be shared in the weeks ahead.</p><p>Fans can enter a sweepstakes for a chance to win a trip to the grand opening event for the Nintendo San Francisco store on May 15. The sweepstakes offers up a three-night, four-day trip for you and up to two guests.</p><p>The contest is open to US residents who are 18 or older. To enter, fans must have a Nintendo Account and can <a href="https://my.nintendo.com/rewards/0347dfdfd78e4195" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">redeem 10 Platinum Points to enter</a>, with a limit of five entries per person. The full terms and conditions can be found on <a href="https://my.nintendo.com/rewards/0347dfdfd78e4195" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo's website.</a></p><p>In 2021, Nintendo <a href="https://kotaku.com/sources-nintendo-shutters-california-office-1847966405" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">closed its San Francisco-based office in Redwood City</a>. Outside of the US, Nintendo has an official store in its home country of Japan, located in Tokyo.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 is expected to launch later this year, with a big reveal set for April 2. That's when fans can expect to learn more about the system and its games, like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">rumored Mario Kart 9. </a></p>
