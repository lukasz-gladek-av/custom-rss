			<p>A few hours ago, Rocksteady sent out an email newsletter to announce the release date and details for Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League Season 2.</p>
<p>The big addition is the playable new character Mrs. Freeze, also known as Nora Fries. She's an alternate version of Mr. Freeze, who is more commonly found in DC adaptations (including Batman Arkham City, where the Caped Crusader fights him in one of the boss battles). The newsletter did not go into further details on Mrs. Freeze's moveset, but the developers will likely do so shortly, given that Season 2 is coming to Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League next Thursday.</p>
<p>Episode 3, called Frozen Hearts, will add an Elseworlds Mayhem map, a Superman versus Flash Brainiac fight, an 'ever-changing' Metropolis,&nbsp;new Infamy sets and Notorious gear such as the Killer Frost Infamy set, Firefly Notorious, and Parasite Notorious Melee, and of course, a new Battle Pass.</p>
<p>Episode 4, called Winter, brings a Green Lantern versus Superman Brainiac fight, new incursions, new Infamy sets and Notorious gear such as the Captain Cold Infamy set, Icicle Notorious, and Trickster Notorious Melee, and new Shop items.</p>
<p>It does look like Rocksteady will keep its promise to deliver four seasons of post-launch content for the game despite its massive failure. As revealed by parent company Warner Bros., Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League <a href="https://wccftech.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-contributed-to-200-million-lower-ebitda-for-wb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">contributed</a> to a $200 million lower EBITDA compared to last year's outstanding performance bolstered by Hogwarts Legacy. The game was also panned by critics, including Wccftech's Nathan Birch, who <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">gave it just 5 out of 10</a>:</p>
<p><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League has a sprinkling of that classic Rocksteady charm, delivering polished visuals, fluid traversal and combat, and some snappy repartee, but the whole experience is bogged down by dreary, repetitive mission design, empty live service elements, and a feel-bad story that’s mean-spirited to the point of feeling oddly resentful.</em></p>
<p>The studio isn't at any risk of being shut down, though. According to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, it will be given the chance to return to what it does best: a single-player game. Meanwhile, some Rocksteady employees <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are helping on a Hogwarts Legacy Director's Cut</a>.</p>

<p>Fortnite has just announced the commencement of the <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1808863497897304138" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">All Sweat Summer</a>, during which players can embark on exclusive quests to earn unique summer-themed rewards. In addition, Fortnite has decided to implement significant changes to the Ranked Mode as part of the All Sweat test. </p>



<p>These changes are designed to immerse players in a tournament-like experience. Discover all the alterations to Fortnite’s Ranked mode below.&nbsp;</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-time-to-sweat">Time to Sweat</h2>



<p>The Fortnite Status account has announced a series of changes that will be implemented in Ranked Battle Royale and Zero Build between July 4 and July 18. Among these changes, all vehicles and vehicle items, including the upgraded boss cars, will be disabled. The unique and new weapon of Chapter 5, Season 3, the Nitro Fists, will also be disabled. </p>



<p>Lastly, players will no longer be able to hire characters, but enemy NPCs and Bosses with medallions will still be present. It’s time to bring out your competitive spirit, as Fortnite’s All Sweat Test for Ranked mode has begun. The development team will be closely monitoring player feedback during this time.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>During All Sweat Summer, Ranked Battle Royale and Zero Build will be switching things up a bit! From July 4 to July 18:</p><p>– Vehicles and vehicle items are disabled, including Boss Cars.<br>– Nitro Fists are also disabled.<br>– Characters are no longer Hireable, but hostile Characters… <a href="https://t.co/nLBFutgq7u">pic.twitter.com/nLBFutgq7u</a></p></div>— Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1808864035380601000?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 4, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>For those wondering, you don’t need to worry about the entire season being vaulted; these changes only arrive for Fortnite’s Ranked Modes. The standard Battle Royale and Zero Build Mode will still include all the elements introduced for Fortnite’s Chapter 5 Season 3, Wrecked. </p>



<p>This consists of the newly announced <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1808139084440736232" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Magneto mythic, </a>which allows players to defend themselves with a metal shield and shoot projectiles at other players, builds and vehicles to cause damage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nascar-integration-with-rocket-racing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nascar recently revealed a landmark integration </a>with Fortnite’s Rocket Racing Mode. Also, the official status account confirmed that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-pirates-of-the-caribbean/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pirates of the Caribbean collaboration will arrive on July 19</a>. What do you think about Fortnite’s Ranked Mode changes to make the game more sweaty? Let us know in the comments.&nbsp;</p>

This is what I do every time I hear that claim: I ask ChatGPT to draw a map of the United States.</p><p>Before I show you the image that ChatpGPT produced for me today after being given the prompt “use ascii art to draw a map of the United States,” I want you to imagine the contours of the United States in your mind. It’s July 4th, after all, a day when we celebrate America’s freedoms, such as … and … and who could forget …. You might not be able to remember all of the states names, but I can picture the Florida panhandle and the weird triangle part of Texas and the curvature of California. Hold that image in your head, and now scroll down.</p><hr><figure></figure><p>Is this a fluke? A one off? No. Here’s another response to this prompt that looks like a little dog.</p><figure></figure><p>Generative AI is stupid. It is not a thinking machine. Art is made by people who can see and interpret symbols, and then re-interpret them into new images. At the very least it is made by people who can picture the United States in their mind and draw a vague outline of it when prompted. All the rest is stunning AI spaghetti art.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You may have heard of the global craze for taiyaki inspired by the work <em><a title="Games > Kanon [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/kanon">Kanon</a></em>, but are you familiar with its original creator and head writer, Naoki Hisaya? I had the honor of being a sub-writer for that project. Naoki Hisaya started the trend of ‘<a title="Genres > Visual Novel [417 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/visual-novel">visual novel</a>s that make players cry,’ a pursuit that I have passionately followed for over 20 years. The pinnacle of this journey is <em>Heaven Burns Red</em>. Whereas Hisaya used sophisticated storytelling techniques to evoke tears, I took a rather direct approach, and that’s the essence of <em>Heaven Burns Red</em>. To think that this work would be released in places where he sparked the taiyaki craze—such a delightful coincidence feels like fate. We eagerly look forward to sharing <em>Heaven Burns Red</em> with you. Thank you.”</p><p>Jun Maeda, a Japanese writer and composer. He is considered a pioneer of visual novel and his notable works includes <em>AIR</em>, <em>CLANNAD</em>, <em>Little Busters!</em>, and <em>Angel Beats!</em>. </p></blockquote><p>Watch the western announcement trailer and a video message from Jun Maeda below.

It's a "deluxe collector grade figure with 42 points of articulation and 12 different accessories including multiple face plates and alternative hands." The figure will be released in August 2024, with preorders now available.</p><p>Coming soon after in The Shapes Collection is Kratos and Atreus from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-ragnarok-review">God of War Ragnarok</a>, Varl from Horizon Forbidden West, and Jin Sakai from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-review">Ghost of Tsushima</a>. These figures have between 24 and 34 points of articulation depending on the model, and two to four different accessories each.

"We made sure the many articulation points made sense and even the finest textural detail shows up on the figures."</p><p>Creative director at Ghost of Tsushima studio Sucker Punch Jason Connell chimed in too. "Jin’s Ghost armor has so many beautiful details, including intricate fabric patterns and overlapping armor plates that are integral to the design of his character," he said. "In addition to his katana, it’s also always important to us to see all of his various Ghost tools represented to capture his different fighting techniques."</p><p>PlayStation didn't reveal if further figures would be released down the road, but as these four just scratch the surface of its wealth of franchises, it's perhaps likely. Other potential figures could include Ellie from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-i-review">The Last Us</a>, Nathan Drake from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/11/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end-review">Uncharted</a>, Spider-Man from, well, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-2-review">Spider-Man</a>, and more.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/dragonballgames/status/1808863367324430671" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on X today, the official Dragon Ball Z: Kakarot account revealed that the game has now reached 8 million copies sold.</p>



<p>The team thanked players for their support in reaching the milestone. However, they also teased that “we hope you look forward to what’s coming next.” The devs did not confirm any clear details about this, but it could possibly signal future DLC. </p>



<p>The most recent DLC for the game was Goku’s Next Journey, which released in February 2024. It expanded beyond Kakarot’s main story, concentrating on material from the anime.</p>

			<p>Considering the vast amount of killing and death that takes place in many games, it’s rare to have any consideration of what happens afterwards. Other than technical discussions about whether enemy bodies remain visible or disappear to save on processing power, the fate of the dead generally remains unanswered. Well, Autopsy Simulator promises to change this and puts the cadaver front and centre. Or, at least that’s what the premise of the game suggests. As things stand, however, the game actually turns out to be a rather different kettle of fish.</p>
<p><iframe title="Autopsy Simulator | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/imJTlY8Tv-s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The simulator genre in general suggests an attempt to more or less accurately represent some kind of profession or activity, starting off with simple tutorials before developing in complexity and difficulty such games have encompassed everything from farming to power washing. Such an approach being applied to the messy but fascinating business of working a mortuary had my interest piqued. Things start off relatively well as the tutorial aspects are introduced through the fantastical in-game technique of your character filming lectures for prospective students. This beginning left me excited for the addition of more developed examples and looking forward to the training wheels being taken off. Unfortunately this never really happens and the five autopsies you carry out during the game are all strictly on rails.</p>



<p>Aesthetically, Autopsy Simulator is solid enough with effective graphics and audio. The interior of the bodies and associated organs are detailed and respond to your interventions with a grisly but realistic feeling of squishiness – obviously I’m not speaking from direct experience here! Voice acting is far more important here than I expected going in, but is functional rather than exceptional. This is a shame as what the game morphs into absolutely requires you to have sympathies for your player character. This is a game that follows the trend of ‘simulator’ games being infused with stories, and it becomes clear early on that you are mourning the loss of your late wife, which becomes the dominant motif throughout. While this could have made for an emotionally involving narrative, the execution is lacking.</p>

<p>Rather than a clinical but mechanically deep simulator or a genuinely creepy thriller that takes advantage of the natural unease created by the proximity of corpses in the game, Autopsy Simulator plays out as a pretty generic sad guy horror game with a twist ending that is as predictable as it is disappointing. A great deal of the game ends up with you wandering around areas finding the next interactive object to unlock the next section with no real puzzles or player involvement. As a result I found myself stuck between wanting the narrative parts to be over and finding the autopsies underwhelming and overly simplistic.</p>
<p>The elephant in the room is the inevitable comparisons and parallels to Mortuary Assistant – many people who enjoyed that game a couple years ago will be drawn toward Autopsy Simulator for the aesthetics and seeming tone alone, but they are very different experiences. Mortuary Assistant is much more a horror game than Autopsy Simulator, which feels much more like a hidden object game and walking sim set in and around the morgue.</p>

<p>All this being said, there are plans for an extra autopsy only mode which will be added as a free update in the future and if this is handled well then it might be worth revisiting what feels more like a proof of concept attached to a sophomoric thriller narrative than a full game. It is a real shame as the base mechanics for the actual autopsy sections, with the building blocks of possible puzzles to ascertain cause of death, have real potential. It’s just potential that is currently unfulfilled.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		I went into Autopsy Simulator with expectations and hopes for a game that confronted the messy realities of mortality and gave an insight into the neglected world of the mortuary. However, the game at present is so preoccupied with telling a hackneyed story that it is difficult to recommend. Hopefully the promised autopsy only mode will remedy this.	</p></div>

            <p>
Netflix's nascent plans to produce a Horizon Zero Dawn series are "no longer moving forward", it's claimed, following the publication of a <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/umbrella-academy-steve-blackman-abuse-allegations-1235047142/">Rolling Stone</a> report this week that detailed accusations of "bulling, manipulative and retaliatory behaviour" by its planned showrunner Steve Blackman. 
</p>
<p>
The report's allegations relate to Blackman's previous work for Netflix as showrunner on hit series The Umbrella Academy. Blackman has responded to the claims from 12 former colleagues and described them as "entirely untrue". 
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer contacted Netflix and PlayStation earlier this week following the report's publication but did not receive a response.

<p>
Now, an update by Rolling Stone senior reporter Cheyenne Roundtree, who penned the original scoop, has further claimed that Netflix is no longer working with Blackman on his two series in development - Horizon, and an original project named Orbital. 
</p>
<p>
Blackman's previous work includes screenwriting for TV series such as Bones, Altered Carbon and Fargo.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Scoop: Rolling Stone has learned that two of 'Umbrella Academy' showrunner Steve Blackman’s projects that were in development at Netflix, a Horizon Zero Dawn series and an original series, Orbital, are no longer moving forward <a href="https://t.co/cFnyww0n3Q">https://t.co/cFnyww0n3Q</a></p>— Cheyenne Roundtree (@cheyenne_round) <a href="https://twitter.com/cheyenne_round/status/1808627787953053814?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 3, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horizon-zero-dawn-netflix-project-in-development">Sony first announced plans for a Horizon Zero Dawn TV series</a> in 2022, as part of a big push for the majority of its biggest PlayStation franchises to get adaptations. 
</p>
<p>
Alongside HBO's hit The Last of Us series, currently shooting its second season, Sony has a Ghost of Tsushima movie and God of War Amazon Prime series in development, as well as its Twisted Metal TV show and Gran Turismo movie. 
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has again contacted Netflix and PlayStation today for clarity on whether the planned Horizon TV series has been ditched for good, or whether it will continue without Blackman's involvement.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-games-like-elder-scrolls-5-skyrim<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>There's nothing quite like the first time you explored Skyrim. From the moment you narrowly escape your grisly execution in Helgen and emerge into the legendary RPG's vast wilderness, it's an adventure that allows you to go anywhere and everywhere with no limitations, and it's this sense of sheer freedom that's had millions of players returning to its cold, untamed landscape for over a decade.</p><p>But after spending years exploring the many <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-elder-scrolls-5-skyrim-editions-in-order">different versions of Skyrim</a> that have been released, it's safe to say we're all looking for some new games to scratch that fantasy adventuring itch. So, to ease the wait until we get an official follow-up in the long-anticipated <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elder-scrolls-6-latest-news-trailers-rumors-release-date">Elder Scrolls 6</a>, we've compiled a list of some of the best games in the same vein as Skyrim that you can play right now.</p><h2>1. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</h2><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2007/03/06/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-20070306105525970-1926021.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>An obvious one to kick us off, but one of the best places you can go to get an experience similar in style and scope to Skyrim is <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</a>. The fourth game in Bethesda's landmark RPG series, Oblivion may be Skyrim's predecessor, but it still has all the components that made its younger sibling such a hit.</p><p>Casting you as a prisoner who finds themselves in the center of a conflict involving demonic gods, fiery doors to a hellish plain and the murder of Tamriel's emperor, you set forth across the land of Cyrodil on a daring adventure. Along the way, you're free to explore this realm however you see fit, completing quests, allying with factions and building your character with new skills, weapons, armor sets, spells and more.</p><p>Simply put, it's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-games-in-order">more Elder Scrolls</a>, and a great way to continue your journey through Tamriel while you wait for Elder Scrolls 6. As for where and how you can play it, it's available on PC and can be played through the Xbox Series X | S and Xbox One's backwards compatibility feature.</p><h2>2. The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2020/10/26/01-tloz-botw-1603741775621.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The poster child of the Nintendo Switch and one of the best fantasy RPGs ever made, you really can't go wrong with <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>. Nintendo's acclaimed reinvention of its seminal series really has it all: a secret-filled open world to explore, a range of physics-based systems that you can toy with to battle enemies and navigate precarious terrain, phenomenal quests, a stunning art style, and much, much more.</p><p>Breath of the Wild is a game that never holds your hand. It lets you loose into a fully explorable Hyrule, sets you up with some essential tools and, from there, you're free to do what you please. Whether you want to scour the land for lore tidbits, climb to the peak of the tallest mountain or even <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/How_to_Get_to_the_Final_Boss_Early">head straight into the final boss room</a>, everything is available to you from the moment you make your descent from the Great Plateau.</p><p>It gives you the reins and lets you do whatever you see fit. If you're looking for a game that has the same freedom and unguided exploration that makes Skyrim so compelling, Breath of the Wild is a perfect substitute. It's available exclusively on Nintendo Switch. You can also jump straight the sequel, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, but you'll get a similar experience.</p><h2><strong>3. Dragon's Dogma 2</strong></h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/03/20/dragonsdogma2-performancereview-blogroll-1710963891870.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>One of the more recent releases on our list, if you're looking for a big, sprawling RPG that puts exploration at the forefront, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragons-dogma-ii">Dragon's Dogma 2</a> could be a great pick. Spread across two realms, Vermund and Battahl, Dragon's Dogma 2 drops players into the boots of The Arisen: a player-created warrior whose heart has been stolen by an ancient dragon.</p><p>Tasked with finding and killing this dragon, they embark on a quest across a vast, untamed world. Much like Skyrim, the true draw of Dragon's Dogma 2 is its heavy focus on exploration. Its world is full of secrets to uncover, and with monsters patrolling every inch of its map, you'll quickly amass organic stories as you clash with colossal foes and survive dangerous encounters by the skin of your teeth.</p><p>It's also a deep RPG with various classes to master, a wide range of weapon types and armor sets, and a <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/dragons-dogma-2-how-pawns-vocations-portcrystals-and-more-work">unique party system</a> where you can recruit allies created by other players. All in all, it's sure to satiate those hungry for a massive fantasy RPG on the scale of Skyrim. It's available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and PC.</p><h2>4. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</h2><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2014/10/03/thewitcher3-wildhuntvarioustypesofenemiesrequiredifferentapproachpng-47df44.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>In the pantheon of 100-plus hour RPGs, Geralt's quest to stop the Wild Hunt in <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> is a top-shelf pick. Set in a morbid, Slavic-mythology-inspired world of monsters, magic and shady politics, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is often lorded as one of the best RPGs ever made and for good reason. It boasts a giant open world filled with difficult battles, morally gray choices that affect the outcome of quests and an engrossing story to follow.</p><p>You play as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/first-official-look-at-liam-hemsworths-geralt-of-rivia-in-the-witcher-season-4">Geralt</a>: a gruff, white-haired, yellow-eyed mercenary searching for his surrogate daughter, Ciri. His quest will take him on a perilous journey, where he'll face mythical monsters and evade the ever-present threat of the spectral warriors known as the Wild Hunt.</p><p>Much like Skyrim, The Witcher 3 sets you up with the basics and then releases you into a lore-rich fantasy world untethered. Whether you want to live the bounty hunter lifestyle, taking on contracts to kill monsters while ignoring the main quest, or face the Wild Hunt head-on by following its supremely well-written story, it puts the control in your hands. The base game and its <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/25/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-blood-and-wine-review">two sizable DLCs</a> are well worth a playthrough once you've conquered everything Skyrim has to offer. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt is available on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch and PC.</p><h2>5. Kingdom Come: Deliverance</h2><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2016/09/29/onq3g6qx9screenshot13pineforrestfightjpg-fe1708.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Moving away from high-concept fantasy and into the more grounded world of a realistic medieval epic, another game that manages to capture the sense of unbridled freedom Skyrim offers is <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance">Kingdom Come: Deliverance</a>. Quickly becoming a cult hit when it launched in 2018, Kingdom Come: Deliverance tells the tale of a blacksmith's son on a quest for revenge.</p><p>Set in Bohemia in the 15th Century, the story follows an apprentice named Henry living in a small village. After his parents are brutally murdered during a Cuman invasion, Henry is forced to flee, entering the service of Lord Hanush of Leipa and pursuing the men who killed his parents. From here, the game lets you loose on a giant open world complete with authentic medieval locations to explore, a range of open-ended quests which react to your decisions and an intricate battle system to master.</p><p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance is an experience that focuses on immersion, from its high-stakes battles to its range of survival mechanics, which task you with managing everything from food and sleep to your hygiene and armor degradation. If you're looking for something a little more involved than Skyrim or an RPG with a more grounded setting, Kingdom Come: Deliverance is definitely worth a look. It's currently available on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch and PC.</p><h2>6. Elden Ring</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/14/elden-ring-erdtree-promo-1718370675412.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>One for fans of a challenge, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> is a punishing game, but one that's more than worth the blood, sweat and tears it takes to roll credits. FromSoftware's latest serving of bleak RPG goodness is simply one of the most gratifying RPGs ever made, and that's not just because beating some of its most challenging bosses makes you feel like you've just gone 12 rounds with Mike Tyson.</p><p>Elden Ring just fundamentally masters the art of exploration, from hiding routes to brand new areas off the beaten path to burying useful rewards for those who choose to search every nook and cranny. No area is meaningless; no detour is fruitless. It makes you feel like you're charting your path across a living, breathing world. A dying world that takes pleasure in crushing you beneath its boot, definitely, but one that rewards your curiosity all the same.</p><p>With the game's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-dlc-review">Shadow of the Erdtree expansion</a> now available, there's never been a better time to play. So if you've finished Skyrim, are looking for a new world to explore and don't mind getting eviscerated by a giant lobster or two, The Lands Between could be worth a visit. Elden Ring is available on PlayStation, Xbox and PC.</p><h2>7. Fallout 4</h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2015/06/15/fallout4e3cityvista1434323956png-b57731.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Granted, it's the furthest thing from a fantasy RPG, but if you're done with Skyrim and want something that shares its design philosophies, Bethesda's work on <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> naturally has a lot in common with The Elder Scrolls series. It's a massive open-world RPG that focuses on letting you build a unique character, explore sprawling environments and complete quests. The major difference is that you'll be shooting big green mutant abominations while listening to alternate-history corporate propaganda instead of casting spells at mud crabs.</p><p>Taking the series to Boston, Fallout 4 sees a new vault dweller, known as the Sole Survivor, embark on a mission to save their kidnapped son from a mysterious faction known as The Institute. Much like Skyrim, that mission is just one of the many objectives scattered throughout the Wasteland, and you'll be able to explore freely without an invisible hand guiding you down any single path. It's a great way to get an experience that shares the same DNA as Skyrim with a post-apocalyptic twist. Fallout 4 is playable on PlayStation, Xbox and PC and remains one of the best <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-bethesda-games-in-order">Bethesda games available</a>.</p><h2>8. Dragon Age: Inquisition</h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2015/03/23/explorationjpg-dfed36.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Bioware's most recent take on the sprawling fantasy RPG, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a> is another big ol' fantasy RPG that offers over 80 hours of gameplay to sink your teeth into. Tasking you with saving the realm of Thedas from mysterious rifts opening in the sky, you'll lead a faction known as The Inquisition as you explore a series of massive open-world maps, defeat monsters and uncover a new Dragon Age story.</p><p>Much like Skyrim, Inquisition allows you to build a character, pick their class and race, and then set forth on your adventure. As you journey through the game's various worlds, you'll add new party members to the Inquisition while completing a range of quests and making choices that affect the story, your keep and Thedas as a whole.</p><p>In essence, it's another meaty fantasy RPG to play after you've wrapped up Skyrim, and there's never been a better time to get stuck in, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/veilguard-the-first-dragon-age-game-where-the-combats-actually-fun-former-exec-producer-says">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> slate to launch later this year. Dragon Age: Inquisition is available on PlayStation, Xbox and PC.</p><h2>9. Baldur's Gate 3</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/08/03/baldursgate3-reviewinprogress-blogroll-1691011267515-1691093584397.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>On a gameplay front, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and Skyrim don't share much in common. Baldur's Gate is a top-down CRPG that focuses on strategic fights, carefully constructing a party of characters with complementary abilities, and completing quests by using your chosen party's list of stats and skills.</p><p>However, Baldur's Gate 3 is arguably one of the best introductions to CDRPGs out there, and a must-play for those who enjoy a big, expansive fantasy RPG like Skyrim. Its world is a carefully curated expanse of tactical combat, engrossing storylines and outstanding quests, the latter of which react and evolve to your choices, leading to a playthrough that feels distinctly tailored to you. But the biggest boon of all is how it freely allows you to play your way.</p><p>From giving you the option to mix and match a mind-boggling number of classes, races, backstories and more in the character creation screen to giving you free rein with how you approach and complete quests, Baldur's Gate 3 encourages you to experiment and tinker with its systems to your heart's content. If you liked how Skyrim never pointed you in a direction or forced you down a set path, Baldur's Gate 3 is going to be a game you get along with. It's available on PlayStation, Xbox and PC.</p><h2>10. Kingdoms of Amalur: Re-Reckoning</h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2010/07/22/kingdoms-of-amalur-reckoning-20100722022612210-3267698.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>A cult classic brought back to life through its 2020 remaster, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdoms-of-amalur-re-reckoning">Kingdoms of Amalur</a> is a great pick for those who've wrapped up their time with Skyrim and are looking for a new fantasy RPG with fun combat, a huge world and plenty of quests to complete. The story takes place in the world of Amalur, with the player taking on the role of the Fateless One: a corpse brought back to life by the Well of Souls, severing them from fate.</p><p>After waking in a pile of bodies, they embark across a realm known as the Faelands in hopes of stopping a destructive force fated to eradicate Amalur's people. Along the way, you'll be able to build your character, pick a class and freely explore the Faelands, completing quests, delving into dungeons and bringing down formidable threats. It's available on PC, PlayStation, Xbox and Switch.</p><h2>11. The Forgotten City</h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2019/03/11/the-forgotten-city-2-1552339912221.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-forgotten-city">The Forgotten City</a> is a unique entry on this list because it actually <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-forgotten-city-interview-nick-pearce">started its life as a Skyrim mod</a>. However, it doesn't take long to see why it was given the full game treatment. The Forgotten City's story starts in modern-day Italy, as you wake on an island and discover you were brought to shore by a mysterious woman. After a brief conversation, you search a strange ruin in the center of the island and, somehow, are transported back in time to Ancient Rome.</p><p>It's a killer set-up, but it only becomes more compelling when you realize this city is stuck in an eternal time loop, and whenever a mysterious law known as the "Golden Rule" is broken, the loop resets. From here, the Forgotten City takes the base fundamentals of Skyrim and uses them to craft a completely different type of experience. The Forgotten City is, at its core, a detective game; one that tasks you with talking to citizens, learning more about the Golden Rule and uncovering clues to solve its underlying mystery. It's almost entirely devoid of combat, and that makes for a game that somehow doesn't feel like Skyrim at all while retaining the game's inherent DNA.</p><p>If you're looking for something akin to Skyrim that plays with the formula and tries something wholly different, The Forgotten City is more than worth a look. It's available on PC, PlayStation, Xbox and Switch</p><p>.</p><h2>12. Outward: Definitive Edition</h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/02/17/screen-outward---hyena-in-purple-grass-1487296598839.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Another one for the fans of a hardcore adventure, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/outward-definitive-edition">Outward</a> is an RPG that casts players as a regular, everyday person instead of some prophecised warrior fated to save the world. Their initial task is simple. Pay off a debt hanging above their head within five days. However, it quickly spins into a large-scale open-world epic, as the player crosses the land of Aurai, faces tough threats and contends with the elements to survive.</p><p>What sets <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/outward-wants-to-be-a-more-realistic-fantasy-rpg">Outward apart is its focus on realism and consequence</a>. It includes various survival systems, which force the player to contend with hunger, sleep and the harsh environment around them, while quests and other objectives can fail if they aren't attended to in time. There's no fast travel in Outward and, in the place of a standard respawn system, you cannot die, instead triggering random events that move you around the map.</p><p>In short, it's a game with a ton of interesting systems, and one that's well worth a look if you're searching for Skyrim's sense of open-world exploration with a few twists to keep things interesting. Outward is available on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch and PC.</p><h2>13. The Elder Scrolls Online</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/09/elder-scrolls-1717956044502.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Another obvious one, but if you're ready to move on from Skyrim, why not continue your Elder Scrolls experience with a few friends? As the name suggests, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-online">The Elder Scrolls Online</a> is an MMO take on the series, allowing you to visit various realms across Tamriel while completing a laundry list of new quests.</p><p>From Skyrim and Cyrodil to Morrowind and Highrock, there are a lot of returning locations for longtime fans of the series, as well as some brand new locales to explore, including the Khajit homeland of Elsweyr and the High Elves' home of Summerset. Along the way you can tag along with other players, bringing down enemies, completing missions and building your own unique characters.</p><p>If you've exhausted everything Skyrim has to offer and want more Elder Scrolls, The Elder Scrolls Online is a surefire bet, especially as the game has been updated with a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-games-in-order">multitude of DLCs</a> over the years. The Elder Scrolls Online is available on PlayStation, Xbox and PC.</p><p><em>Callum Williams is a  freelance media writer with years of experience as a game critic, news reporter, guides writer and features writer.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Nintendo has run out of spare parts worldwide.</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
Nintendo will no longer repair your Wii U anywhere in the world, the company has today said.
</p>
<p>
The Japanese repair service for Wii U had still been running until this week, following the closure of customer service for the console elsewhere. But, as of yesterday, 3rd July, the company has now officially run out of spare parts. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's <a href="https://twitter.com/nintendo_cs/status/1808707230377914724">confirmation</a> today via social media marks another closed chapter for Wii U, the company's unloved and underselling console that preceded Nintendo Switch. In total, Wii U shifted 13m consoles. At the last count, Switch had sold 141m.

<p>
Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-nintendos-wii-u-and-3ds-eshop-stores-will-close-on-monday">Nintendo shuttered the Wii U's eShop</a>, meaning owners could no longer buy digital games. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-3ds-and-wii-u-online-play-shuts-down-next-week">Nintendo also pulled the plug on Wii U's online servers</a>, rendering online multiplayer impossible.
</p>
<p>
For now, you can still download previously-purchased games and receive game updates.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/after-years-in-development-hell-ubisofts-watch-dogs-movie-finally-begins-shooting<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Nearly decade after its first announcement, Ubisoft's Watch Dogs movie has finally begun filming. 
</p>
<p>
An <a href="https://twitter.com/Ubisoft/status/1808540050046484836">update</a> from the Assassin's Creed and Far Cry publisher on social media last night showed a set photo with the caption: "Lights_Camera_Action.exe". 
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft has kept details of the film's plot close to its chest, and for years there seemed little movement on its plans to adapt its hacking-focused high-tech open-world franchise for the big screen. 
</p>

<p>
But, earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-watch-dogs-is-the-latest-game-series-to-get-the-live-action-movie-treatment">things appeared to finally get moving with a report via Deadline</a> that the project would be helmed by director Mathieu Turi (currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-plague-tale-is-being-turned-into-a-tv-series">adapting A Plague Tale for television</a>), working from a screenplay by Christie LeBlanc - the writer behind Netflix's 2021 French sci-fi thriller Oxygen.
</p>
<p>
Talk to Me actor Sophie Wilde was said to be in talks to star.
</p>
<p>
Last month, a further report by <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/06/hunger-games-tom-blyth-sophie-wilde-watch-dogs-movie-1235958776/">Deadline</a> appeared to confirm Wilde's involvement and additionally noted that Hunger Games prequel movie star Tom Blyth was also attached. 
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Ubisoft's official photo does indeed show Turi's name, proving that report correct. 
</p>
<p>
It's unclear whether this Watch Dogs film will be an original tale or based on any of the three main Watch Dogs games released so far: the gritty Chicago-set original starring gruff hacker Aiden Pearce, the sunnier San Francisco-set sequel starring the youthful Marcus Holloway, or the grim post-Brexit London-set Watch Dogs Legion, launched in 2020. 
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft finally getting the project going now is also somewhat ironic, seeing as no new games in the franchise appear to currently be in development. For now, the series seems to be getting a rest following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/watch-dogs-legion-review-a-bleak-and-buggy-retread-of-ubisofts-formula">mixed response to Legion</a>.

The article adds that a representative for Blackman says he “continues to work on new projects” with Netflix, and that he had “signed a new multi-year deal earlier this year.” However, the respondent didn’t mention <em>Horizon</em>. Netflix, apparently, continued to decline to comment on the story.</p><p>Given there has been no information on <em>Horizon</em>’s TV adaptation since 2022, it seems relatively likely it would still have been in pre-production, whatever its fate now. Still, it would make for the most fantastic show, so here’s hoping it can be picked up and run with by someone worthy of the franchise.<br></p><p><strong>Updated: 07/04/2024, 11:14 a.m. ET:</strong> Updated the post above to remove confusion over whether the shows were continuing without Blackman, or not continuing at all.

<p>One of the most interesting characters in Zenless Zone Zero straight off the bat, thanks to the dual revolvers and black face plate, is Billy Kid. It makes sense that HoYoverse fans would take to him immediately. But who is the Billy Kid voice actor? They’re fantastic!</p>



<h2 id="h-who-is-billy-kid-s-english-voice-actor">Who is Billy Kid’s English Voice Actor?</h2>



<p>Believe it or not, the character has two voice actors: Chen Runqiu (Chinese) and Hayashi Yu (Japanese). There is no specific English voice actor currently credited with the role of Billy Kid in Zenless Zone Zero. As such, we suspect it’s Hayashi Yu tackling the English voicework, too, but that’s a guess at this time.</p>

<h2 id="h-who-is-billy-kid">Who is Billy Kid?</h2>



<p>Billy Kid is one of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-playable-characters-zenless-zone-zero/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many playable characters</a> in Zenless Zone Zero. He’s an A-rank agent with a focus on Physical Damage and an Attack playstyle, making him a sound choice for new players upon unlocking the man.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“The Starlight Knights never lose!” — Billy Kid</p>



<p>This handsome cyborg with a cool and carefree personality is an avid fan of the Starlight Knight show, not only referring to himself as one of the Starlight Knights, but repeating many classic lines from the show.</p>



<p>He may look unreliable, but once he gets serious, Billy can take on any challenge…</p>



<p>He seems carefree, but his strength can be relied on..</p>

<p>In the latest update for Escape from Tarkov, Battlestate Games has tweaked PvE in the right fashion, allowing users playing solo to run the game locally as opposed to connecting to a server. That means that matches will now load in a matter of seconds – but there are a few caveats to that deal. </p>



<p>Firstly, you can’t play as a group offline (obviously), nor can you run a Scav offline. Also, if you want to play offline Streets of Tarkov on PvE, you’re out of luck – that still requires you to connect to a centralised server. It’s still a good change, though.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-clever-bots">Clever Bots</h2>



<p>Battlestate Games revealed that the AI has received a monumental boost in PvE, with both PMC and Scav characters becoming more meaningful in their movements and adopting a little more intelligence.</p>



<p>For instance, AI PMCs will now actively seek out loot, diving into dense areas and procuring items, prioritising high-value loot and replacing their loadout with more valuable items as they go. That means that you can predict their movements a little better and get potentially bigger rewards when you kill them. Be warned, though – they’ll be more prone to setting up ambushes in high-value areas like Shoreline’s Resort region.</p>



<p>Furthermore, AI PMCs can also extract from the map if a) they’re done looting, or b) enough time has elapsed since they spawned. They’ll move more tactically across the map towards their chosen extract, making it feel much more like a ‘normal game’ of Escape from Tarkov. It does mean you’ll need to keep your head on a swivel when you approach extract points, though.</p>



<p>Scavs are the same – the latest tweaks have made it so that they too will roam around the map looking for loot, but according to BSG, they’re ‘less picky’ than PMC characters.</p>



<p>It’s tough to tell <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/303" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">if these changes</a> will make PvE ‘harder’, but it’s almost certain that they will. BSG loves introducing fresh challenges to the world of Tarkov, and this latest update is no different.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, players can now throw on freshly created outfits, purchase the ‘Lega’ medals, and even wipe their PvE profile if they have the desire to do so. BSG has balanced a range of spawns, fixed some bugs, and added new feedback forms in the game – fill them out and you’ll be rewarded.</p>



<p>All in all, it’s another day at the office for Tarkov players.</p>
