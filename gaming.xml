            <p>Two-thirds of female players still report being harassed when playing online.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://news.sky.com/story/why-gaming-still-has-a-women-problem-13210551">report</a> entitled "Why gaming still has a women problem", Sky News reflected on the propensity of misogyny and hatred against women in gaming spaces, particularly on Discord and in multiplayer games.</p>

<p>In primary research conducted for the report, tech journalist Mickey Carroll said she was harassed and called a host of slurs simply because her "profile picture showed that [she] was clearly a woman".</p>
<p>After receiving abuse on Discord "within seconds", Carroll asked the abuser to justify their position. In response, the male gamer said:</p>
<p>"You're female. You're a filthy female. We don't like females, we like men in here. You're a slag. You know that, right? Because you're a fucking female, all females are slags, and you're expired. You're a slag on the streets, bruv. Bro, she's a nonce, she's a paedophile, she's a nonce, she loves kids."</p>
<p>The research – conducted by Bryter's Jenny McBean – found abuse typically starts off as "sexist comments", "but it often escalates into something more threatening; rape threats, male gamers saying, 'I'm going to find out where you live, attack your family and attack you'."</p>
<p>Of the "around a thousand" female gamers polled across the UK and US, 72 percent reported experiences of online toxicity in 2022, but this fell to 65 percent in 2023.</p>
<p>"It's the first positive shift that we saw [since research began in 2019]. It's actually reduced to 65 percent, which is a significant decrease," McBean explained.</p>
<p>"It's great, but we can't just assume everything's fine now. It's still two in three women."</p>
<p>Despite the fall in harassment, 20 percent of women gamers who responded to the survey said they simply choose not to play online due to potential harassment. One in 10 have been threatened with rape.</p>
<p>19-year-old French esports professional Mathilde conurred, saying: "Being a woman in gaming is "scary. You need to have confidence in yourself… if someone jumps on me, I will jump back."</p>
<p>Stephanie Ijoma says she founded the diversity and inclusion agency NNESAGA in order to dismantle "a system that was against us, and we are doing it".</p>
<p>"I'm a Black woman and Black women in this space are subject to more abuse than anyone else," Ijoma said.</p>
<p>Discord told Sky News it takes "immediate action" when harassment is reported, insisting "safety is integrated into every aspect" of its service, including "use a mix of proactive and reactive tools".</p>
<p><em><strong>If you have experienced this kind of abuse and are in need support, the </strong></em><a href="https://www.cybersmile.org/"><em><strong>Cybersmile Foundation</strong></em></a><em><strong> has dedicated tools, including a global support service, to help people deal with abuse in gaming. </strong></em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/someone-made-an-animated-version-of-the-minecraft-movie-trailer-and-it%E2%80%99s-so-much-better.975306/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-movie-trailer-animation/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Following the lackluster reception of the Minecraft movie trailer earlier this week, one animator has animated the entire trailer, and it’s so much better.</p>



<p>The animation is by 3D artist and animator <a href="https://x.com/Alumio_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@Alumio_</a>, who has since seen his trailer animation go viral on X (formerly Twitter). At the time of writing, the tweet had been up for just five hours and had already received 140,000 likes, which matches the original trailer uploaded by Minecraft themselves. You can watch the animated Minecraft trailer below:</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>What’s more impressive is that the animation only took Alumio a few days.</p>



<p>The Minecraft movie has a preliminary budget of $150 million and features the likes of Jason Momoa and Jack Black (who doesn’t look anything like Steve in the trailer, but just Jack Black with a blue shirt, but whatever).</p>



<p>The animated trailer seems to be connecting better with audiences, and although it’s unclear how successful the movie will be, it would be awesome to see a fully animated film in the future. The original Minecraft movie trailer uploaded to YouTube has already generated over one million dislikes, so it’s safe to say that fans of the game are not particularly happy about the movie’s direction.</p>



<p>Minecraft, the movie, is set to launch in theatres on April 4, 2025. </p>



<p>What do you think of the trailer animation? Do you think the movie will be a success? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/peterbot-and-pollo-blow-150-point-lead-in-fortnite-globals/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The competition at the Fortnite Global Championship 2024 event has been absolutely insane, with some of the biggest names in Fortnite competing against each other under one roof in Texas. After gaining a 147-point lead yesterday, Peterbot and Pollo have officially dropped to second place.</p>



<p>Th0masHD and Queasy now take first place with a whopping 485 points, putting them well ahead of Peterbot and Pollo during Fortnite Globals.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-th0mashd-win-his-first-fncs">Will Th0masHD Win His First FNCS?</h2>



<p>Do not underestimate a duo like Th0masHD and Queasy. With both of the player’s crazy Fortnite history, these are two competitors you do not want to run into on the battlefield. Th0masHD, however, for how long he has been competing in Fortnite, has never had an FNCS win.</p>



<p>Now, being so far ahead of second place, this could actually be the day Th0masHD walks out a victor. But do not forget about Queasy, though, as the competitor, who used to duo with Veno, has been absolutely crushing the competition.</p>



<p>So, will today be history made for the duo?</p>



<h2 id="h-peterbot-and-pollo-throw-2-games-in-a-row-during-fortnite-globals">Peterbot And Pollo Throw 2 Games In A Row During Fortnite Globals</h2>



<p>Starting the day off, both Pollo and Peterbot talked a big game, claiming they were the best duo in the world. That momentum, however, was short-lived, as the two barely managed to grab any placement points during the first two games of today’s competition.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In fact, during game number eight of day two of Fortnite Globals, the team found themselves back in the lobby quite early, as the duo was pushed heavily in the storm earlier on. Sadly, after Peterbot accidentally closed off his downed teammate with a reinforced wall, the duo went down. </p>



<p>Still, with the 1.5x point-multiplier system coming into play today, we could see Peterbot and Pollo grab first place back for themselves.</p>

            <p>Director John Garvin says it's "kinda sad" that the leading man of his <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> game has been "reduced to a cartoon shill" by an image posted by his former studio, Bend.</p>

<p>Garvin said, "[Deacon] has been reduced to promoting other games", adding: "Well done Bend Studio! Way to protect your legacy!"</p>
<p>When someone in his comments suggested that he "calm down my brotha", Garvin said: "Haha, I see my character reduced to a cartoon schill [sic] promoting some small game and I'm being harsh? Sit down, my brotha, adults are talking".</p> <div>

<p>We all already know Astro Bot has a lot of bots, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-has-lots-of-bots-but-concept-arts-got-those-that-are-not">but what bots has Astro Bot not got</a>?</p>
<p>Eurogamer just awarded <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-review">Astro Bot a sparkling five out of five stars</a>.</p>
<p>"When it's all done I'm left with that strange feeling of being very well cared for. I've seen a bunch of wild sights. I've messed around with cool gadgets, used the controller in unusual ways, tilting it, yes, but also blowing into it, trying to read the buried hieroglyphs of its rumble, I've ticked boxes, collected things, unlocked things, nodded at references that make me feel old, or sharp-eyed, or generally in the know," Donlan wrote.</p>
<p>"But when I close my eyes, I see the tumbling fruit, the hundreds and thousands, the gems stacked so high I can kick through them as if I'm wading through autumn leaves. I think, more than anything, of all the glorious bits and pieces."</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">Star Wars Outlaws</a> director Julian Gerighty has confirmed a patch is coming "maybe in 10 days" to address the game's "unfair" and "incredibly punishing" insta-fail stealth sequences.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/star-wars-outlaws-director-agrees-the-early-instant-fail-stealth-missions-are-incredibly-punishing-and-ubisoft-is-easing-the-pain-with-a-patch-coming-maybe-in-10-days/">GamesRadar+</a>, Gerighty admitted that whilst the team had intentionally designed the sequence to build "tension", it "just [didn't] want it to feel unfair. And today, I think it feels unfair".</p>
<p>"This is more of something that crept in in the last week or so and that we're correcting already for a patch that's coming out maybe in 10 days," he added.</p>

<p>"So especially, I mean, you're probably thinking of one of the early missions in Mirogana, which is incredibly punishing," Gerighty said.</p>
<p>"And for me, that is a mistake, and this is something that we're going to work on improving.</p>
<p>"I don't think it means removing the fail state completely, but I do think there are millions of low-hanging fruits where we can make it so much more enjoyable and understandable."</p>
<p>Gerighty also confirmed that the team was on the lookout for other "blockers" that prevent players from "enjoying the game", revealing that Ubisoft will "tweak the narrative context" - such as, for example, adding additional PA announcements that better contextualise what's happening - "so that we can get people to enjoy those moments as much as possible". </p>
<p>"Star Wars Outlaws [...] feels like it's blagging it - much as Kay can, when regularly caught out by some far more worldly syndicate boss," We wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-star-wars-outlaws-pushes-the-latest-pc-technologies-hard-and-the-results-are-stunning">Eurogamer's Star Wars Outlaws review</a>, in which we gave the game two out of five stars.</p>
<p>"The result is a series of quite painful comparisons: it lacks the branching, open stealth of an Arkham game, the systemic options of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> or the incisive, relentlessly satisfying speed of picking enemies off in Assassin's Creed. It lacks the linear polish and charisma of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/uncharted">Uncharted</a>. Lacks the animation flow to its yellow-ledge platforming next to a Horizon, or the sheer joy of taking platforming and making it into an actual game in itself, as in Star Wars Jedi."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Delta Force has taken the first-person shooter by storm these past few months, with players praising the game for being “what Battlefield 2042 should have been”. </p>



<p>In addition to the console version of the game, the developers also confirmed that a kill-cam feature is in development, as well as content variations for some of its modes and maps. This includes a night mode for its Hazard Ops extraction game mode, where players will be required to use Night Vision goggles during gameplay.</p>



<p>Delta Force is a free-to-play first-person shooter scheduled to release in early access on Steam sometime in Q4 2024. The console versions will come in Q1 2025.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s average 30-day player count on Steam has dropped to its lowest level in the series' history.</p>
<p>Whilst participation in live-service games inevitably waxes and wanes - and these figures do not account for players on console - it's nonetheless an unwelcomed milestone for Bungie's beleaguered sci-fi shooter.</p>

<p>Despite launching Episodes, the three-part, self-contained seasons that kicked off in The Final Shape's shadow back in June, <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/1085660">Steam Charts</a> suggests the game is averaging just 31,300 players over the last 30 days – the lowest number ever recorded since Destiny launched on Steam back in 2019.</p>
<p>That's down 75 percent since June, when Destiny 2's final expansion, The Final Shape, launched.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://thegamepost.com/destiny-2-lowest-player-count-franchises-history/">TheGamePost</a>, that's less than half the number of players Destiny 2 boasted three months after The Witch Queen and Lightfall released in 2022 and 2023, respectively.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-acknowledges-uncertainty-surrounding-the-future-of-destiny-following-layoffs">Bungie recently issued a statement acknowledging concern over the future of its decade-old sci-fi franchise</a> following "recent changes" at the studio.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">Sweeping layoffs saw 220 Bungie staff out of a job</a>, less than a year after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-developer-bungie-latest-playstation-studio-to-be-hit-by-layoffs">further 100 employees were let go last October</a>. A further 155 Bungie staff are also departing the studio for roles within parent company PlayStation.</p>
<p>In response, Bungie has now said it remains "committed" to Destiny, though details of what's next remain thin on the ground. There's also no mention of the departures of key Destiny creatives Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy, who were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-destiny-project-payback-no-longer-happening-senior-execs-depart">reportedly developing a now-cancelled Destiny spin-off named Payback</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"I was recently contacted by my publishers on behalf of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> [regarding] the possibility of using [1983 hit] Temptation on the new Grand Theft Auto 6," Ware wrote.</p>
<p>"Naturally excited about the immense wealth that was about to head my way, I scrolled to the bottom of the email [regarding] the offer…"</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>IT WAS $7500 - for a buyout of any future royalties from the game - forever…</p><p>To put this in context, Grand Theft Auto 6 grossed, wait for it…</p><p>$8.6 BILLION</p><p>Ah, but think of the exposure…</p><p>Go fuck yourself</p></div>— Martyn Ware 🦉 (@martynware) <a href="https://twitter.com/martynware/status/1832360366464008543?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 7, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>"IT WAS $7500 - for a buyout of any future royalties from the game - forever…" Ware added in a follow-up tweet.</p>
<p>"To put this in context, Grand Theft Auto 6 [sic] grossed, wait for it… $8.6 BILLION.</p>
<p>"Ah, but think of the exposure…," he added, before signing off with: "Go fuck yourself".</p>
<p>When pressed in his comments that he'd "fucked up" by turning down such an opportunity and "long-term win", he responded:</p>
<p>"I haven't 'fucked up'. I've worked in artist rights advocacy for 20 years. I know the game. This [is] iniquitous."</p>
<p>"For those claiming [Heaven 17] should have accepted the extremely low offer for buyout for Temptation in GTA6 claiming 'increased exposure'…  an extra one million streams generates each writer a pitiful $1k each," he <a href="https://x.com/martynware/status/1832661703554728237">explained</a> later still.</p>
<p>When asked what he would have considered a reasonable offer, Ware <a href="https://x.com/martynware/status/1832738125237358859">suggested</a>: "$75K a buyout - or no advance required for a reasonable royalty". Apparently, Rockstar "<a href="https://x.com/martynware/status/1832677601267052797">refused</a>".</p>
<p>Ware's mentions were then swarmed by people pointing taking umbrage with his position.</p> <div>

<p>The company's CEO Strauss Zelnick was asked about the timing of GTA 6's release during an interview with CNBC. Here, the company exec said the team generally decides upon a release window by factoring in measurable elements, using the "number of bugs in a title" as an example.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/the-beatles-rock-band-harmonix-anniversary-1851642490<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Plain and simple, I am a Beatles fan because of video games—prior to a specific game, I didn’t give two shits about one of the most influential acts in modern music history. But this week, the sole reason for my fandom, <em>The Beatles: Rock Band</em>, turns 15. Harmonix’s rhythm game masterpiece feels forgotten despite the miraculous circumstances that allowed it to exist. </p><p>It remains the single most gorgeous tribute the band has ever received and deserves to be remembered as both the peak of a forgotten genre and a prime example of how games can allow newer, younger audiences to appreciate things they wouldn’t have otherwise.<br></p><h2 id="h468359"><a id=""></a>The Long And Winding Road</h2><p>The existence of a <em>Beatles </em>video game was announced by MTV Games, Apple (no not that Apple, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Records&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Records" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this one</a></span>), and Harmonix in October 2008. In the media landscape of the time, this was massive, with both <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20090312101841/http://www.gamespot.com/news/blogs/rumor-control/909119209/26653056/wsj-beatles-playing-rock-bands-tune.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20090312101841/http://www.gamespot.com/news/blogs/rumor-control/909119209/26653056/wsj-beatles-playing-rock-bands-tune.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">gaming</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/the-beatles-onboard-with-rock-band-1043637/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/the-beatles-onboard-with-rock-band-1043637/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mainstream</a></span> outlets reporting on the new untitled project. Back then, there were two dominant franchises in the absurdly successful rhythm game genre, and every few months the world’s biggest bands would pick a side. </p><div><p><em>Guitar Hero</em>, owned by Activision and developed by Neversoft, managed to lock down groups like Aerosmith, Metallica, and Van Halen to exclusivity deals that eventually resulted in their own standalone entries. Meanwhile,<em> Rock Band</em>, the franchise helmed by Harmonix (the original creators of <em>Guitar Hero, </em>confusing I know) and published jointly by MTV Games and EA, managed to get bands like U2, AC/DC, and The Pixies to drop entire albums into its ever-growing, always forward-compatible music library.</p><p>Two bands were widely considered the holy grail of this ongoing cold war: Led Zeppelin (one of the only rock acts to never feature any of their music in either series) and the Beatles. Both groups had a long history of being deeply protective of how and where their music was licensed.</p></div><p>So when one of these holdouts declared they were jumping onto gaming’s biggest trend, it was major. There was a caveat: Players couldn’t import these songs into the other <em>Rock Band</em> games, one of the key advantages Harmonix’s series had over the competition. Still, though, this was the goddamn Beatles. This was huge news to everyone.</p><p>Everyone but me.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="bb972b3fba0937a62981750bcd3c3fae" data-recommend-id="image://bb972b3fba0937a62981750bcd3c3fae" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Beatles perform." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Beatles perform." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Harmonix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bb972b3fba0937a62981750bcd3c3fae" data-recommend-id="image://bb972b3fba0937a62981750bcd3c3fae" data-format="jpg" data-width="1024" data-height="576" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Beatles perform." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h468360"><a id=""></a>Nowhere Man</h2><p>As a fanboy skimming Harmonix forums daily, with hundreds of <em>Rock Band </em>songs on his Xbox 360 hard drive, I was underwhelmed. I knew very little about the Liverpool-based quartet. Aside from some late-night infomercials promoting box sets of their old-ass music, the Beatles were about as distant from me, a Black teenager from New York City raised primarily on hip-hop, ‘80s pop, and the <em>Tony Hawk Pro Skater </em>soundtrack, as humanly possible.<br></p><div><p>I had an appreciation for a handful of older rock acts like the Police and Jimi Hendrix thanks to my parents. But the Beatles, who broke up before either of them could speak complete sentences, didn’t resonate with mom or dad during their formative years, either.</p><p>It was the 2009 Xbox E3 Press Conference, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/is-e3-dead-2023-canceled-esa-1851092261&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/is-e3-dead-2023-canceled-esa-1851092261">of all things</a></span>, that changed my tune. In a genius bit of marketing, Microsoft opened the show with the world premiere of <em>The Beatles: Rock Band</em>. Six joyful members of the Harmonix team played “Day Tripper,” followed by Giles Martin, son of the Beatles’ legendary producer, explaining that the Beatles catalog was “meticulously reworked specifically for this game.” The resulting work was also the basis for the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.npr.org/2009/09/08/112646759/the-beatles-remastered-not-just-for-audiophiles&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.npr.org/2009/09/08/112646759/the-beatles-remastered-not-just-for-audiophiles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2009 remasters</a></span> being released alongside the game’s launch.</p></div><figure id="" data-id="b328d9649ac01aa6563336582a449018" data-recommend-id="image://b328d9649ac01aa6563336582a449018" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Beatles perform.

This was a rare moment in which the living Beatles and their surviving loved ones had come together (heh) under one roof, and the mainstream media ate it up. </p><p>The significance of this, of course, was totally lost on me, a 16-year-old writing up dumb E3 blogs for my 300 Tumblr followers. But I was intrigued. It finally clicked that this wasn’t just a <em>Rock Band </em>game with Beatles avatars and some extra chrysanthemums in the main menu’s UI. Sure, this wasn’t my band. But this was clearly something Harmonix was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/developer-terrified-while-making-beatles-rock-band-5350599&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/developer-terrified-while-making-beatles-rock-band-5350599">excited to make</a></span>. The team’s enthusiasm was infectious enough to get me, a fan of their work since <em>Frequency</em> and <em>Amplitude</em>, curious about the final product.</p><p>A few weeks after the September 9, 2009 release date I picked up my copy and quickly discovered my new musical obsession. <em>The Beatles: Rock Band</em> was obviously a great game. But it was also an in-depth, lovingly crafted history lesson told across 45 songs, dozens of archival videos and photos, loading screen fun facts, and original cinematics, aimed squarely at a total Beatles novice. Harmonix diligently recreated the sets, stages, stadiums, and imaginary landscapes of the band’s entire career, instantly catching me up on why they mattered.</p></div><h2 id="h468361"><a id=""></a>Fixing A Hole</h2><div><p>Sure, this was about as sanitized a history lesson as one could get on The Beatles, a band with no shortage of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/when-john-lennons-more-popular-than-jesus-controversy-turned-ugly-106430/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/feature/when-john-lennons-more-popular-than-jesus-controversy-turned-ugly-106430/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">controversies</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/cynthia-lennon-the-first-wife-of-john-lennon-whose-steadfastness-was-rewarded-by-cruel-treatment-at-the-hands-of-the-beatle-10150200.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/cynthia-lennon-the-first-wife-of-john-lennon-whose-steadfastness-was-rewarded-by-cruel-treatment-at-the-hands-of-the-beatle-10150200.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fuck-ups</a></span>. And with music (and games) being subjective, not everyone would have the same takeaway. But like the Wii, which simplified the hobby for working parents and retirees just a few years before, <em>The Beatles: Rock Band</em> was an undeniable demonstration of how video games could reintroduce and recontextualize a point of cultural significance to all ages.</p><p>A year before <em>The Beatles: Rock Band</em>, I would’ve cynically written them off as a bunch of old white dudes with no real classics like a <em>Reasonable Doubt</em> or a <em>Late Registration</em>. Within a month of rolling credits, I purchased 70 percent of those 2009 remasters. I even learned how to play a handful of their songs on the bass.</p><p>Harmonix has since moved on from the <em>Rock Band </em>series<em> </em>to create unsung gems like the experimental turntable simulator <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fuser-dj-game-dlc-harmonix-guitar-hero-rock-band-1849856001&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fuser-dj-game-dlc-harmonix-guitar-hero-rock-band-1849856001"><em>Fuser</em></a></span>. Then, in 2021, the company was purchased by Epic Games and has since released the successful <em>Fortnite Festival</em>. But it’s a shame that its Beatles game only received a handful of DLC releases (the rest of <em>Abbey Road</em>, <em>Rubber Soul,</em> <em>Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band</em>, and the free single <em>All You Need Is Love</em>). It’s an even bigger tragedy that Harmonix couldn’t renew those licenses so it could remain playable on modern hardware (would love it if Epic used its near-infinite war chest of V-Bucks to rectify this, but I digress).</p></div><p>Some 15 years after its release, <em>The Beatles: Rock Band </em>represents one of gaming’s finest moments: The tasteful and respectful preservation of seminal work from another medium in a new and interesting way. The rhythm game bubble may have popped not long after its 2009 release. But <em>The Beatles: Rock Band </em>is paramount to the industry trend that birthed it. It is a gold standard in a larger phenomenon that makes the entire medium so unique and so compelling in the first place.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
