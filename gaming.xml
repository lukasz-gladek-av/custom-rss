			<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> has a bunch of party tricks, but its mouse controls are all-too-easily overlooked. They really shouldn’t be, when it opens the console up to all sorts of new experiences, or to genres that are just fundamentally better with a mouse in your hand. Enter Citadelum, a Roman city-builder that lets you create your own corner of the Empire and fully embraces Nintendo’s latest console and its pointing-and-clicking skills.</p>
<p><iframe title="Citadelum - Official Nintendo Switch 2 Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rvY5gE5LM7w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Citadelum offers both an open-ended Sandbox mode and an expansive single-player campaign that takes you on a historical journey beginning in 40BCE – that’s Before Common Era, not Before Consoles Existed – through the rise of the Roman Empire, the Third Punic War, and the Gallic Wars. Each period is broken down into a series of different missions and levels, giving you a steady stream of targets to judge your burgeoning society by before you can advance.</p>


<p>Whatever time period you’re focusing on, infrastructure is key. From the moment you place your Forum at the centre of your city, it becomes a race to house the plebeians, keep them gainfully employed, dig, find or grow material resources, and curry favour with the people. Leave too many unemployed or disgruntled citizens, and you’ll soon find your city beset by thieves, murderers and criminality. So… don’t let that happen?</p>


<p>Once you have the basics prepared, your city’s Prestige Level will increase, opening up new buildings and options for further expansion. This is also a good time to hop into the wider regional map and have your explorers take a gander at the nearest settlements, opening up the possibility of trade and collaboration with them. If you become a reliable trading partner, your relationship with that town will improve, and they may be able to provide you with soldiers and military support in return.</p>
<p>I was immediately impressed by how in-depth and fully featured Citadelum feels. It’s not a cut-back console port or a simplified genre entry, it’s a true city builder, with the gauges, percentages and macro-economics to prove it. It’s an interesting experience playing a game of this type on the TV and in handheld, but it’s been well optimised, with larger text, readable icons, and a tutorial that takes you through all of the most important aspects of the game before it turns you loose.</p>
<p>The Campaign steadily gives you a full understanding of all of the different multi-level resource and building trees, factoring in housing, agriculture, entertainment, combat and religion. For all that Citadelum is a fairly calm, relaxed experience, battles, and the appearance of the occasional unhappy god to smite you, bring a surprising level of chaos that’ll keep you tinkering away for hours on end.</p>

<p>There are six gods to woo with your religious fervour, and you can curry their favour to speed your technological growth or feed your nation, though equally, you can make them upset. Get it wrong, and they’ll appear to smash up your buildings or ruin your crops, setting your city back, and forcing you to rethink how you worship them. It brings a touch of Age of Mythology to Citadelum, and at first, it felt like an odd fit. After you spend more time here, though, it feels utterly authentic to the era, and whatever you might think, it’s certainly a fun addition.</p>
<p>In terms of controls, Citadelum is well optimised for controller, with the shoulder buttons cycling through your different categories, and different buttons opening up sub-categories from there. You build to a grid, and while the controller input is occasionally a little finicky, such as when you’re trying to build a road that does anything other than be straight, everything locks into position, and it’s pretty easy to parse whether playing docked or handheld. It’s just so straightforward to create a huge, but functional, city, and it’s mostly a relaxing, thoughtful experience.</p>

<p>Switching to mouse is a revelation, though. City builders and strategy games just work better with a mouse, and there’s something truly amazing about unclipping the Joy-Con 2 and using them on the sofa next to you. Citadelum feels like a perfect city-building experience in this mode, and I massively enjoyed the mostly laid-back vibes of laying my city out from the comfort of my sofa.</p>
<p>The only annoyance is that you have to manually move between mouse and controller in the options instead of having the switch auto-detected as in Metroid Prime 4, for example. That’s fine when switching to the mouse, but coming back to controller means hopping back into mouse mode. This needs to become an automatic change, and it definitely resulted in some huffing, and indeed, puffing, when I discovered I had to get back up again.</p>

<p>The ver. 1.4.0 patch is now live on Switch and Switch 2, introducing two new cherry blossom-themed gliders (the 'Ceremonial Glider' and 'Leaf Glider') alongside new deluxe bingo cards, bonus hair and eye colour options, and a couple of other tweaks and bug fixes.</p>
<p>It's far from the biggest update we've seen from Grand Bazaar to date, but it's nice to see Marvelous' support extending into 2026.</p><div><figure data-videoid="ylLGp-DIVlY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytylLGp-DIVlY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ylLGp-DIVlY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed601436jyqhgx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>We had a great time with Grand Bazaar when it launched on Switch and Switch 2 last year, calling it "a fantastic reinvention filled with smart choices and heartfelt polish" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">our review</a>.</p>

            <guid>1432042</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Speculation <a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is already running rampant</a> on which games will be featured in <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-state-of-play-february-2026-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tomorrow's <strong>State of Play</strong></a>, and one of the most anticipated PlayStation games of the year is certainly <strong>Marvel's Wolverine</strong> from <strong>Insomniac Games</strong>. However, the studio has just dropped a tidbit hinting that <strong>it might not be featured at the event</strong>. <a href="https://x.com/i/status/2021332733998612529" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Replying on X</a> to a user who asked when they'd release more information, <strong>the developers said it's happening at some point this Spring</strong>. Obviously, we are not in Spring yet.</p>



<p>It's possible they might still show off a brief new trailer without any further details about the game, but <strong>the more likely outcome is that they'll just save everything for a later showing</strong>. Perhaps they could even get their dedicated broadcast in April or May; after all, the <strong>Marvel's Spider-Man</strong> franchise has done wonders for Sony, so Marvel's Wolverine could get a special spotlight.</p>



<p>It also makes sense from a schedule perspective. Marvel's Wolverine <strong>isn't due until sometime in the Fall</strong> season, whereas another game from a Sony-owned studio is coming out much sooner. I'm referring to <strong>Housemarque's Saros</strong>, which will launch on PlayStation 5 <strong>on April 30</strong>; it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/housemarque-saros-gameplay-release-date-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">originally planned for March 20</a>, but the Finnish studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-saros-trailer-shows-provides-new-look-at-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced a <strong>slight delay</strong></a> a while ago.</p>



<p>Saros could get a deep dive at the State of Play, but it might not be the only PlayStation Studios update featured there. Insider Shinobi602 <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot48-has-ot48-been-hijacked-by-ot47-ot46-and-ot45-to-the-detriment-of-48-ots-of-history.1329010/post-151107211" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> he wouldn't be surprised if Sony Santa Monica was ready to reveal the long-awaited game led by <strong>Cory Barlog</strong>. As a reminder, following the massively successful 2018 <strong>God of War reboot</strong>, Barlog transitioned into the role of Creative Director and Producer for <strong>God of War Ragnarök</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-not-directed-cory-barlog-atreus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which was directed by <strong>Eric Williams</strong></a>. We don't know a lot about this new project, except that, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-santa-monica-cory-barlog-new-game-going-well-potentially-not-new-ip/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, <strong>it was going well as of July 2025</strong>, and it's not technically a new IP but might feel like one.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Today’s Quordle: Hints & Answers For February 11, 2026]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Quordle takes the complexity of the original daily word game and ups the ante by having you solve four solutions at once. Your 100% attention suddenly needs to be diverted four ways, and completing the daily Quordle is a tough proposition, no matter how experienced you are. The February 11, 2026, Quordle has four new words for you to find, and this guide has hints and a helping hand to have you be four for four.</p>



<p>Before the information comes thick and fast at you, make sure you give today’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/quordle/" id="3574" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Quordle</a> a go if you haven’t already!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-play-quordle-daily-word-game">How To Play Quordle Daily Word Game</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rest assured, they will be tested. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Quordle is different from other daily word games as it requires you to correctly work out four words at once, and you can attempt this through the official Quordle website.</strong></p>



<p>Before anything else, check out this set of instructions on finding and playing Quordle:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://beta.quordle.com/#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Quordle</a> website.</li>



<li>You should be presented with four equal boxes reminiscent of a Wordle setup.</li>



<li>Enter your first guess using the keyboard input at the bottom of the screen.</li>



<li>The game will fill out the first of nine lines for all four boxes.</li>



<li>A green box means the letter is correct AND goes in that exact spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A yellow box means the letter is correct BUT needs to go in a different spot on the grid.</li>



<li>A grey box means the letter DOESN’T feature at all.</li>



<li>Do this up to nine times to try to solve all four words.</li>
</ol>







<h2 id="h-best-quordle-tips-amp-tricks">Best Quordle Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>
<li>Try to use as many of the five vowels as you can in your first two guesses.</li>



<li>Focus on solving words with more green and yellow boxes first.</li>



<li>Avoid reusing letters that are not applicable across any of the four answers.</li>



<li>Don’t be afraid to try the same letter twice in one word, as answers can be sneaky like that.</li>



<li>Play the Practice game first if you’re not used to Quordle, or need a warm-up before today’s new game!</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="block-44882c9d-d6a6-4e4f-9b1a-8312ae0b3036">When Is The Next Quordle Daily Game?</h2>



<p id="block-bc42def5-af74-42a4-abf5-f31a34e53dd6"><strong>Quordle is updated daily at 12 AM or Midnight in your respective time zone and region, meaning the next game will start on February 12.</strong></p>



<p>The Quordle schedule is very consistent and always comes out at the same time each new day. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-quordle">What Is Quordle?</h2>



<p><strong>Quordle is a variation of the popular Wordle daily word game, but instead of giving you one word to solve, you must figure out four unique words at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Needless to say, Quordle is MUCH harder than Wordle! There are days when it might be an achievement just to solve one of the four words. Whereas you can guess Wordle with your first answer, that’s impossible with Quordle. You need to be thinking on all cylinders with Quordle, and Insider Gaming strongly recommends you take the hints above on board and apply them to future Quordle puzzles.</p>



<p>Additionally, a new daily guide will be on the website for every new puzzle. Keep coming back each day for hints and solutions to the newest Quordle daily word games!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Relooted Launches To Double-Digit User Count on Steam but Positive Reviews]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/relooted-launches-double-digits-steam-reviews/</link>
            <guid>1432030</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>On social media, discussions have surfaced surrounding the recent launch of Relooted, an Africanfuturist heist game that sees players assume control of characters stealing African artifacts from Western museums. Those discussions aren’t entirely positive, as Relooted has managed to secure a peak player count of just 57 users on Steam on launch day.</p>



<p>While the bulk of users will be playing Relooted via Xbox Game Pass, on which the game dropped on day one, it’s not a strong look for just the second game from Nyamakop. It is worth stressing that the game has a review rating of ‘Mostly Positive’ on Steam, so perhaps it’s much better than the player count suggests and is just struggling with adoption.</p>







<h2 id="h-relooted-regarded-as-genuinely-bad-by-some">Relooted Regarded as ‘Genuinely Bad’ by Some</h2>



<p>If you hold any stock in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3255890/Relooted/#app_reviews_hash" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">user reviews on Steam</a>, you might baulk at the most recent recollections. One gamer wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>This game sucks. I’m not saying that because it’s “woke”; the game is genuinely bad. The art style is ugly, the mechanics are terrible, and it has a multitude of other issues. Avoid this game.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Of course, the almost immediate mention of ‘woke’ does something to invalidate their opinion a little, as it’s a phrase too easily lobbied around these days by those not happy with their evaluation of a game.</p>



<p>By comparison, another user explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s a fun and vibrant little platformer with a lot of interesting history driving it. Sadly, Americans struggle to think anything can be made without centering around their politics.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s <strong>extremely tough </strong>not to take a political approach to judging Relooted, and that might be what’s slowing adoption. It’s not possible to see how many people are playing the game on PC or Xbox via the Game Pass subscription service, but at the time of writing, just 15 people were playing it on Steam.</p>



<p>In June 2025, our Tom Henderson <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-nyamakop-ceo-ben-myers-relooted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sat down with Ben Myres</a>, CEO at Nyamakop, who said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We struggled with the design for quite a while – how to make an interesting mechanical adaption of heist movies was tricky (most heist games are shooters, and don’t always feel accurate to the vibe and sensibilities of say an Ocean’s 11). It was only when Teardown came out that something clicked.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team also stressed that the Metroidvania-style game wasn’t influenced by games like Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown or Tales of Kenzera: ZAU, despite bearing similarities to both.</p>



<p>Time will tell how Relooted pans out, but the critics’ impressions <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2026/02/relooted-is-available-today-with-xbox-game-pass-and-some-early-reviews-are-now-live" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are mostly positive</a>. One outlet described the game as ‘unique and rewarding’, while another dubbed it ‘a fantastic premise’.</p>

            <p>A revitalised <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> (formerly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a>) is bringing players back, propelling the game to most-watched status on streaming service <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, and to being one of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/mostplayed">most played games on Steam</a> - comfortably above copycat hero-shooter Marvel Rivals. There was even a queue to log in to Overwatch when I played yesterday evening, which is something I've never seen before.</p>
<p>Currently there are <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/directory/category/overwatch-2">nearly 100,000 people watching Overwatch streams on Twitch</a>, making it the most viewed game by some way, with nearly 30,000 more viewers than second-place game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a>. Meanwhile on Steam, Overwatch peaked at 165,000 players, putting it briefly in the top 10. It's currently 13th, nearly 10 places ahead of genre rival Marvel Rivals, which has trumped Overwatch on Steam for a long time.</p>
<p>Note, however, that Overwatch is not only available on Steam. The predominant platform for play is Battle.net, which is presumably where the bulk of the audience lies. Should the jump in activity on Steam reflect the jump in activity on Battle.net, then, the actual number of Overwatch players is presumably much higher.</p>
<p>The renewed Overwatch activity is due to an expansion-like release, The Reign of Talon, which arrived yesterday. It's the game's first expansion and heralds <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzards-big-plan-to-put-overwatch-back-on-top">the beginning of a new yearly expansion-era for Overwatch</a>, which Blizzard will release in addition to more regular Season updates.</p><p>Season 1 - the kick-off season for Reign of Talon - brings five new heroes to the game at once, which is an unprecedented amount for Overwatch, and Blizzard plans to add five more new heroes over the course of the year. These aren't the only changes to the game, though, with major user interface reworks and story-related changes present as well.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="546"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1r1segu/so_death_chandelier/">So… Death Chandelier???</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Synodii/">u/Synodii</a> in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/">Overwatch</a> </blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>But it's the new heroes that everyone is talking about - notably the new flying hero Jetpack Cat, who has the meta-shaking new ability to tow other characters through the air. All of the combo possibilities of this are currently being felt out. Among them, lifting a spinning, Ultimate-ing Reaper above a team to prevent them hiding behind cover; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1r1omoi/behold_the_jetpack_cat_reinhardt_duel/">airlifting the hammer-swinging Reinhardt through the air to duel other airlifted Reinhardts</a>; and discovering bizarre quirks such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1r1rsht/eliminated_someone_before_the_match_even_started/">being able to kill people before a match has officially begun</a>. People are also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/1r1rog9/first_game_with_emre_first_potg/">getting to grips with the other new heroes, such as Emre</a>, and discovering how potent they can be. The question is how long Overwatch can keep this renewed momentum up for.</p>
<p>Not all of the new heroes have gone down well, though. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-responds-to-overwatch-anran-design-controversy">Controversy arose over the weekend around the visual appearance of new fire-wielding hero Anran</a>, whose final, cute in-game look seemed to contradict a more ferocious design used in previously-released animated shorts and comics for the game. Anran's face also appears very similar to a lot of other female characters in the game - an issue the community refers to as "same-face syndrome". Blizzard has said it's discussing her design with the intention of making changes to it.</p>

            <p>Konami has announced its next Silent Hill Transmission broadcast.</p>
<p>As shared by the company, we can all expect to hear more about what's in store for the Silent Hill series tomorrow, 12 February, at 4pm PT. That's actually the early hours of the 13th for those of us here in the UK, with everything kicking off at midnight.</p>

<p>As for what we can expect, the studio has said it will share the "latest news on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a>".</p>
<p>Silent Hill: Townfall (my computer keeps trying to autocorrect that to Downfall, which is very annoying) is coming from No Code, the Glasgow-based developer of Stories Untold and Observation. It was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-townfall-is-a-new-entry-to-the-series-from-stories-untold-developer-no-code">first announced back in 2022</a>, though at this time not too much was revealed about the game, other than a mysterious trailer featuring a man talking over a walkie-talkie.</p><p>Soon after this reveal, some started to decode the trailer, and it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-townfalls-announcement-trailer-has-a-secret-message-hidden-inside-it">discovered an SOS signal was tucked between the 'THY FLESH IS WEAK' images</a>. There was also mention of Alessa, who is the little girl seen throughout Silent Hill during the first game and the name should be pretty familiar to anyone who's played the first or third installments, or watched the original Silent Hill movie.</p>

<p>"I'd like to keep expanding it"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy</a> creator Kazutaka Kodaka has been pretty open about his aspirations to expand upon the game with DLC, but thanks to a new interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@WeebyNewz">Weeby Newz</a> on YouTube, we now have a better idea of just how far he's willing to go.</p>
<p>When asked about what he might be interested in exploring with additional DLC regarding new routes and endings, Kodaka states that he wants to keep growing The Hundred Line for "around ten years", citing the seemingly unlimited potential to tell new stories.</p>
<p>Here's what he had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Since the game already includes so many genres such as the Romance Route and the S.F. Route, it means we can add almost any kind of story. I'd like to keep expanding it into like 200 lines, 300 lines, or even 400 lines – as many routes as we can imagine, a game people have never seen before.</p>
<p>"Ultimately, I'd love for it to grow into something that can keep going for around ten years."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also goes on to tease the possibility of new characters, stating that "depending on the route, I think we can introduce new transfer students".</p>
<p>It does, however, sound like we'll be waiting a little while before we see any DLC expansions. Although Kodaka states that the team is working through ideas daily, he stresses that it's "not something that's fully in motion yet".</p>
<p>Still, this is all very exciting, indeed. We gave The Hundred Line a 9/10 in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy">our review</a> last year, calling it "an excellent tactical RPG that fully showcases the strengths of the creatives behind it". If you've yet to play it, we'd urge you to give it a shot.</p>

            <p>Social media company Discord are trying their best to reassure people irked by the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/discord-roll-out-global-age-verification-system-including-an-age-inference-model-that-runs-in-the-background">recently announced global rollout of some new age verification measures</a>, which include face scans and a background “age inference” system for determining whether the user is an adult. </p>
<p>Amid predictable backlash against potential privacy violations – see, for context, last year’s <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/oct/07/discord-data-breach-proof-of-age-id-leaked">cybersecurity breach</a> that saw a hacker get hold of personal information used for age verification via one of Discord’s customer service partners – Discord are promising that they won’t require every user to complete a face scan or upload some ID, and that the “vast majority of people can continue using Discord exactly as they do today”. Albeit, mostly because “the majority of Discord users don’t access age restricted content”.</p>
<p>“For the majority of adult users, we will be able to confirm your age group using information we already have,” the platform holders <a href="https://discord.com/press-releases/discord-launches-teen-by-default-settings-globally#age-assurance-clarification">write in a clarification on their official blog</a>. “We use age prediction to determine, with high confidence, when a user is an adult. This allows many adults to access age-appropriate features without completing an explicit age check.”</p>
<p>If Discord feels the need to verify your age, they’re offering additional privacy protections. Firstly, any face scans you take won’t leave your device. “If you choose Facial Age Estimation, you’ll be prompted to record a short video selfie of your face,” the post notes. “The Facial Age Estimation technology runs entirely on your device in real time when you are performing the verification. That means that facial scans never leave your device, and Discord and vendors never receive it. We only get your age group.” </p><p>Discord say they will only use info from this and other ID verification processes “for safety purposes and to help us deliver age appropriate experiences”. They assure that they won’t use it to help target adverts, or sell your data to third parties. Speaking of third parties, they also promise they aren’t working with the same partners responsible for last autumn’s cybersecurity incident. “We are partnering with dedicated age assurance vendors who specialize in performing these verifications in a privacy-forward way,” the post goes on. “These vendors were not involved in the September 2025 data breach of our customer service agent.</p>
<p>“Our vendors perform these verifications in a way to minimize the data collected and stored,” it continues. “For FAE, the video selfie is processed on device and never stored. IDs are processed to get your age only and then deleted. Your identity is never associated with your Discord account.”</p>
<p>Discord have also shared a little about how their “age inference” model works. It’s a machine learning tool, as you may guess, which predicts “whether a user falls into a particular age group based on patterns of user behavior and several other signals associated with their account on Discord”. </p>
<p>The company will only use these hints to assign you to an age group “when our confidence level is high”; otherwise, they’ll ask you to confirm your age. They also say the model doesn’t base its predictions on the content of your messages, which I guess is some reassurance that “age inference” isn’t some kind of LLM chatbot ‘training’ process in disguise.</p>
<p>Discord’s new age verification model is already live in the UK and Australia, and will kick in worldwide over March. If you’re not persuaded by the above, there’s always <a href="https://www.mirc.co.uk/">internet relay chat</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-is-back-claims-game-new-peak-player-count/</link>
            <guid>1432015</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Overwatch has been ‘relaunched’, the game’s previous ‘2’ has been removed from the title, and a new season of content has brought players flooding back to the hero shooter in droves. In recent hours, Overwatch managed to hit a new all-time high peak player count on Steam, soaring and prompting many to declare that <strong>Overwatch is back!</strong></p>



<p>Of course, it’s not all good news. In the last couple of days, the community was wrestling with the voice actor for one of the newest characters, Anran, who used her position to ‘push an agenda’ regarding unrealistic beauty standards in games. She <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-anran-actor-bags-on-ozempic-chic-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dubbed them ‘Ozempic chic’</a> and drew immense flak from one half of the community.</p>



<p>So, is Overwatch back?</p>







<h2 id="h-overwatch-skyrockets-on-steam">Overwatch Skyrockets on Steam</h2>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/overwatch/" id="197">Overwatch</a> has hit a new all-time peak player count of 165,651 users <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2357570/charts/#max" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a> in the hours before writing this article. That’s not just a slight climb over the previous high; it’s a <strong>120% </strong>boost. Previously, Overwatch had secured a high of around 75,000, back in 2023. Since then, it had slowly been working its way down the leaderboard.</p>



<p>Despite the arrival of a rebrand and a fresh season of content, plus the huge leap in players, Overwatch has managed to drop in review standings. It has a rating of ‘Mixed’ in recent reviews and ‘Mostly Negative’ overall, so it might be a case of users dipping back in, seeing what’s what, not being impressed, and leaving again.</p>



<p>Regardless, fans of the franchise have taken to social media platforms worldwide to declare the almighty and unstoppable return of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/blizzard/" id="1092">Blizzard’s</a> hero shooter, which has fallen in and out of good graces over the last few years.</p>



<p>Even Zedd, a popular music producer and DJ with millions of followers, declared Overwatch <strong>back </strong>on socials:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Whether this resurgence is a flash in the pan remains to be seen. The five new characters (which include a cat with a jetpack), the new meta event, and the countless tweaks might not pay off for long enough for Overwatch to be considered entirely renewed.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-teams-ga-snipers-major-ii-qualifiers/</link>
            <guid>1432009</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In the latest sweeping change to hit the Call of Duty League, the scene’s pro teams have decided to eradicate snipers from the competitive circuit, pushing for a GA that moves them firmly out of the meta pool.</p>



<p>As we go into the Major II qualifying stage, which leads up to the first CDL Major to land in the United Kingdom in <strong>many years</strong>, very few changes are being made. The map pool is expected to remain the same, rosters haven’t shifted too much (<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cloud9-new-york-failing-to-build-new-roster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">aside from Cloud9</a>…), but yes, snipers are now out of the picture.</p>







<h2 id="h-too-many-changes-could-harm-the-cdl-s-image">Too Many Changes Could Harm the CDL’s Image</h2>



<p>Snipers have been pulled in and out of the meta for the longest time. It seems that they’re a point of contention every single season, and we rarely go an entire year without them being kicked out of the pool. All it takes is for them to dominate for a few games and for some players to get sharper with them, and the consensus boots them from the meta.</p>



<p>That’s what’s happened this time around, with a reported <strong>nine teams </strong>agreeing to GA (Gentlemen’s Agreement) snipers and eviscerate them from the weapon pool.</p>



<p>The ever-shrinking weapon pool, we might add.</p>



<p>Many have their concerns about Call of Duty’s approach to the competitive meta, and it almost always results in the game becoming a two-gun esports title. It’s a theme not replicated in any other game, including the likes of Counter-Strike, Rainbow Six, Apex Legends, and VALORANT, all of which are much more diverse.</p>



<p>It’s now almost exclusively down to the Dravec and the M15 to determine the outcome of each match, with a few Jäger 45 clips thrown in for good measure. It’s already tough for Call of Duty to be seen as a ‘serious esport’ without this issue surfacing every season.</p>



<p>Major II welcomes the first UK-based Call of Duty esports major in more than six years, with the NEC at Birmingham welcoming both CDL Major II <strong>and </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dreamhack-coming-to-the-uk-in-2025-call-of-duty-dota/">a wider DreamHack event</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eidosmontreal.com/">Eidos-Montréal</a> is one of those veteran game studios that constantly appear in the news cycle, but always seem to be tied to some form of drama despite their pedigree. Luckily, Embracer Group has kept it running and working away on a handful of mystery projects, most of which have been scrapped.</p>
<p>Though the current buzz points to the developer now working on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rumour-has-it-a-new-alien-game-is-on-the-way-and-its-being-described-as-shadow-of-the-tomb-raider-with-xenomorphs">an ambitious Alien video game</a> with heavy action-adventure elements, <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-cancelled-lotr-game-by-eidos-montreal-with-a-telltale-like-story-first-look">this report from MP1st</a> deals with a cancelled Lord of the Rings project which never got too far. Late last year, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/tM8RcRXnHX8?t=2132s">Insider Gaming talked about this</a> already, so it's not the first time we'd heard about it, but that noise didn't take off.</p>
<p>MP1st now claims to have gotten their hands on concept art and early tests done for the game, which apparently didn't advance much before being binned. The project joins <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/legacy-of-kain-reboot-eidos-montreal/">the reported Legacy of Kain reboot</a> as games that haven't moved forward at Eidos-Montréal recently.</p>
<p>The images show painterly and colourful art depicting what's believed to be the Umbar region of Middle-earth, as pointed by recurring file names and some of the 3D screens introducing a better sense of how the game would've been structured, at least in that region. Apparently, the iconic Prancing Pony inn from the books and movies was part of the game as well, as it wouldn't have been restricted to the area south of Gondor and known for its pirates.</p><p>But perhaps the most interesting part of the report is the game would've featured card-based mechanics on top of an isometric view similar to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-rest-for-the-wicked-2024">No Rest for the Wicked</a>'s and a Telltale-like narrative approach. We lack more details, but I think it's safe to say Eidos-Montréal aimed to make a LOTR game that would've felt quite different from what we've gotten before.</p>
<p>The end of the report underlines the studio is now "deep in development" of a major project nicknamed "P11" that's third-person and open-world. Could that be the rumoured Alien title? Place your bets now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Following a recent <strong>Marathon</strong> hands-on event organized by <strong>Bungie</strong> for Chinese media, new gameplay footage and impressions are now available online. The event reportedly <strong>took place in Shanghai earlier this month</strong> and was the first held outside North America.</p>



<p>The most impressive aspect reported by attendees was the <strong>significant expansion of worldbuilding and narrative depth</strong>. The tutorial and faction introductions now provide clear origins and motivations for the playable characters, creating a more coherent story framework for the extraction shooter game. Players can discover Dr. Strauss's will; he's a pivotal figure who connects multiple narrative threads from the original Marathon trilogy.</p>



<p>The PvE experience of this Marathon build <strong>proved quite challenging</strong>, according to multiple impressions. AI enemies continuously call in reinforcements over time, and environmental hazards are aplenty, including poison gas vents, perimeter turrets, and landmines scattered throughout the maps.</p>



<p>Resource management adds an extra layer of difficulty, as <strong>medical supplies and shields are fairly expensive at vendors</strong>. By the end of the play sessions, some testers couldn't afford these items without selling all their buffs. <strong>The high-risk environment apparently discourages early combat or PvP engagements</strong>, which typically result in net losses, pushing players to focus on missions to upgrade base stats instead. At least one map confirmed support for 18 players (6 teams of 3), though there are also smaller maps that support 12 players (4 teams of 3). </p>



<p>Since the Alpha version, <strong>Marathon has received a significant visual upgrade</strong>. Environments now convey a darker, more mysterious atmosphere reminiscent of Bungie's <strong>Pathways into Darkness</strong> (1993) and the original Marathon trilogy. <strong>The UI has also undergone a major overhaul</strong>, though some aspects still feel somewhat awkward according to the event's attendees. Perhaps that's just a matter of getting used to them. </p>



<p><strong>Skill distribution across all classes appears to be well-balanced</strong>, allowing flexible team compositions. Several Shells feature movement abilities, enhancing mobility options. Each runner has six base appearances tied to their respective faction.</p>



<p><strong>The weapon arsenal includes 28 guns, each with two or more skins</strong>. Some even change the entire weapon model. Every weapon features one charm slot and three sticker slots that unlock through challenge completion. Overall, <strong>impressions of the gunplay are very good</strong>, but then again, that's an area where Bungie always excelled. The cosmetic shop and battle pass were, unfortunately, unavailable during the event.</p>



<p>The footage is <a href="https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1LrFZz6EGC" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a 10-minute video</a> available on the Chinese video sharing website Bilibili featuring <strong>Lockdown</strong>, a large scale PvE event that can trigger on the <strong>Abyssal Swamp</strong> map. Around 15 minutes later, a Point of Interest (POI) may be locked down and surrounded by red bubbles. To trigger this event, players can use the 'HEC' consumable. This allows them to enter the red bubble without taking damage for 45 seconds, during which time they can press a switch to close it. </p>



<p>After activating the switch, <strong>three waves of enemies will appear, with the final one featuring a boss</strong>. Defeating the boss provides the first wave of loot and a keycard. The locked-down area will then move to another area (it could be 'Algae Pool', 'Isolation Zone', or 'Comprehensive Facility'), and this process will repeat up to 3 times. Each time, Marathon players will need to use a keycard from the previous level to increase the difficulty level.</p>



<p>Bungie Game Director Joe Ziegler was also <a href="https://www.ali213.net/news/html/2026-2/998177_2.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed by Ali123</a>. In the conversation, <strong>he shared the studio's vision for Marathon seasons</strong>: </p>



<p><em>Each season in Marathon will be a fresh start. We envision each season as a months-long "roguelike adventure ." Each season, players will start with limited resources and must gradually grow stronger through various means, forging their own unique path to growth. To implement this concept, each season will incorporate new content and systems, substantially reshaping the seasonal gameplay. That said, some content will be retained at the player account level. For example, cosmetic items acquired through unlocking or purchasing will continue to be retained across seasons.</em></p>



<p>After several delays, Marathon <strong>will be released for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S and X <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungies-marathon-launches-march-2026-developers-provide-updated-vision/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on March 5</a></strong>. In less than a month, we'll know if Bungie turned around the mild reception of the previous testing phases.</p>

<p>Finding Juliet might be at the heart of Romeo Is A Dead Man, but that doesn’t stop Romeo from getting married along the way. That being said, it’s not an easy process, though love rarely ever is simple.</p>



<p>Romeo’s potential wife, WorstPink, is the doctor aboard the Space-Time Ship, and she can put you up for examination. What happens is more akin to a dating simulator, where you are given a host of questions—99 of them, to be exact—and you must answer each one correctly to see the true ending. </p>







<p>The caveat is that they’re exceedingly ludicrous, and the correct answer isn’t always obvious. Luckily for you, Insider Gaming has sat through all of WorstPink’s questions in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/romeo-is-a-dead-man/" id="170918" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Romeo Is A Dead Man</a>, and every correct answer is listed for your convenience down below.</p>

<p><strong>There are 99 questions to answer during the WorstPink encounter, and you must answer them all correctly in one sitting to reach the true ending.</strong></p>



<p>The questions are as random and disjointed as you could expect from a Suda51 game, and it can be incredibly frustrating to figure out the answers organically. Luckily for you, they’re all listed below:</p>

            <p>Sorry Marvel fans, you may need to retract those claws, as it seems that Insomniac's Wolverine won't be appearing during this week's PlayStation State of Play.</p>
<p>When Sony first announced a State of Play for tomorrow, 12th February, it said the show would last for over 60 minutes, and include "news, gameplay updates, and announcements". Many soon assumed (and hoped) this lengthy broadcast would include a look at Insomniac's Wolverine, which was<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-studio-insomniac-developing-wolverine-game"> first teased back in 2021</a> during a PlayStation Showcase.</p>
<!-- code from Primis - Eurogamer.net - eurogamer.net -->

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span> </p>
</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>However, it now appears that this won't be the case after all. Replying to one fan on social media, who asked when we would all hear and see more from Logan and co, <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/2021332733998612529?s=20">Insomniac replied</a> with a very to the point:</p>
<p>"Spring 2026."</p>
<p>Now, alas, February doesn't exactly fall under the 'spring' window (she writes while looking out at the sunless, grey sky, wondering when the ground will ever be dry again). Spring starts towards the end of March, so unless Insomniac is pulling the wool over our eyes it seems doubtful Wolverine will show up tomorrow night.</p><p>Something that may (<em>may</em>) show up though could be the next game from Sony Santa Monica. When asked about a possible appearance from the team during tomorrow's State of Play, industry insider <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot48-has-ot48-been-hijacked-by-ot47-ot46-and-ot45-to-the-detriment-of-48-ots-of-history.1329010/page-378#post-151107211">Shinobi602 responded</a>: “Wouldn’t be super surprising given the target release window." They did stress, though, "this isn’t a confirmation it'll be there lol".</p>
<p>Thankfully, we don't have too much longer to find out what Sony has up its sleeve, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026-announced">tomorrow's State of Play kicking off at 10pm UK time</a>. What do you hope to see there?</p>

<p>In the meantime, while we may not be getting Wolverine news this month, we do have another Marvel-flavoured leak for February. Recent rumours suggest that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-extra-february-games-leak-ahead-of-tomorrows-state-of-play">Marvel's Spider-Man 2 will be headlining PlayStation's PS Plus Extra games for February</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>I <em>still</em> haven’t left <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/im-not-sure-ill-ever-leave-the-prologue-area-in-skull-and-bones">the starting area in Skull and Bones</a>, but it’s a relief to know that as and when I do, I’ll have some big molluscs to bombard alongside those boring galleons. Ubisoft’s open world Jolly Rogerer forges bravely on with another season of updates, Eye of the Beast, despite Ubisoft recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">jettisoning a bunch of games and studios</a> in their efforts to buoy up the share price. Yes, this is the same <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skull-and-bones">Skull and Bones</a> that has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2853730/">320 in-game players on Steam</a> as of writing, and a worryingly Biblical user review average of 66.60%.</p><!--more-->
<p>Eye of the Beast’s star is the Kraken, risen with its unnumber’d and enormous polypi to engage players in multiple phase combat. “Outsmart its whirlpools, ink blasts, and toxic fog to claim victory and rich rewards,” urges <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2853730/view/559142478449479233?l=english">the game’s Steam page</a>. You may fare better against ol’ Krakdown McGee if you “take command of the mighty Corvette, a powerhouse support ship built to shift the tide of battle.” It’s a new large-class vessel equipped with a flagbearer perk that boosts crew damage and recovery. To mark the game’s anniversary, they’re also bringing back The Founding Event, which is an opportunity to complete some anniversary challenges and get your hands on a Frigate. </p>
<p>I used to loathe the very thought of Skull and Bones, a live service <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/devolver-boss-calls-gta-6-an-aaaaa-game-in-latest-attack-on-human-dignity">qAAAAgmire</a> that looks like Sea Of Thieves with a fraction of the charm. Then I played the prologue and was strangely beguiled. I still think fondly of that opening last chance lagoon, with its sunset shipwreck and scattered islets full of marooned, drunken corsairs. I don’t want to get too melodramatic at 9.30 in the morning, but if I die of sudden-onset scurvy today and wake up in the Skull and Bones tutorial area, I will have few regrets. I will go play the cannon-firing minigame and spend eternity carousing by the campfire. Beautiful. </p>
<p>I also think fondly of Skull and Bones because right now, Ubisoft is essentially Yves Guillemot and Tencent drinking D'Amalfi Limoncello Supreme in an emerald-studded crow’s nest above a living life raft consisting of Assassin’s Creed, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a> and Rainbow Six developers. I'm automatically rooting for any underperforming project that has survived the cull. Picture Skull and Bones clinging grimly to the mast, biting any shareholders who come near. As with the similarly unsinkable <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beyond-good-and-evil-2">Beyond Good and Evil 2</a>, I’m sure there are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-didnt-cancel-beyond-good-evil-2-because-open-world-games-are-a-priority-but-i-suspect-the-real-reason-is-more-boring">mundane financial reasons</a> for the game’s on-going existence. I wonder if it’s got something to do with Ubisoft’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/first-it-was-an-assassins-creed-expansion-now-its-ubis-1847326742">old deal with the Singaporean government</a>. Or maybe it's just that it squarely fits their professed current focus on live service open world projects.</p>

<p>According to the ever reliable <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-une-grosse-exclusivite-ps5-debarque-ce-mois-de-fevrier-61029">dealabs</a>, PS Plus members can expect to get their hands on the following three titles:</p>
<ul>
<li>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 (PS5)</li>
<li>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown (PS5)</li>
<li>Neva (PS5/PS4)</li>

<p>The big headliner here is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/spider-man-2-walkthrough-9356">Marvel's Spider-Man 2</a>, which reunites players with Spider-Man (of course) as well as Miles Morales and MJ. "At once a little simple and a little over-stuffed, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is still above all a game of immense charm and fluid, free-form style," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvels-spider-man-review-1">four star review from 2023</a>.</p>
<p>I would also fully recommend Neva, which is the most recent game from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gris">Gris</a> developer Nomada Studio. It follows the story of a young woman named Alba and a magnificent wolf, with whom she forms a lifelong bond.</p>
<p>We also awarded Neva four stars on its release. "Nomada Studio follows up on the striking Gris with an effort that's poignant and precise, if maybe just a tad melodramatic," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neva-review">Eurogamer's Neva review from 2024</a>.</p>

<p>It is expected that Sony will officially announce February's PS Plus Extra games in the very near future, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026-announced">perhaps during this week's State of Play</a>, so stay tuned for more.</p>

			<p><strong>Grasshopper Manufacture's ROMEO IS A DEAD MAN</strong> released yesterday to fairly positive critical reviews. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/romeo-is-a-dead-man-review-great-scott-what-a-ride/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In Wccftech's review (8.7/10)</a>, Francesco De Meo wrote:</p>



<p><em><strong>It is the most mechanically polished and stable game</strong>&nbsp;since the original Shadows of the Damned, yet it beats with the heart of&nbsp;Flower, Sun, and Rain. It leaves behind&nbsp;<strong>the technical jank and the empty-world frustrations</strong>&nbsp;of&nbsp;No More Heroes III&nbsp;without losing the "punk" soul that makes a Suda51 game&nbsp;<strong>essential</strong>. It is a game that&nbsp;<strong>respects your time</strong>&nbsp;with its 12-hour runtime, but still&nbsp;<strong>leaves its mark</strong>&nbsp;with its fever-dream narrative.</em></p>



<p>The debut on Steam seems very solid, too, with a 'Very Positive' verdict from user reviews, thanks to 93% of the reviews giving ROMEO IS A DEAD MAN a thumbs up.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f_PObigha-w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a "Launch Day Special" Grasshopper Direct</a>, Goichi Suda himself provided an update on several things. The studio was hoping to get the ROMEO IS A DEAD MAN artbook and soundtrack out by now, but there has been a delay. Still, <strong>they're coming "as soon as possible"</strong>. Grasshopper is also <strong>trying to make a retail version of the game a reality</strong>; they are currently in talks with several publishers to achieve that goal, which many players requested. The same goes for the Nintendo Switch 2 version.</p>



<p>The biggest surprise, though, was that Grasshopper Manufacture <strong>actually has an unannounced game due in 2026</strong>:</p>



<p><em>We actually have a surprise announcement for you all in this Grasshopper Direct… It’s ALMOST 100% certain that we’ll be releasing one more game during 2026! What kind of game? When can we announce it? We’re not sure just yet… But if you wait a little longer, I feel like we’ll be able to make an announcement soon. Keep checking out various events, media, and videos like this, and sooner or later, we’ll have that big announcement ready for you all. Please keep an eye out and look forward to it.</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders is Too Far Gone for a PvE Event to Work Properly]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-too-far-gone-for-pve-to-work/</link>
            <guid>1431943</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, ARC Raiders received a sizeable update that introduced a new PvE-focused event named <strong>Shared Watch</strong>. The point of Shared Watch is to work together with other raiders to take down ARC threats, and by doing so, you unlock a string of rewards, including a new skin, some cosmetics, and some Raider Tokens.</p>



<p>The trick is, you get <strong>no progress points </strong>(known as ‘Merits’) for this event for killing or maiming <strong>other players</strong>, stripping focus away from the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-arc-raiders-pvp-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s PvP loop</a>. It’s ambitious on Embark Studios’ part, but the problem is, ARC Raiders feels way too far gone to be a proving ground for a PvE-led event, and players are quickly discovering that.</p>







<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-shared-watch-event-in-arc-raiders-all-rewards-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shared Watch</a> gives incentives for working as a team, either with friends or with strangers, to take down ARC enemies. For every enemy you damage, destroy, or assist in destroying, you earn Merits that push you along a reward path. That path culminates in a nice, new helmet for your rooster, Scrappy, but there are other items to secure along the way.</p>



<p>However, Shared Watch also pushes the PvE agenda a little further, attempting to encourage users to <strong>work together</strong> and stop slinging lead at one another for five minutes.</p>



<p>Last night, I hopped on ARC Raiders with a friend to participate in Shared Watch, and ten raids later, we’d <strong>not had a single successful extraction</strong>. We were prioritizing Trials, almost all of which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-easily-complete-all-arc-raiders-trials-this-week-february-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are geared this week</a> around fighting ARC enemies, and trying to crack through that reward path.</p>



<p>On every single occassion, we were met with incoming fire from other raiders, despite <strong>rarely </strong>opening fire first. Twice, we were pushed at extraction and shot in the back while trying to get out of the map. On another raid, we fought to take down a Leaper for our Trial, learning that a duo sat in the bushes waiting for us to secure the kill so they could, subsequently, laser us to death.</p>



<p>This is the go-to standard in ARC Raiders now. There are videos and guides online geared towards ‘guaranteed entry’ to PvE-focused lobbies, which involve shooting <strong>no human enemies </strong>for around ten raids, but it’s a loose concept at best. Like the game’s loot model, securing a PvE-focused raid is based on RNG, and it depends entirely on who you’re matched with.</p>



<p>For a PvE-focused event to work in ARC Raiders, and I mean <strong>truly work with a 0% failure rate</strong>, Embark Studios has to build servers (even temporary ones) that have raider damage switched off or altered. By that, I mean you cannot take damage from another raider, period. On these servers, only ARC will be a threat.</p>



<p>To capitalize on that and keep things balanced, I’d be willing to see <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/embark-studios/" id="1161">Embark Studios</a> <strong>increase the risk </strong>from ARC on these servers. Make them tougher, more plentiful, more aggressive, whatever it takes. But the balance is, you can’t be gunned down by ARC enemies.</p>



<p>Embark Studios has said time and again that PvE doesn’t work, despite the game’s original operating model being geared towards just that. But as a limited-time event, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-event-tracker-every-map-condition-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a map condition</a>, or even a specific map built <strong>only </strong>for PvE, I think an entire audience would feel validated and well served.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Insane $4,000+ Handheld is ‘Dreamlike’ and Beats Most Gaming Laptops]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ayaneo-next-2-insane-handheld-beats-laptops/</link>
            <guid>1431934</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you thought that spending $800 to acquire a ROG Xbox Ally X was a stretch, you’ll baulk at the Ayaneo Next 2. This all-new gaming handheld, dubbed ‘dreamlike’ by Ayaneo, carries a price tag of up to <strong>$4,299</strong> if you want to get the most powerful version available. It’s tough to fathom <strong>why</strong>, but when you uncover the tech specs, it starts to make a little sense.</p>



<p>This immensely aspirational device is ambitious, and it’ll probably sell all of about three units in its lifetime, but it’s an indication of just how much effort handheld manufacturers are willing to cram into these devices.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-the-ayaneo-next-2-so-expensive">Why is the Ayaneo Next 2 so Expensive?</h2>



<p>To be fair, the <a href="https://ayaneo.com/article/901" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ayaneo Next 2</a> pricing starts at $1,999, or $1,799 if you pre-order and soak up an early bird discount. That version boasts AMD’s new Ryzen AI Max 385 processor and Radeon 8050S graphics, which come equipped with 32 GB of memory and 1 TB of storage. That’s already enough to trump every other handheld on the market.</p>



<p>But if you ramp up the specification and head for the top-tier version of the Ayaneo Next 2, you’re getting one hell of an upgrade.</p>



<p>For a princely sum of $4,299, or just $3,499 with that pre-order discount, you’ll get the AMD Ryzen Max+ 395 processor, a Radeon 8060S iGPU, an eye-watering 128 GB of memory, and double storage – 2 TB total.</p>



<p>Let’s talk about the makeup of this thing.</p>



<p>The Ayaneo Next 2 has a gorgeous OLED screen measuring just north of 9 inches. across, and a dynamic, adjustable refresh rate of up to 165Hz. It effectively puts other handhelds to shame, as the OLED screen is still rarely seen in the on-the-go gaming space.</p>



<p>There’s a massive on-board battery with a 116Wh capacity, which decimates the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/xbox-ally/" id="2725">ROG Xbox Ally X’s</a> 80Wh battery. But that’s because the Ayaneo Next 2 has <strong>so much to power</strong>. We’re talking advanced cooling solutions, RGB elements, two USB-C ports, Hall Effect triggers, TMR joysticks, insane brightness capabilities, and powerful, front-facing speakers.</p>



<p>Ayaneo has gone beyond the standard considerations, including features like trigger locks and even more rear buttons than you’d expect.</p>



<p>When it drops, the Ayaneo Next 2 will have shells available in both ‘Polar Black’ and ‘Aurora White’. It’s worth stressing that it’s not expected to be released until <strong>June 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>Do you think the Ayaneo Next 2 is worth more than $4,000? Let us know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Square Enix further note how save data for an "eligible title" must be on the same Switch 2 console. And if you're playing the game on Switch 2, and the applicable data is on an original Switch system, that data must be transferred to the Switch 2.</p>
<p>These save data bonuses can apparently be claimed at "any time", even if the save data for one of these titles is created <em>after</em> starting the Adventures of Elliot. As for the length of this promotion, it's taking place at the time of "release" but this does not guarantee it will be a permanent distribution or service, according to Square Enix.</p>
<p>Here's how you can claim these items in-game when it launches for the Switch 2 on <strong>18th June 2026</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>How to claim the bonus items:</strong></p>
<p>- Select the Promotional Bonus option from The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales’ title screen and link with any corresponding titles.</p>
<p>- Linking occurs automatically by opening the relevant screen.</p>
<p>- After starting a new game, examine the desk on the second floor of the orphanage in the Age of Safekeeping.</p>
<p>- Select Claim bonuses from the menu options to claim the qualifying bonuses from the list.</p>
<p>- Please note that bonuses cannot be claimed at certain points in the game when the orphanage in the Age of Safekeeping becomes temporarily inaccessible.</p>
<p><em>- Departure Brooch - Increases the amount of tul (in-game currency) and magicite fragments dropped by enemies by a little</em></p>

<p>Oh, and it's got one other game planned for 2026</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="ee576a7524a55"><a title="Romeo Is A Dead Man" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ee576a7524a55/romeo-is-a-dead-man.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Grasshopper Manufacture</em></figcaption></figure><p>Grasshopper Manufacture, the developer known for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/no_more_heroes">No More Heroes</a> series, launches its new game <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/romeo_is_a_dead_man">Romeo Is A Dead Man</a></strong> on multiple platforms today, but this doesn't include Nintendo's systems.</p>
<p>If you have been wondering about the chances of this new title getting a Switch release, we've got another update. During a special five-minute <a href="https://youtu.be/f_PObigha-w">'Grasshopper Direct' broadcast</a> earlier on, company CEO Goichi Suda (aka Suda51) reiterated how the team is doing what it can to make a "Switch 2 version" happen.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We're doing what we can to make it happen, so again, please give us a little more time."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This actually follows a comment Suda51 made last December, mentioning how the team wanted to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/grasshopper-wants-to-bring-romeo-is-a-dead-man-to-switch-2-but-needs-to-make-sure-the-engine-will-play-nicely-with-it-first/">bring the game to the Switch 2</a> but needed to make sure Unreal Engine 5 was "going to play nicely" with the new hybrid system, so it was testing everything out.</p>
<p>This update today also followed the news that Grasshopper is currently in talks with multiple parties about a "physical version" of the title.</p>
<p>And in one other surprising piece of news shared by Suda, it's been revealed the developer is "almost 100% certain" it will be releasing "one more game" in 2026. As for the details about this new project, the team can't reveal any information just yet, but another announcement should take place "soon".</p>
