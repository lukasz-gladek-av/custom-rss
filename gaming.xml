The dance has become incredibly popular, to the point of being shouted out in Charli XCX's tour and shared on <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@charlixcx/video/7389277177629379872?lang=en" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Charli XCX's TikTok</a>.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/dress-to-impress-brat-update-promo-1744834699035.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">So it's unsurprising that Roblox wanted the Apple Dance as part of a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/dress-to-impress/Brat_Update_Details_and_Patch_Notes_(DTI_Charli_XCX_Collaboration)">collaboration between Charli XCX and one of the most popular games within Roblox</a>: creative fashion contest game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dress-to-impress-roblox">Dress to Impress</a>. Spotted by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/559582/charli-xcx-apple-dance-roblox-lawsuit" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polygon</a>, the lawsuit in question was filed last week in California, in which Heyer claims that originally, Robox did contact her to license the Apple Dance for the crossover event. Heyer says that she was open to the idea of the dance being licensed if the terms were right - she even <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@kelley.heyer/video/7448063559411584299" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">licensed it to Fortnite</a> and Netflix via actual, signed agreements - but never reached an actual agreement with Roblox.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Heyer alleges that Robox released the Apple Dance emote for sale in the event before negotiations were ever completed and without Heyer giving her consent for its use. Heyer says that Roblox sold over 60,000 Apple Dance emotes, resulting in an estimated $123,000 in sales. The suit also argues that while the emote was a part of a Charli XCX event, the dance emote itself is unattached to the song or Charli XCX, and thus is solely Heyer's intellectual property.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The suit accuses Roblox of copyright infringement and unjust enrichment, and requests relief in the form  of the profits Roblox received from the dance plus damages as a result of Roblox harming Heyer's brand and Heyer herself, plus attorney's fees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Update 2:15 p.m. PT: </strong>Heyer's attoney, Miki Anzai, shared the following statement: "Roblox moved forward using Kelley's IP without a signed agreement. Kelley is an independent creator who should be compensated fairly for her work and we saw no other option than to file suit to prove that. We remain willing and open to settle and hope to come to a peaceful agreement."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-edgerunners-combat-zone-board-game-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cyberpunk-edgerunners-combat-zone-board-game-review.1166313/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-edgerunners-combat-zone-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-edgerunners-review"><u>Cyberpunk Edgerunners</u></a> is an electrifying animated Netflix series that debuted in 2022 and left me gobsmacked. Across 10 episodes, we rip through Night City alongside protagonists David and Lucy as they confront the terrors of the concrete hellscape while stuck between two warring MegaCorps. This brilliant anime is full of potential and is too damn good to be forgotten. Thankfully, it's now been reanimated via cardboard and plastic, allowing players to explore some of the key moments of the series through a refined tabletop miniatures game that's as razor sharp as the Cyberpunk 2077 setting.</p><div catalogid="ee2f861d-896e-452c-918b-38684ca2ff50" id="217983"><div id="217983" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cyberpunk Edgerunners: Combat Zone Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The setup mimics the show – one player controls Maine and his crew of merc edgerunners, and another the Arasaka paramilitary team. Players select a scenario and then craft their gang from a selection of characters based on the assigned points value for the mission. Maine’s group can include any of the main protagonists of the series, including David, Lucy, and Rebecca. Arasaka has a mixed cast of faceless grunts alongside more menacing options such as the braindance editor Jimmy Kurosaki and massive hulk Adam Smasher. You can outfit team members with various weapons and cybergear, allowing for advanced tactics and more nuanced options.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the strengths of this game is that the system it uses is already seasoned. The ruleset is identical to publisher Monster Fight Club’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cyberpunk-red-combat-zone-tabletop-game-review">Cyberpunk Red: Combat Zone</a> miniatures game. I’ve already written many words about this excellent tabletop skirmish game, and I am more than pleased to see it return with a fresh exoskeleton. It’s really a top-notch ruleset that hasn't received the acclaim it deserves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most interesting aspect is the activation system. Characters are allotted color-coded action tokens that are spent to roll matching dice. The stronger actions allow you to move farther or roll larger dice, such as a 12-sider, to perform various activities. The active player chooses one of their characters to activate, and then spends their assigned tokens to sprint across the board, attack their foe, or perform special actions such as netrunning or completing a scenario objective. There is added texture through leadership abilities allowing you to activate additional models out of order, or the option to react when wounded. This creates a dynamic flow to play with a controlled chaos that blends player agency with unpredictability. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This splendid system is interesting in that it evokes a sense of resource management for players to puzzle over. Each action is precious and needs to be spent for maximum gain. For instance, if Dario is being targeted by an Arasaka Point Man, do you spend her best action token for the opposed defensive roll, or do you go with a weaker action to save her best die for later in the turn? This decision process evokes a similar feel to tactical board games, such as some of the more inspired <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dungeon-crawler-board-games">dungeon crawler board games</a>. It’s more opaque than traditional miniatures games such as Kill Team or Frostgrave. This quality isn’t a total surprise, as the founders of Monster Fight Club have a long established history, having designed hit board games such as Spartacus: A Game of Blood and Treachery and Star Trek: Ascendancy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the system here is identical to Cyberpunk Red: Combat Zone, the content is certainly not. In addition to swapping out Night City gangs for edgerunner mercs and Megacorp goons, the plastic miniatures of that previous box have been abandoned in lieu of stylish acryllic standees. This style of plastic faux 3D figure has started to become popular in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board game</a> hobby, but it hasn’t quite been experimented with on the same scale in miniatures games. Monster Fight Club is looking to spearhead this movement as these standees are incredibly appealing for both ease of play and striking aesthetics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the reasons the acrylic standees work so well in this game is that the characters' depictions are all grounded in the anime. The artistic style of the Edgerunners series is an iconic element of the property, so carrying it forward to the miniatures game is an enormous win. The sleek tone of the figures blends well with the cyberpunk terrain and battlefield, merging for an overall enhanced visual field that is fantastic. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The standees are such an enormous benefit to the game that I can’t imagine the average wargamer opting for miniatures instead. Look, all of us that play these types of games have scads of unpainted figures occupying our shelves. This switch to illustrated acrylic standees is such a breath of fresh air, as it allows you to just dive into the game with virtually no assembly or prep time. And for many, they will look better than the average paint-job we are capable of. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The standees are such an enormous benefit to the game that I can’t imagine the average wargamer opting for miniatures instead.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, some may instead find that desire for full-blown miniatures eating away at their soul. Fret not, for an <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxX4mx?object_uuid=c3c6f68e-acb0-4a67-858d-ee5e2ed13c4b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">aftermarket option</a> does allow for a return to plastic multi-part miniatures. It’s a pricey option that will certainly increase your overall burden in entering this game, and I certainly find it entirely unnecessary, but it’s an option that’s there for collectors. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The terrain is of similar exceptional quality to the magnificent Cyerpunk Red: Combat Zone kit. Cardboard buildings, rubble, and barricades are composed of thick chipboard that slots together with ease. The surface is a sturdy mounted board similar to that found in hobby board games. There’s no paper mat needing an immediate upgrade here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This line of Cyberpunk miniatures games are also well supported with aftermarket purchases of Monster Fight Club’s various <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7EB3G?object_uuid=c3c6f68e-acb0-4a67-858d-ee5e2ed13c4b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">plastic terrain options</a>. They have crafted some of the best cargo containers in the industry, and have expanded that series of products to include walkways, crates, and various other small scatter options. It’s incredible stuff that rivals the top-notch cardboard options in the core box.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cyberpunk Edgerunners: Combat Zone is an impressive box. It once again includes a fully featured <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign</a> reminiscent of its peers such as Necromunda and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warcry-heart-of-ghur-brings-big-changes-to-the-tabletop-game">Warcry</a>. Players can take their gang through multiple battles and increase their characters' potency. Eventually your gang will reach the end of their story and engage in a climactic finale that wraps up their narrative. Campaign play isn't a requirement, however, as the game performs exceptionally well in one-off skirmishes. The wide range of scenario options are exciting and varied, affording for a large amount of experimentation. Couple that with full crew options allowing players to field a wide array of rosters, and this single box set feels wholly complete.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The characters are well realized, with abilities and play-styles that reflect the Netflix series.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The attention to detail here is strong throughout. The characters are well realized, with abilities and play-styles that reflect the Netflix series. David, for instance, can really dig into cybergear and run wild. Adam Smasher is scary as hell. Lucy can netrun with the best of them. Owners of Cyberpunk Red: Combat Zone products may be pleased to find out that you can mix content across games. Since both utilize the same core ruleset, they are fully compatible for those wanting to explore anachronistic conflicts that jump across the timeline. Regardless of Combat Zone experience, this new boxed set feels singular and expansive, offering a tailored skirmish game that is fantastic in its own right.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aX2rAp?object_uuid=c3c6f68e-acb0-4a67-858d-ee5e2ed13c4b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/z6odK3?object_uuid=c3c6f68e-acb0-4a67-858d-ee5e2ed13c4b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Atomic Empire</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/a5YDp5?object_uuid=c3c6f68e-acb0-4a67-858d-ee5e2ed13c4b&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Miniature Market</a></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">See more board games based on video games</h3></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Apr 16, 2025 7:30 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">This is a wonderful miniatures skirmish game that begs consideration. The switch to acrylic standees has only improved the overall gaming experience, and it’s a trend that I hope catches on with other publishers. This Edgerunners boxed set is a fully-featured and complete game that will stand the test of time. For fans of the animated series, this game is everything you’d hope for.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Using the forest to their advantage, and always with an eye toward gaining the upper hand on their opponents via their natural surroundings, the Syenann are a force to be reckoned with.</p>

<p>This Action Pack, which serves as a great starter kit for this upcoming army, contains the following units:</p>

<ul><li>3 Protector of the Forest minis</li>
	<li>2 Shadows of the Yew minis</li>
	<li>1 Druid mini</li>
	<li>1 Ynyr Daá Lainn mini</li>
	<li>1 Grand Captain mini</li>
	<li>1 Aiodos mini</li>
	<li>1 Alula mini</li>
	<li>1 Lioslaith Coic Caledhee mini</li>
</ul><p>With exactly enough miniatures to field for each troop (most or one-off’s) you’ll have everything you need to dive in. Now let’s take a look at each troop, and speak briefly about what they do on the field.</p>

<h2><b>Warcrow Syenann - Protectors of the Forest</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcrow-syenann-protectors-of-the-forest.jpg?itok=hSaOx3UC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcrow-syenann-protectors-of-the-forest.jpg?itok=ulLI6uDp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Protectors of the Forest are your boots on the ground unit for the Syenann. With impressive movement (they’re a 4-4 [10]), they hit hard from afar with their main attack, an 18 range rolling one red and three orange dice (if you’re not familiar with the mechanics of the game… that’s pretty darn far, and pretty darn hard-hitting).</p>

<p>Their two special abilities thematically link them to the whole army’s role as assassins in the forest. Their “Sharp Archers” ability says that if you inflict damage on a ranged attack, the target suffers one stress. That pairs with their “Stalking from the Forest” ability, which allows you to move this unit a short distance if they’re within 5 strides of a forest terrain piece of an allied unit.</p>

<h2><b>Warcrow Syenann - Shadows of the Yew</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcrow-syenann-shadows-of-the-yew.jpg?itok=DX7QgL4w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcrow-syenann-shadows-of-the-yew.jpg?itok=FKcK3Mec 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>But if you thought the Protectors of the Forest were assassin-like, wait until you see the Shadows of the Yew. This two-unit infantry troop moves even faster, strikes with two red dice, one orange, and one yellow (melee), and has lots of “switches” that allow it to cancel your opponents defenses, inflict extra damage, slip out of trouble, and cancel hits.</p>

<p>Their special abilities are also pretty impressive, with “Camouflaged” making it extremely hard to hit them from a distance, and “Silent and Precise” that shut down a lot of enemy options when you charge in on the attack.</p>

<p>Now let’s move onto talking about characters included in this pack.</p>

<h2><b>Warcrow Syenann - Grand Captain</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcrow-syenann-character-cards-1.jpeg?itok=CaduZ3Js 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcrow-syenann-character-cards-1.jpeg?itok=O7EXTeX0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Grand Captain is a unit that can be attached to another Infantry unit, or fielded on their own. They attack hard with ranged and melee weapon options, and when attached to a unit they offer up free hits per attack.</p>

<p>Their special ability “Maneuvers in the Forest” allows them to command up to two friendly units within 5 strides of a forest to position themselves next to the forest, and their “Ambushing Tactics” ability gives all allied units the ability to re-roll melee attack rolls if they’re close to a forest.</p>

<h2><b>Warcrow Syenann - Lioslaith Cóic Caledhee</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcrow-syenann-lioslaith.jpg?itok=aRWsURBf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcrow-syenann-lioslaith.jpg?itok=CvCdw1Nl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Lioslaith is another High Command unit that can be attached to an infantry unit, but on her own she’s a very fearsome warrior. With a hard-hitting melee attack (each roll is a red, two yellow, a defensive blue, and an auto-hit), and switches that allow her in offense to cancel blocks and in defense to move herself away from a fight, she’s brutal on the field.</p>

<p>Her special ability “Encircling Defense” lets allied units within 5 of a forest or an allied unit ignore 1 damage per activation, and her extremely powerful “Scabbard of Nuada” ability allows you, once per game, to ignore damage that would kill her, remove all damage from her character, and move her away (at the cost of two stress).</p>

<h2><b>Warcrow Syenann - Ynyr Dará Lainn</b></h2>

<p>This feather-bound character takes to the skies to attack! With a very interesting move allowing them to charge up to 20 (!!), and his special abilities are all about swooping in, attacking, and getting away.</p>

<p>“Death from the Skies” let’s you engage with an enemy 10 or less away and attack with an extra yellow dice, while his “To The Sky” ability allows you to remove him from the battlefield, remove all stress from him, and then re-deploy him using the scout rules.</p>


<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcrow-syenann-character-cards-2.jpeg?itok=bPC_XI0J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcrow-syenann-character-cards-2.jpeg?itok=8iqYv0pV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Druid is the magic-user of the group, with a very weak attack and average movement, but their use of magic sets them apart. Their “Punish the Intruder” ability is a ranged attack with heavy damage potential (and the ability to risk negative Tinge for extra stress added to the enemy).</p>

<p>Their “Exalting the Troops” special lasts 4 turns, and gives allied units nearby an extra orange die on all their attacks (with the ability to risk tinge to remove stress from themselves, or add a different colored die). And perhaps their most interesting ability is the “Defenders of the Great Forest” ability, which lets them just plop down a fresh piece of forest scenery!</p>

<h2><b>Warcrow Syenann - Alula</b></h2>

<p>Alula is a character unit built for getting the jump on the enemy. Their special ability “Surprise Attack” lets them jump into battle when another friendly unit within 10 strides of them is engaged. That enemy unit also receives the “disarmed” state, and you get to make an opportunity attack against them.</p>

<p>Add to that their “Vanguard Observant” ability, which basically allows all allied units to draw line of sight from anything <i>this unit</i> can see, and it’s clear the Alula is meant to wander off on his own, jump into surprise fights, and give your allies a clear view of the battlefield.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcrow-syenann-character-cards-3.jpeg?itok=5x8IT1cB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcrow-syenann-character-cards-3.jpeg?itok=rCa2ucQ9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><b>Warcrow Syenann - Aoidos</b></h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warcrow-syenann-aoidos.jpg?itok=Bt2eDOUc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warcrow-syenann-aoidos.jpg?itok=9xoEjpnS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Finally, there’s Adidos, another character unit that can join infantry. Their spell, “Ballad of the Dryad,” gives an enemy unit within 15 strides of them a state of your choice (usually you’d likely want to make them stressed or disarmed). And, if they don’t pass a Willpower test with two successes, you can choose an ability on their profile and they can’t use it until the spell wears off (3 turns).</p>

<p>Their “Dance to My Tune” ability also inflicts stress on enemy units who fail a WP test, making them a walking problem for all enemies nearby.</p>

<h2><b>Warcrow Syenann - Building The Kit</b></h2>

<p><i>Warcrow</i> prides itself on not including complicated models that need a whole booklet of instructions to put together, but I did find it difficult, at times, to know exactly how a specific piece was supposed to fit. Also, these are resin miniatures, so if you’ve gotten spoiled by the instant gratification of plastic glue on plastic minis, you’ll have to resort back to superglue for these <i>Warcrow</i>.</p>

<p>That being said, most models were, indeed, very intuitive to build, with each unit packaged separately so you know you’re not cross-pollinating bows and arrows across units.</p>

<h2><b>Warcrow Syenann - Final Thoughts</b></h2>

<p>This is a very, very slippery army. I love when elf-type armies are represented not as high-magic, civilized, or haughty - but as animalistic or like a true force of nature. These are definitely your archetypical wood elves, and I love the look of them.</p>

<p>With rules that rely on forest terrain, you’ll need to ensure you’ve got enough when going into battle to get the most out of this army. Without any forests, you’re kind of losing out on the whole point of the army - this could be a downside, if you were hoping to just build them up, grab some random buildings from your terrain shelf, and get them into the action.</p>

<p>But when all is said and done, the Syenann are an army that brings a whole new dimension to this brand new game - trading brute force for precise strikes and an overload of stress on your opponents.</p>

Unlike the notorious OGL debacle, the SRD allows third-party developers to make material using the rules material without paying a fee to Wizards of the Coast. In addition, since both SRDs are in Creative Commons, it provides a legally binding promise that the essential rules of D&amp;D are free to use, change, and build upon forever.</p>

<p>With this SRD's publication you can, irrevocably and in perpetuity, create and publish material for both Fifth Edition Dungeons &amp; Dragons and Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024.</p>

<p>The post also confirms that Wizards of the Coast will be releasing a Conversion Guide for creators who want to update their work to be compatible with the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em> SRD.</p>

<p>Lastly, Wizards of the Coast confirmed the SRD will be routinely updated to include any and all errata for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em>. The SRD will be updated accordingly to match these changes.</p>

<p>The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em> SRD was initially announced in <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dungeons-dragons-2024-srd-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">May 2024</a>. This announcement was made alongside the updated core rulebooks as part of the fantasy TTRPG's 50th anniversary. These Core Rulebooks were overseen by industry leads <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/christopher-perkins-retires-from-wizards-of-coast-after-28-years-working-on-dungeons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Christopher Perkins</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/jeremy-crawford-game-director-of-dungeons-dragons-is-leaving-wizards-of-ghost" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Jeremy Crawford</a>. Both of them have recently announced their departure from Wizards of the Coast.</p>

<p>The <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> 2024 SRD will be released on April 22.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xboxs-stream-your-owned-games-to-console-feature-now-available-to-all-via-game-pass-ultimate.1166217/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-stream-your-owned-games-to-console-feature-now-available-via-game-pass-ultimate<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Following months of Xbox Insider testing, all Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers can now stream a "select" number of their owned games to Xbox Series X/S or Xbox One consoles, without needing to install them first. It's one of several Xbox features launching in April.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft first discussed giving Xbox players the ability to stream their owned games back in 2019, but the feature suffered multiple delays. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscribers-can-now-stream-select-games-from-their-own-library-via-cloud-gaming">finally arrived last November</a>, but was only available through a limited number of platforms - namely TVs and via browsers on supported devices such as tablets, smartphones, and Meta Quest headset. A month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-insiders-can-now-play-select-games-they-own-on-their-console-using-cloud-streaming">streaming to Xbox consoles was introduced to Insider testing</a>, and it's now available to everyone - provided they have a Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription, at least.
</p>
<p>
The feature's arrival means all Ultimate members can now stream games outside of those included in the Game Pass library, but only if they appear on Microsoft's list of supported titles. At present, "100+" games are compatibile with the feature, and more are set to be added over time. Recent additions include Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage Tape 2, Wanderstop, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed">Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</a> - with the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/play/gallery/buy-and-stream">full list available on the Xbox website</a>. 
</p>
<p>
To begin using the feature, Game Pass Ultimate subscribers should fire up their console and navigate to My games &amp; apps &gt; Full library &gt; Owned Games. All supported titles include a cloud badge on their game page, and streaming is started by selecting the game and choosing the Play with Cloud Gaming option. It's also possible to begin streaming directly from the Store app after purchasing a compatible game.
</p>
<p>
Alongside owned game streaming, April's Xbox update brings a number of other improvements and additions to console. Xbox's 'Free up space' screen, for instance, now highlights duplicate copies of games and games that players no longer have access to, and Microsoft has introduced new Game hubs to Xbox consoles too.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, Xbox remote play has seen changes, with Microsoft removing the feature from the Xbox app on mobile and instead requiring players to access it from their mobile device's browser, which the company insists will "make it easier for our teams to optimise the streaming experience and build new features". The change will also "soon" bring remote play to more devices, including Samsung Smart TVs, Amazon Fire TV devices, and Meta Quest headsets. 
</p>
<p>
And finally, Microsoft is updating its Xbox app on iOS and Android so players can buy games and add-on content, join Game Pass, and redeem Perks directly in-app. The changes will initially be available to beta users before launching for everyone via the Google Play Store on Android devices and the Apple Store on iOS. More <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/04/16/xbox-april-update-buy-games-xbx-app-stream-your-own-game-console/">details an be found in Microsoft's blog post</a>.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-talos-principle-reawakened-launches-on-april-10-for-playstation-5-xbox-series-pc/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened</a> came with a new expansion for players to dig their puzzle teeth into called In the Beginning, on top of everything else in the remaster.</p>
<p>The 18 puzzles in the new expansion are some of the toughest in the entire Talos Principle series, which is a credit to developer Croteam and the Talos Principle community since 16 of those 18 puzzles were designed <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=31026X886738&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.7.1&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwccftech.com%2Fhow-to%2Fthe-talos-principle-reawakened-in-the-beginning-eclipse-puzzle-guide%2F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F2806640%2Fview%2F519709875052217858&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=240&amp;xuuid=856e40b29b36265e272b3ed9bb5c7e57&amp;xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D">in collaboration with members of the game's community</a>.</p>
<p>This guide will walk you through completing the Flying Cubes puzzle in the Egypt section of the In the Beginning expansion in The Talos Principle: Reawakened.</p>
<h2>The Talos Principle: Reawakened - In the Beginning - Flying Cubes Puzzle Guide</h2>
<p>Flying Cubes is a fun puzzle until it's suddenly not, and you're stuck trying to fit the last piece of it together so you can walk out of the puzzle area with your tetromino in tow. 3/4 of the puzzle is relatively easy for any Talos Principle veteran to solve. It's that last bit that takes a little extra finagling you might not immediately think of.</p>
<p>If you just want a hint, I'll say that crossing the beams is your friend here. If you want the solution, read on.</p>
<h3>Phase One</h3>
<p>As in many Talos Principle puzzles, you first need to acquire all the tools you need to solve the rest of the puzzle.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>After entering the puzzle area, look immediately to your left and climb the ladder, where you'll find a jammer and a pressure switch. Grab the jammer, step on the switch, and watch a cube fly through the air onto another pressure switch. Now you understand where the puzzle gets its name and the final objective. You need to get four boxes to fly through the air, land on the four pressure switches, and open the tetromino gate.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Jammer in hand, walk off the ledge, fall back to the ground, and then head further into the rest of the puzzle area, where you'll see two blue barrier shields, one to your left and one in front of you. Use the jammer on the one to your left. Walk past the barrier you just jammed, and you'll see the other two items you need to solve the puzzle. One connector is just out in the open, and another is trapped behind a blue barrier shield.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Use the connector out in the open to free the trapped one by connecting the blue beam with the blue node that turns off the barrier trapping the other connector. Once the shield is down, grab the connector. For simplicity, from here on, I'll be saying C1 for connector 1 and C2 for connector two.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place C1 on the pressure switch that sits immediately in front of the red laser and connect it to the red beam. Grab C2 and connect it to C1 and the other two red nodes in your immediate vicinity. One of those nodes will make your jammer redundant, as they keep the same shield barrier off. Now you can pick up the jammer and bring it to the other side of the barrier so that you have the jammer, C1, and C2 on the same side of the barrier.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Phase Two</h3>
<p>All right, at this point, you have all the tools you need for the puzzle in one place. As you read through the rest of this guide, you'll see that you can do these next parts in whatever order you want, but the way I'm going to lay it out is that you'll do the most confusing part first, so you can breeze through everything else.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>You'll notice that the red nodes you have lasers connected to are both keeping shield barriers off. Take the jammer and walk it across the opposite side of the far shield barrier, the one that leads to a corner of the puzzle area, where you'll find two fans blocking your path to a box and a blue laser behind a window connecting to a blue node that keeps one of the fans operational. Use the jammer to redundantly keep the same shield barrier down that the red laser is already disabling. Make sure you're using it on the inside of the puzzle area with the fans and the box, so you can walk both C1 and C2 to where the jammer is, as you'll need them both for these next steps.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up C1, connect it to the far red node, and place it on the opposite side of the wall where it would directly clash with the blue beam keeping one of the fans on.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up C2 and connect it to where the blue beam is coming from and C1. When you put it down, you'll create a loop that cuts off the beam keeping one of the fans on.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the jammer, and jam the other fan so you can grab the box with both fans turned off. Use the jammer and both connectors to bring the box to the main puzzle area by going through the same steps you used to get to the box in the first place. Then use the jammer to turn off the shield barrier at the top of the stairs.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Walk the box to the top of the stairs and place it directly in front of the fan before stepping on the pressure switch to the right of the fan to activate it. This will send the box flying, where it will land on one of the four pressure switches, which will open the gate to the tetromino.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Phase Three</h3>
<p>Grabbing that box and getting it to its pressure switch final destination took me the longest to figure out and is the most confusing part of this puzzle. Everything from here on out is pretty simple and also pretty easy to spot now that you've been around the whole of the puzzle area.</p>

<ul>
<li>Use the jammer to disable the shield barrier on the left side of the main puzzle area, where you went to grab C1 and C2. You can leave the jammer as is the for the rest of the puzzle.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>The last two boxes are sitting on top of elevated towers, and they're already ready to be launched by fans activated by blue and red laser nodes. Grab C1 and connect it to the blue laser and the blue node on the far right side of the puzzle to launch the first box.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab C1 and place it in front of the red beam on the pressure switch and connect C1 to the red laser. Grab C2 and connect it to C1 and the red node on the left side of the main puzzle area to launch the final box.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<p>With all four boxes on the elevated pressure switches, the gate to the tetromino will drop, and you can grab your prize.</p>

Casting pretense aside, he took his anti-vigilante stance to dictatorial levels by killing the police commissioner and trapping opposing political figures as well as the Punisher (Jon Bernthal) in an underground wine cellar, and placing the greatest city in the world under martial law. D’Onofrio took to X hours after the Season 1 finale was released to inform fans that shooting for the next season has already begun, and sharing a behind-the-scenes photo of Fisk in his cocaine-white power suit. In his <em>Variety</em> interview, he also revealed how Punisher escaping Fisk’s cage will affect the next season.</p><p>“I think that he does know that he’s gone. Eventually, he knows that he’s not there anymore. So far it’s a small part of the second season. We have to see what the one-off thing that they’re planning on doing with the Punisher, that should be interesting to see.” </p><p>The “one-off thing” he’s referring to is a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/jon-bernthal-punisher-special-marvel-disney-1236146371/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/jon-bernthal-punisher-special-marvel-disney-1236146371/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standalone special presentation</a></span> centered around the Punisher, which Bernthal will be co-writing.

What we seemingly shouldn’t expect is for his captor to make an appearance, as D’Onofrio says it would be “news to me” if Kingpin appeared. <br></p><p>Then again, I’m sure Kevin Feige and the Marvel brain trust have taught their lead talent how to hide future plans behind lies. So don’t be surprised if Punisher and Kingpin finally square off when the<em> Punisher</em> special feature is released in 2026, around the time of the second season of <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em>. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Discord is experimenting with a new age-verification policy that would require users to prove their age to see material Discord considers harmful. The verification process is currently undergoing trial in the United Kingdom and Australia, though Discord didn't say how long the test period will last or when--or if--it will roll out in other countries.</p><p dir="ltr">The age verification process applies to all devices, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/discord-comes-to-xbox-for-everyone-today/1100-6507437/" data-ref-id="1100-6507437">Discord on Xbox</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/discord-on-ps5-how-to-link-accounts/1100-6511123/" data-ref-id="1100-6511123">PlayStation 5</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">When a user tries to interact with material that Discord flags with its sensitive media filter, such as potentially explicit images, or tries to change their sensitive media filter settings, a pop-up appears that tells them to verify their age before they can continue. Discord provides two ways to verify: a face scan using your device's camera or using a mobile device to scan an ID card, such as a driver's license. The process reportedly takes just a few minutes, and you receive a direct message from Discord once it's finished that tells you which age group you're in.</p><p dir="ltr">This system invites privacy concerns, though Discord said in an <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/30326565624343-How-to-Verify-Age-Group" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">FAQ section</a> about the new requirement that the data users provide for verification is not stored by Discord or its face-scan vendor. The face scan option is "on-device," which means the vendor doesn't collect or store biometric data. Age verification for Discord is a one-time thing. After the system places a user in a specific age group, that's where they stay until they choose to re-verify. Discord said users can choose to re-verify their age at any time if they believe the system placed them in the incorrect category or, presumably, once they get older and the category no longer applies.</p><p dir="ltr">If the verification process decides your age category is below the minimum required to have a Discord account, it'll automatically ban you. Banned users will have to file an appeal using Discord's underage appeals process to try reversing the ban.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/last-epoch-1-2-builds-best<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Last Epoch 1.2 Tombs of the Erased brings a sentinel rework, Weavers endgame Faction, revamped Monolith of Fate experience, and much more. This is Last Epoch’s biggest update yet and IGN has teamed up with the ARPG experts at Maxroll to prepare detailed guides on all of the new content along with excellent builds for leveling and endgame alike. Before we get to the builds, here’s all the new stuff coming in 1.2:</p><h2 data-cy="title2">New 1.2 Tombs of the Erased Content</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/01-new-content-woven-faction-1744819698558.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Woven Faction</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the biggest changes in 1.2 is the new Woven Faction. They provide a deeper endgame experience by adding Woven Echoes to your Monolith of Fate. Begin interacting with them by finding a Cemetery of the Erased on your Echo Web, after completing the mini-boss at the end you can enter the Haven of Silk and speak to Masque to join the faction. Gain ranks with the Woven Faction by completing Woven Echoes to add points to your Weaver Tree then use these points to customize your endgame experience.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Champions &amp; Mini-bosses</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">As you explore the Echo Web, you may also find some fun new surprises in the form of Champions, and new weaver mini-bosses. The Champions are larger, more powerful versions of rares, immediately visible due to their angry red glow. Defeating them is tricky but if you persevere you’re sure to be duly rewarded. There are also several new mini-bosses you can encounter in 1.2, so keep an eye out for a scary-looking boss as you explore the Monolith of Fate.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Set Item Crafting and LP Changes</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Last Epoch has an in-depth <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/resources/beginner-crafting-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Crafting System</a> where you use Affix Shards, Glyphs, and Runes to heavily customize your items. This popular system is straighforward to understand and has a fair bit of depth to master. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 1.2, crafting in Last Epoch gets even better. You can break Set items down to obtain crafting shards and then use those to craft set bonuses on your items. This gives you the best of both worlds where you have the power of a set bonus and the flexibility to craft your own gear with the affixes you need. EHG has also made a big change to how you use Unique items with Legendary Potential (LP) to craft Legendary items. In the past, when interacting with the Eternity Cache the modifiers added to your Legendary Items were chosen at random. So if you used a 1LP Unique, you get a Legendary with 1 random affix, if you use a 2LP Unique, you get a Legendary with 2 random affixes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, if you complete a Temporal Sanctum of level 2 or higher you can choose 1 affix to transfer to your Legendary! This means you get to pick what you want when using a 1 LP Unique, if you use an item with 2-4 LP, then you get to pick 1 affix and the remaining modifiers are chosen at random.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Uber Aberroth</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Last Epoch’s ultimate boss is getting even tougher with 1.2. In addition to the normal version of this encounter, there is a special Uber Aberroth encounter. Very little is known about this foe beyond the fact that he is the most dangerous being in Eterra. Challenge him at your own risk!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1.2 Tombs of the Erased Leveling Builds</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Use Maxroll’s leveling builds to cruise through the campaign with ease. Season 2 introduces the ability to switch your Mastery so you can level with the most efficient build for the campaign, then respec your mastery upon reaching the endgame. Here are the best ways to level each of the game’s 5 classes, straight from Last Epoch’s top speed runner Terek!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/primalist-build-1744820944042.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Primalist</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The best way to level a Primalist is by playing Druid. This build has good damage, it’s very cozy as you can use transformations to spam your skills during the campaign, and gets quite tanky thanks to Werebear form.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/mage-build-1744820963651.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Mage</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Spellblade mastery seamlessly weaves blades and spells to decimate foes using Shatter Strike. You are reliant on spells in the early game but once you get Shatter Strike most of your time is spent rotating between Shatter Strike for damage and Mana Strike to recover your resources to continue dealing damage. Don’t be fooled by the Mage’s health, you can easily generate tons of Ward just by hitting enemies.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/sentinel-build-1744820980104.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Sentinel</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Hot off the rework, Sentinel is stronger than ever. The most efficient way to level is by playing Paladin to get easy access to Resistances and Holy Aura for both offensive and defensive bonuses. Crusade your way through the campaign burning enemies in the holy fire of your Judgment!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/acolyte-build-1744820998394.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Acolyte</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">As an Acolyte you are a master of the undead and the profane. Embrace your inner darkness and become a Warlock to create rifts in reality which unleash a volley of Chaos Bolt. The Chthonic Fissure skill provides great persistent damage for clearing while your Summoned Infernal Shades melt bosses with their hellish assault.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/16/rogue-build-1744821018335.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3">Rogue</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Rogue levels with her trusty Falcon Companion, flying through levels with ease and grace. This Falconer build is easy to scale with great sustain thanks to the Melee Leech affix on gear. With a bit of investment into Health, Regen and Physical Resistance, this Rogue becomes a well-rounded beast of a build.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1.2 Tombs of the Erased Endgame Builds</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">After you complete the campaign, you enter Last Epoch’s endgame. Maxroll’s Last Epoch team has been extensively testing a wide variety of endgame builds to dominate in the Monolith of Fate. While all of these builds are powerful, you can use Maxroll’s tier lists to see how they compare across different kinds of content.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Heartseeker Marksman</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/heartseeker-marksman-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heartseeker Marksman</a> uses a new skill which seeks enemy targets and triggers a spectacular display of Fire and Cold Projectiles that cover the entire screen. Watch your enemies evaporate as they get blasted by your Attacks and Spells!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The build revolves around dealing Damage with Heartseeker and proccing an insane amount of Dragonfire from Dragonsong. Heartseeker also triggers Burning Dagger for even more craziness. This Marksman has incredible mobility and utility thanks to Shift, Smoke Bomb, Shurikens, and unspecialized Decoy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Amazing DPS</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Fast Clear Speed</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Deals Damage While Moving</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Insane Scaling with Gear and Uniques</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Active Playstyle</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Needs Uniques to Shine</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Survivability Relies on Gear</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Defensive Tools Require Timing</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Judgement Paladin</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/judgement-paladin-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Judgement Paladin</a> creates Consecrated Ground with Judgement, to burn enemies with holy fire. Become the Judge and cleanse your foes of impurity, as they hopelessly try to break through your immense defenses. This build is a natural continuation of the Paladin Leveling Build, making it extremely easy to play as your first character of the season.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Judgement Paladin deals Fire Spell Damage Over Time with Consecrated Ground and generates Mana with Vengeance. Consecrated Ground also grants massive Healing, since multiple instances can stack on top of each other. Use Holy Aura and Symbols of Hope for great passive buffs. Healing Hands grants Ward and Healing, while acting as your Movement Skill.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Insane Tankiness</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Exceptional Sustain</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ High Single Target DPS</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Amazing Scaling With Gear and Uniques</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Limited AoE</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Average Clear Speed</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Needs Legendaries To Shine</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Generator/Spender Playstyle</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Warpath Void Knight</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/echo-warpath-void-knight-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Warpath Void Knight</a> uses Warpath to wipe the battlefield clean of enemies. Stay spinning to increase your Damage and AoE until Warpath almost covers the whole screen. Unleash the Spin-to-Win playstyle with this build!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Warpath Void Knight specializes into Warrior's Fury to reach amazing levels of Void Melee Damage and Area of Effect. Warpath costs more Mana every second, but thanks to the Void Well Passive and Mana stacking, you can stay spinning for a long time. The Void Well Passive is mandatory when you have Warrior's Fury allocated. Devouring Orb, Anomaly, Symbols of Hope, and Abyssal Echoes grant powerful buffs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Amazing AoE</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Extreme Clear Speed</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Very Simple Gameplay</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Excellent Single Target DPS</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Gear Dependent</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Average Tankiness</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Needs Legendaries To Shine</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Requires Mana Investment</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Tornado Shaman</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Summon the fury of the storm with this <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/tornado-shaman-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tornado Shaman Guide</a> as you strike down foes from afar. This build invokes Tornados onto the battlefield that rapidly calls Storm Bolts down on enemies in an enormous area. Speed through monoliths and destroy bosses with this outstanding build.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Place down long-lasting Tornados on the battlefield that rapidly cast Storm Bolts thanks to Charged Storm for huge Lightning damage. Gathering Storm allows you to drastically increase the damage of those storm bolts while Summon Spriggan, Warcry, and Maelstrom offer you some amazing offensive and defensive bonuses. Since you are not casting Gathering Storm manually, you can equip an unspecialized Fury Leap for mobility.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Insane Tankiness</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Exceptional Sustain</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ High Single Target DPS</p><p data-cy="paragraph">✔️ Amazing Scaling With Gear and Uniques</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Limited AoE</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Weaker Defensively While Moving</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Optimal Play Requires Standing Still</p><p data-cy="paragraph">❌ Summon Spriggan Dies Often And Needs To Be Resummoned</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Stygian Coal Lich</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/build-guides/stygian-coal-lich-guide" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stygian Coal Lich Guide</a> harnesses the power of undeath in the form of Stygian Beams.

Builds are compared based on their Endgame Planner Setup.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Bossing</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Use Maxroll's <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/tierlists/bossing-tier-list" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bossing Tier List</a> to see which builds excel at taking down Monolith Bosses, Dungeons Bosses, and Pinnacle Content. Maxroll considers many factors when placing the builds but mainly focuses on Overall reliable DPS. Builds are compared based on their Endgame Planner Setup.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hardcore</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Maxroll's <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/tierlists/hardcore-tier-list" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hardcore Tier List</a> ranks a build's suitability for the optional permadeath mode “Hardcore”. Therefore the builds are primarily ranked based on their raw survivability and reliability, even on their Starting Planner Setup. Unlike the other tier lists, the early game gearing is given higher weight here, because a single death means losing your character when playing on Hardcore.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Speed Farming</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Maxroll's <a href="https://maxroll.gg/last-epoch/tierlists/speed-farming-tier-list" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speed Farming Tier List</a> ranks a build's ability to speed through content. Naturally, speed is the main factor, which means the ability to AoE down mobs, move quickly, and maintain this speed even at high corruption. Builds are compared based on their Endgame Planner Setup.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>This article was created by IGN Staff with help from the Maxroll Last Epoch Team.</em>
