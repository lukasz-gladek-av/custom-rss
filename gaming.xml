<p>Ready for your Asterism Voyage?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Dragami Games has announced that its mecha strategy title, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/relayer-advanced-definitive-edition">Relayer Advanced Definitive Edition</a> will launch for Switch 2 on <strong>25th September</strong>. By Jove, that's today!</p>
<p>Relayer Advanced, which sees you assume the role of Starchildren in a battle against the alien Relayer, has already seen release on various other platforms since its debut back in 2022, and this snazzy new Switch 2 version comes complete with all previously released DLC and spin-off story content.</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar, the 'Advanced' version is a souped-up take of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/relayer">Relayer</a> from March 2022 (the Advanced rejig launched the following October), which sits with <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/relayer/">a Metascore of 77</a>. So, if you like SRPGs featuring big robots leathering chunks out of each other in space (and let's face it, who doesn't?), then it seems there's gonna be plenty of faces to get busy leathering for you.</p>
<p>Here's some further info from the game's PR blurb, plus some screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Players will command the "Stellar Gear" unit that the Starchildren board and battle against the "Relayer" forces. On stage, players will lead their troops to victory by making full use of such strategic systems as "Hate," which quantifies how easily enemies target you, "Skills" specific to jobs and characters, "Backstab," which launches pincer attacks, and "Big Bang," a special move.</p>
<p>This is the complete version that includes the main game as well as all previously released DLC.</p>
<p>Command a unit of "Stella Gear," humanoid weapons created using the technology of an ancient galactic civilization, and defend Earth from invasion by the mysterious lifeforms known as "Relayer."</p>
<p>There are a total of approximately 100 cutscenes that are played when units battle each other.</p>
<p>The stage maps are also rendered in high-quality full 3D.</p>
<p>There is also "Hate," which indicates how likely you are to be targeted by the enemy, a wide variety of skills, and special attacks such as the pincer attack "Backstab" and the special move "Big Bang."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As well as all of the above tweaks, the game also includes a full English dub alongside its Japanese vocals. Hooray!</p>
<p>There's no pricing on Nintendo's US site just yet, but in the UK it'll set you back Â£29.50.</p>

                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/honkai-nexus-anima/" data-ref-id="5000-693126">Honkai: Nexus Anima</a> is the next chapter in the HoYoverse, and we've recently gotten more details about what the game is going to be about. The Honkai franchise has always been known for its anime-style graphics, quick and fluid combat, and addictive gameplay that keeps players coming back for more with every new installment. While Honkai: Nexus Anima is keeping many of those same elements, the developers are also changing up the core gameplay loop in some significant ways. Of course, you can still expect a similar feeling as the four previous games, but Nexus Anima is breathing some fresh ideas into the franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">While we don't know everything about the new Honkai title, we've seen plenty of gameplay and heard enough details to get a good idea of what it has in store for the community. Below, you can see everything that we currently know about Honkai: Nexus Anima, including its release date, trailers, gameplay, and all other details in between.</p><h2 dir="ltr">When will Honkai: Nexus Anima be released?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568303-1c9a3d9c-b411-490e-82d0-2e6a5e2b42a5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568303" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2208" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568303-1c9a3d9c-b411-490e-82d0-2e6a5e2b42a5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568303"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568303-1c9a3d9c-b411-490e-82d0-2e6a5e2b42a5.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">At the time of writing, a release date for Honkai: Nexus Anima has not been announced by the developers at miHoYo. The game was only just recently formally announced on August 28, 2025, with some official screenshots, trailers, and information coming with that announcement.</p><p dir="ltr">However, no release date has been offered just yet. According to some rumors and how the development of the game is going, though, it seems like early 2026 is the most likely release window for Honkai: Nexus Anima at this time. Take that with a grain of salt, of course, as things can change drastically and we still don't know anything concrete.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Preorder Honkai: Nexus Anima</h2><p dir="ltr">One of the best parts about most new Honkai titles is that they are all free-to-play. The most recent game in the series, Honkai: Star Rail, was free-to-play at its launch in 2023, and that hasn't changed since.</p><p dir="ltr">As such, no preorders are necessary for Honkai: Nexus Anima, as you won't actually be able to purchase the game. This also means there are likely no editions for the game either. However, the developers haven't officially confirmed the free-to-play nature of the game, so Nexus Anima having a price tag attached to it can't be ruled out just yet. It would be a major change for the franchise if the game wasn't free-to-play, though.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Watch the Honkai: Nexus Anima Trailer here</h2><p dir="ltr">Currently, there are two Honkai: Nexus Anima trailers you can watch that both come directly from the developer. One is a trailer for the private gameplay test that began in September, and the other is a gameplay trailer that showcases some of the new elements in Nexus Anima. You can watch both of them below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V5FV_6jirKU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V5FV_6jirKU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dGfTS72aEOs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dGfTS72aEOs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The first trailer, titled "Nexus Bond Teaser: Side by Side," is more of a cinematic trailer than anything. It features some of the characters and Anima that you'll see throughout the game. However, it mainly showcases the world that you'll get to explore, and the graphics are certainly a major highlight.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the second trailer, titled "In-game footage from Honkai: Nexus Anima," this is where we get into actual gameplay. The trailer shows off some of the gameplay mechanics that are being introduced with the game, as well as more characters and Anima. There's a look at the flying mechanic, a full-length battle, character creation, and a broader view of the world map.</p><p dir="ltr">Both of these trailers were released when Nexus Anima was announced in late August, and it's not currently known when a new trailer could arrive.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Honkai: Nexus Anima Platforms</h2><p dir="ltr">As of right now, we know for sure that Honkai: Nexus Anima will be releasing on PC, iOS, and Android devices. This is the same trend that recent Honkai games have followed, but Honkai: Star Rail also eventually came to PlayStation 5. This occurred roughly six months following the game's initial release date.</p><p dir="ltr">We don't know if the developers have a console release date in mind for Nexus Anima. If the developers are planning a PS5 or Xbox version, though, we'll likely hear about it closer to the game's actual release date. Even then, we can assume that a console port wouldn't arrive until after the game launches on its standard platforms.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Honkai: Nexus Anima Story, Setting, and Characters</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568302-659581d4-8864-4527-bb0e-07cb694b893f.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568302" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2208" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568302-659581d4-8864-4527-bb0e-07cb694b893f.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568302"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568302-659581d4-8864-4527-bb0e-07cb694b893f.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Not too much about the story of Honkai: Nexus Anima has been revealed just yet. However, we do know the game takes place in a seaside town with dense urban elements. You can travel through the metropolis or take a stroll with your Anima down one of the several beach boulevards. The map in Nexus Anima seems to be quite large, so there's no shortage of places to explore.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll also meet a variety of characters throughout the world, and many of them can be interacted with by you or your Anima. The main characters in Nexus Anima don't have too many details around them just yet, as the developers are likely waiting to reveal more of the main story.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Honkai: Nexus Anima Gameplay</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568301-ac5a72b3-8989-439c-9085-69a006c09471.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568301" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2208" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568301-ac5a72b3-8989-439c-9085-69a006c09471.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568301"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4568301-ac5a72b3-8989-439c-9085-69a006c09471.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">At its core, Honkai: Nexus Anima is a "creature-collector" game, which is akin to something like PokÃ©mon. Players can head out into a large, open world and collect different creatures that will then be added to their party. These creatures are called "Anima."</p><p dir="ltr">While you can battle with these Anima and face off against other NPCs, your Anima aren't solely meant for that purpose. They also have utility during exploration and other areas, making your priorities for capturing one different from what they might be in a game like PokÃ©mon. For example, some Anima are efficient at cleaning up the streets of the city by picking up trash, while others can actually work in stores and interact with potential customers. You can also level up your Anima, who all start at level 10, through a star-based system. Anima are leveled up through experience in combat.</p><p dir="ltr">When it comes to battling, though, Anima have unique combat roles. These are defined by the Anima's in-game "Trait," which tells you more about how they will battle. One example of a Trait is the Gladiator, which likely means an Anima is going to be more fierce in combat.</p><p dir="ltr">To further help out Anima and customize them, each one has three gear slots that can be filled with gear you find out in the open world. Some gear will be more tailored to certain types of Anima, so it might be crucial to seek out that specific gear if you want to use one Anima in particular.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of using Anima, you don't have a traditional party of these creatures like in other games of this nature. Instead, Honkai: Nexus Anima uses a deck-building system that allows you to customize a deck of your acquired Anima. When you head into battle, you'll roll out the deck you've assembled based on real-time elements. Your deck won't be randomly rolled, so you can pick and choose which Anima appear in a battle depending on external factors.</p><p dir="ltr">Battling follows an auto-chess system, but there are several other elements that come into play as well. When a battle begins, you'll send out your Anima, and an "Animaster" will provide a buff to your creatures as combat starts. You can also utilize the assistance slots on the battlefield, which can be used by both teams and offer support in the form of healing, extra damage, etc.</p>

            <p>Sega has revealed the post-launch roadmap for Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, including last night's announcement that Mega Man will be joining next year as paid DLC.</p>
<p>Capcom's iconic hero will be joined by Proto Man too, plus there will be a Dr. Wily's Castle course and a vehicle inspired by canine companion Rush.</p>
<p>The DLC will be available in Q2 next year in the third patch of the game's Season Pass. That begins later this year with the addition of Minecraft and SpongeBob Squarepants, with Pac-Man to follow early next year.</p>

<p>Then, Q3 of 2026 will see the arrival of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a> and anime Avatar Legends. Each Season Pass Content Pack includes playable characters, a new vehicle, a new track, emotes and sounds.</p>
<p>In addition, there will be a number of free updates adding new characters and more. Hatsune Miku and Sonic Prime characters are available at launch for Digital Deluxe owners. Then later this year Joker from Persona 5 and Ichiban from Like A Dragon will be added, along with another unknown character.</p>
<p>More free additions will arrive in each quarter next year. You can see the roadmap in the image below.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-leak-reveals-more-iconic-characters-coming-to-its-roster-which-retro-fans-will-love">Mega Man's inclusion leaked last week</a>, so his reveal at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-in-playstations-latest-state-of-play-showcase">last night's PlayStation State of Play</a> came as little surprise.</p>
<p>However, the back of the physical box includes artwork for Sega Saturn icon NiGHTS, with fans presuming the jester character will be one of the free characters coming to the game.</p>
<p>Who else do you hope to see join Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds?</p>

            <p>The next grand open-world setting for the next <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a> game will be Japan, Microsoft has accidentally announced, and it will be released in 2026.</p>
<p>The announcement came via an Instagram post on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/forzahorizonofficial/">the official Forza Horizon account</a>. This let slip, ahead of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-tokyo-game-show-2025-broadcast-live-watch-it-with-us">Tokyo Game Show 2025 Xbox briefing</a> today, that "The Horizon Festival is heading to Japan. Coming 2026." The post has since been removed. Whoops!</p>

<p>The full announcement is expected to occur in the Xbox briefing that's only moments away - due to begin at 11am UK time. How much of the game we'll see, we don't yet know, nor how much of Japan it will allow us to explore.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-5">Forza Horizon 5</a> was released four years ago now, in 2021, and this year debuted on PlayStation 5, in the spring. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-now-has-one-of-the-greatest-racing-games-of-all-time-and-it-feels-like-im-cheating-on-my-xbox?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAYnJpZBExNHhTNEVIUmNRc1d6dFJ3ZgEeNeEeu8Qu5tD-zcBwnMvjnEelfLbKhqomunPmhYChqepr7UZmU8nQvQuCyqw_aem_FMSnw25d-mSOyt9PPW3ayQ">Tom thinks it's one of the greatest racing games of all time</a>. Given that, the question of whether this new instalment could launch on PlayStation 5 is probably more "when?" rather than "if?". Or, "How long will Microsoft keep it exclusive to Xbox for?"</p>

		<p>Just ahead of the Xbox Tokyo Game Show event at 11AM UK time, Forza Horizon 6 has leaked, confirming that &nbsp;the next entry in the open world racer is heading to Japan, when it launches in 2026.</p>



<p>The teaser shows a number of license plates from the locations that the series has visited in the past, before panning past some Japanese memorabilia and up to reveal Mount Fuji off in the distance.</p>
<p>The leak came from Forzaâs own social media accounts, posting the teaser to Instagram almost 12 hours ago, and itâs seemingly appearing as an advert across social streams. With the cat out of the bag â the neko, if you will â it seems theyâve just left it all live.</p>
<p>No word on platform specifics just yet, but the game is definitely coming to Xbox Series X|S and PC at launch, with Xbox Play Anywhere and availability on Game Pass. Whether itâs day and date for PS5 as well, we wonât have to wait too long to find out, I suspect.</p>

<p>What's more, the studios have revealed the new Titanic Scion update roadmap, so we can get an idea of everything on the horizon. It's near-identical to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/daemon-x-machina-titanic-scion-roadmap-outlined">the one showcased earlier this month</a>, but it's always nice to know what's in the pipeline.</p>
<p>The free 'Iris Outfit' DLC will still land on 2nd October, followed by more new bosses and cosmetic items on 16th October. The 'Into the Abyss' Expansion Pack will then arrive as a paid add-on in November, before a batch of three bosses land for free in December.</p>

<p>We had a decent enough time with Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion's mech combat when it launched on Switch 2, but felt that the whole thing was sullied by a less than perfect performance. Here's hoping that this update moves things in the right direction.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 Game-Key cards are far from being the most popular game format among users, but they are proving to be way more popular among developers, as they allow them to overcome some of the limitations of traditional cartridges, according to Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director Naoki Hamaguchi.</p>



<p>Speaking with German publication <a href="https://jpgames.de/2025/09/final-fantasy-director-hofft-dass-ihr-game-key-cards-eines-tages-moegen-koennt/">JP Games</a>, Hamaguchi-san acknowledged why users don't like them, but from a developer's perspective, the discussion on Game-Key cards is much different. This new format allows developers to overcome storage restrictions, as releasing on a Game-Key card allows the developer to overcome the Nintendo Switch 2 cartridges 64 GB limitation.</p>



<p>The biggest issue for developers, especially those making high-end AAA games, is the loading speed of traditional cartridges, which is slower than the speed of solid-state drives. By releasing games on Nintendo Switch 2 in this <em>"semi-download"</em> format, developers can leverage the faster loading speed of the console's internal storage, allowing them to release their AAA games on the system.</p>



<p>While acknowledging how users may not like Nintendo Switch 2 Game-Key cards, the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth director hopes that, in time, they will come to like them and accept them as part of the culture of gaming on the system. Not only is using them optional for a developer, but it also allows studios to release high-end experiences that may not have hit the system without them.</p>



<p>Since their reveal alongside the system this April, the Nintendo Switch 2 Game-Key cards have been somewhat controversial, especially among those who like actual physical releases. While some developers worked their magic and managed to release their huge AAA games on a regular cartridge, like&nbsp;CD Projekt Red did with Cyberpunk 2077, others made it clear, like Naoki Hamaguchi, that traditional carts have limitations that<span> force them to release their games on Game-Key cards, like in the Star Wars Outlaws case. The open-world game launched on a Game-Key card</span> as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-forced-choice/">Switch 2 cartridges didn't give the performance needed at the quality target the developer was going for.</a></p>

<p>The remaster is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3131640/Deus_Ex_Remastered/">set to hit PC on February 5th, 2026</a>. As you can see in the trailer above and as explained in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/24/deus-ex-remastered-launches-february-5-on-ps5/">PS blog</a>, it gives the original game a visual facelift that smooths out some of its old school blockiness, with revamped character models that boast "smoother lip-sync animations and ragdoll physics". Elsewhere in visuals department, Aspyr and Eidos have touched up the various environs JC Denton sneaks or shoots through with "reimagined lighting, dynamic shadows, water physics, particle effects, and fully updated textures".</p>
<p>They've also worked in some quality-of-life additions like autosaves, zippier loading times, achievement tracking, and cloud saves "across supported platforms". Rounding things out is revamped support for controllers which "draws inspiration from what Eidos-MontrÃ©al pioneered in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deus-ex-human-revolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a> and Mankind Divided" with "refined radial menus, fluid weapon management, and streamlined navigation". Plus, setups with ultrawide or multiple monitors will work out of the gate.</p><p>So, a very remastery remaster. The question is whether it'll be as tempting a purchase for PC folks as I imagine it'll be on console. As of writing, the original Deus Ex's game of the year edition can be grabbed for less than Â£1/â¬1/$1 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/6910/Deus_Ex_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/">Steam</a> thanks to a deal running until September 29th. Over on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/deus_ex">GOG.com</a>, it's currently Â£5.99, but is also part of the platform's preservation program, meaning GOG themselves have made sure it runs as it should on modern hardware.</p>
<p>Add in the fact that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/397550/Deus_Ex_Revision/">both</a> <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/deus_ex_revision_mod">platforms</a> host the Deus Ex Revision mod which offers a substantial fan-made revamp of the game, and it's tough to say whether the Â£22.49/â¬26.09/$26.99 that's been stapled to the remaster right now - set to go up to Â£24.99 and equivalents once it's out - will be that appealing to folks keen for an Extra dose of Deus.</p>
<p>Time will tell if going the full remake route might've been a better call on Aspyr's part, at least from a PC-centric perspective.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> is set to release on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> and Xbox next January and will come with boost features familiar to players of the Pixel Remasters, known as Streamlined Progression.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has confirmed to Eurogamer these boosts will also be coming to the PS5 and PC versions of the game in a future update, though there's no date yet. The PC version's enhanced lighting features will be coming to PS5 too.</p>
<p>As outlined previously in a <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-switch2-xbox-series-x-s">Square Enix blog</a>, players will have access to a new menu where they can implement a number of boosts such as HP full, MP full, Limit gauge full, and maximum damage dealt, which can be toggled individually.</p>

<p>"I feel that the way people enjoy content has become more flexible these days, as we see with video streaming platforms, and that people also want the same thing from games, with options to tailor the experience based on the time they have and their levels of interest," said director Naoki Hamaguchi. "I have also had personal experiences where I wanted to play something with the limited time I have but gave up because of the time it takes to level up characters or traverse the game.</p>
<p>"Thatâs exactly why I think that the Streamlined Progression feature is very effective - to give players smooth access to the story."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Hamaguchi stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> is "doing very well" on PS5 and PC in an interview with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-selling-well-no-need-to-worry-about-the-trilogys-finale-director-naoki-hamaguchi-says/">Automaton</a>, so there's no need to worry about part three.</p>
<p>For its remake of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>, Square Enix decided to create a trilogy. But as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">sales appear to have decreased with each installment</a>, some fans have been worried about the quality of the third game, presuming the company may be keen to move on.</p>
<p>"I know some fans have expressed concerns, but please rest assured, we'll be able to deliver a proper, high-quality third installment," said Hamaguchi.</p>
<p>He additionally provided a status update on the project.</p>
<p>"Development is going extremely well, and the game is shaping up nicely," he said. "A lot of the content is already playable, and the game's direction and form are firmly set in place. Right now, the team is united around refining everything."</p><p>For now, the game remains without a release date, but as Remake is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-gets-switch-2-release-date">heading to Switch 2 and Xbox in January</a>, and Square Enix has confirmed the whole trilogy will be coming to both platforms too, the final part presumably won't be released until after then. Perhaps it'll even be a simultaneous multiplatform release.</p>
<p>Indeed, the multiplatform release of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake project will certainly boost sales, helping to counter any decline in sales.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/final-fantasy-7-director-on-xbox">Windows Central</a>, Hamaguchi declared himself an Xbox fan. "I'm going to do my best to make sure that Square Enix can continue to reach a wider audience, including Xbox," he said. "So thank you from me as well."</p>
<p>He also discussed optimising the game for the Xbox Series S, which is notoriously tricky due to its lower specs.</p>
<p>"In terms of hardware specs, I would say the Xbox Series S is actually quite solid in terms of spec," said Hamaguchi. "We didn't come across much of a processing challenge, but many of the challenges were more memory related.</p><p>"Optimisation is something we were strongly cognizant of as we worked on the PC version as well. For Final Fantasy 7 Remake, we took some of the philosophies found in Nanite for Unreal Engine 5 and created our own solution for Unreal Engine 4. We were successful in delivering stable graphics there, and gain Steam Deck verification as well. We have been pretty proud of what we were able to achieve, even on lower spec systems."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Final Fantasy 16 producer Naoki Yoshida has hinted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-producer-hints-at-possible-switch-2-version">that game may also be headed to Switch 2</a>.</p>

<p>This mode, absent from the launch version of the game, will be available to owners of the game across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. This online mode is a competitive "hide-and-seek" style PvP mode where players have to find and take each other out using any tools they can find.</p>
<p>Up to 12-players can take part in a match at any one time, though <a href="https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000001255.000050711.html">according to the official Konami press release</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-fox-hunt-will-not-support-cross-play-konami-confirms">crossplay is still not supported</a>.</p>

<p>There are two available game modes: Survival Capture and Survival Intrude. The first is a capture the flag style mode where players must secure a dwindling number of cute green Kerotan, and the latter a battle royale style mode where players must battle over a shrinking play area.</p><p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater has proven popular, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-surpasses-a-million-sales-on-launch-day">selling over a million copies on its launch day earlier this month</a>. Since its launch the game has received <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-stability-improvements-promised-as-new-patch-addresses-crashes-and-textures">a variety of patches to improve stability and performance</a>, some good news for those who were waiting to give it a try.</p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is itself a fantastic recreation of the original game. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-review">In Eurogamer's review</a> it's described as "an achievement for the development team behind Delta too, some of whom were original staff from the Metal Gear Solid 3 team. The legend of Metal Gear Solid 3 has been brought back to life thanks to their efforts, and the experience of playing it has put me in a position I could not have foreseen just a few years ago."</p>

The company, completely by surprise, has released a new Fire Emblem game for mobile devices called Fire Emblem Shadows, and itâs an unlikely blend of strategy and social deduction.</p><p>Fire Emblem Shadows gives players control of a party of warriors, and asks them to choose between Light and Shadow. As the team progresses through dungeons, the player must determine which of his allies is a traitor, and act accordingly before itâs too late.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hqMRXKUNwo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6hqMRXKUNwo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Battles play out in a strategy format that doesnât quite follow the usual Fire Emblem way, but does contain some elements of it.

			<p>During yesterday's State of Play, Bandai Namco shared a new Code Vein II trailer that unveiled the game's release date. The sequel to 2019's Soulslike action RPG will release on January 30, 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Pre-orders are open now, with the Standard Edition priced at $69.99, the Deluxe Edition priced at $89.99 (including 3-day early access, the Mask of Idris expansion DLC coming in January 2027, and a Custom Outfit Pack with three costume sets and one weapon), and the Ultimate Edition priced at $99.99 with all the above plus a digital mini artbook and soundtrack and a Character Costume Set that comes with six costumes based on characters from the original game.</p>



<p>A Collector's Edition is also exclusively available <a href="https://t.co/9GBTiLv45w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from the Bandai Namco Store</a>. Priced at $179.99, it gets players all the aforementioned digital bonuses and the following physical goodies:</p>



<ul>
<li>60-page 25x25cm artbook</li>



<li>18cm figurine of character Lou Magmell</li>



<li>Exclusive Steelbook</li>
</ul>



<p>Code Vein II <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-announced-with-new-cinematic-trailer-launches-in-2026-on-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was first announced during Summer Game Fest 2025</a>. This sequel builds upon the previous installment's foundation to improve in key areas, as outlined in a new gameplay presentation video that you'll find embedded below.</p>



<p>To begin with, the character creation system is much more robust and detailed than in the original, allowing customization of details such as eyes, hair, scars, and even outfits, hats, masks, and accessories. Being a Soulslike, the combat system is of paramount importance. The developers are evolving it by introducing new weapon types and strategies, such as the bayonet weapon, which blends ranged and melee combat and requires ammunition. The game also retains the core mechanic of building up bleed status on enemies to capitalize with jail attacks, but now the jail weapon types vary more, giving players tactical flexibility tailored to their style. The boss fights promise to be more epic thanks to multi-phase battles and more dynamic enemy abilities. </p>



<p>The companion system was also significantly expanded. In Code Vein II, companions not only fight alongside the player but can even be âassimilatedâ to provide passive buffs and additional powers. Each companion also has unique abilities, such as Lou, the revenant who can control time.</p>



<p>Narratively, the game introduces a stronger focus on time travel, with the protagonist and companions traveling to the past to save the future. The world exploration also sounds more interactive, with map objects that unlock new areas and crafting mechanics involving consumables like flour for creating buffs and healing items.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During Sony's September State of Play event, South Korean developer Pearl Abyss announced the final launch date for its long-awaited game Crimson Desert.</p>



<p>The open world action/adventure title will be available starting on March 19, 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Pre-orders are open now across all platforms, with the Standard Edition priced $69.99 and a Digital Deluxe Edition priced $79.99. The latter provides access to some in-game extra cosmetics:</p>



<ul>
<li>Kairos Plate Helm</li>



<li>Kairos Plate Gloves</li>



<li>Kairos Plate Boots</li>



<li>Kairos Cloak</li>



<li>Kairos Plate Armor</li>



<li>Balgran Shield</li>



<li>Exclaire Champron</li>



<li>Exclaire Barding</li>



<li>Exclaire Saddle</li>



<li>Exclaire Stirrups</li>
</ul>



<p>A physical Deluxe Edition will be available for $10 more and also includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Deluxe Edition Limited SteelBook</li>



<li>Map of Pywel</li>



<li>Letter from the Developer</li>



<li>Greymane Brooch Pin</li>



<li>3 Character Photo Cards</li>



<li>3 Patches</li>
</ul>



<p>A physical Collector's Edition is priced at $279.99 and adds a stunning 17â Diorama as well as a digital Ultimate Pack that gives players a Tormented Soul Bow, Derictus Spear, Sielos Longsword, Shroud Lantern, and Hyperion Horse Tack Set. All Crimson Desert pre-orders also include the Khaled Shield, and all PS5 pre-orders get the exclusive Grotevant Plate Set. This may be all that remains of t<a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-is-reportedly-looking-to-partner-with-korean-studios-starting-with-pearl-abyss-for-crimson-desert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hat rumor from two years ago about Pearl Abyss partnering with Sony on the game</a>.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>With the game's pre-orders opening, Pearl Abyss also updated its <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously shared PC system requirements</a>. The minimum specs are exactly the same, but the recommended specs have been greatly reduced from the previous recommendations of Ryzen 7 7700X / i7-13700K CPU and RTX 4070 SUPER / RX 7800 XT GPU to Ryzen 5 5600 / i5-11600K and RTX 2080 / RX 6700 XT, likely as a result of ongoing optimization. The Steam page also now lists the macOS requirements, which we have reported below:</p>



<p><strong>MINIMUM:<br></strong>Requires an Apple processor<br><strong>OS:</strong> MacOS 15<br><strong>Processor:</strong> Apple M1<br><strong>Memory:</strong> 16 GB RAM<br><strong>Graphics: </strong>M1<br><strong>Storage:</strong> 135 GB available space</p>



<p><strong>RECOMMENDED:<br></strong>Requires an Apple processor<br><strong>OS:</strong> MacOS 26<br><strong>Processor:</strong> Apple M4 Pro<br><strong>Memory: </strong>16 GB RAM<br><strong>Graphics:</strong> M3 Pro<br><strong>Storage: </strong>150 GB available space</p>



<p>Crimson Desert is powered by the rather impressive proprietary BlackSpace Engine, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-blackspace-engine-showcase-demonstrates-big-tech-advancements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we have covered in detail in our GDC 2025 report</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The end of the road is finally in sight for the second triple-A game developed by the studio currently known for the MMORPG Black Desert. Crimson Desert was originally announced pre-COVID at G-Star 2019 and even had a Winter 2021 launch window at some point before <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-open-world-multiplayer-game-delayed-indefinitely-by-pearl-abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being delayed indefinitely</a>. Initially, the game was meant to feature some MMO-like elements, but it was revamped into a full-fledged single player action/adventure title, which inevitably required a lot of work. </p>



<p>It won't be long before we judge for ourselves whether the change and the wait were worth it. In the meantime, stay tuned for additional Crimson Desert coverage.</p>

This is noticeable early on during the <strong>altar puzzle</strong>, the game's first puzzle sequence you'll encounter. If this early puzzle has you stumped, don't worry, we have the solution right here to help you. Here's how to solve the <strong>Silent Hill f altar puzzle</strong>.</p><h2>Silent Hill f - altar puzzle guide</h2><p>This first puzzle won't be as tricky as some of those you'll encounter later, like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-f-shrine-vault-puzzle-guide/1100-6534872/" data-ref-id="1100-6534872">shrine vault puzzle</a> or the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-f/" data-ref-id="5000-574203">Silent Hill f locker codes</a>, but it may still stump you if you've not noticed a key detail that reveals the answer.</p><p>When you reach the altar, you'll find five stands and five items, or "offerings," before you on plates. It may be immediately apparent that you must place the items in a specific order, but the related poem sure leaves you guessing. The five offerings include a vase, a paper fan, and three dead animals, each of them dressed in some kind of ceremonial wrappings, including a bird, mouse, and fish.</p><p>The alter poem, as confusing as it is, reads:</p><div data-embed-type="breakoutBox"><p><strong>Altar</strong></p><p>Thy restless heart betrays thee as unfit for this auspicious day.</p><p>Thou must first pay respect to the gods and the spirit of thine ancestors.</p><p>A restless heart leads to a corrupt soul.</p><p>Only through sufficient offerings laid upon many stands may thy soul be cleaned.</p></div><p>If you tried relying on just this poem for the answer, you'd probably have better luck using simple trial and error. It's not very clear at all. Instead, the answer is in the details on the offerings themselves. If you interact with each offering, you'll see that you can spin them. Do so and you'll notice each has a symbol somewhere on them that matches the symbols on one of the altar's stands.</p><p>With this in mind, you simply need to place each offering on the altar that matches its symbol. If you're still stumped, don't fret. Here's the answer, plain as day to help you.</p><h2>Silent Hill f altar puzzle solution</h2><p>From left to right:</p><ol><li>Fan - front left</li><li>Fish - back left</li><li>Vase - front middle</li><li>Bird - back right</li><li>Mouse - front right</li></ol><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4574367-screenshot2025-09-24205944.png" data-ref-id="1300-4574367" data-ratio="0.57242063492063" data-width="1008" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4574367-screenshot2025-09-24205944.png" data-ref-id="1300-4574367"></a><figcaption>Silent Hill f altar puzzle answer</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4574367-screenshot2025-09-24205944.png"></figure><p>Placing the offerings in this order will immediately solve the puzzle and initiate a cutscene.

You'll come to a spot where you leave a home through a window and drop down from a rooftop, then you'll be told to return to the general store while avoiding enemies. As you work your way back through this area, you'll pass by a Hokora. From this point on, the Bonuses tab should unlock automatically when accessing one of these shrines. <strong>Open the Bonuses tab to obtain all of your pre-order items</strong>.</p><p>Silent Hill f is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</p>
