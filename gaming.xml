<p>If you’re on the fence about buying Battlefield 6 because you’ve been burned by EA before, or you simply think Battlefield 6 doesn’t look good, we’ve got 5 reasons to convince you why you should buy Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>Let’s start by making things clear: We are not paid by EA to promote <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>.</p>



<p>The reason we’re bigging it up is because it’s one of the best Battlefield games in years. It fills a void in the FPS market that desperately needed a game like this. Battlefield 6 has learned from past mistakes, resulting in an excellent single-player and online shooter. </p>



<p>We’ve isolated 5 key talking points that could convince you to be a Battlefield believer (we’ll never say that again, promise).</p>



<h2 id="h-1-it-has-a-campaign">1. It Has A Campaign!</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No burning bridges this time. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Even if you’re someone who jumps straight into online multiplayer the second you get a new shooter, you can’t deny that having a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-campaign-co-op/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 single-player campaign</a> makes for a better overall package. It’s also better value for your money. Battlefield 2042 not having a campaign was borderline criminal, and EA didn’t learn from the negative reception Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 received for doing the same thing.</p>



<p>Yes, it’s not the best campaign in the world, nor is it that memorable. We think it doesn’t necessarily need to be. Having it there is better than not having it at all. It’s also a good little training tool to warm up your shooting skills; learning how weapons work in the game and getting a sense of recoil and movement against AI before you need to use these skills against real people.</p>



<p>It also offers many tough <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-trophy-list-all-achievements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trophies and achievements</a> to tick off as well.</p>



<h2 id="h-2-ea-is-listening-to-you">2. EA Is Listening To You</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Leave all the feedback. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>“With over 30 Battlefield Labs sessions successfully completed alongside our community, and a total of 92,351,578 hours played during the Open Beta, Battlefield 6 is the most tested and iterated Battlefield game in history, and player agency remains at the heart of it,” said a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/community-update-play-your-way" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield 6 community post</a>.</p>



<p>It’s no secret that EA has been on something of a vendetta against itself with Battlefield 6. The failure of Battlefield 2042 sent the game’s team back to the drawing board. Battlefield 6’s MO from the beginning has been clear: Listen to the community. If you don’t believe us, take it from Battlefield Studios:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We appreciate all of your suggestions, and want you to know we’re listening. With Season 1 and our roadmap ahead, we’re excited to continue to build a Battlefield that reflects what players want. We’ll continue reading and listening to community channels, and we cannot wait to share more with you, so keep the feedback coming.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The whole team knew that Battlefield 6 couldn’t fail, or it could be the end for the franchise. Time will tell if this remains the goal from day one until a potential next Battlefield release. In the meantime, you can play Battlefield 6 knowing that if you have feedback or criticism, it will be heard.</p>



<h2 id="h-3-more-content-than-any-other-battlefield">3. “More Content Than Any Other Battlefield”</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Content upon content. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Now we head to the Battlefield Comms channel—a terrific communication line between players and the developer. A detailed post outlining the game’s current and upcoming content delivered a simple message: <strong>“Our Seasons will have more content than ever before in a Battlefield game.”</strong></p>



<p>Battlefield 6 is a live-service game at the end of the day. This means the usual dripfeed of new content, but we’ve already seen with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1 Roadmap</a> how seriously EA is taking this. If you commit to the purchase, you know you’re getting a plethora of new maps, weapons, game modes, and everything that <em>you </em>want for the next few years.</p>



<p>We’ll probably get beloved maps and fan-favorite playlists.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-4-free-to-play-battle-royale-mode">4. Free-To-Play Battle Royale Mode</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Fire away. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>This won’t be everyone’s cup of tea, but a free-to-play <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-pois-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 Battle Royale mode</a> arrives shortly after the game’s full release. It freshens up the concept slightly with the new insta-death circle, and will also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-and-multiplayer-has-the-same-destruction-system/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feature the multiplayer’s destruction</a>—meaning if someone is camping in a house, try to bring it down on them to win the game!</p>



<p>Even though the Battle Royale concept is a bit stale and played out at this point, adding a BR mode to Battlefield 6 once again helps the game’s overall package and value.</p>



<h2 id="h-5-it-s-fun">5. It’s Fun</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Beautiful. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The reality is that few AAA games offer the level of destruction and versatility that Battlefield does. Even a ‘bad’ Battlefield game is still pretty good—2042 being the outlier—and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6s-destruction-improved-after-dropping-ps4-and-xbox-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6’s decision to skip the PS4 and Xbox One</a> has allowed Battlefield Studios to improve the franchise’s destruction.</p>



<p>Our time in the Open Beta was delightful, and this really is Battlefield back to its brilliant best. From long, back-and-forth Conquest matches to the pitfalls and pressure of defending an objective in Rush, there really is nothing like Battlefield and its signature ‘moments’. </p>



<hr>



<p>As always, this is the part where you get to say your piece. Either leave a comment or head to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a> and share your thoughts on Battlefield 6 with us. Did you buy Battlefield 6? If so, what do you think? Or tell us why you won’t be buying it, and why our reasons aren’t convincing enough.</p>

<p>Brainrot Evolution is a grindcore experience that calls forth dynamic progression through Rebirths. The madcap world is divided into distinct maps and surreal Brainrots, each with varying power levels. Smacking every NPC and object you see is the way to go in this Brainrot game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Like many other modern PC releases, Battlefield 6 launched with some issues that prevent players from playing the highly anticipated new entry in EA and DICE's FPS series. Thankfully, most of these issues are minor and can be easily fixed.</p>



<p><em>Note: Due to the nature of PC gaming, with different system configurations and driver versions, and with various versions of the game (Steam, EA App, Epic Games Store) these fixes are not guaranteed to work for all players. They are, however, the most common solutions available for the up-to-date version of the game as of October 11, 2025.</em></p>



<div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#h-quick-fix-checklist" data-level="3">Quick Fix Checklist</a></li><li><a href="#h-battlefield-6-game-not-released-error-steam" data-level="2">Battlefield 6 "Game Not Released" Error (Steam)</a></li><li><a href="#h-battlefield-6-won-t-launch" data-level="2">Battlefield 6 Won't Launch</a></li><li><a href="#h-battlefield-6-directx-error-dxgi-error-device-removed" data-level="2">Battlefield 6 DirectX Error "DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED"</a></li><li><a href="#h-battlefield-6-purchase-to-play-or-content-not-installed-error-ea-app" data-level="2">Battlefield 6 "Purchase to Play" or "Content Not Installed" Error (EA App)</a></li><li><a href="#h-battlefield-6-queue-and-server-errors" data-level="2">Battlefield 6 Queue and Server Errors</a></li><li><a href="#h-battlefield-6-long-or-infinite-loading-screen" data-level="2">Battlefield 6 Long or Infinite Loading Screen</a></li></ul></div>



<h3 id="h-quick-fix-checklist">Quick Fix Checklist</h3>



<p>Before attempting any in-depth fixes, try these simple, common fixes.</p>



<ol start="1">
<li><strong>Restart the Steam/EA App/Epic Games Store app and Battlefield 6:</strong> Close the game and your platform's launcher, then restart them. This forces an automatic recheck of licenses and updates that may fix minor issues.</li>



<li><strong>Verify/Repair Game Files:</strong> Try the <em>"Verify Integrity Of Game Files" option in Steam or the </em>repair function in the EA App. This fixes corrupted files that may prevent the game from working.</li>



<li><strong>Clear EA App Cache (EA App Users):</strong> Clearing the EA App cache is a common solution for any license verification issue.<br></li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-game-not-released-error-steam">Battlefield 6 "Game Not Released" Error (Steam)</h2>



<p>The Battlefield 6 "Game Not Released" error is a Steam issue that prevents some users from downloading or updating the game.</p>



<p><strong>Fix</strong>: The development team has shared an <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1976862813437280350">official workaround</a>, requiring the user to open the game's Properties on Steam and uncheck the Battlefield Multiplayer HD Marker and Battlefield Multiplayer Marker DLC. Alternative fixes include restarting the Steam client or rebooting your system. An official fix has yet to be implemented.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-won-t-launch">Battlefield 6 Won't Launch</h2>



<p>For some users, Battlefield 6 will crash right after the splash screen, and will not launch.</p>



<p><strong>Fix: </strong>Enable Secure Boot in your BIOS/UEFI settings. To do so, you have to make sure your system's BIOS Mode is UEFI and your Windows drive's partition is GPT and:</p>



<ol>
<li>Restart your system and enter the BIOS setting menu by holding the appropriate key for your motherboard (usually the Delete key, F11 or F12)</li>



<li>Access the Advanced Mode in the menu</li>



<li>Access the Boot or Secure Boot option</li>



<li>Enable Secure Boot if disabled.</li>



<li>Save changes and reboot your system</li>
</ol>



<figure><figcaption><em>Before you can fight other soldiers, technical issues may be your Battlefield 6 enemies.</em></figcaption></figure>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-directx-error-dxgi-error-device-removed"><strong>Battlefield 6 DirectX Error "DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED"</strong></h2>



<p>The Battlefield 6 DirectX DXGI_ERROR_DEVICE_REMOVED error is caused by your GPU not correctly recognized by the game.</p>



<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Make sure you have the latest drivers from <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/">NVIDIA</a>, <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/support/download/drivers.html">AMD</a> or <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/products/docs/discrete-gpus/arc/software/drivers.html">Intel</a> for your graphics card. Updated drivers can also address performance or stability issues. Also, make sure all GPU and CPU overclocks are disabled. Reinstalling the game may also fix this issue. If these fixes don't work, you will have to wait for a patch to address this issue.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-purchase-to-play-or-content-not-installed-error-ea-app">Battlefield 6 "Purchase to Play" or "Content Not Installed" Error (EA App)</h2>



<p>The "Purchase to Play" or "Content Not Installed" error is an EA App issue that prevents the game from starting due to a license verification issue. As the EA App cannot verify if you have purchased the game, it will launch, but you cannot play it.</p>



<p><strong>Fix:</strong> Clear the EA APP Cache or restart the game. If this doesn't work, you should try reinstalling the game. Joining an active game, whether a friend's or one found via the Community Server Browser, was also confirmed to be a working workaround for some users.</p>



<p><em><strong>NOTE: An <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1976679780264153186">official fix</a> is in the works.</strong></em></p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-queue-and-server-errors">Battlefield 6 Queue and Server Errors</h2>



<p>Several users are stuck in long queues for online multiplayer or are encountering "Server Disconnected" or "An Unidentified Error occurred" errors.</p>



<p><strong>Fix:</strong> For long queues, you only have to wait for your turn. Don't quit, or you will start waiting again from the back of the queue! There are no fixes for the other issues, as they are server-side issues that require developer intervention.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-long-or-infinite-loading-screen">Battlefield 6 Long or Infinite Loading Screen</h2>



<p>Sometimes, Battlefield 6 is stuck in a long, potentially infinite, loading screen.</p>



<p><strong>Fix</strong>: Restarting the game is the only known fix for this issue. If you cannot close the game by closing its window, do so with Task Manager (CTRL+Shift+Esc) after pressing Alt+Tab to get out of the game.</p>



<p>If any of the fixes above have solved your issues, and you can finally enjoy Battlefield 6, congratulations!

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-grogu-set-with-hover-pram-is-selling-for-pennies-amazon-clears-out-stock-at-a-new-record-low-2000634151</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-grogu-set-with-hover-pram-is-selling-for-pennies-amazon-clears-out-stock-at-a-new-record-low.1322533/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If there’s one Lego license that consistently flies off the shelves, it’s Star Wars. These sets rarely see significant discounts, which makes today’s deal even more remarkable. The Lego <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4704/">Star Wars Grogu with hover pram building set has dropped to $69 on Amazon, down from its usual $99 price tag</a>. This is the first time this incredibly popular set (boasting an<strong> impressive 4.9 out of 5 stars</strong>) has hit such a record low price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4704/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This <strong>1,048-piece building set</strong> brings everybody’s beloved Force-sensitive foundling to life in breathtaking detail. Over <strong>7.5 inches tall when standing in his hover pram</strong>, it’s not just another fast-assembly figure. Thoughtful engineering allows you to interact with the model long after you’ve finished building it and it captures Grogu’s undeniable charm. With a <strong>dial-controlled arm mechanism</strong>, you have complete control over Grogu’s gestures to recreate those iconic moments when he reaches out to touch whatever comes his attention or attempts to use his powers. His <strong>head smoothly turns to freeze various expressions</strong>, and his characteristic oversized ears can be set to demonstrate curiosity, sleepiness, or wakefulness.</p>
<h2>Why This Set Provides the Magic of The Mandalorian</h2>
<p>The <strong>hover pram itself is a 7-inch long and 6-inch wide base</strong> that doubles as a display piece. It’s the flexibility of having a choice in how you display this build that makes it so interesting. You can display Grogu safely nestled inside his safety pod just as Din Djarin carries him when out adventuring or standing him upright outside for a more dynamic display.</p>



<p>Lego didn’t hold back on the accessories that transformed Grogu into a cultural icon. Three key items that epitomize his personality are included in the set: <strong>a brick-built Sorgan frog</strong> (don’t you recall his snacking ways from Season 1?), <strong>the shifter knob from the Razor Crest</strong> that became a meme immediately, and <strong>a cookie</strong> that he can hold in his miniature hands.</p>



<p>The advanced level of this 1,048-piece set makes it <strong>ideal for builders aged 10 and up</strong> but adult collectors will relish the building process as much. The piece count assures hours of uninterrupted building time which makes it an ideal weekend project or a relaxing evening activity. While other, simpler sets may have you racing to get to the final stages, you’ll have time to smell the Lego, as it were, as you assemble the mechanical components that give Grogu’s movement life.</p>
<p>With the $30 savings, it comes to a price that is difficult to pass up, particularly since those Star Wars sets tend to hold their value or gain it over time.</p>

But before we dive into what we're playing over the next couple of days, let's just look back at some of the recent news highlights.</p>
<p>The big talking point this week was undoubtedly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendo-updates-animated-short-film-close-to-you-with-some-familiar-faces">the debut video(s) from Nintendo Pictures</a>. While there was a lot of mystery surrounding the first release, most had assumed that it would be <strong>Pikmin</strong>-related, and this was indeed confirmed just one day later. It's a lovely release, so do check it out if you haven't already.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendo-expands-switch-onlines-snes-library-with-three-more-titles">three SNES games have been added to Nintendo Switch Online</a> – perhaps not the most exciting line-up imaginable, but welcome nonetheless. Alarmo (remember that?) also <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendo-alarmo-is-getting-a-kirby-themed-update">received a new Kirby-themed update</a>, which means we're <em>still</em> waiting for those sweet <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a> themes – come on, Nintendo.</p>
<p>We also reviewed a bunch of games this week, so do give them a read if you have chance:</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Since last weekend was pretty much dedicated to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>, I'd like to spend a bit of time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> and actually get a decent start on it. On the other hand, I've recently jumped into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/xenotilt_hostile_pinball_action">Xenotilt</a>, and my goodness, it's absolutely <em>marvellous</em>. Gorgeous visuals and lots of numbers that keep going up, up, up. It's addictive stuff.</p>

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I’m still banging my head against repeatedly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a> runs and, once again, it’s refusing to let me go. I don’t think I’m quite as <em>into</em> this one as I was its predecessor, but it’s still a jolly good time and a firm reminder that I am very bad at just about every boss fight going.</p>
<p>If I can put it down, I’d really like to get back to <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a>, which I haven’t touched in about a week but has really gotten under my skin. I’ll wrap it up on PS5 soon enough, I’m sure, but it has to be coming to Switch 2 soon, right?</p>
<h2>PJ O'Reilly, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>Well, I've got a bunch of things to review over the weekend so most of my gaming time will be spent doing that. However, I will also be putting a little time aside especially for Hades II and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> action.</p>
<p>I genuinely can't believe these latest Galaxy 1+2 ports have been out this long and I haven't even started them yet. I'm losing my touch.</p>
<p>I never had a touch.</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>This week, it's nothing but Hades 2. I was a very good girl and waited until it was out of early access, a feat of willpower for which I deserve the highest praise, and I'm glad I did — although I always feel like I can sort of see the stitches in a formerly-early-access game. I can see the places where they've added more content, like building on an extension after realising that they forgot to put in bathrooms; I can feel the tension between whatever the early combat systems were, and how they ended up changing to be different from the first game, and more like what the early access players wanted. There's a lot of speedrunning and min-maxing stuff, for example. I don't hate it!</p>
<p>But I am less invested in the storyline this time, which is a shame, because Hades was so pivotal to me as a player, designer, and writer. It's like they lost their sense of humour. Supergiant has always had a really masterful way of weaving together cosmic tragedy and silliness (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bastion">Bastion</a> was great at it), but Hades 2 is far more serious. I have strong thoughts on Comedy As Serious Art, and I love when games get it right, so I'm a little disappointed, especially because I love seeing the Gods take things less seriously than mortals would. There are still moments of levity, but they're largely at the side of the Main Story. Still, I'm relatively early in the game — maybe a little under midway through the story? — so perhaps it lightens up a bit!</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>I'm reliving my Final Fantasy Tactics obsession through Zach all over again, who's playing on Tactician difficulty. So of course we're getting our backsides handed to us every so often. We're approaching <em>that</em> Chapter 3 fight, so let's see if we get another rude reawakening...</p>
<p>That's pretty much it for me right now — things are busy busy in our household right now! Enjoy your weekends, folks!</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Greetings programs! I have arrived at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> point where I am told if I proceed forward, I will miss out on all unresolved side quest content. So instead of properly finishing the game, I will probably be running around the galaxy for odds and ends. Wow, it’s Lando Calrissian! While not properly a new game despite its recent début on the eShop, Söldner-x: Himmellstürmer is giving that euro-shmup bliss I often crave and it was the only game in the series I had never played before with the added bonus of a banger soundtrack by Rafael Dyll. Also making my way to the final missions of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/gearbits">Gearbits</a> and I've made my way to Cronos in Hades II. Hopefully a defeat of the Titan is on the cards for this weekend.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> report: 31 of 50 games played. Wow, these week’s lot is impressive! Divers is super retro-hardcode hard, Rail Heist is amazing, Vainger gravity switch tricks makes it rather unique, Rock On! Island is super addictive and Pingolf could be a stand alone release! Still more games to come next week.</p>
<p>Game of the week is that Wii forgotten gem <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/tron_evolution_battle_grids">TRON Evolution: Battle Grids</a>. In this scribe's humble opinion still the best TRON video game ever made and clearly one destined to be forgotten by time and industry advancements. But despite all the light-cycling and disc throwing shenanigans, I need to ensure part of this weekend is spent cleaning up my new upcoming music album and ensure a smooth release in a few short days time. End of line.</p>
<h2>Nile Bowie, Contributor</h2>
<p>There’s a very quirky, recently released title by Panic called Blippo+, which is basically a TV simulator where you pick up the broadcasts of a distant alien planet where '80s New Wave culture is the norm! The fun thing about it is that you can use a single Joy-Con vertically to as a remote, and it gives me vivid flashbacks of surfing channels on a CRT and stumbling across late-night public access shows as a kid. There’s not much “game” to it, but it’s utterly unique.</p>
<p>I absolutely love Donkey Kong Bonanza<em>,</em> but I’ve been chipping away at it far too slowly and will be firing it up this weekend. Likewise, there are so many P-Switches in Mario Kart World that I’ve yet to discover and complete, and I owe it to myself to improve my paltry Knockout Tour score a little bit, so there’ll definitely be some competitive karting happening.</p>
<p>I’m really curious as to the roadmap for future updates for <em>World</em> and still find it odd that DK and Pauline have only an outfit each. I’m crossing my fingers for a <em>Bonanza</em> tie-in of some kind.</p>

However, the game, powered by the latest version of the Frostbite engine, is still quite the visual treat.</p>



<p>YouTuber ElAnalistaDeBits has decided to compare the game's maps to their real-life counterparts. In the video embedded below, we can see how the Gibraltar and New York City maps (Iberian Offensive, Empire State, and Manhattan Bridge) stand up to the real locations. Overall, the developers have done an admirable job, to be sure, though of course, there are a few creative liberties here and there. After all, the purpose was not to make the Battlefield 6 maps 1:1 replicas; instead, they sought to replicate the location's atmosphere.</p>

<p>Mere hours after the Battlefield 6 launch, the new installment in the popular military first-person shooter series <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-servers-hit-capacity-at-launch-steam-charts-747k-players/">has already thrashed any previous Steam concurrency records in the franchise</a> with 747K concurrent players. To be fair, though, successful entries such as Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4, and Battlefield 1 only landed on Steam in June 2020, many years after their actual debuts. That's because Electronic Arts tried to use the games to push its own launcher, Origin, making them exclusive to the platform. The company <a href="https://wccftech.com/electronic-arts-is-back-on-steam-with-ea-games-and-ea-access-subscription/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only decided to switch strategy in late 2019</a>, returning its games to Valve's platform. Battlefield 2042 launched on November 19, 2021 on both Origin and Steam, but that game had its own issues and only reached a peak of 107K concurrent players.</p>



<p>If you're still on the fence about buying Battlefield 6, perhaps <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our review written by David Carcasole</a> can help you decide:</p>



<p><em>Battlefield 6 is an incredibly strong return to form for the series, with a multiplayer experience that is finely tuned with huge potential for what it could build into, destruction mechanics that bring a level of immersion back to the series that it was missing, and a more than solid visual and sound design package tying up how endlessly fun it is to play. The single-player campaign fails to impress, but the multiplayer experience more than makes up for it.</em></p>

<p>It's also got an fps boost on Switch</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>When the 3D hand-drawn platformer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ruffy_and_the_riverside">Ruffy and the Riverside</a> made its debut on Nintendo platforms in June, we noted how there were some performance issues across both the Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>It seems the developers have now acknowledged these issues in the latest game update by addressing the frame rate on both hybrid systems. On the Switch 2, you can now look forward to 60fps, and on the original device, you can generally expect "higher fps" than before.</p>
<p>This "huge" new patch also reportedly improves some other aspects of the game. This includes a "smoother camera" and "better combat". Here's the full rundown:</p>

<p>Here's what we had to say about the frame rate of this title on the Switch and Switch 2 in our Nintendo Life review:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>On Switch 1, the framerate struggles at times, mostly when the game transitions into new areas on-the-fly. Moving seamlessly across the world comes at a cost, it seems. It's a shame, and although they've not spoiled my enjoyment much, they are there and it'd be really nice to have a patch to sort this (and to add the old gyro).</p>
<p>For Switch 2 players, the performance issues present on Switch 1 do carry over to the newer console, and swapping between the two (bad puns flying out of me today), there's very little difference other than perhaps a slight improvement in loading times.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-852-october-11/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nyt-connections-hints-today-852-%E2%80%94clues-and-answers-for-saturday-october-11.1322494/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s Saturday, and while I’ve not been around for a while, I hope that your streaks are all going strong, pushing into the weekend. I unfortunately lost mine, but it’s time to kick that back into gear with more NYT Connections hints and solutions for Saturday, October 11.</p>



<p>Read on to learn everything you need to know about today’s NYT Connections hints.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-october-11">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (October 11)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll get started with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will be enough to spur your brain into action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #852:</p>



<ul>
<li>ALLEY</li>



<li>SPORT</li>



<li>TACKLE</li>



<li>LANE</li>



<li>TOM</li>



<li>COURT</li>



<li>KIT</li>



<li>BOB</li>



<li>DON</li>



<li>BILL</li>



<li>WEAR</li>



<li>GEAR</li>



<li>PAT</li>



<li>WAY</li>



<li>PUT ON</li>



<li>STUFF</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– Whether you’re camping or competing, this collection has you covered.</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – Ready for the runway or the rugby pitch? These words help you get suited up.</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – You’ll find these at the end of addresses — just don’t take a wrong turn</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – These names double as everyday nouns — from currency to movement.</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, October 11.</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-october-11-852">NYT Connections Answers for Today, October 11 (#852)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– GEAR, KIT, STUFF, TACKLE</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – DON, PUT ON, SPORT, WEAR</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – ALLEY, COURT, LANE, WAY</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – BILL, BOB, PAT, TOM</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>







<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/vince-zampella-complains-ea-app/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/respawn-ceo-vince-zampella-complains-about-ea-app-and-suggests-players-go-to-steam-instead.1322491/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 was released yesterday, and some PC-based players have been experiencing issues tied to the EA App, a digital storefront and launcher that supports the game. It has been actively blocking users from booting the game and presenting an error message, which is something that has actively ’embarrassed’ EA leadership.</p>



<p>In a series of social media posts, Respawn Entertainment CEO and co-founder Vince Zampella actively criticized the EA App, suggesting that users consider refunding the game and purchasing it through Steam instead, which offers a more stable experience.</p>



<h2 id="h-vince-zampella-bags-on-the-app-his-owner-created">Vince Zampella Bags on the App His Owner Created</h2>



<p>Respawn Entertainment is one of the many subsidiaries under the Electronic Arts banner, but that hasn’t stopped CEO Vince Zampella from taking to social media to lead a crusade against the EA App.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/VinceZampella/status/1976718941063151656" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In a post</a> responding to a communication about the rampant EA App issues, Zampella wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I have yelled about ea app people. Any suggestions on next levels of escalation?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the comments beneath that post, Zampella admitted he’s playing the game on Steam, and he actively advised others to do the same. When one user explained they had similar issues, Zampella asked if they could refund the game on the EA App and buy it on Steam instead.</p>



<p>He also confirmed that other platforms, like Xbox, aren’t having these issues whatsoever.</p>



<p>When one user demanded that Zampella ‘yell at Andrew Wilson’ (EA’s CEO), Zampella said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s not his fault, he’s just as upset as me</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s worth stressing that <strong>as of a few hours ago</strong> (at the time of publishing), the EA App was no longer exhibiting these issues and things had returned to normal for users across the platform.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In July, a PEGI rating surfaced for Assassin’s Creed Shadows on Nintendo Switch 2. This was just days after Ubisoft stated the game, which is one of the best-received Assassin’s Creed games in <strong>years</strong>, would be headed to ‘other machines’.</p>



<p>Now, a listing on a French storefront has revealed a placeholder cover and a product description for the game. It could be the site getting ahead of the game, or it could be a slip that was posted early in error. The listing was spotted by eagle-eyed fans, but if it’s a real listing, it comes as no surprise.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-assassin-s-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2">When is Assassin’s Creed Shadows Coming to Switch 2?</h2>



<p>At the time of writing, there’s no release date for Assassin’s Creed Shadows on Switch 2, but it’s widely believed that it will land in the coming months. It’s looking as though it’ll follow a similar path to Star Wars: Outlaws, which landed on Switch 2 on September 4.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows was given <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-rating-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a PEGI rating</a> for Nintendo Switch 2 back in July, which is usually applied within a few months of launch and no earlier. Now, a French outlet <a href="https://www.auchan.fr/assassin-s-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2/pr-C1851867" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">named Auchan</a> has shown a listing for the game.</p>



<p>On the French storefront, it’s written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Experience Assassin’s Creed Shadows in a whole new way with Nintendo Switch 2!<br></p>



<p>MASTER THE SERIES’ MOST DEPTH-BASED STEALTH MECHANISMS AND ENJOY VISCERAL COMBAT.<br>Play as Naoe, a cunning shinobi, and use light, sound, and shadows to avoid detection. Infiltrate enemy strongholds with a variety of free-running options, including the new grappling hook, distract guards with shurikens or smoke bombs, and assassinate targets with your Hidden Blade. As the samurai Yasuke, perform silent takedowns with a bow or unleash devastating combos with a katana or naginata.<br></p>



<p>Switch between these two heroes to adapt your strategy and experience feudal Japan through two radically different approaches: stealth or power, shadow or steel.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows was released in March 2025, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in our review</a>, we praised the game’s visuals, world, and cinematic campaign, all of which were on point for this stellar release.</p>



<p>If Assassin’s Creed Shadows comes out on Nintendo Switch 2, will you be picking up a copy? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Return to the garden later this month</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>PopCap's highly addictive tower defence series <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/plants_vs_zombies">Plants vs. Zombies</a> is making a return on the Switch and Switch 2 later this month.</p>
<p>Before you return to the garden in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/plants-vs-zombies-replanted">Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted</a>, there's a new gameplay trailer you might want to check out. It showcases the Switch 2 GameShare feature, which allows two players to enjoy Local Co-Op or PvP together.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the fine print of the trailer, the Switch 2 system must initiate the GameShare session. And users who receive software via GameShare can only play this software during the session it was shared.</p>
<figure data-uuid="5b4736719262f"><a title="Plants vs Zombies Replanted" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/5b4736719262f/plants-vs-zombies-replanted.large.png"></a></figure>
<p>Here's a bit more about what you can expect from the 'Replanted' version of the original Plants vs. Zombies:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The cult classic, Plants vs. Zombies, returns in glorious HD! After years in Crazy Dave’s attic, the original battle between Plants and Zombies is back—bigger, brighter and crazier than ever before. Revisit the epic backyard standoffs you remember, but this time with new levels, fresh twists, and 15 years of never-before-seen franchise history at your fingertips. Relive the glory days of Peashooters, Sunflowers, and brain-hungry chaos. Rejoin the ultimate garden defense and experience the backyard brawl that started a phenomenon—now back for a new era!"</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/galaxy-buds-3-pro-are-going-for-pennies-the-new-airpods-pro-can%E2%80%99t-compete-at-full-price.1322428/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple just released the AirPods Pro 3 a few weeks ago and finally added AI features that Samsung’s Galaxy Buds 3 Pro have had for nearly a year now. Samsung got ahead with AI features in its Galaxy Buds 3 Pro, which launched way back and still remain at the top of their game. From a value perspective, they’re even more compelling now with this <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/">post-Prime Day deal on Amazon that drops them to a record low of $172, down from their usual $249 price</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4703/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The <strong>AI integration goes beyond marketing buzzwords</strong> and actually improves your listening experience in practical ways. The Galaxy Buds 3 Pro use machine learning to analyze your ear canal shape and ambient noise conditions, then automatically adjust sound output to optimize audio quality for your specific situation. This means the earbuds adapt when you move from a quiet office to a loud street, or when you switch from music to podcasts, adjusting EQ and volume levels on the fly. The real-time translation feature lets you have conversations across language barriers with audio playing directly in your ears as someone speaks in another language. This AI capability <strong>transforms these earbuds into a communication tool rather than just an audio device</strong>.</p>
<h2>Active Noise Cancellation That Really Works</h2>
<p>The<strong> active noise canceling system incorporates multiple microphones</strong> that cancel out external noise over the full frequency spectrum. Rumble from motors or HVAC is cancelled out very effectively, while mid-level noise such as voice conversations and typing on the keyboard drop into the background. The adaptive ANC modulates the level depending on where you are so you’re not draining the battery with full cancellation when you’re already sitting in silence. Ambient sound mode does the opposite, streaming external sounds in over the microphones so you hear announcements, traffic, or brisk conversations without removing the earbuds.</p>



<p>Samsung reworked the fit around the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro based on complaints from previous iterations. The new blade design with tilted nozzles fit deeper into the ear canal with more even pressure distribution. It makes a difference during exercises, commutes or marathon listening sessions where ill-fitting earbuds will fall out or make uncomfortable pressure points. The <strong>IP57 rating also means dust and water resistance</strong>&nbsp;so you won’t harm them by sweating during exercise or getting caught in the rain. The protective coverage even extends to immersion under up to one meter’s depth of water for 30 minutes, although you won’t be swimming with them.</p>



<p><strong>Sound quality is improved by dual-driver construction</strong> that decouples the low frequency from the mid and high frequency response. The low end is covered by a specialized woofer and the high end and midrange by a specialized tweeter. The decoupling makes for clearer sound with better detail compared to single-driver earbuds that are not capable of accurately playing the full frequency response.</p>
<p>Battery life is around six hours with ANC enabled and around eight hours with ANC disabled. The <strong>charging case adds around 20 hours or so</strong>&nbsp;so you’ll have enough time before you’ll want to recharge. Fast charging will give you around an hour’s play from five minutes’ charging if time is extremely limited. The Amazon Exclusive version comes with a two-year warranty rather than the one-year coverage you get otherwise, so you have even greater assurance for your pound.</p>
<p>The all-time low price makes the earbuds an extremely smart purchase this time.</p>

<p>Pre-orders for Resident Evil Requiem are set to go live on October 29, along with a special series-themed video.</p>



<p>The Resident Evil franchise has been delivering the scares since 1996. With the 30th anniversary coming next year, a new entry, Resident Evil Requiem, is releasing on February 27th, 2026. From what we’ve seen (and played), it looks to capitalize on what makes the series iconic: terrifying creatures and survival skills. If you cannot wait to return to Raccoon City, like I am, we know know when pre-orders will start. Plus, we’ll get an extra special video to go along with it.</p>



<h2 id="h-resident-evil-special-video-requiem-pre-orders-to-release-on-october-29th">Resident Evil Special Video, Requiem Pre-Orders To Release On October 29th</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The nightmare begins soon. <br>Resident Evil Requiem pre-orders will start on October 29th, US time. Plus, we'll be releasing a video celebrating the Resident Evil franchise at the same time (note: no new Resident Evil Requiem gameplay will be shown). Keep an eye out.… <a href="https://t.co/M8ssS8PJsS">pic.twitter.com/M8ssS8PJsS</a></p>— Resident Evil (@RE_Games) <a href="https://twitter.com/RE_Games/status/1976773536883609715?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>On <a href="https://x.com/RE_Games/status/1976773536883609715?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter/X</a>, Capcom has announced that pre-orders for Resident Evil Requiem will go live on October 29th, 2025. No specifics were given as for what time that will be other than “US time”. In addition, a special video celebrating the Resident Evil series will premiere on October 29th as well. Unfortunately for fans hoping to see more Requiem gameplay, Capcom confirmed that no new footage will be shown.</p>



<p>However, for the optimists in the room, it doesn’t confirm that nothing new from the series will be shown. Rumors of a remake of Resident Evil 0, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-resident-evil-5-getting-a-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5</a>, and Code Veronica have made the rounds for a while. Perhaps we could see a reveal for one of those titles during the video? Furthermore, the film adaptation of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-2026-resident-evil-movie-will-be-in-spirit-of-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-2026-resident-evil-movie-will-be-in-spirit-of-games/"> Evil</a>, directed by Weapon’s Zach Cregger is currently in production. Maybe we’ll see some footage or principal photography? We’ll just have to wait and see on October 29th.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jackerys-1500w-power-station-is-cheaper-than-during-prime-day-looks-like-amazons-selling-at-cost-2000634122</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jackery%E2%80%99s-1500w-power-station-is-cheaper-than-during-prime-day-looks-like-amazon%E2%80%99s-selling-at-cost.1322410/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Prime Big Deal Day took place from October 7th through October 8th, and Amazon doubled down from July’s Prime Day by cutting the price to all-time lows on nearly all product lines. The Jackery Explorer 1000 portable power station dropped to an all-time low during the sales event and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/">remains at that same $429 price point, down from the $799 price point consumers will pay until existing stock is sold out</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3722/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>This product has been the <strong>category’s number one bestseller on Amazon</strong> since the first day of the month. Power outages, camping excursions, tailgating parties and even emergency planning all have one thing in common: the need for good backup electricity that doesn’t come from noisy gas-based generators. The Jackery product addresses this very same issue by delivering clean, silent power that you can tote around with one hand and enjoy indoors without hassle from fumes nor carbon monoxide.</p>
<p>The Explorer 1000 stores a 1,070Wh LiFePO4 battery capacity into an amazingly <strong>small package weighing only 23.8 pounds</strong>. That capability translates into tangible runtime in the real world: you’ll power a mini-fridge for around 10 hours, power a CPAP machine overnight over multiple nights, sustain laptops and cellphones for multiple days, or power LED lights for an extended time. With<strong> the 1,500W continuous AC output but 3,000W surge peak</strong>, this power station supports appliances drawing much power during startups such as refrigerators, portable air conditioners, or electric kettles.</p>



<h2>Speeding Up Charges and Lasting Batteries That Alter the Equation</h2>
<p>The <strong>fast charging for one hour is quite impressive</strong> and is only accessed by activating the emergency charging mode from the Jackery app. It is ideal when you are aware bad weather is imminent or you want to quickly get it topped up before you leave. The standard charging mode will take 1.7 hours for full charging that is something the manufacturers made deliberate for the best preservation of long-term battery health. The slow charging decreases the strain on the cell from the battery, giving them an extended lifespan.</p>



<p>LiFePO4 batteries are the key to this power station’s longevity: Unlike standard lithium-ion batteries that degrade relatively quickly, LiFePO4 chemistry maintains over 70% of original capacity even after 4,000 charge cycles. In practical terms, if you fully charge and discharge this power station once per week, <strong>it’ll still perform well after a decade of use</strong>.</p>
<p>The port assortment accomodates the majority of general devices and setups. <strong>Three pure sine AC outlets</strong> supply clean power safe for sensitive electronics such as laptops, medical equipment, and digital-control-enabled modern appliances.<strong> Two USB-C ports supply up to 100W PD fast charging</strong>&nbsp;so you’ll be able to charge contemporary laptops at full speed without the need for heavy power adapters. One is relegated to older devices, with the <strong>DC car port supporting 12V accessories</strong>.</p>
<p>The Jackery app adds smart controls that actually improve the user experience: You can switch between charging modes, monitor battery levels and power draw in real time, and <strong>activate the 30dB quiet overnight charging mode</strong> when noise matters. Energy efficiency mode adjusts output to reduce waste when powering low-draw devices. The integrated LED lights provide emergency illumination without draining your phone’s battery.</p>
<p>Coming in at $429, this Jackery Explorer 1000 brings serious power capacity, and decade-spanning battery longevity all for almost half the going price.</p>

<p>Are you looking to play PowerWash Simulator 2 in early access? Are you hoping for any chance to jump in as soon as possible?</p>



<p>With the first game being a surprise hit, PowerWash Simulator 2 is looking to be another rewarding experience, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-powerwash-simulator-2-splitscreen-local-multiplayer-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this time with more friends</a>.</p>



<p>Here is everything you need to know about any potential PowerWash Simulator 2 early access.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-powerwash-simulator-2-have-early-access">Does PowerWash Simulator 2 Have Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You have to wait just like everyone else to clean this. Image via FuturLab</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, there is no early access period in PowerWash Simulator 2. The game’s full release is set for October 23, which is when everyone will be able to access the game.</strong></p>



<p>The original <a href="https://www.futurlab.co.uk/games/powerwash-simulator-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PowerWash Simulator</a> was released into early access, in the way that it did not have its 1.0 release until much later, but that is not the case with the sequel. All content in PowerWash Simulator 2 can be considered the game’s full launch, with any future maps likely coming via DLC packs, like the first game saw.</p>



<p>It is not necessarily surprising that there is no early access for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/powerwash-simulator-2-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PowerWash Simulator 2</a>. Typically, only very large games offer that kind of benefit for buying a deluxe edition or something like that. With a smaller, but still anticipated, game like this, that doesn’t happen much.</p>



<p>With that said, it is nice to see the game have a full 1.0 release so soon after the release date announcement.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-does-powerwash-simulator-2-have-a-demo">Does PowerWash Simulator 2 Have a Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, there is a demo available for download for PowerWash Simulator 2, but it is only available on Steam. There is no demo for the game on Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5, or Xbox Series X|S, at least as of this writing.</strong></p>



<p>In the demo, you get a look at the early portion of the game, with two jobs available: Removal Van and Public Facility. You can also walk around your home base and see how this new area will be in the full game.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, with the demo only available on Steam, console players are left out of the early fun. There is always a chance that these storefronts will get access to the demo before the game releases, but as of now, there is no indication that it is happening.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bose-is-quietly-selling-its-qc-headphones-at-a-new-record-low-after-prime-day-to-clear-out-stock.1322389/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon’s October answer to the summer Prime Day event (Prime Big Deal Day) just wrapped up but some of the best deals are still hanging around. The <strong>Bose QuietComfort headphones</strong> are a perfect example, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/">now sitting at a record low of $199, down from their usual $349 price</a>. These are the most popular premium noise-canceling headphones in the world for a reason: they solve the problem of trying to focus, relax, or enjoy music in noisy environments better than almost anything else on the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4702/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Bose QuietComfort headphones’ active noise cancellation does what the name suggests – canceling out noise – <strong>by using microphones to listen for external noise and then creating countering sound waves to eliminate the noise</strong>. This all occurs in real time so background noise such as engine rumble, air flow from the air conditioning or background chatter all get greatly alleviated. Bose overlays this with passive noise isolation from the over-ear design itself where the cushy earcup cushions form an actual physical seal around the ears. The active-passive noise reduction mixture makes that classic <em>“quiet bubble”</em> result that makes the headphones so desirable among travelers and remote workers.</p>
<h2>Comfort Engineering That Makes All-Day Wear Actually Possible</h2>
<p>The earcup cushions incorporate soft materials that wrap around your ears without applying too much force and <strong>distributes weight evenly so you don’t feel any pressure points</strong>. The cushioned headband keeps the headphones firmly in place during movement but doesn’t develop that ill-fitting clamp sensation causing headaches after an hour. The design for comfort is important because these headphones <strong>provide up to 24 hours of battery power from one charging</strong>. That’s multiple intercontinental flights, some workweeks, or an infinite number of daily commutes before you have to recharge them. Should you unexpectedly run low, 15 minutes of charging provides 2.5 hours of subsequent playtime which is enough to get you through the rest of your trip or workweek.</p>



<p>Two modes for listening give you the choice depending on the circumstances: <em>Quiet Mode</em> engages full noise cancellation as much as possible, ideal when you’re working or sleeping on a trip. <em>Aware Mode</em> does the reverse and uses external microphones to feed external sounds so you’ll hear announcements or traffic without having to lift the headphones.</p>



<p>The high-fidelity audio reproduction provides <strong>excellent sound throughout the frequency spectrum</strong> with the EQ settings in the Bose app allowing you to tailor the bass, midrange, and treble to suit. Some users desire booming bass for dance/electronica, while others want well-balanced reproduction for classical or jazz. The app puts the settings in your hand so the same headphones suit varied genres and individual taste.</p>
<p>The multipoint Bluetooth connectivity allows you to <strong>connect to multiple devices at the same time</strong>&nbsp;so the headphones remain connected to laptop and phone. If you receive an incoming call on the phone while you’re streaming something on the laptop, the headphones will automatically switch to the phone without needing you to manually detach from one device and connect to the other.</p>
<p>The packaged audio cable with the in-line microphone gives you the option of going wired when you don’t have access to Bluetooth or when the battery dies. This is the kind of feature that is actually useful on outdated airplane entertainment sets or where wireless connectivity is not an option. At $199, you get flagship-level noise cancellation and excellent battery life all at close to half the full price.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-rpg-1851770647"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a> hasn’t officially been announced for Switch 2 yet but a new leaked retailer listing all but confirms it. It’ll be the second big open-world blockbuster to arrive on the new Nintendo console from Ubisoft following <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-patch-is-it-good-2000624465"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>‘ arrival&nbsp;back in September</a>.</p> <p>Like that sci-fi stealth adventure, the “physical” version of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> on Switch 2 will be <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-game-key-card-2000623413">a game key card</a>. That shouldn’t be too surprising considering <a href="https://x.com/MikeOdysseyYT/status/1976767268764705115">its size</a> on every other platform is over 100GB. The <a href="https://www.auchan.fr/assassin-s-creed-shadows-nintendo-switch-2/pr-C1851867">Auchan listing</a> that leaked the apparent port doesn’t confirm a release date or price, though it seems a good guess it will be $70 and potentially arrive before the end of the year.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Shadows (Switch 2 Key Card) listed at a retailer <a href="https://t.co/P1tsWNMBBm">https://t.co/P1tsWNMBBm</a> <a href="https://t.co/h9E10PoNHN">pic.twitter.com/h9E10PoNHN</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1976762547958423703?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is one of the most visually impressive games on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, and it’ll be interesting to see if Ubisoft can get it looking anywhere near as good on Switch 2. The port of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> included ray-tracing and other current-gen features, making it a decent version of the 2024 mercenary sim.</p> <p>Other big third-party ports for the Switch 2 are still MIA. <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> won’t arrive until early 2026. <em>Elden Ring</em> doesn’t even have a release date yet. And <em>Borderlands 4</em> was recently indefinitely delayed despite originally being due out earlier this month. So far at least, the Switch 2 seems in a good position to get a surprising number of last-gen and current-gen blockbusters. It’s just taking a bit longer than some might have hoped.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Borderlands 4 Player Kills 3,000 Bosses To Discover Disappointingly Low Legendary Drop Rate]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-legendary-drop-rate-bosses-patch-notes-nerf-2000634114</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-player-kills-3-000-bosses-to-discover-disappointingly-low-legendary-drop-rate.1322368/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are two ways to <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149">approach <em>Borderlands</em> <em>4</em></a>. One is as a colorful sci-fi comic book sandbox where people say entertaining stuff as you shoot things in the face. The other is as a claw-game lottery to be mathematically solved, with players optimizing strategies to earn prizes as efficiently as possible. Both of those things can be fun! The magic of a great loot shooter is in making those two approaches feel like one and the same.</p> <p>One player decided to go full tilt in the numbers direction and Excel the shit out of <em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s loot RNG. The result after 3,000 boss kills, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands4/comments/1o0q032/bl4_drop_rate_data_3000_kills/">published on the subreddit in a color-coded spreadsheet for all to see</a>, was a legendary drop rate that felt surprisingly stingy at just 5 percent. They want Gearbox to increase it.</p>

 <p>“I think 10 percent is the sweet spot for dedicated items for two reasons,”&nbsp; the player, who goes by Siphonicfir, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-want-to-know-what-sort-of-odds-i-am-trying-to-beat-when-i-am-grinding-a-game-150-hours-and-over-3000-boss-kills-later-a-superfan-has-worked-out-borderlands-4s-disappointingly-low-drop-rate">told<em> IGN</em></a>.&nbsp; “One reason is precedent, as that was the drop rate in <em>Borderlands 2</em>. I think that game is widely regarded as the best game in the franchise, and I am almost certain the community thinks it was the best game for farming. Ten percent created a perfect balance where a drop always feels special, but you never go too long without one.”</p>

   <p>That might feel purely like vibes talking, but Siphonicfir points out that while a 5-percent drop rate means you’re averaging one Legendary drop every 20 boss kills, the far end of the range means there are players out there going a lot longer without getting anything meaningful, especially if they’re trying to farm specific pieces of equipment.</p>

 <p>They explained further:</p> <blockquote><p>For example in my data the longest cold streak was when I farmed Fractis. It took 96 runs to get a single UAV grenade to drop. The odds of not getting the item 96 consecutive times at a 5 percent drop rate are about 1 in 137. In stark contrast, at a 10 percent drop chance, the odds of going cold for 96 trials in a row are just 1 in 24,703. Going from 5 percent to 10 percent isn’t just doubling the chance, it’s reducing the worst possible outlier outcomes by a factor of 180. Those outcomes make people give up or quit due to frustration and should be limited as much as possible. An increase to 10% would make a world of difference in limiting the most egregious outlier scenarios.</p></blockquote> <p>Time will tell if the developers at Gearbox end up agreeing with Siphonicfir’s logic. It’s easier to make a game more generous than it is to turn off the reward spigot, so studios have an incentive to wait and see before course correcting too far in favor of showering players with extra loot.</p>

 <h2>Nerfs and mod warnings</h2> <p>In the meantime, Gearbox is trying to get some weapon balancing issues sorted <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pearls-roadmap-takedown-dlc-free-update-2000621708">ahead of future content updates</a>. Some players have been running around <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GONnYPDIHq0">one-shotting bosses</a> for a few weeks now, and that little festival of unintended build consequences is coming to an end. The <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">October 9 patch notes</a> detailed a litany of changes, including a big buff to Hellwalker base damage and pistol reworks. Assault rifles are supposed to <a href="https://x.com/grantkao/status/1975989364258897947">get some love</a> a little later on, too. But clock is ticking on those broken builds too, with some big nerfs slated for the mid-October patch.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We have future content like the upcoming Invincible that we want players to find challenge/accomplishment in. If we balanced that content around bad gear, it would remove build diversity, forcing players into specific builds using said gear.</p> <p>— Graeme Timmins (@ProdigyXL) <a href="https://twitter.com/ProdigyXL/status/1976485366384210394?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Small update this week before a larger one next week,” creative director Graeme Timmins posted on X. “There will be some changes next week to specific gear and those unintended interactions.” He explained the team’s reasoning in response to criticism from some fans of nerfs in a non-competitive, mostly single-player game. “We have future content like the upcoming Invincible that we want players to find challenge/accomplishment in. If we balanced that content around bad gear, it would remove build diversity, forcing players into specific builds using said gear,” Timmins <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1976485366384210394">wrote</a> back.</p> <p>Also, beware of some of those popular mods floating around for <em>Borderlands 4</em> on PC. One of them lets players skip all of the dialogue in the game, a feature fans are requesting be added in an official update at some point to make it easier to keep grinding through the campaign. Easier said than done, according to the development team. “I’d be cautious using this mod; skipping dialog could lead to broken mission states that might not be recoverable,” Timmins <a href="https://x.com/ProdigyXL/status/1976079573768138920">posted on X</a>. Skip the writing and performance teams’ hard work at your own peril!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/just-three-days-after-prime-day-bose-offloads-its-tv-soundbar-at-a-new-record-low-price-2000634100</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Prime Big Deal Day</em> may have officially wrapped up, but Amazon isn’t done surprising us just yet. The retailer is keeping the momentum going through the weekend with some unexpected deals that are actually getting better. Case in point: the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3727/">Bose TV speaker has dropped to a record low of $199, down from its regular $279 price tag</a>. Even better? This <strong>deal isn’t locked behind Prime membership</strong> anymore, so everyone can grab it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3727/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>If you’ve been struggling to hear dialogue in your favorite shows or constantly reaching for the remote to adjust volume during movies, this compact soundbar addresses exactly that problem. <strong>Bose built this speaker specifically to make voices clearer and more distinct</strong>&nbsp;which means no more missing crucial plot points or asking “what did they say?” every five minutes.</p>
<p>Measuring slightly <strong>over 2 inches in height and 23.38 inches wide by 4.02 inches deep</strong>, this soundbar sits unobtrusively in front of most TVs without obscuring the screen or seeming cumbersome. The black finish blends seamlessly with any living room décor but if counter space is limited, you can wall-mount the device using separately purchased brackets. What makes this soundbar actually worth the money is the<strong> dual full-range drivers located at an angle to develop the wider soundstage</strong>. Rather than having audio blasted directly at you in one flat plane, the angled drivers reflect the sound around your room for a naturally immersive experience that better reflects the way we actually perceive things in the real world.</p>



<h2>Good Clear Dialogue That Finally Does the Hype Justice</h2>
<p>Setup couldn’t be any easier: You’ll pair the soundbar with the TV using the provided optical audio cable or an HDMI-ARC cable (the latter is sold separately). In minutes, you’re finished. The system has <strong>three input options total to work with: HDMI, optical, and auxiliary</strong> so you have versatility depending on what ports are open on your TV. Connected, the provided remote control provides you with access to an optional dialogue mode that further highlights speech clarity. There’s also an optional bass boost mode when you need the low-end kick for action scenes or music.</p>



<p>Talking about music, this soundbar also functions as an <strong>external Bluetooth speaker</strong>. The smartphone, tablet, or laptop can be paired to play podcasts, playlists, or audiobooks directly from the Bose system. The auto-connect function comes in handy: when you have paired the device, the device will auto-connect when the power is switched on.</p>
<p>At $199 post Prime Day, you’re getting Bose’s name for audio quality at an affordable price point for anyone fed up with constantly adjusting their TV’s volume. This weekend deal is the lowest price we’ve ever seen on this model which makes this the perfect moment finally to upgrade the audio you watch on TV.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In hindsight, the emergence of our modern, engagement bait-based world was inevitable. But of all the possible lenses through which to view the progression from a quainter, kinder internet to today’s sinkhole for eyeballs, I’d never considered the map game as pioneered by the<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> series. On the latest Aftermath Hours, our guest makes a convincing argument that these things moved in tandem.&nbsp;</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ckunzelman.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cameron Kunzelman</a> of the <a href="https://rangedtouch.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ranged Touch podcast network</a>, who has a book about<em> Assassin’s Creed</em>, <a href="https://bookshop.org/p/books/everything-is-permitted-on-assassin-s-creed-cameron-kunzelman/f0a99fbf424cdff4?ean=9781517914943&amp;next=t&amp;aid=84774&amp;listref=buy-cmrn-s-book" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Everything Is Permitted</em></a>, coming out next month. We discuss how the series has evolved over the years, with each sequel and spinoff essentially functioning as an argument in favor of the series’ continued existence. Highlights include: why <em>Brotherhood </em>was weird and kinda bad, how Ubisoft portrayed itself in its own book about<em> Assassin’s Creed</em>’s legacy, and the origin of the series’ entire Assassins vs Templars conflict (the first chunk of just one book).&nbsp;</p><p>Then we move on to modern <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>-related matters: This week, news broke that Ubisoft <a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-reconstruction-era-klansmen-cancelled-kkk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">canceled a Reconstruction-era AC game</a> that would’ve starred a freed slave, citing the current political climate and backlash to Yasuke, a Black samurai in <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>. This after Ubisoft <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ubisoft-assassins-creed-mirage-saudi-arabia" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly accepted funding from Saudi Arabia</a> to develop a new DLC for <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage</em>. Says a lot about where the company’s priorities lie! Finally, we adapt the Bible’s Old Testament into a <em>WarioWare</em>-like minigame collection.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can also adapt the New Testament into a series of minigames.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Cameron:</strong> [There’s this idea of] the more you’re spending minutes with our thing, the less you’re spending minutes with other things. The <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games and Ubisoft games in general are a really interesting canary in the coalmine for that, alongside mobile gaming. Because that’s everything now. There’s a reason that Netflix currently talks about second-screen content, right? Their belief is that you’re not even looking at it. It’s a thing for you to be listening to and half paying attention to while you’re on your phone.&nbsp;</p><p>Ubisoft is thinking through this stuff. If you read those investor reports and you kinda pay attention to the way they talk about themselves, they want to capture that whole minute. They want to be demonstrating that people are putting all their effort and time and thought into that. And that goes all the way back to map design, to the map game. That’s the early indicator of “We’re gonna give you so much to do. There’s gonna be so many icons, and you’re gonna feel so good about completing those things.”</p><p>Luke, you were talking about this: That’s the <em>Brotherhood </em>innovation, right? “I’m gonna feel good by clearing this section of the map.” But it’s in order to eat your time. It’s in order to pull you into the orbit of the device. What’s great about <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> as a franchise – and why I wrote a book about the franchise – is that you can watch it happen, beat by beat. You can look at 15-ish games at this point and watch, nearly yearly, the progression toward the world we live in today.</p><p>The games industry of 2007 to now is a different universe. We have continuity of people and companies and whatever, but anyone who was around back then remembers: It’s just a radically different universe. The video game franchise is one of the really cool ways that we can trace that and watch that transformation happen.&nbsp;</p><p>And my hope is that on the academic side and anyone who wants to do this, my hope is that writing a book on the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> franchise helps open the door to other people writing about things like this. I desperately want to read the <em>Halo </em>franchise book. Because it allows you to do the same thing, but in a different way. How has multiplayer changed? How has the relationship between studios and their ownership companies changed? How has the relationship between companies and IP changed?</p><p>If you follow the way the map game kind of operates and changes and moves, you get to watch the whole industry change around it from that initial kernel.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>People often look at <em>Origins </em>as this very pivotal game in the series in terms of narrative and setting and overall structure. People say “Oh, it’s the first real open-world one.” But if <em>Valhalla </em>was the first game where they were actively tracking engagement metrics, <em>Origins </em>was the first one to bring in that “We want to keep you in this game” stuff. They’d make you log in through UPlay, and they’d keep offering skins, and they’d want you to keep buying stuff in the game, and they’d keep offering updates and little storylines. Six months, nine months later, they’d want you playing the same game.&nbsp;</p><p>So based on what you’re saying, that maybe makes <em>Origins </em>the most pivotal game in the franchise’s history. Fans will look at it in terms of its structure, but economically and design-wise, it’s clearly the most important. It’s almost like a clean BC/AD break between what came before and what’s happening now.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cameron:</strong> I think you’re exactly right. When I mention <em>Valhalla</em>, it’s certainly not the first place that they’re highlighting those numbers and talking about engagement. I do think it starts with the beginning of the Leila/Hassan games. There’s something interesting that you make a new trilogy with a new economic model foregrounded underneath it. I think all of that starts with <em>Origins </em>and probably starts earlier.&nbsp;</p><p>But by the time you get to <em>Valhalla</em>, it’s such a major part of the self-narration of Ubisoft and of the franchise. I think the reason for that is that <em>Valhalla </em>broke $1 billion in revenue – or at least, that’s what Ubisoft claimed. So I think Valhalla gets highlighted by them so much because it demonstrates the thing they started with <em>Origins </em>has reached its apex with a three or four year-long support cycle on it that had daily content and weekly content associated with it that’s demonstrating not only a drip feed of stuff, but a firehose of stuff that is monetizable at all times.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s a fascinating game. The thing that’s tricky about writing a book like this is, every game in the franchise could support 250 pages of serious writing about it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> When thousands of people worked on anything, it can support one book if not more.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cameron:</strong> And thousands of people who have strong opinions and are willing to ping off each other. Each game is kind of an argument for why<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> should exist. There’s a real diligence to pulling those things apart.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/chess-dungeon-crawler-yeah"><h3>Chess Dungeon Crawler, Yeah</h3></a><p>Below the Crown combines roguelike hallmarks with chess</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-assassins-creed-reconstruction-ubisoft]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Capcom Cup 12, with its finals scheduled for March of next year, is set to be the first pay-per-view livestream for a major <em>Street Fighter</em> tournament. On Friday, however, the Japanese publisher might change how much it charges players to watch it. That’s in response to <a href="https://kotaku.com/street-fighter-6-capcom-cup-12-ppv-ticket-price-2000630340">a furious backlash</a> from fans and competitive pros alike to what would be a controversial milestone for professional esports.</p> <p>“Currently, we are considering price adjustments for the paid live viewing,” Capcom announced on X earlier today, according to the platforms’ auto-translation. “We plan to make another announcement regarding the pricing of live viewing tickets, as well as the background and intent behind it, by late October.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="ja" dir="ltr">＜カプコンeSportsイベント 有料チケットに関するお知らせ＞<br>本日より「CAPCOM CUP 12」「ストリートファイターリーグ: ワールドチャンピオンシップ 2025」の国技館の会場観戦チケットの抽選販売受付を開始いたします。</p> <p>▼詳しくはこちら▼<a href="https://t.co/UdNZJzoxUf">https://t.co/UdNZJzoxUf</a>…</p> <p>— CAPCOM eSports (@CAPCOM_eSports) <a href="https://twitter.com/CAPCOM_eSports/status/1976528542889545892?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>While fans can pay to attend the tournament live in-person, they’ll also have to pay to watch it live online. Right now the ticket price is $40 for two days of matches. That’s as much as it currently costs to buy <em>Street Fighter 6</em>. While some fans are against Capcom charging at all, others might be satisfied if the publisher simply lowers the price, or rolls the ticketing into a broader package that also includes in-game cosmetics.</p>

 <p>Capcom’s retreat comes a week after S<em>treet Fighter 6</em> director Takayuki Nakayama confirmed on social media that the development team was not consulted about the pay-per-view pricing for the more than $1 million prize pool event. “It may sound strange, but it’s true,” he <a href="https://x.com/takaNakayama/status/1973626143187280262">wrote</a>. “Revenue targets and assigned tasks differ fundamentally by department. Even the development team was surprised by this announcement. (At least Matsumoto and I were shocked at the venue). That said, since this matter occurred within the same company, we are currently discussing it. We apologize for any concern this may have caused.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">For example, the initiatives we implemented in the previous title. That was a proposal from the development team—it was tough but fun.<br>Since then, the organization has grown significantly, and various departments have been established.<br>My main responsibilities now are improving…</p> <p>— TAKA-nakayama (@takaNakayama) <a href="https://twitter.com/takaNakayama/status/1973633016691040448?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>He also confirmed that there was no discussions about including tickets for the livestream in add-on content for the game, like a World Championship costume set. Nakayama even added that he’d delete his post if he got “scolded at work” for it. That clearly hasn’t happened.</p> <p>“We kindly ask for your patience until then,” Capcom told fans today. “We sincerely appreciate your continued support for Capcom eSports events.”</p>
