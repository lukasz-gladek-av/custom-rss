<figure><a title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d2eef610549ee/metroid-prime-4-beyond.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Last week, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/rumour-a-nintendo-direct-is-reportedly-coming-ahead-of-marios-40th-anniversary">it was claimed</a> that a Nintendo Direct would take place later this month on <strong>12th September</strong> via a post from <a href="https://x.com/TheSwitchForce/status/1959828809559249019">SwitchForce</a> on X. Now, this alone wouldn't be much cause for alarm, but <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-nintendo-direct-is-reportedly-planned-for-mid-september/">VGC</a> had also corroborated this and stated that its own sources have made mention of a Direct on this date.</p>
<p>Adding fuel to the fire, <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1962214416339833244">Nate the Hate</a>, a YouTuber / podcast host who has accurately predicted several Nintendo Direct presentations in the past, has now stated that a Direct will indeed take place in September.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>In an effort to seemingly give himself a little room for error, however, Nate the Hate has said that the showcase will take place in the "second week of the month, in the latter half on or around Sept 11 or 12th".</p>

<p>It's not the most outrageous prediction imaginable; after all, given that we've yet to receive release dates for the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, both of which are scheduled for '2025' and 'Winter' respectively, it's reasonable to assume that we'll be getting a Direct pretty soon.</p>
<p>In addition, of course, Mario himself is celebrating his 40th anniversary this month, with the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> on NES having launched in Japan on, wait for it... 13th September 1985. So yeah, a Direct in September to coincide with this seems pretty safe, no?</p>
<p>Still, folks have been wrong in the past, so we'll just have to wait and see. We reckon it's notable that we now have multiple sources pointing to roughly the same date, so let's all keep our eyes peeled next week for that official announcement...</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksong-will-launch-at-19-99.1285449/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Adelaide-based independent developer Team Cherry has now <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:njcr3moahtid7crxdjtu26jp/post/3lxqi3epy3s2p?ref_src=embed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> the launch pricing of Hollow Knight: Silksong: $19.99/€19.99/¥2300. The studio also shared the unlock time with the fans, confirming that the game will be playable starting Thursday, August 4, at 7 AM Pacific Time | 10 AM Eastern Time | 4 PM Central European Time | 11 PM Japan Time.</p>



<p>It must feel almost unreal to Hollow Knight aficionados. It's been eight and a half years since the first game won widespread critical acclaim and became so popular that it has sold over 15 million units over time. Silksong was announced just two years later and was already playable at E3 2019. Still, for a long while, there were no updates from the team, who would later say they preferred to focus all energies on the development instead of communication. </p>



<p>Originally conceived as a DLC for the first installment, Hollow Knight: Silksong has since become much bigger than its predecessor, boasting more enemies, bosses, and 'benches'. It also features a full-fledged quest system and a journal to track those quests. In the narrative, Hornet, the former princess of Hallownest (the region featured in the first game), is captured and brought to the haunted Kingdom of Pharloom, described as a place "haunted by silk and song." She then embarks on a deadly pilgrimage to ascend its peak and discovers ancient secrets tied to her very nature and past.</p>



<p>The game's release date announcement forced several indie games (CloverPit, Aeterna Lucis, Baby Steps, Demonschool, Faeland, Little Witch in the Woods, and the demo of Stomp and the Sword of Miracles) to <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-delays-indie-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delay their own launches</a>, as they feared being overshadowed by the long-anticipated sequel. As a reminder, Hollow Knight: Silksong is being released on PC (Windows, macOS, Linux), PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Hell is Us is the latest game from Montreal-based studio, Rogue Factor, which has greatly emphasized that this is a game not looking to hold your hand. There are no map markers, no quest trackers, none of the usual open-world comforts modern video game players enjoy.</p>



<p>The game will even remind you of this before it starts, to try and make it land that you're meant to find your way through the game by using your instincts, and paying close attention to your environment. After reviewing it for Wccftech, I can say that Hell is Us does a great job at making that experience feel fun and smooth. I can also say there are a few bits of knowledge that would've been nice to have going into the journey.</p>



<p>That's why this guide will break down the five most important things you'll want to know to be ready to jump into Hell is Us, that also don't ruin the mystery and fun of discovery that's so core to the experience.</p>



<h2 id="h-5-things-to-know-before-starting-hell-is-us-guide">5 Things to Know Before Starting Hell is Us Guide</h2>



<h3 id="h-1-have-a-notebook-and-a-pen-at-the-ready">1. Have a notebook and a pen at the ready</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Sometimes it's just easier to write details like this down instead of running back and forth if you can't remember them.</figcaption></figure>



<p>You don't need to be writing everything you see and do down, this isn't Blue Prince. But it is helpful to have a notebook beside you with a pen ready to jot down potential clues you come across and parts of a puzzle solution as you try to solve the several puzzles you'll face in Hell is Us. The puzzle gameplay is arguably more important to the game than the combat, and unless you have an incredible memory, or swap back and forth between your game and screenshots you take, you'll need a notebook by your side.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-you-can-t-always-solve-the-puzzle-in-front-of-you-the-first-time-you-see-it">2. You can't always solve the puzzle in front of you the first time you see it</h3>



<figure><figcaption>You won't be able to get into every building and solve every puzzle when you first find them.</figcaption></figure>



<p>There will be a few puzzles you come across, one even in the very first area of the game, that you can't solve the first time you see them. You'll need an item or some piece of knowledge that you'll acquire later on in the game, so the only thing to do is to move on and come back to it later.</p>



<p>With Hell is Us lacking any map or quest trackers, it's tough at times to know what will help you progress the main story, what's optional, and what you need to be doing next. All of that packed together means it's easy to spend far too long smashing your head against something you literally cannot solve the first or sometimes even the second time you come across it. Again, another reason why it's good to have a notebook with you, so you can make a note remembering to go back when you have the item or knowledge you're missing.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-spec-into-crowd-control">3. Spec into crowd-control</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Combat encounters are often 3-or-more-against-1. Image credit: Rogue Factor</figcaption></figure>



<p>You have a few different weapon varieties you can choose from, and between those varieties, you can tweak them by infusing abilities based on four core emotions that are central to the game's story. It all comes down to what you prefer to use, because I found that there are things to appreciate with weapon variants for each emotion. But succeeding in the combat is less about the specifics of your gear, and more about how the weapons and abilities you select let you control the flow of combat.</p>



<p>Hell is Us doesn't feature a lot of boss fights; more accurately, it features several combat encounters with a few or sometimes large quantities of enemies that are designed to try and catch you off-balance. That's why whatever weapon you choose, whatever emotional variant you infuse it with, you'll want abilities and a weapon that can help you even out the odds.</p>



<p>A larger weapon, like a greatsword or the halbred-esque polearm are helpful physical tools for crowd control, but area-of-effect abilities that can be added to any of your weapons are going to be more important in helping you keep the advantage in a fight. So even if you go with the shorter-ranged twin axes, as I did for a good chunk of my playthrough, having abilities that stunned and damaged enemies within a certain area of impact helped even out the fact that I could only really focus my blows at one creature at a time, instead of taking wide sweeping attacks against a group.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-talk-to-everyone">4. Talk to everyone</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Details on where to go and what to do next will commonly come up in conversations you have.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This one should be a little more obvious due to how puzzle solving works in Hell is Us, but it needs to be said: talk to every NPC you see. If you can ask them questions, ask them as many questions as you can. Even the six general knowledge topics you'll see appear with every NPC you can have a direct conversation with.</p>



<p>Most of the time, answers pertaining to your investigation and the puzzle you're trying to solve will come through the unique questions you can ask for each NPC. But there are answers to be found when asking the general knowledge questions.</p>



<p>Even beyond just asking to try and help solve a gameplay-related issue you have, it's worth talking to them because Rogue Factor has done a wonderful job in making everyone you meet feel like a real person. Half of the enjoyment there is in Hell is Us comes from the strength of its supporting cast. Spend as much time with them as you can.</p>



<p>Also, you'll have objects you can 'Trade' with NPCs, which is to say there are things you'll find in the world that, if you listen carefully, are items you can deliver to NPCs who have indirectly asked for them. If you're not sure if you've matched the right object to the person, there's no harm in asking, since the wrong person will just tell you they don't need the object or whatever it is you're offering.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-keep-your-head-on-a-swivel">5. Keep your head on a swivel</h3>



<figure><figcaption>You'll always want to be looking at what's on the walls.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hell is Us is not an open-world game. There are several places you'll go to in the game's setting throughout the story, and each is a contained zone that you can explore to the extent of its boundaries.</p>



<p>Because there's no active map for you to rely on, nothing that will tell you in real-time where you've gone and where you're going, you'll need to learn how to get around each zone. Sure, you can make notes and jot directions for yourself, but it's worth keeping in mind that each zone has been designed with the intention that you should be able to find your way naturally.</p>



<p>On top of paying attention to everything people tell you and making notes of the clues you'll read or pick up, looking at the details of your environment is vital to figuring out where to go next and how to solve the puzzles you'll come across. Keep your head on a swivel and don't stop looking around until you're sure you have all the information you need as you move from room to room and place to place within each zone. Since they're all contained, you don't have to worry as much about getting lost and winding up somewhere too far from where you want to be, like how taking the wrong path in an open-world game can mean an hour of backtracking if you're not paying attention.</p>

                <p>Are you wondering about how long it takes to beat <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hell-is-us/" data-ref-id="5000-562538"><strong>Hell Is Us</strong></a>? This action-adventure offering from Rogue Factor combines sci-fi elements and a bit of dark fantasy horror on the side. Apart from facing ferocious foes, you also have to contend with a bunch of brain-teasing puzzles.</p><h2>How long to beat Hell Is Us - Campaign length and main missions</h2><p>On average, it should take you around <strong>12 to 20 hours</strong> to complete Hell Is Us' campaign. You might be curious as to why there's a huge gap in the estimates. Well, that's because you can tweak the game's difficulty while you're playing. These include lowering the health, base damage, and aggressiveness of enemies. So, if you feel like focusing more on exploration instead of combat, then encounters against hostile foes shouldn't present too much of a challenge.</p><p>That said, if you're more of a completionist, then trying to find every single item, upgrade, and secret in Hell Is Us could take you anywhere from <strong>25 to 35 hours</strong>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4556327-hell-is-us-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556327" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4556327-hell-is-us-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556327"></a><figcaption>The Lymbic Forge is where you need to place your Keystones.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4556327-hell-is-us-how-long-to-beat-campaign-length-1.jpg"></figure><h2>Hell Is Us main missions list</h2><p>These are the main missions in the campaign:</p><ul><li>Family Reunion</li><li>Family Legacy</li><li>Searching for the Keystone of Terror</li><li>Searching for the Keystone of Rage</li><li>Searching for the Keystone of Ecstasy</li><li>[REDACTED]</li></ul><p>The Family Legacy and Family Reunion arcs comprise the game's first act. From there, the campaign opens up into a longer second act where you search for artifacts known as Keystones. Each individual arc has an investigation that leads to two or three zones as well.

						<h5>Hell is Us</h5><p><span>September 4, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>I've been intrigued by the third major release from Montreal-based developer <a href="https://rogue-factor.com/?lang=en">Rogue Factor</a>, Hell is Us, ever since I first saw its debut in 2022. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/hell-is-us-is-an-unreal-engine-5-action-adventure-game-due-next-year/">teaser trailer</a> didn't give away much, and frankly, there's a lot about that original trailer that looks very different now, even if I can look back on it and recognize what every element of it refers to now that I've hit credits on it days ahead of its full release. But I've kept the game in the back of my mind for years now, which has its own layer of expectation building, even though I realistically knew very little about the game.</p>



<p>My expectations only rose with its marketing push in the last year, with the first debut of gameplay last <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ynk7LyKGNHM">September</a>, a <a href="https://wccftech.com/hell-is-us-gets-15-minute-extended-gameplay-video/">more detailed look</a> at the puzzle and combat elements in that same month, and again this <a href="https://wccftech.com/hell-is-us-dungeon-gameplay-trailer/">past July</a>. I purposely avoided the demo to be as devoid of spoilers as possible regarding how the game would actually feel, but I've more or less followed each step of its public development, and in all that time I've been particularly interested in the studio's emphasis on how Hell is Us has "<em>no hand-holding</em>" for players.</p>



<p>"<em>There's no map, no quest markers, and no hand-holding. Just organic exploration asking you to trust your senses</em>," the game's art and creative director, Jonathan Jacques-Belletête, said in July. The game even reminds you about all of this before it starts.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Hell is Us warns you from the start.</figcaption></figure>



<p>I love that kind of game, challenging me to think outside the box consistently and pay attention to my surroundings more than the map in a menu screen.</p>



<p>And for the most part, I'm glad to say that Hell is Us delivers on that experience in spades. At least until you start to recognize commonalities within its various puzzles, and, as what happened in my case, years of experience with games like Resident Evil and Uncharted kick in to help solve the several puzzles that require you to match symbols with environmental landmarks or figure out the path to odd and uniquely shaped objects that just so happen to fit into a concave spot in the centre of the door you're trying to open.</p>



<p>But even after seeing the patterns, the puzzles are still fun to solve. Paired with a strong combat system, a gameplay and narrative structure that lets you go at your own pace, a thick atmosphere, stunning visuals, and an intriguing lore to the game world that makes me want to read each item description, Hell is Us is, without a doubt, one of 2025's best games.</p>



<figure><figcaption>The Acasa Marshes is the second major zone you visit.</figcaption></figure>



<p>It's not perfect, though, faltering with its core character, narrative, and the unfortunate reality that faces many modern games, which is the fact that they really didn't need those light RPG elements that seem to have little to no impact on how you progress.</p>



<p>I want to start by talking about its story, Remi, and the fictional country of the game's setting, Hadea. Some basic context for Hell is Us: you play as a man named Remi. Born in Hadea, he was sent away by his mother when he was just five years old, with her final words to him being "<em>I love you. Never come back</em>." Despite growing up in the outside world to be a military man, Remi shows a distinct inability to follow orders and smuggles himself into Hadea years later to find his parents based on a small set of facts he remembers.</p>



<figure><figcaption>You don't have maps or quest markers, but you do have a device that you can check at all times with records of who you've talked to and what you learned from them.</figcaption></figure>



<p>He was born in Hadea, his family lived in a town called Jova, and his father was the town's blacksmith. He doesn't know if his parents are still alive, but armed with those three facts, he's determined to find them. We begin our journey with Remi after he's officially made it in under the guise of being part of a peacekeeping force trying to do its best to stop the two peoples of Hadea, Sabinians and Palomists, from killing each other off in a brutal civil war.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Remi wears gear he picks up from a mystery person who saves his life.</figcaption></figure>



<p>But that's not the only element of the game's opening. It more accurately begins with Remi strapped to a chair, with a truth serum currently being administered into his bloodstream. A man who could be a relative of the Baron Vladomir Harkonnen in Villeneuve's Dune sits across from him in a suit, sporting a hat and a bolo tie, and in one of those bits of exposition dialogue that's more for the audience, he tells Remi (us) about Remi. We're told that, according to his file, Remi is a 'high-functioning sociopath,' a cold and calculating man who cares about his own objectives and little else. A man not led by emotions, and honestly, even though it becomes clear that Remi is not without human emotion, I found that, despite Elias Toufexis being behind his voice, Remi is the most boring part of the whole story.</p>



<p>I can understand that Rogue Factor might've intended for players to have a blank sheet in Remi upon which they will write their own emotional journey, but he's not a character I created. He's the central piece of a crafted narrative, and I think it's boring to have your character be emotionless, or for them to at least present a state of emotionlessness. His brooding stare can join the legions of leading characters who are like that to look cool, I suppose? Like I said, he's not actually emotionless, but his range as a character is lacking, and it made it difficult for me to care about him beyond his place within the lore of the game's world. Link has more emotional range without ever saying a word, and in a game absolutely chalk-full of characters you speak to that feel like real people, with real emotions, I found myself stunned by the fact that Remi lacked what I found everywhere else in the game.</p>



<p>Maybe that's another reason why Remi is as boring as he is, because you're supposed to care about everyone else more. You'll talk to Sabinians and Palomists, you'll hear about their traditions, their histories, their cultural views, and perhaps most importantly, you'll hear how they talk about each other.</p>


<figure>
<div>

<figure>
<figure><figcaption>You know from the beginning that Remi gets caught at some point.</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Rebecca lost her parents and her brother in the fighting.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Some Sabinians will tell you the Palomists aren't even people, and that they deserve to have their homes pillaged, destroyed, be sent to work camps, and stay under the Sabinian boot until they die. Some Palomists will tell you, "<em>The only good Sabinian is a dead one</em>," that they are of a lesser stock compared to Palomists, and that they deserve to be treated as such. You'll see graffiti of a group of people having been lynched, which Palomists call "<em>the Sabinian family tree.</em>" Some, from either side, will express disgust at the hatred, the fighting, and the atrocities committed. They'll argue they're all Hadeans first, and beyond that, they are all human. The atmosphere built by what you see and hear in the environmental storytelling weighed on me constantly, with signs of hate and violence that remind me too much of real-world news and the worst examples of what people are capable of.</p>



<p>Both will argue an original claim to Hadea, with the Palomists' argument generally carrying more religious reasons than the ones given by the Sabinians. And again, there are a select few on both sides who believe the two can coexist peacefully, and that this fighting has to come to an end.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Palomists and Sabinians call anyone not born in Hadea 'an outsider.'</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Children are the future.</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Almost everyone you talk to will give you an opinion on the same six topics.</figcaption></figure>
</figure>

</div>
</figure>



<p>It was impossible for me to hear all of this and not think of the ongoing genocide in Gaza, particularly due to how the fighting between the Sabinians and the Palomists is depicted between its historical and religious origins. I'm not saying that Rogue Factor mapped the conflict between Sabinians and Palomists based on the generations of fighting between Palestinians and Israelis, or that Sabinians were mapped to Palestinians and Palomists to Israelis or vice-versa. In fact, key differences in how the situation in Hadea is depicted seem to avoid those one-to-one comparisons purposefully. The studio's technical designer, Simon Girard, even discussed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/history-is-repeating-itself-the-real-world-inspirations-of-hell-is-us-are-as-relevant-today-as-they-were-30-years-ago">in an interview</a> that went live days before this review, how Hadea is meant to represent no singular conflict, just the reality of civil wars in a brutal way. "<em>The nature is of neighbours-against-neighbours. It's not one country against another. It's people who are the same, right? They're divided amongst either geographical or cultural or religious lines, but they're one in the same</em>."</p>



<p>Even still, the comparisons between what's presented in Hell is Us and our current world were impossible to ignore, particularly when some of the characters laid blame at the lens through which the media reported on issues between the two peoples, and how the role of the media in causing and perpetuating the civil war is discussed.</p>



<p>Rogue Factor front-loads all of this and the importance of the ongoing civil war in Hadea and the divide between Sabinians and Palomists, with your introduction to the town of Jova being a Sabinian-occupied town with a few Palomists trying to stay hidden, held in captivity, or, as is the case for the man who upgrades your weapons, not held captive by ropes and chains, but by being put to work for the occupying force. The rest of the town was either taken to the forest to be shot or sent to work camps.</p>



<p>It's a violent, terrifying introduction to Hadea, with dark displays of hatred in every house you walk into, some of which feature displays of sexual violence that are particularly dark.</p>


<figure>
<div>

<figure>
<figure><figcaption>For as dark as Hell is Us is, there's a level of humor to your first meeting with Gildas Brom.</figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption>Abbot Jaffer doesn't mince words.</figcaption></figure>

<p>Almost everywhere you go in the game is like this. One area is spared, with its design being that of a warm blanket and all the comfort it can provide. It's a safe haven from the fighting, where you can see NPCs end up by making certain narrative choices, but the rest of the game's locations don't let up.</p>



<p>To say that it's a lot to kick things off is an understatement, so I found it disappointing that it all took a backseat in the narrative to focus on the more fictional elements. The history of Hadea and the fighting between Sabinians and Palomists are all woven through the lore, but Remi's personal quest drives the bus for the story. It was a heavy narrative opening with no real payoff, and ultimately landed on 'War is bad, humans are capable of awful things.' That's a fine message, but it felt lacking when compared to the opening and what follows with every other city you go to in Hadea, and the complexities of the characters you meet.</p>



<p>The game even has an added layer to the narrative with examples of the creatures you fight being less monstrous than the people of Hadea, but it's once again not leaned on enough.</p>


<figure>
<div>

<figure><figcaption>Maeve works in a major Sabinian city.</figcaption></figure>

			    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>There was also a core element of the gameplay that I found a tad narratively incongruent with the positive side of any message its narrative has, which is centered around helping people who need help. You can return to a key NPC to receive a reward every time you complete a side quest that's called a 'Good Deed.' You'll get a gameplay-focused reward when you do so, and getting a reward each time feels like it misses the point of doing the good deed in the first place.</p>



<p>This is all to say that Hell is Us gets a lot of things right with its narrative. The lore of the creatures and the history Rogue Factor has built is really interesting, and I have a lot of time for a game that tells its story through environmental design and item descriptions more than it does cutscenes. But it doesn't stick the landing, and doesn't go as deep as I expected it to based on its heavy opening.</p>



<p>The gameplay, on the other hand, is actually pretty much the same, just on a different scale. It's good, sometimes really good, sometimes great, but doesn't succeed in crossing the line to amazing. The combat is fairly solid. I really appreciate a key mechanic that lets you get your health back by being aggressive. But, at least when playing on its normal, balanced difficulty setting, it was never challenging enough that I had to really engage with the various buffs and slight build changes you can make with passive and active abilities and special attacks.</p>


<figure>

</div>
</figure>



<p>Once you find what works between your weapon choice, abilities, and drone attacks, sticking with it is all you need to do, and you can practically ignore everything else that's not just 'upgrade your weapon to hit harder' afterwards. I found a passive relic that, when equipped, made it so that I did 200% damage to enemies after a successful parry. Paired with a halbred-esque weapon called a Polearm, I got through every combat encounter with little trouble. There are a few cool-looking killing blows you can deliver, though. I also appreciated that even though there were only a few variations of the creatures you fight, later-stage versions of them get new attacks to switch things up.</p>



<p>The best part about playing Hell is Us, though, is its puzzles, partly because the whole world is a puzzle, as you're constantly trying to put context clues together to figure out where to go next. Sometimes you solve that problem by talking to people, sometimes by looking at your surroundings, and sometimes the answers come through objects you find. Like I said before, you start to notice the pattern to it, but that doesn't make it any less fun.</p>

</div>
</figure>



<p>The puzzles kept me glued to Hell is Us. Walking around one of the major dungeons, exploring each new zone for clues about the story or where I'm supposed to be going. It's where I had the most fun, and the design that went into every puzzle, particularly in making each zone and the world you explore a giant puzzle, is why I truly think, despite my problems with its narrative, Hell is Us will remain as one of 2025's best games.</p>



<p>I can only fault it so much for falling short of its introduction, and the whole of it is I was absolutely glued to it throughout my playthrough. It only took me 26 hours to hit credits, but you can easily spend double that time looking into every nook and cranny, and I intend to keep digging further.</p>



<p>There's no question that Rogue Factor has a great game on its hands. Hell is Us is an amazing accomplishment for the studio, and especially for a core team of 55 developers. It fumbles in places, but I was so engrossed with all the things it does well that those fumbles don't overshadow the whole experience.</p>

<p>Hell is Us might not go as far as I want it to in more ways than one, but it doesn't entirely drop the ball either. Overall, it delivers a package to be missed for anyone looking for a deep narrative and a solid action game, with a lot of puzzles and a rich atmosphere tying it all together.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hell-is-us-is-a-cryptic-and-ambitious-meditation-on-the-horrors-of-war.1285425/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The opening hours of <em>Hell Is Us</em> are brilliantly confusing. The game tasks you with getting up to speed on a complicated civil war between the Palomists and Sabinians. A deluge of proper nouns is unleashed: Lymbic weaponry, Guardian Detectors, and more. But the clearest way the game communicates that you should feel utterly dumbfounded is through the cryptic stone panels scattered amid its ravaged, Eastern Europe-coded setting; you’re unable to actually read the text engraved in these tablets. At every turn in the first levels — a dank forest and then a fetid bog — meaning and, just as importantly, understanding, eludes.</p><p>In this manner of willful bewilderment, <em>Hell Is Us</em> evokes <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2018/aug/06/hidetaka-miyazaki-dark-souls-deracine-fromsoftware">Hidetaka Miyazaki</a>’s constellation of soulsborne hits. Like those games, notably <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/23/22946279/elden-ring-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Elden Ring</em></a>, here beckons a world of esoteric symbols, puzzles, and inscrutably complex history. Combat also apes the cadence of quintessential Miyazaki titles: stamina drains with each thunderous strike, recuperating only in moments of panicked or planned retreat.</p><p>Yet that’s where the FromSoftware comparisons end. <em>Hell Is Us</em> is also a detective game: you are given a pleasingly chunky retrofuturistic datapad in which you store a small encyclopedia’s worth of information, and there are spider diagrams filled with leads to follow. To solve the game’s more devilish conundrums, you may wish to have a pen and paper on hand!</p><p>Befitting both its own name and game title, the fictional country of Hadea has fallen into war-torn carnage — in essence, becoming hell itself. The first hour shows the grisly aftermath of a firing squad and lynched bodies swinging from a tree. Nearby, a soldier plays a maudlin tune on a violin. Bizarre white creatures stalk marshes and blustery plains; gigantic orbs barbed with spikes — so-called Time Loops — pulsate. These anomalous fissures in time and space are the result of the so-called “Calamity,” and it is up to protagonist Rémi, a gorpcore investigator-cum-action-hero, to send them back to oblivion.</p><p>At first, the game seems like a hodgepodge of visual styles: bleak landscapes, mannequin-like creatures, technical wear fashion, gigantic swords to rival Cloud Strife’s in <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>. Slowly, it begins to coalesce, taking on a sublime, haunted quality suffused with dream logic. The strangeness is compounded by the sheer density of obscure puzzles. What maddening realm is home to so many arcane riddles?!</p><p>There is a lot to process in <em>Hell Is Us</em>. This extends to its enemies who, if especially powerful, summon support beings via a weird, metaphysical umbilical cord. One is a white, humanoid creature; the other is a brightly colored, geometric foe. There’s a further wrinkle, as each color corresponds to an emotion: blue for grief, green for terror, and so on. The metaphor is a little hackneyed yet potent. These enemies are physical manifestations of war’s emotional wreckage. They wander the landscape, imbuing it with a surreal, psychic quality. But the symbolism is a little limited: how do you put an end to intergenerational grief? According to <em>Hell Is Us</em>, by cleaving it in two using hand axes infused with rage.</p><p>There is a breadth of ambition and imagination here but uneven execution. Take our hero, who looks great in his flapping, rain-resistant poncho, yet speaks like a gruffer, more cynical version of countless male game protagonists from the late 2000s. Gazing upon a cathedral-sized mound of human bones, Rémi (played by Elias Toufexis, aka Adam Jensen from the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/19/12545142/deus-ex-mankind-divided-eidos-montreal-square-enix-review"><em>Deus Ex</em></a> series) muses aloud: the Sabinians may be the victims here but the region is also littered with Palomist graves. It is an odd, jarring line, to make this kind of equivalence when confronted with such monumental loss.</p><p>After the wonderfully discombobulating opening hours, <em>Hell Is Us</em> loses some momentum. Hadea remains a beguiling setting throughout; the desire to pull at its various laced mysteries never wanes. But the same can’t be said of the other narrative layers, either Rémi’s own personal voyage to discover the fate of his parents and the place he fled as a young child, or precisely what the Calamity is. The former is intended to propel the player’s exploration yet it does not grip. Without the requisite narrative intrigue, the plot boils down unlocking a series of doors decorated with ornate glyphs. At one point, a character inadvertently sums up the prosaic plot: “So you found a door with a strange mechanism. What happened next?”</p><p>Meanwhile, combat — which is an activity you need to do a lot of in order to decipher the weird event that caused the appearance of the unnerving pallid creatures — becomes rote. My attention started to dwindle around hour 15 of a possible 30.</p><p>This is a shame because <em>Hell Is Us</em> does so much that is admirable and interesting. The actual dungeons that plummet below the game’s semi-open zones are a spatial symphony of claustrophobic passageways and soaring, light-filled atriums and altars. There are no waypoints or quest markers; you must carefully read journals for navigational clues (and sometimes use a compass). Another smart design choice: you can only talk to characters about information you have already uncovered. In this era of often anodyne and frictionless big-budget video games, where anything that might potentially limit a game’s audience is carefully considered and often avoided, it is refreshing to play something that is so intentionally prickly.</p><p>As I trudge forward in this muddy, miserable land, my mind keeps circling back to language and understanding: the codes, symbols, tongues, and customs of Hadea. It’s clear that I am only grasping a tiny fraction of this millennia-old conflict. But there is another, more universal language that the game seems to use, which it relays through bracing imagery: the misery of war.</p><p>Regardless of time and place, violent conflict breaks people in much the same way, making them scared, angry, vengeful, and, naturally, violent. Despite its myriad of shortcomings and sheer informational density, <em>Hell Is Us</em> speaks with clarity: of war, it is impossible to close Pandora’s box once its evils have escaped.</p><p><sub>Hell Is Us <em>launches on September 4th on the PS5, Xbox, and PC.</em></sub></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/767993/hell-is-us-review-ps5-xbox-steam#comments">0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NTQzMA=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Lewis Gordon</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/767993/hell-is-us-review-ps5-xbox-steam]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Battle Royale Map Leaked in New Footage]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-map-leaked-footage/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A <a href="https://streamable.com/ydlo9l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked footage</a> shared earlier today on the popular Chinese online video sharing website Bilibili provides the first look at the Battle Royale map that Battlefield 6 players will eventually find in the game.</p>



<p>It was early 2024 when we first <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-next-to-launch-in-october-2025-with-f2p-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> on a rumor that the new Battlefield installment would include a Battle Royale mode. That rumor, from renowned leaker Tom Henderson, correctly predicted the game's October 2025 launch date and also guessed that the mode would be available at launch. However, since then, it's become obvious that this would not be the case. First, there was a report from <a href="https://twitter.com/rivaLxfactor/status/1948529831911821481?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">content creator rivalXfactor</a>, and then, more importantly, EA did not make any mention of Battle Royale modes when describing the modes that will be there when Battlefield 6 is released. </p>



<p>On the other hand, dataminers <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-labs-nvidia-dlss-4-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">found mention of the mode in the game files</a> over two months ago, and the Battlefield Labs account recently <a href="https://twitter.com/Battlefield/status/1950993144205680912?" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> a Battle Royale mode that would be coming to the testing program soon. It looks like the mode has finally been made available to testers, leading to the leaked video mentioned above. The obvious conclusion is that BR will be introduced to Battlefield 6 at some point after launch; perhaps the developers wanted to focus on the core modes first while they ironed out Battle Royale, which is obviously very different from all the other modes.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>A free-to-play BR mode is going to be critical to even attempt to reach the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lofty 100 million players target shared internally by publisher Electronic Arts</a>. As much as long-time fans of the franchise loved the Battlefield 6 beta, it was still very much a classic, albeit refined, Battlefield experience, and there aren't anywhere near 100 million BF aficionados out there. It will take a very solid Battle Royale mode to pull at least part of that audience away from the likes of Apex Legends, Call of Duty Warzone, Fortnite, et cetera.</p>



<p>In other Battlefield 6 news, the developers have just <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-ditched-ray-tracing-focus-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that ray tracing has been left out of the game in order to focus on performance instead.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-free-look-weapon-mechanic-appears-youtubers-wild/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-weapon-%E2%80%98free-look%E2%80%99-mechanic-will-have-youtubers-running-wild.1285407/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>This weekend, videos emerged on social media showcasing Battlefield 6’s new ‘free look’ mechanic that allows users to examine their weapons from almost any angle. While holding the weapon, players can twist, tip, and turn the gun in any direction to get a better look at the weapon’s minute details, and it’s an element that’s going to have content creators running wild.</p>



<p>In almost every first-person shooter space, the most common thing for YouTubers to do for ‘thumbnails’ is to look up, reload, and capture a screenshot to showcase a weapon. It seems Electronic Arts’ studios are aware of this and have added a neat feature to add a little more diversity to the pot.</p>



<h2 id="h-get-creative-in-battlefield-6">Get Creative in Battlefield 6</h2>



<p>Some YouTubers are worse than others at this, but for years, the running theme has been the old ‘look-up-and-reload’ trick. It has served as the basis for FPS-based thumbnails on YouTube for the longest time, regardless of whether we’re talking about Battlefield, Call of Duty, Rainbow Six, Escape from Tarkov, or something in between.</p>



<p>The studios piecing together Battlefield 6 have tried to take that concept a step further, adding in a free look mechanic that allows players to actively manipulate how their weapon is being held.</p>



<p>A video surfaced on social media recently, perfectly showcasing this new mechanic:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Don't know if this was in the beta but you can inspect your gun and it's some kind of free look inspect, where your right stick will move the gun around <a href="https://t.co/b7SrCMGY2P">pic.twitter.com/b7SrCMGY2P</a></p>— bob. (@BobNetworkUK) <a href="https://twitter.com/BobNetworkUK/status/1961417910229897219?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 29, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>It wasn’t present in the Battlefield 6 beta, but it has been added now for the next round of Battlefield Labs tests. As you can see in the video above, it’s a pretty fluid, functional mechanic that screenshot lovers will adore, giving them much more accessibility in the thumbnail space.</p>



<p>I’m just excited that we might start to see <strong>differences emerge </strong>between YouTubers and the incessant reload-trick thumbs they’re uploading with each new video.</p>



<p>Are you excited to play with this feature in Battlefield 6? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Left 4 Dead Coded Shooter is Coming From The Game’s Creator]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/left-4-dead-coded-shooter-coming-from-game-creator/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-left-4-dead-coded-shooter-is-coming-from-the-game%E2%80%99s-creator.1285404/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Mike Booth, the creator of Left 4 Dead, has emerged on social media to reveal he’s piecing together an all-new four-player co-operative shooter that is ‘built on the foundations of what made L4D special.’ He promoted an application process inviting prospective fans to jump into the project as playtesters, giving an indication of how far along the game’s development is.</p>



<p>Booth boasts a storied tenure in the games industry, but he’s currently at Bad Robot Games, which has links to JJ Abrams, best known for his work in the film and television industries.</p>



<h2 id="h-teamwork-tension-and-replayability">‘Teamwork, Tension, and Replayability’</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/l4d2/comments/1n3jvu3/from_the_creator_of_l4d/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In a post</a> on the Left 4 Dead 2 Reddit channel, Mike Booth surfaced to promote his new game, but didn’t drop a title or any graphics.</p>



<p>He wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m Mike Booth (creator of Left 4 Dead), and I’m excited to share that I’m working on a brand new project —a 4-player co-op shooter built on the foundations of what made L4D special.</p>



<p>If you enjoyed the teamwork, tension, and replayability of my past games, you’ll probably find this one interesting. It expands on the co-op formula in ways I’ve wanted to explore for a long time.</p>



<p>We’re still in the early stages of development, but we’re opening up playtests to a limited number of players. If you’re interested in joining us on this next adventure and helping shape the game early on, we’d love to have you involved.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/left-4-deads-creator-is-making-a-comeback-to-create-the-next-big-co-op-shooter-3244290/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a> for the spot)</em></p>



<p>The comment section exploded with excitement as users realized that it could be a spiritual successor to the franchise that effectively died a death in 2009 when Left 4 Dead 2 was released and promptly marked <strong>the end </strong>of the series.</p>



<p>In 2021, Back 4 Blood was released by Turtle Rock Studios, but despite being marketed as a twisted successor to Left 4 Dead, it fell flat on its face relatively quickly.</p>



<p>Coincidentally, Mike Booth was working at Turtle Rock more than a decade ago, before leaving for Blizzard. That post eventually fell through, and Booth <a href="https://x.com/_MikeBooth/status/627164439788138497" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">confirmed on social media</a> that his project ‘wasn’t a good fit’ for Blizzard.</p>



<p>There’s definitely room for another Left 4 Dead-coded game, but will Mike Booth deliver from his position at Bad Robot? It’s worth stressing that at no point does Booth mention <strong>zombies</strong>, but you never know.</p>



<p>Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a> if you’re excited for this game.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-steam-page-%E2%80%98available-soon%E2%80%99-it%E2%80%99s-confirmed.1285395/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>This past weekend, teasers started surfacing from Battlestate Games suggesting that Escape from Tarkov, the most popular extraction shooter ever made, is heading to Steam. This landmark move for the game was met with a mixed reception from fans worldwide, but it’s all part of the 1.0 release of Escape from Tarkov, which is happening on November 15.</p>



<p>On social media, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, Nikita Buyanov, has just confirmed that Escape from Tarkov <strong>is </strong>coming to Steam soon, and more details are incoming.</p>



<h2 id="h-tarkov-is-coming-to-steam-soon">Tarkov is Coming to Steam Soon</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-steam-release-teased-battlestate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teasers posted recently</a> on social media followed a promise made months ago that Escape from Tarkov would come to Steam with the game’s 1.0 release. In recent weeks, we learned that Escape from Tarkov will be released as a full game on November 15, bringing to an end almost a decade of beta testing.</p>



<p>Nikita Buyanov followed up on the teasers with a shot of Tarkov’s Steam page and wrote that it’ll be available soon:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Escape from Tarkov fans were quick to criticize, with some pointing out how Steam’s lenient refund policies could negatively impact Battlestate Games’ decision, especially as many feel that the game isn’t ‘1.0 ready’.</p>



<p>This weekend, Battlestate Games took <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/">Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 version</a> to PAX, letting swarms of fans, including some of the game’s top creators, demo the new version. The feedback has been positive, with many stressing that players ‘aren’t ready’ for how good the 1.0 release will be.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov’s arrival on Steam is a <strong>huge </strong>moment for the game, but will you fork over the cash to buy the game again on a new platform? Let me know on the Insider Gaming forum what you’re planning to do.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-warzone-season-5-reloaded-start-times/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/when-does-black-ops-6-season-5-reloaded-start-%E2%80%94update-times-and-content-explained.1285392/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 remains one of the world’s best-selling games, even now. It has had a troubled life, marked by controversies, bizarre skin bundles, and issues with cheaters, but there’s no doubting the pull of Call of Duty. Now, fans are preparing to pick up the Black Ops 6 Season 5 Reloaded update, which brings a nice mid-season content drop.</p>



<p>Below, I’ve pulled together the key information about the Black Ops 6 Season 5 Reloaded update that you’ll need while you wait for it to drop.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-season-5-reloaded-coming-to-warzone-and-black-ops-6">When is Season 5 Reloaded Coming to Warzone and Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p><strong>Season 5 Reloaded of Black Ops 6 and Warzone will be released on September 4, 2025. </strong>This supersized update introduces a new map, ‘Jackpot’, a high-octane new multiplayer mode, fresh weapons and attachments, and new limited-time events (LTMs).</p>



<p>Here are the release times for Season 5 Reloaded in Black Ops 6 and Warzone:</p>



<ul>
<li>September 4, 11:00 AM CT</li>



<li>September 4, 12:00 PM ET</li>



<li>September 4, 5:00 PM BST</li>



<li>September 4, 6:00 PM CEST</li>



<li>September 4, 8:00 PM GST</li>



<li>September 5, 1:00 AM JST</li>



<li>September 5, 2:00 AM AEST</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-season-5-end-in-black-ops-6">When Does Season 5 End in Black Ops 6?</h3>



<p>Season 5 will wrap on September 9, which doesn’t give you all that long to grind the Call of Duty Battle Pass and unlock this season’s rewards ahead of the imminent release of Black Ops 7.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-season-5-reloaded">What’s in Season 5 Reloaded?</h2>



<p>Season 5 Reloaded features a casino-themed map called Jackpot, a core 6v6 map. It’s pulled straight from the Black Ops 6 campaign. Players diving into Black Ops 6’s multiplayer platform after the update will also be able to play Cranked Demolition, Ransack, and Blueprint Gunfight, most of which can unfold on Jackpot.</p>



<p>When Season 5 Reloaded hits, you’ll be able to unlock the sweet Gravemark .357 Revolver, a stunning pistol with insane power output. Later in the update, players will be able to get the Combat Bow, a scorestreak rather than a core weapon. Those who love to run and gun will also appreciate the new PPSh-41 Helical Magazine attachment.</p>



<p>Zombies fans will get access to the Directed Mode for Reckoning, helping them to solve the map’s puzzles and trials, and Warzone users will gain access to the Deadline LTM.</p>



<p>What are you most looking forward to in Season 5 Reloaded? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Another Key Fairgames Developer Quietly Leaves Haven Studios]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/another-key-fairgames-developer-quietly-leaves/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/another-key-fairgames-developer-quietly-leaves-haven-studios.1285380/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fairgames was the talk of the town a few weeks back when it was rumoured that Haven Studios had <strong>cancelled </strong>the upcoming live-service shooter. This claim was retracted within a matter of hours, and as far as we know, Fairgames continues to be developed and backed by PlayStation.</p>



<p>However, prospective fans of the game have used their eagle-eyed powers to learn that yet another high-ranking departure has occurred at Haven Studios, as the game director of Fairgames has left the company. This news comes just three months after the studio’s founder also left for greener pastures.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-happening-with-fairgames">What’s Happening with Fairgames?</h2>



<p>The recent retraction of the claim that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fairgames-not-cancelled-confirmation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fairgames was cancelled</a> was enough to shake the boat considerably, as the rumor sent gamers into a spiral, wondering about the future of this seemingly ill-fated live-service shooter.</p>



<p>Fairgames (stylized as Fairgame$) was revealed in 2023, and since the first trailer dropped, almost nothing more has been shared about the game’s development. Haven Studios was founded in 2021 to bring the game to life, but it seems things aren’t going as well as expected.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jade-raymond-leaves-haven-studios-after-founding/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jade Raymond</a>, one of the studio’s founders, departed the team in May, and now, the game’s director has also split.</p>



<p>It was discovered <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1n5bmy9/game_director_leave_fairgames_after_45_years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by a Reddit user</a> that Daniel Drapeau, the former game director at Haven Studios, has left the company to take up a role at WB Games Montreal. He’s now a creative director at the studio most recently known for Gotham Knights and for assisting on Suicide Squad, which isn’t the best track record.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>That sentiment was echoed by users on Reddit, with one writing, ‘Out of the pan and into the fire.’ Another quipped, ‘Escaped Titanic, ended up on the OceanGate submarine.’</p>



<p>Do you think Fairgames is in danger of being cancelled? Let me know your thoughts on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/silksong-when-release-live-price-hollow-knight-steam-2000621785</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksong-fans-can%E2%80%99t-believe-how-cheap-it-is.1285353/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s mildly shocking that <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-the-kotaku-review-1827367425"><em>Hollow Knight</em> was just $15</a> when it came to PC back in 2017. It’s even more surprising that eight years and over a million Steam wishlists later, the sequel is only $5 more. Team Cherry has confirmed <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-demo-hands-on-price-hollow-knight-pax-west-2000621695"><em>Silksong</em>‘s final price</a> and launch times cementing this upcoming week as the official kick-off of the 2025 fall video game release blitz.</p> <p>While most games have gone up $10 or more in the jump to the current console generation, <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> is aggressively going against the grain with just a $20 price tag on Steam and elsewhere. Team Cherry only <a href="https://x.com/TeamCherryGames/status/1962330350681735642">officially confirmed</a> the amount on Sunday night after a weekend of speculation following leaks on GameSpot and elsewhere.</p> <p>The move has won Team Cherry tons of additional good will with fans who were already praising it for withholding review copies so that Kickstarter backers would still be among the first to get access to the game. Plenty of players commenting on the latest pricing announcement still can’t understand why the game isn’t more.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="qme" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/cR0JuzvhxH">pic.twitter.com/cR0JuzvhxH</a></p> <p>— Kalrim Frosthill (@KalrimFrosthill) <a href="https://twitter.com/KalrimFrosthill/status/1962333593570795730?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Make it $40 or I’m not buying,” joked one. Others recalled co-director Ari Gibson’s previous defense of charging so little for the first game, noting the development team’s desire for as many people as possible to play the game. And <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-interview-delay-hollow-knight-team-cherry-2000619168">with 15 million copies sold</a> of the original<em> Hollow Knight</em>, Team Cherry has the flexibility to make that happen.</p> <p>In retrospect, it’s also wild to think one of the biggest games of the year only had a placeholder in the pre-order box until now. Maybe discussions were still ongoing within the team. After all, fellow indie darlings <a href="https://kotaku.com/hades-2-switch-2-exclusivity-pc-steam-1-0-date-1851775233">like Supergiant Games’ <em>Hades 2</em></a> are currently $30 and likely to cost even more at the end of Early Access (the studio behind Bastion and Transistor seems to be doing us all a favor by waiting to launch its own sequel until later in the fall).</p>

 <h2>What time does<em> Silksong</em> go live on Steam?</h2> <p>While the September 4 release date for <em>Silksong</em> has been known for just over a week now, it wasn’t entirely clear exactly when the game would go live until today. Alongside the price, Team Cherry also confirmed the launch time for each time zone:</p> <ul> <li>7AM PT | 10AM ET | 4PM CEST | 11PM JST</li> </ul> <p>That suggests everyone across PC and console will begin getting to play Hollow Knight sequel at roughly the same time.

<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong is the highly anticipated sequel to the beloved 2017 indie hit Hollow Knight. It was originally announced as an expansion to the original game before its scope grew into a full standalone title. The new title sees you play as Hornet, the former Princess of Hallownest. Hornet is captured and taken to the Kingdom of Pharloom, where she must escape through a realm ruled by silk and song. According to Team Cherry, the game features over 200 enemies and 40 bosses in a world full of “mossy grottos, gilded cities and misted moors”.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong will be available on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PC, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One. It will also be available on day one through Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Gameplay for the upcoming Battlefield 6 Battle Royale game mode has been leaked online. The gameplay originally appeared on the Chinese social media site bilibili but has since found its way onto other social media platforms.</p>



<p>The clip, <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield_inf/status/1962273931819127268" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">which you can watch</a> below for now, is 1:53 in length. In that short time, you can see the start of the mode, swimming mechanics, building destruction via sledgehammer, and more. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Though details remain slim, the new game mode <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-battle-royale-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was confirmed during Battlefield 6’s reveal</a> back in July. What is currently known is that there will be a standard Battle Royal mode as well as a more competitive mode called Gauntlet.</p>



<p>While it won’t launch alongside the game, the new mode will be free-to-play and is EA’s challenge to Call of Duty Warzone. Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/">first reported the existence</a> of the Battle Royale mode in early 2024. And although the gameplay footage above is new, it’s not the first leak related to the mode to surface online. In recent weeks, gameplay, points of interest, and the map have all been leaked—though each was taken down within hours.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 releases October 10 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. If you’re hoping for a Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game, game lead Vince Zampella has confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-plans-for-battlefield-6-on-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there are currently no plans</a> to bring it to the new system, as EA is focused on where the “core Battlefield audience” plays.</p>



<p>What do you think of the gameplay from the Battlefield 6 Battle Royale mode? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <p>Watch out, there's a goblin over there! Have you dispatched him with a deceased Blade's rusty blade? Good, we can now keep trekking through the revamped Imperial sewers dungeon that unofficial <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion">Oblivion</a> remake <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a>'s devs have just shown off.</p>
<p>The massive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-skyrim-mods">Skyrim mod</a>'s getting ever closer to the release its creators have pencilled in for later this year. Despite that looming, they've not opted to skip what's become an annual cameo at fan-run <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> modding showcase <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CreationModCon/featured">Creation Mod Con</a>, alongside a bunch of other in-the-works Elder Scrolls remake projects and add-ons.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I spoke to Skyblivion project lead Kyle 'Rebelzize' Rebel ahead of Creation Mod Con about where the modders are at in terms of announcing the mod's full release date. "Progress is generally good, volunteer based projects are always a challenge due to people sometimes dropping out or not having as much time to contribute as in the past," he told me. "To work around that we try as much as possible to keep the project a bit flexible and change our MVP (minimum viable product) according to the team's capability. I'd say recent developments made us come closer to a potential date announcement, but we will be able to share more about that at a later date."</p>
<p>The team also revealed that in addition to the GOG release they announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivion-project-lead-and-gog-chat-about-partnering-up-to-release-the-massive-elder-scrolls-mod-following-fallout-londons-troubled-success">back in June</a>, a release via Nexus Mods is also locked in and there are plans to offer the mod for free via Steam too. I'm intrigued to see how that last one might differ from the other two.</p>

<p>Anyway, the modders showed off the opening 15 minutes of Skyblivion in this latest showcase. Big spoiler alert - the sequence sees some youths in hoodies harass Patrick Stewart into freeing Nirn's ugliest prisoner before departing to go and voice a sentient poo in the Emoji Movie several years down the line.</p><p>I'm not joking about it being Patrick Stewart that does this, as shown a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/finishing-skyblivion-is-a-new-dev-diary-series-about-the-last-leg-of-the-oblivion-remake-mods-run-to-release">recent dev diary</a>, Skyblivion's Uriel Septim is his regal spitting image. As for the iconic series of corridors in which he's shanked up while you decide whether you're going to default to a sneak build for the hundredth time, Skyblivion's devs said they've opted to keep things "closer to the original experience" at the start so players can get up to speed with the mod's combo of Skyrim and Oblivion mechanics.</p>
<p>Though, lest you forget this is remake rather than a remaster, something the modders have understandably been keen to stress since the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">official Oblivion remaster</a> rocked up through a flaming gate earlier this year, there are plenty of the sort of tweaks and touches that've left me generally more curious to play this interpretation than Bethesda and Virtuos' efforts.</p>
<p>As you battle through the caves, there are goblin cave paintings and brief glimpses of the White-Gold Tower to ensure the background's more than a plain brown mush. They're subtle elements, designed by modders <a href="https://annakhudorenko.com/">Anna Khudorenko</a> and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/users/4419430">Penrutet</a> respectively, but I'm hoping they'll keep the experience feeling a bit fresher than the remaster's intentionally  minimalistic reskinning.</p>
<p>That said, the fresh addition I dug most from what the modders showed off here is the first look at the Imperial Mausoleum, a hall in the Arboretum where Emperor Stewart's body will now be interred once he meets his demise. The Skyblivion crew tell RPS this was designed by Gabriele Floris, aka <a href="https://www.artstation.com/kazuhide">Kazuhide</a>. They've lent their two architecture degrees to shaping the mod's version of Cyrodiil's capital, with real life mock-ups for a restoration of the Roman Emperor Augustus' mausoleum being cited as the inspiration for Uriel's resting place.</p><p>This Septim tomb's just one aspect of what you can expect from the mod's total revamp of the city. "We've really set out to entirely remake the Imperial City to be the grand cosmopolitan city it is known as in lore - that means every district is substantially larger and more detailed," Rebel tells me.</p>
<p>Skyblivion's still looking for <a href="https://skyblivion.com/volunteer/">volunteers</a> with the skills to help get it over the line.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pax-west-rage-room-gearbox-2000621767</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-borderlands-4-rage-room-is-the-most-obnoxious-thing-at-pax-west-and-people-love-it.1285263/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Stroll by Larian Studios’ <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> display at PAX West and you’ll see fans quietly playing the <em>Divinity: Original Sin</em> board game. Linger a little too long though, and you’ll hear what sounds like a car crashing through a McDonald’s drive-thru in the far corner of the show floor. And then another, and another. Follow the piercing sounds for long enough and you’ll arrive at the <em>Borderlands 4</em> Ripper Rage Room, by far the most ridiculous marketing stunt at this year’s expo.</p> <p>Fans of Gearbox Entertainment’s anarchic loot shooter, some adorned with its enemies’ iconic Psycho masks, are wrapped around a small, encased exhibit waiting for their chance to smash aluminum trash cans, glass bottles, and Dollar Store ceramics. Staff dress them in jumpsuits and riot helmets with plastic visors. Then, one at a time, they make their way into a plexiglass-ensconced chamber where they emotionally unburden themselves with a post-apocalyptic baseball bat.</p>   <p>It’s surprisingly loud and jarring, even when you know it’s coming. Imagine the heart-stopping moment in the restaurant when a waiter accidentally drops a giant tray of dishes. The immediate gasps as everyone experiences a simultaneous shot of fight-or-flight adrenaline followed by the hushed murmurings of people gawking at reality’s brief departure from the mundane.</p>

 <p>The Ripper Rage Room debuted during the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/borderlands/reel/DMnrGlOJjgH/#"><em>Borderlands 4</em> Warped Tour fan event</a> earlier this summer in L.A. and is reprising its role for PAX West. The big difference, however, is that the annual Seattle-based expo features lots of booths ranging from PC gaming giveaways to first-time indie developers desperately trying to get someone to pay attention to their passion project.</p> <p>More than one exhibitor has privately confided to me that “it must suck” for all the nearby booths who are trying to get attendees meandering on by to hang a second and listen to their pitch. In the case of Limited Run Games, the boutique physical game retailer closest to the Rage Room, that might mean hanging around long enough to pull the trigger on a copy of <em>Clock Tower: Rewind</em> for the Nintendo Switch. Then all of the sudden: *SNAP* *CRACKLE* *SMASH*.</p>       <p>But Gearbox is the king of PAX and it knows what the people want. Its massive booth for <em>Borderlands 4</em>, filled with dozens of demo stations and massive statutes of each of its Vault Hunter heroes, is both the most packed and the fastest at getting people through the queue. Fans at the Nintendo and Capcom booths complain about wait times and arcane requirements, like a lottery system for who actually gets to try <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> on Switch 2.</p>

 <p>And then there’s the Ripper Rage Room which, despite the absolute vibe-killing antics, always has people watching as each new fan briefly descends into a performative rampage, quietly realizing as they enter the translucent box that they are as much a part of the display as the brutalized silicon dummy standing in the corner. People love smashing shit. They love watching other people smash shit. Like the beautifully cel-shaded Skinner box at the heart of <em>Borderlands</em> franchise, it sometimes is just as simple as that.</p> <p>Less straightforward is the task of needing to reassemble the Ripper Rage Room after each demolition. At least three staff race to stack the trash cans, folding chairs, bottles, and plates in precarious positions for optimal smashing. Trying to replicate chaos is an oxymoron but that is the mandate. Everyone knows what’s going to happen but they wait to watch it unfold again anyway. And what could be more <em>Borderlands</em> than that?</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-ditched-ray-tracing-to-focus-on-performance.1285227/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As any PC gamer who played some Battlefield 6 during the recent beta test weekends will have already noticed, there is no trace of ray tracing options whatsoever in the graphics settings. That, alongside the complete absence of any mention from the developers, was already more than telling. However, just to be absolutely certain, <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/battlefield-6-bf6-no-ray-tracing-pc-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Comicbook.com</a> got the chance to ask Christian Buhl, who is the Studio Technical Director at Ripple Effect (formerly known as DICE LA, the team working primarily on the Portal mode). Buhl confirmed that ray tracing was not considered and is probably not making it into the game in the near future, either.</p>



<p><em>No, we are not going to have ray-tracing when the game launches and we don’t have any plans in the near future for it either. That was because we wanted to focus on performance. We wanted to make sure that all of our effort was focused on making the game as optimized as possible for the default settings and the default users. So, we just made the decision relatively early on that we just weren’t going to do ray-tracing and again, it was mostly so that we could focus on making sure it was performance for everyone else.</em></p>



<p>Needless to say, it does feel a bit of a downgrade when you consider that Battlefield V was one of the first PC games to support ray tracing back in 2018, specifically for the reflections. Three years later, the ill-fated Battlefield 2042 offered ray traced ambient occlusion. However, Buhl is definitely right that a competitive multiplayer shooter should focus first and foremost on performance.</p>



<p>Players have clearly appreciated that, turning the Battlefield 6 beta into the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-most-players-in-beta-in-series-history/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largest ever registered for this franchise</a>. GeForce users can <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-is-in-battlefield-6-lost-soul-aside-eve-online-will-be-added-in-sword-of-justice-wuthering-waves-starship-troopers-extermination/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">further accelerate performance</a> with NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation. AMD users can enable FSR 3 with FSR Frame Generation, and Intel users can select Intel XeSS with XeSS Frame Generation.</p>



<p>The full game will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on October 10.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In June, Roborock released a line of affordable robot vacuums after the unveiling of ultra-premium models (Saros line) during CES. Luckily, some of these models are already on sale, <strong>like the Roborock QV 35A</strong>, which is now <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3822/">listed on the official Roborock website for just $399 instead of $599, which is a nice 40% off for the 11th anniversary of the brand</a>. Even though it is in the budget category, this robot vacuum is still one of the most feature-packed models on the market.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3822/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Roborock.com</a></p>

<h2>Multifunctional Dock</h2>
<p>The QV 35A begins with a bang with an<strong> incredible 8000 Pa HyperForce suction</strong> which is way more than enough to effortlessly remove dust, dirt, and pet hair from carpets and hard floors. Of particular note here is the <strong>zero-tangle arc side brush</strong> that is designed to pick up debris without hair becoming tangled and caught. If you have pets shedding or long hair around, this spares a great deal of annoyance from frequent maintenance.</p>
<p>Its <strong>all-in-one multifunctional station</strong> is a game changer here: Not only is it the charging dock, but it also cleans the mop with cold air drying, auto-empties the dust, and refills the water tank so that the robot is always ready to go without much fuss from you.</p>
<p>The QV 35A also features<strong> twin rotating mops and automatically raises the mop when it encounters carpet</strong>&nbsp;so it’s capable of both vacuuming and mopping at the same time. With this kind of electronic mopping system, you have control over water flow and deep cleaning according to different surfaces so that your floors get the treatment they need without damage or leftover moisture.</p>



<p>Thanks to PreciSense LiDAR navigation, <strong>this model creates a map of your home with incredible precision</strong>. It creates 3D maps and uses intelligent planning to determine the most efficient cleaning route. The robot avoids obstacles on its own thanks to reactive tech, easily working around furniture and other domestic items without stopping.</p>
<p>With the 11th anniversary sale cutting nearly 40% off the cost, it’s the best time to acquire a premium robot vacuum.</p>

<p>While "enacted" doesn't necessarily mean all 23,000 accounts were banned outright, Blizzard says that brings the overall total of banned accounts to over 1m players.</p>

<p>"The new Mouse and Keyboard support will impact how we action users who previously used unapproved third-party peripherals to gain an advantage over players in the Controller Pool," Blizzard explained in a new <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24223576/">blog</a> post. "Bypassing the set restrictions in that pool with unapproved peripherals will be considered cheating and actions will be taken on your account.</p><p>"Previously, we deployed technology to help find and detect players who were using those peripherals on consoles. We enacted over 23,000 actions against players since that deployment. This included players who were directly using unapproved peripherals as well as players who grouped up with them to benefit from that unfair advantage."</p>
<p>Blizzard then admitted that it had to "adapt to new workarounds" but was now ready to "take more aggressive actions against those who try to circumvent the competitive integrity of our console players."</p>
<p>"We’ve rolled out new tech for Season 18 that should help us spot players that use unapproved peripherals faster and with more reliability," the post added. "We’re also laying down harsher consequences on users of unapproved peripherals, since the legitimate opportunity to compete using Mouse and Keyboard on an even playing field is now available, regardless of whether you own a PC or console."</p>
<p>Previously, the team would "warn and restrict" any offenders and send them to the PC Pool, especially for cheats playing at Competitive levels above Diamond.</p>
<p>Now, however, "continuing to use unapproved peripherals and devices in the Controller Pool will result in a full game account ban regardless of the player’s rank or mode".</p>
<p>The recent action has resulted in over one million accounts being banned from playing Overwatch 2. This includes players who used aimbots, wallhacks, and other cheats, as well as those who grouped up with known cheaters.</p>
<p>"While the effort to stop cheaters and the cheats they use is an ongoing effort, we want to reiterate our commitment to ensuring the outcome of every <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> match is determined by skill and passion, and not through unfair advantages," Blizzard added.</p>
<p>Aside from the Stadium update, Overwatch 2 Season 18 introduced significant changes, including heroes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wuyang-revealed-as-new-hero-in-overwatch-2">Wuyang</a>, Pharah, Winston, and Brigitte, plus the Route 66 and London maps, new game modes, new All-Star rewards, Endorsements, and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> is <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ports-cyberpunk-2077-ps4-ps5-xbox-dlss-outlaws-1851782817">coming to Switch 2</a> in just a few days. It’s Ubisoft’s first big port for Nintendo’s new handheld hybrid. So why isn’t the company talking more about its 2024 blockbuster coming to the best-selling console of 2025? Maybe because it’s the latest Switch 2 port to reportedly run less than great.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-review-size-how-big-hours-xbox-ps5-pc-1851631123"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a>, a stealth adventure about gangsters and bounty hunters on the fringes of the Galactic Empire, is currently the 10th best-selling game on the Switch 2 eShop thanks to digital pre-orders, but you won’t find it anywhere on the show floor at PAX West this weekend. Despite stations for fans to try big ports like <em>Elden Ring</em> and <em>Borderlands 4</em> on Nintendo’s new hardware, a demo of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> was only playable behind closed doors, according to YouTube channel <em>GVG</em>‘s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5JbnfU0SVs">new hands-on video</a>.</p> <p>Even worse, the outlet was prohibited from sharing any direct capture footage of <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> running on Switch 2. Over-the-shoulder recording wasn’t allowed either. The demo <em>GVG</em> tested included an early section inside of a Star Destroyer and a ship fight in space. The frame rate often appeared to dip below 30fps while the visual quality varied from good to unimpressive depending on the scene. And <em>GVG</em> didn’t even get to try any of the open-world sections down on planets.</p>

 <p>There have been some potential red flags around<em> Star Wars Outlaws</em>‘ performance on Switch 2 for a while now. At a Partner Nintendo Direct earlier this summer, Ubisoft only <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GIBt_Qnf1_M">showcased the game for two minutes</a>, and most of that was developers (Ubisoft Red Lynx is doing the port) talking into the camera rather than direct feed of gameplay. What little snippets the publisher did share didn’t look outstanding either. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCYL2f49jyQ"><em>Digital Foundry</em> pointed</a> to some impressive lighting effects at the time, but was left mostly with concerns about just how downgraded it would be from the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S versions.</p> <h2>How will <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> run on Switch 2?</h2> <p>While not officially confirmed, <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-port-release-date-1851786749">reading between the lines</a> of recent Ubisoft earnings calls leaves the strong impression that <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> isn’t the only current-gen exclusive the company is planning to port to Switch 2. <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> sounds destined to arrive eventually as well. Has Ubisoft been investing more resources in optimizing that port, knowing it’s the bigger franchise, at the cost of quietly leaving<em> Outlaws</em> to flounder a second time (remember,<em> Shadows</em> was originally delayed precisely because of <em>Outlaws</em> launch struggles last year)?</p>

 <p>Right now, there are basically two buckets of third-party Switch 2 ports. One includes <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> and <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, which rarely remind you that you’re playing on weaker hardware than what the games were originally designed for. The other includes stuff like<em> Hitman World of Assassination</em>, which despite being serviceable, often feels like a noticeable downgrade (though things improved <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STjJVzd-FWI">just this week</a> with a capped frame rate option).</p> <p><em>Elden Ring</em>, which reportedly ran like goop when you hit the open-world sections, and now <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> appear to be in that second bucket as well. Bandai Namco tried to prevent people from filming footage of FromSoftware’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-switch-2-framerate-footage-video-gamescom-2000618923">first Switch 2 game at Gamescom 2025</a> as well, though that game at least doesn’t have a release date yet. Unless a day-one patch or series of other upgrades can improve <em>Outlaws</em> on Switch 2, there’s now a question of whether a potential <em>Shadows</em> port will fall into the “meh” column of ports as well.</p>
