			<p>The next big thing could be announced or revealed pretty much any day now, but there’s still a last few jobs to finish while the Nintendo Switch remains Nintendo’s latest and greatest. Among them is putting the final pieces of the puzzle in place for the Donkey Kong series, uniting the whole franchise on one platform. The early port of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/04/nintendo-have-gone-the-extra-mile-for-donkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze-on-switch/">Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</a> was joined in 2020 by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/08/nintendo-switch-online-july-update-donkey-kong-immortal-natsune-wrestling/">the SNES trilogy on Nintendo Switch Online</a>, while the tail end of 2024 saw the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/22/donkey-kong-land-lands-on-nintendo-switch-online/">Game Boy’s Donkey Kong Land trilogy added</a>, and now <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/18/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-returns-to-switch/">Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</a> is putting the penultimate piece of the puzzle in place. Really, the only game left to reunite the whole simian platforming family on Switch is Donkey Kong 64.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2010/12/05/review-donkey-kong-country-returns/">Donkey Kong Country Returns is one of the best platformers of the Wii era</a>. The two Super Mario Galaxy games were exceptional, of course, but we were also a few years on from Nintendo’s return to side-scrollers with New Super Mario Bros. on Nintendo DS, jumping to Wii in 2009. Donkey Kong Country Returns was born out of Retro Studios’ love of Rare’s trilogy, looking to bring the same kind of ethos to a new generation, and it was a huge success.</p>


<p>DK and Diddy wake up one day to find their massive horde of bananas stolen by the Tiki Tak Tribe, the pair of them chase after them through the various distinct areas of Donkey Kong Island, from jungle to beach, from cliff faces to… a whole factory zone? It’s the fairly standard set-up with a clutch of levels within each area and you have to make a path through them (each area having multiple paths and an unlockable route) to a boss that’s been hypnotised and powered up by the Tiki Tak Tribe.</p>


<p>The platforming itself is inherently familiar, as you run and jump from left to right, though it has some DK-specific tweaks. Ground pounding can stun nearby enemies or interact with the world, some enemies need you to roll through them, and there’s a whimsical way that you can stop and blow at dandelion heads and propeller flowers to reveal their secrets.</p>
<p>And there’s tons of secrets. Almost all levels have the letters K-O-N-G to collect, and a bunch of puzzle pieces that are hidden behind scenery or in bonus areas. It will take a good deal of hunting to find them all, the rewards being some extra challenging levels, or things like gallery art, music and other extras.</p>
<p>Grab a DK barrel and Diddy can join in, hopping onto DK’s back to provide you with a second batch of hit points and boost your jumping with a jet pack. Alternatively, Diddy is player 2 in co-op, keeping that jet pack jump separate and having a pop gun in place of DK’s ground pound. This can actually lead to the game being quite a bit more challenging, since you don’t have both players with the expanded movement of Diddy’s jet pack.</p>

<p>Donkey Kong Country Returns is renowned for being a challenging platformer, and that absolutely holds true. Though it’s moderately forgiving by giving you multiple hit points, and there’s usually a couple of checkpoints and lives are plentiful, the mine kart and rocket barrel levels are all insta-kill stages that can become quite frustrating through trial and error.</p>
<p>Everything brought to the game with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/05/17/quick-review-donkey-kong-country-returns-3d/">the Nintendo 3DS port</a> is brought forward to Nintendo Switch, so for the game difficulty you have a choice of “modern” mode with three hearts per ape and “original” mode with two, and you have more flexibility with buying things from Cranky Kong’s shop and equipping them in the inventory. Across both modes, multiple deaths eventually see you offered the help of Super Kong, which will have an AI play through the level for you, though you forego any of the things he collects.</p>

<p>Visually, this looks pretty much like you would expect it to. If you didn’t go back and look at comparisons, you’d happily assume that it’s just the game on Wii running at a higher resolution. The art direction absolutely holds up to this day – the silhouetted levels really stand out as a stylistic treat – though it does feel of its era in some ways and DK definitely isn’t as lusciously hairy as he is in Tropical Freeze. Curiously, catching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=donkey+kong+country+returns+hd+comparison">a few comparison videos,</a> it does seem as though the Switch visuals are a tad more muted, with lighting highlights having a cooler tone to the more golden hues of the original. It’s a cleaner looks to the game, that’s for sure.</p>

						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/donkey-kong-country-returns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donkey Kong Country Returns</a> is set to return yet again. The fourth entry in the Donkey Kong Country series bounded onto Wii in 2010, was revived as Donkey Kong Country Returns 3D on the 3DS in 2013, and now, over a decade later, Nintendo returns to the well with Donkey Kong Country Returns HD for the Switch. You definitely can’t say The Big N hasn't recouped their original investment on this one.</p>
<p>Is Donkey Kong Country Returns HD still a barrel-blasting bash here in 2025? Or has this once-ripe banana gone bad? Grab your red tie, it’s time to go to work on this one...</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/WCCFdonkeykongcountryreturnsHD2.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As with the previous versions of the game, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD opens with the Tiki Tak Tribe (a bunch of sentient tiki masks that replace the series’ previous crocodilian baddies) stealing DK’s banana hoard. Naturally, DK grabs his buddy Diddy and charges off to pound some sense into them. That’s about all you get in terms of story, which shouldn't surprise anyone even passingly familiar with this franchise.</p>
<p>As the title on the box implies, Donkey Kong Country Returns HD updates the original game’s standard-def image, giving everything a sharper, more high-contrast look. Donkey Kong Island looks nice enough in HD, although the game’s visuals don’t quite wow like they did 15 years ago. While some effects and background elements do look slightly “off” in this version, most of the game’s less-attractive moments are simply a case of the higher resolution and brighter lighting highlighting shortcomings in the original assets. At least the game runs at a nice, smooth 60fps most of the time, with the few minor hiccups I noticed being countable on a single hand.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/WCCFdonkeykongcountryreturnsHD3.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>For those coming to Donkey Kong Country Returns for the first time, our fuzzy hero’s abilities are simple, with no real power-ups to speak of aside from occasionally being able to hop on Rambi the rhinoceros. DK can jump, bounce on enemies, roll, pound the ground, and in a quirky addition for this game only, blow on items like flowers and pinwheels. DK feels a bit heavy and unwieldy at first compared to platforming contemporaries like Mario, but you should get used to controlling the big ape fairly quickly. The original game required a bit of Wiimote waggle to use some abilities like the ground pound, but, to the relief of most I suspect, you can now execute all actions with simple button presses. That said, the game’s control scheme still isn't perfect -- ground pound and your roll attack being assigned to the same button can result in accidents where you tumble into oblivion without meaning to.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/WCCFdonkeykongcountryreturnsHD4.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In addition to his own abilities, DK can sometimes free Diddy from a barrel, who will hop on your back, doubling your health and giving you a limited rocket-boost for crossing gaps. Diddy's abilities are a nice level-up to DK's, but partner barrels are often irritatingly limited, and while you don't technically <em>need </em>Diddy to complete any of the game's challenges, some of the tough-as-nails later levels feel pretty insurmountable without his rocket boost. The game also offers same-couch co-op with one player controlling DK and the other Diddy, although the mode doesn't offer any real benefit. In fact, if you and your buddy both die at the same time, as will happen often during more frantic sequences, you'll lose <em>two </em>lives instead of one. Co-op can certainly be fun, but realistically, it's often more trouble than its worth.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/WCCFdonkeykongcountryreturnsHD5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>In terms of level design, Donkey Kong Country Returns was designed to be a continuation of what Rare laid down with the original SNES DKC trilogy, with simple, challenging stage layouts that push the player forward at a steady pace, as well as plenty of precarious jumps, things to swing on, barrel cannons, and yes, those dang mine carts. Everything feels a bit more fluid here due to the game being fully polygonal, replacing the sometimes-stiff pre-rendered visuals of the original DKC games, but not everything always feels as smooth as it could.</p>
<p>In retrospect, developer Retro Studios was clearly still finding their footing a bit here. While there's plenty of variety to be found in DKCR, with individual levels serving up unique challenges like outwitting a giant octopus, running from a horde of bugs, avoiding crushing waves, and more, there are times when the game gets in a bit of a rut, serving up several similar levels in a row. This is particularly egregious once you get to World 4, as Retro, in their infinite wisdom, decided it should exist entirely of minecar and rocket barrel levels. Unlike the next entry in the series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/donkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze</a>, minecart and rocket barrel levels are one-hit kills in DKCR and will eat your lives for lunch, as they really require rote memorization to get through. I feel like World 4 might be a breaking point for some newer players.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/WCCFdonkeykongcountryreturnsHD6.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Donkey Kong Country Return’s difficulty may be something today’s players struggle with in general. This is a <em>hard</em> game, and that's coming from somebody who's played through more than his share of difficult platformers -- including this one back on the Wii! Playing the game again, it serves up a lot of moments where the challenge doesn't feel particularly fair, with deadly hazards you can't reasonably foresee coming and "gotcha" style platform layouts. Tropical Freeze was a lot better about presenting intense, challenging levels that didn't feel unfair.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/WCCFdonkeykongcountryreturnsHD7.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>There are ways to mitigate DKCR’s challenge, like visiting Cranky's Shop to buy extra lives, a temporary expansion to your heart meter, and other helpful items using the Banana Coins you find strewn around levels. You can also take advantage of the Super Kong feature, which will become available once you've died several times on a level. Super Kong will play the level for you, with you being able to take control whenever you like, which is a neat enough trick but not terribly satisfying, particularly when you realize that none of the collectibles grabbed after Super Kong is activated count toward your totals. Players can also choose to play on "Modern Mode" from the beginning of the game, which is essentially a rebranding of the "New Mode" from the 3DS version of the game, which gives you more hearts and some additional items to buy at Cranky's shop.</p>

<p>This slightly tweaked new difficulty option is pretty much all you can expect in terms of new content in Donkey Kong Country Returns HD – aside from that, you just get what was included in the 3DS version. That said, there's no denying there’s a good amount of content here. The main campaign will take you a solid dozen hours to complete, and those looking to track down all those devilish K-O-N-G letters and puzzle pieces and beat all the maddeningly difficult secret levels will take at least twice that long. Still, one can't help but feel like more could have been done here. Donkey Kong Country Returns was a cutting-edge 2D platformer back in 2010, but it's been surpassed by a number of other games since then, with the superior Tropical Freeze being the most obvious point of comparison. With a few tweaks, the game could have been brought closer to modern standards, but as is, this silverback is starting to show its age.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD still delivers its share of scintillating simian escapades, but aside from a visual spit shine, not much has been added to the game to keep it competitive with the many excellent 2D platformers that have hit the scene since 2010, including its own sequel. DK completionists and newbies looking for a surprisingly stiff "Nintendo hard" challenge will be happy with this package, but others might want to wait until the big ape has something truly new to beat his chest about.</p>

			<p>A couple of projects I saw at Gamescom 20024 had their behind-closed-doors previews embargoed until a much later date, and one of them, a dark fantasy game called Project Pantheon, is now being revealed. It's a blend of two highly popular genres: extraction and action RPGs. The latter is very familiar ground for the developer Wolcen Studio, a team known for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cryengine-powered-action-rpg-wolcen-to-release-in-q1-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">namesake game</a> (formerly titled Umbra and crowdfunded via Kickstarter).</p>
<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5 technology and targeting PC (there's already <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3086590/Project_Pantheon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a Steam page</a>), Project Pantheon will soon enter public testing. A Closed Alpha Test is scheduled to take place on January 25-26 and February 1-2 for European and North American players, with servers that support other regions coming up in a few weeks.</p>
<p>At Gamescom, I met with Game Director Andrei Chirculete, who provided me with a thorough overview of the game and also answered several questions. Wolcen Studio currently has around 110 employees between France and Romania and they are working on three projects of various sizes. Project Pantheon is the one closest to release, with a targeted Q4 2025 early access launch window and the plan to employ a seasonal system with a new season coming roughly every four months. Find the transcription of our conversation below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Project Pantheon I Teaser Trailer #1 - The Guiding Hand" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/laLs8orag_E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>What was the original pitch for the game?</strong></p>
<p>When we started working on this project, one of the most important things for us was building it as a live game. We will consider it successful if it's still rather going strong in ten years from now on the market.</p>
<p>All the pillars we have here are in support of that. Right now, we're working hard on the combat side. We want to get good, fluid combat, and then, of course, every feature and mechanic we are putting in the game needs to have replayability because we're working on two fairly difficult genres. In both extraction and action RPGs, difficulty and progression systems are important to keep at the core of the game, and because we have a PvP component, we also need competitive systems. We have very strict anti-cheating stands. Last but not least, one big change for us as a company is that we are going forward with a community-driven development. When we started putting Project Pantheon together, the first thing we asked ourselves was, how do we make an MVP of this, put it in front of the community and start developing the game with that community?</p>
<p><strong>What's the world going to look like in Project Pantheon?</strong></p>
<p>Instead of a classic fantasy setting, the game takes place in a post-apocalyptic universe where all the different mythologies coexist, but all the gods have been mysteriously wiped out. Death is our central character. He's a cosmic entity that kind of picks up the pieces of a broken universe, and he recruits the players as his new Reapers. To get to the bottom of what happened, for one thing, but also helped him manage this situation, let's say. Let's have a look at that in the context of the extraction game. Death will give players a corner of his own universe as a base of operations, and that's the safe space where players can try on different things. They have access to crafting and other functionalities.</p>
<p>Eventually, they can head out from there to different maps in different mythologies, such as Olympus, Valhalla, or something like that. The goal sgenerally will be to follow objectives, kill other players, and go through various PvE encounters (including some bosses), but ultimately, the goal is to survive and extract back into the sanctuary. If the players manage to do that, they get to keep everything they've accumulated along the way; if they don't, they will lose what they've got, excluding the progression. The progression they get to keep, like, the quest progression.</p>
<p>The sanctuary is essentially a collection of buildings that you have to upgrade. Well, first, you have to build them, then operate them, and each one has a very distinct functionality attached. For example, storage space and crafting. There's a playing area that allows the players to test their play style. There are also some passive bonuses, for example, when you respawn after dying, what kind of bonuses. There are even some aesthetic options, such as changing the lighting in your sanctuary. On the loop side, something we're doing differently compared to traditional action RPGs is that we've moved a lot of what the playstyle means from the character to the gear that he is wearing.</p>
<p>You are what you wear. All the abilities, passive and active, come from the gear that the player is equipped with, and this feeds into a system related to the in-game economy, which we think is the secret sauce to extraction games. We believe you can't really have a feeling of anxiety about losing an item or extracting with an item and being super happy about it unless that item actually holds value in the in-game economical model.</p>

<p><strong>Can you talk about the art direction of Project Pantheon?</strong></p>
<p>There are three main important pillars here: post-apocalyptic, grounded fantasy, and mythologies. On the post-apocalyptic side, we're trying to build a fantasy post-apocalypse. Think Valhalla destroyed or Mount Olympus in ruins, not zombies or nuclear fallout or anything like that. On the grounded fantasy side, we are speaking to our roots with our fantasy, and we're trying to really build everything by focusing on the logic of how the world ended up where it is. For each faction, we're looking into how they reached a certain point, and of course, with each mythology, we're looking at the technology level, what they would have access to in terms of armor, weaponry and so on.</p>
<p>On the mythology side of things, we're going to start with Norse and Egyptian for early access and then adding Greek and Aztec throughout the early access. We will add more mythologies post-launch. Each mythology has several maps, about three, each with a unique boss attached to them.&nbsp; Each mythology also brings its own storyline and between fifty and sixty quests. Of course, some new, unique characters are introduced with each one.</p>
<p>There are between five and six factions for mythology, and then we have the items, which in my mind are the most important ones because we introduce about a hundred new items into Project Pantheon with each mythology, bringing more than a hundred abilities for the players to play with.</p>
<p><strong>How important is customization going to be?</strong></p>
<p>A lot. The sanctuary will be fully customizable. The playable character, of course, as well as stuff like armor and weapons.</p>

Of course, some new, unique characters are introduced with each one.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What does monetization look like in the game?</strong></p>
<p>We're building it as a free-to-play live service. First, we want to reach as wide an audience as possible, and more importantly, we want to avoid any kind of pay-to-win mechanics. That's why we're looking at customization options and selling them through traditional means like season passes and starter packs rather than selling any kind of advantage in the game.</p>
<p>We're also investigating the subscription model. Take as an example Dota Plus, which gives players access to a bit of analytics about their own gameplay style without actually providing them with any kind of advantage.</p>
<p><strong>Did you do some internal and external playtesting yet?</strong></p>
<p>In terms of market validation, we conducted a couple of external playtests to figure out if we're not crazy and that this game mode actually has some fans. We started out with North America and Europe, and we've done South Korean and a Southeast Asian playtest. In each case, we've had great results, with players engaged with the two in-game loops, albeit in different ways. The Western audience was more focused on the action RPG elements, whereas the Asian audience was more focused on the competitive side of things. That just reflects the different markets.</p>
<p><strong>Where are you when it comes to progress?</strong></p>
<p>We started this in February 2023 by conceptualizing the whole game. We then built a prototype until October 2023 and used that prototype for the market validation I was talking about earlier. Then we began production in April 2024. Now, we intend to have a cadence of at least two Closed Alpha tests every two months until we release the game on early access. The reasoning behind this is because of that pillar of community-driven development. We want to start forming that community.</p>

<p><strong>Is the map randomly generated in any way?</strong></p>
<p>Originally, we tested having the map be randomly generated, and what we discovered was that extraction as a game mode lends itself to player knowledge. As a player, you want to gain knowledge and learn the map so that you can be efficient when you venture into a session. The randomly generated maps simply didn't work very well, so we reverted to doing more traditional maps and then figuring out what elements we could randomize. For example, extraction spots are randomized.</p>
<p>There are some dungeons which sometimes might be there, sometimes might not. So we still have some randomization going on while you're playing Project Pantheon, but yeah, as you're going through it, you're gonna encounter some PvE combat.</p>
<p>Eventually, after going through the monsters, you're going to potentially run into some people. This obviously has a couple of choices. You can choose to stay and fight or just run away. We've seen all sorts of behaviors. The reason we like the extraction loop and why we chose it is because, unlike in the Battle Royale genre, this is a mode in which all the players can be winners. You can have multiple winners. Players could go in and fight it out, if they feel like it, but they don't have to in order to reach their objectives.</p>
<p>We also believe strongly that there's a lot of variety in playstyle with this type of game. You will have players who go in very fast, enter the map, get the job done and get out. You will have others who cherrypick everything. There's no right way to play, we just want to give everyone the tools to play however they prefer. Some players are just going to stand by an extraction point and wait for players to go extract so that they can steal everything that they've got.</p>
<p><strong>Is the amount of active skills finalized yet?</strong></p>
<p>There are six active skills. We've made the weapon more impactful in the build, so your abilities are going to come from the weapon that you're using. You also have a defensive option that comes from your boots, which will either provide you with a shield, a dash, or some other kind of defensive mechanic. We also have a special slot for an artifact item that gives you your ultimate ability. As I said earlier, the gear itself provides you with what you have as a playstyle. The armor also provides you with some passive abilities.</p>
<p><strong>How does the extraction work in Project Pantheon?</strong></p>
<p>You have to find one of these obelisks that spawn dynamically on the map, charge it up for a while, and then hold your ground type of situation.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'An important thing I want to point out is that while doing this in Unreal Engine 5, we knew that UE5 is really power hungry, so we tried to optimize everything and make it as efficient as possible so that we could achieve good performance on low-end graphics cards with 60 frames per second. Right now, we're benchmarking against GeForce GTX 1650 GPUs.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Can you talk about some of the mythologies?</strong></p>
<p>Sure. In the Norse mythology world, we have a Viking village that is inhabited by the unworthy, the unworthy being the souls of people who died dishonorably. More specifically, they didn't die in battle, bringing shame on themselves. We're always trying to bring elements of the world that make it fantastical because these are mythological planes, they are not real life. We also want to explore various myths with each mythology. For example, there are camps home to the berserker faction. These berserkers have gone so far into animal powers that they've almost become the animals they were tapping into.</p>

Right now, we're benchmarking against GeForce GTX 1650 GPUs.</p>
<p><strong>I do hope that you can still enable some eye candy if you have a powerful PC!</strong></p>
<p>Of course, of course, yes, you can go up in graphics with a strong PC.</p>
<p><strong>How many players are going to be in one session of Project Pantheon?</strong></p>
<p>We have smaller maps with six players and some larger ones with sixteen. We've tested with as many as forty players. The real thing here is that we need this community building so that we can properly test the game and see how the number of players influences its dynamics so we can fully make a decision. Right now, these are intended numbers.</p>
<p>We're also going to have social features, like being able to add friends to a party. There is even a proximity chat so that players can maybe negotiate with one another as they're playing. But those will be coming a bit later towards early access.</p>
<p><strong>Is there trading in the game? If so, how does it work?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, there is an in-game auction house like that seen in World of Warcraft. You don't spend real money, just in-game money. You have to extract the goodies, and then you trade from your sanctuary.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We found the extraction genre very intriguing, specifically because it's like a Battle Royale where many players can win. But we also found that a lot of people, ourselves included, wanted to play an extraction game but not a shooter. All the currently available extraction games are shooters.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Well, Project Pantheon certainly looks interesting. I don't believe there is an extraction action RPG yet, and the concept might have potential.</strong></p>
<p>Actually, that's how we started this endeavor, in a way. We found the extraction genre very intriguing, specifically because it's like a Battle Royale where many players can win. But we also found that a lot of people, ourselves included, wanted to play an extraction game but not a shooter. All the currently available extraction games are shooters.</p>
<p><strong>You've previously made the action RPG Wolcen. Is there anything in particular that you took from that game to this one?</strong></p>
<p>For sure the classless part, and some learnings on the technical side. Wolcen was developed with some pretty old tech, which made it unsustainable in the long run. That is why when we built this new project from the ground up, we chose to go with things that we know can scale and work well, both in terms of an engine, backend system, server system, et cetera. The same learnings will apply to a future Wolcen game, but that is coming a little bit later down the line.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you a lot for your time.</strong></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wolcen-devs-project-pantheon-live-service</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wolcen-devs-announce-project-pantheon-and-its-yet-another-live-service-game.1081782/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wolcen-devs-project-pantheon-live-service<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem&nbsp;</em>developer Wolcen Studio has announced&nbsp;<em>Project Pantheon</em>, a game the studio describes as a "first-of-its-kind" experiment set in a world inspired by mythology.</p>

<p>In a press release, Wolcen Studio describes&nbsp;<em>Project Pantheon&nbsp;</em>as an "ExtrAction RPG" offering "intense" hack-and-slash gameplay in an extraction-style framework. Think&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov&nbsp;</em>crossed with&nbsp;<em>Diablo IV&nbsp;</em>and it seems like you'll be most of the way there.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why you'd want to add yet another live service game to your slate in the year of our lord 2025, Wolcen Studio's answer lies with that unique blend of gameplay styles, which director Andrei Chirculete describes as a "fusion of different, exciting gameplays".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wolcen-developer-project-pantheon-combat.jpg?itok=ztnRgCOC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wolcen-developer-project-pantheon-combat.jpg?itok=SXt9d-QP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Project Pantheon&nbsp;</em>is the next game from Wolcen Studio, and yes, it's live service.</figcaption></figure><p>Lest you doubt that this is the direction&nbsp;<em>Project Pantheon&nbsp;</em>is taking, the press release describes the game as a "free-to-play live service game", so this will very much represent a break from the one-and-done payment model of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/wolcen-lords-of-mayhem" rel="nofollow"><em>Wolcen: Lords of Mayhem</em></a>.</p>

<p>Wolcen Studio is promising "dynamic PvPvE combat" across a range of "diverse maps". You'll explore these maps, gather loot, and contend with both enemies and opposing players before attempting to extract with the loot you've gathered.</p>

<p>If you do so successfully, you'll be able to keep what you collected, but failure might result in "losing [your] gear for good". In other words, it's a fairly typical extraction-style gameplay loop, but with a&nbsp;<em>Diablo&nbsp;</em>face.</p>

<p>You'll also have access to a hidden base where you can customize your loadout, experiment with gear, and engage with&nbsp;<em>Project Pantheon</em>'s upgrade systems. The game will feature a "player-driven economy" too; let's hope it pans out better than <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-trading-disabled-another-economy-breaking-bug" rel="nofollow">some other online games' marketplaces</a> have.</p>




<p>If you want to give this one a try, a closed alpha test is being held for European players on the weekend of January 26th, with a North American alpha test coming the following weekend. You can also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3086590/Project_Pantheon/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist it on Steam here</a> if you want to.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/blood-of-dawnwalker-ex-witcher-devs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publiosher Bandai Namco and developer Rebel Wolves have unveiled&nbsp;<em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em>, a narrative-focused dark fantasy action RPG set to arrive on PC and current-gen consoles at some point in the future.</p>

<p>If you feel like you've heard Rebel Wolves' name before, that's probably because it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/witcher-3-game-director-starts-rebel-wolves" rel="nofollow">the studio set up</a> by&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt&nbsp;</em>director&nbsp;Konrad Tomaszkiewicz back in 2022. Back then, the studio said it was working on an action RPG in Unreal Engine 5, and&nbsp;<em>The Blood of Dawnwalker&nbsp;</em>is that very RPG.</p>

<p>Set in an alternate-history 14th-century Europe, the game will revolve around Coen, a man transformed into one of the titular Dawnwalkers. You've got 30 days and nights "to save your family or swear revenge on your sire and destroy everyone standing in your way".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-announcement-landscape.jpg?itok=PvC23Oie 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-announcement-landscape.jpg?itok=GTHsShdT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Blood of Dawnwalker&nbsp;</em>casts you as not-quite-a-vampire Coen.</figcaption></figure><p>Tomaszkiewicz says his game is inspired by "classic RPGs" and that he wants players to "feel the sense of urgency in an open-world game".</p>

<p>According to&nbsp;Tomaszkiewicz,&nbsp;<em>The Blood of Dawnwalker&nbsp;</em>will offer "multiple approaches to saving Coen's family", and there will be "no clear division" between the main story and sidequests. You can, he says, "decide on how you spend the time".</p>

<p>He goes on to say that you won't be able to complete all of&nbsp;<em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em>'s "stories and arcs" before the 30 days and nights have elapsed, so each playthrough will be unique. That sounds like an impressive boast.</p>

<p>You can check out the trailer below if you want to get a sense of what&nbsp;<em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em>'s atmosphere will be like. Technically, there's also a little gameplay footage, although it's real blink-and-you'll-miss-it stuff.</p>




<p><em>The Blood of Dawnwalker&nbsp;</em>is set to launch for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. It doesn't have a release date yet, so stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/donkey-kong-country-returns-is-a-little-easier-on-the-switch-%E2%80%94-but-still-hard-as-hell.1081776/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24343009/donkey-kong-country-returns-hd-review-nintendo-switch<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For a game about collecting bananas and throwing barrels,<em> Donkey Kong Country Returns</em> is surprisingly inventive. The game, which originally launched on the Wii in 2010, takes the classic SNES side-scroller and steadily infuses it with new ideas, creating an experience that’s at times both tense and thrilling. You’ll do everything from fly a rocket through bat-filled caves to avoid the tentacles of a giant squid. It gets <em>intense</em>. It’s also a game that’s known for being very hard. But a new port on the Switch makes it slightly easier to enjoy all of those thrills without getting too frustrated.</p><p>It’s called <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em>, and it’s basically what it says right there in the title: the original game but with cleaned-up graphics. Fundamentally, there isn’t a lot of difference. The premise, which involves an evil mask turning a bunch of animals against Kong, remains the same, as do the levels you’ll explore; though, as a nice bonus, the port does include stages that were previously only available in the 3DS version of the game.</p><p>And just like the 3DS version, the Switch game has two modes to play through. One, called “Original,” is exactly what it sounds like, a straight port of the Wii game. The other is called “Modern Mode.” It doesn’t actually change the difficulty but instead offers a greater selection of helpful boosts, the option to carry nine of those items at once, and an extra heart by default. There’s also a returning feature called the “Super Guide.” If you die a few times, this option will appear, and it lets you watch a playthrough of the level so you can see what you’re doing wrong. It also lets you bypass the level altogether, so you can skip troublesome stages and come back to them later.</p><p>That’s important because, like I said, this game gets <em>hard</em>. There are precarious jumps to navigate, scenes where you have to fire yourself out of a barrel at just the right moment, and multistage boss battles that will test your patience. That hasn’t changed here, but the game gives you more ways to deal with the frustration.&nbsp;</p><p>And it’s worth it because <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns</em> is a delightful game. It may not have the whimsy or playfulness of something like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em></a>, but that doesn’t make it any less creative. While there are standard stages where you hop around, stomping on bad guys, the best parts of <em>Returns</em> have an almost cinematic feel. There are perilous minecart levels that force you to react quickly as the world crumbles around you. There are levels where you’re avoiding destructive forces — like the aforementioned squid or devastating waves — as you inch your way to the goal. It can have the vibe of a high-stakes action movie, only, you know, you’re playing a giant monkey wearing a tie.</p><p>Sure, we’re at the tail end of the Switch’s life, but you could do a lot worse for the end of a console than ports of games like <em>Returns</em> and the upcoming <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/29/24282741/xenoblade-chronicles-x-nintendo-switch-release-date-march-2025"><em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em></a>. The series has a sense of tension and scale that set <em>Donkey Kong Country</em> apart from other side-scrollers, and <em>Returns</em> might be the one that pushes it the furthest. Now, it’s simply a little more approachable — without losing any of its original bite.</p><p><small>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD<em> launches on January 16th on the Nintendo Switch.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to a new leak, players will be able to transform into Godzilla in Fortnite thanks to a new mythic coming this Friday.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/fortnite-godzilla-mythic-giant-transformation-beam-stomp-kong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TheGamer</a>, reliable leaker <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1879121165522026773" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">HYPEX</a> has revealed that Fortnite is receiving a Godzilla transformation mythic this Friday, January 17. The new mythic will allow players to transform into Giant Godzillas and wreak havoc across the islands with their monstrous abilities. When transformed, players can use skills like Beam, Stomp, Roar, and more. Additionally, a “throw banana” ability has been spotted in the files, which is believed to be a Kong mythic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Godzilla descended onto Fortnite Island yesterday, marking the start of the Godzilla X Kong collaboration. We have already seen the Japanese kaiju make an appearance on the island, and it’s just a matter of time before King Kong from Skull Island shows up, too. If the Kong mythic does show up, there will be some interesting Godzilla vs Kong matchups that players can experience this season.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Talking about Fortnite and Godzilla, another <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1879115290157404348" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">leak</a> by HYPEX has revealed that Mechagodzilla has been confirmed for the game, too.

<p>SEGA’s trademarks for “Ecco the Dolphin” and “Ecco” went public today, and players believe this could be the surprise game at the upcoming Xbox Developer Direct.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1i0onuf/sega_has_filled_a_new_trademark_for_ecco_the/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>, a post on X by <a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1878873951344185652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gematsu</a> revealed that on December 27, 2024, SEGA filed trademarks for “Ecco the Dolphin” and “Ecco” in Japan, and this information was made public today. Players believe that this could be the secret game at Xbox Developer Direct as it matches the description of being an iconic Japanese IP with a lot of history.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A few days ago, Xbox <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-developer-direct-announced-for-january-23/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that a Developer Direct is scheduled for January 23, 2025, during which they will reveal more details about South of Midnight, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, DOOM: The Dark Ages, and a secret game. Right after the announcement, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-to-get-a-new-game-from-legendary-japanese-franchise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> claimed that the secret title would be “a new entry in a legendary Japanese IP which has decades of history. ” Players speculate that this IP is none other than Ecco the Dolphin.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Ecco the Dolphin is a video game series created by Ed Annunziata for the Sega Genesis console. In this game, you play the role of a bottlenose dolphin called Ecco, who is searching the vast ocean for his missing pod. The series received several instalments until 2000, including Ecco: The Tides of Time, Ecco Jr., and more. However, the franchise has been dormant since then.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’ll be interesting to see if SEGA’s new trademark is indeed Xbox’s secret title. However, we will have to wait for an official announcement to know for sure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a recent report stated that Sega could be working <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sega-subscription-service-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on a new game subscription service</a>. Also, two Xbox exclusives <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/at-least-two-xbox-exclusives-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">might be coming to Nintendo Switch 2</a>. What are your thoughts on SEGA’s new trademark? Is it Xbox’s secret title?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments below or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<hr><h2>Third Place -&nbsp;Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</h2>



<p>Developer: MachineGames | Release Date: December 9th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Andrew Stretch</p>

<p>There's something so magical about a John Williams score. His style is what made things like the <em>Indiana Jones</em> and<em> Star Wars</em> theme so memorable to this day. I was so excited to hear that theme when loading up <em>Indiana Jones</em>, but what was even more impressive was the way composer Gordy Haab was able to capture that epicness throughout the whole score.</p>

<p>It wasn't just the loud moments, filled with the sounds of horns and strings as Indy ran from traps or fought Nazis, but also the soft chimes of solving a puzzle. The music constantly enhanced the experience while keeping the player grounded in the world as Indiana Jones.</p>

<h2>Second Place - Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</h2>



<p>Developer: Square Enix | Release Date: February 29th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Austin Suther</p>

<p>Within the past few years I started a collection of some of my favorite video game soundtracks. After playing<em> Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>, I knew what my next addition to the collection would be. With dozens upon dozens of tracks, there’s a unique song to accompany almost every occasion in <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>.</p>

<p>The expansive overworld has its own themes outside of combat, and once you initiate combat, a more “amped up” version of that song plays. Mini-games have their own music, characters have their own themes too, and so much more. Quantity does not always equal quality, but in <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>’s case, every song is a banger.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Winner - Metaphor: ReFantazio</h2>



<p>Developer: Atlus | Release Date: October 11th, 2024</p>

<p>Written by Robert Scarpinito</p>

<p>As expected with veteran composer Shoji Meguro, the music in <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> works overtime to claim your attention. The biggest, and most notable, earworm is of course <em>Warriors in Valour</em>, the main battle theme.</p>

<p>Because of the game's structure, you're less likely to get fatigued over it because battles won't happen as often, thanks to the overworld mechanics. But when they do happen? You've got the most energetic monk in your corner, chanting for your victory.</p>

<p>You've surely noticed it if you played the game—it's a triumphant mood shift from a decent battle theme to a rousing cheer toward triumph. To call it "epic" doesn't begin to describe how it gets the blood pumping.</p>

<p>Another song worth shouting out is the final boss theme. Without spoiling anything of course, it masterfully blends themes that you've heard throughout the the long, 80+ hour journey. While taking down the final boss, the music reflects back on every step you've taken to get to there.</p>

<p>When the music tells its own story on top of the main narrative, it absolutely earns your attention--and our praise.</p>
</div><div><p><span><div>
       
    <p>There's no I in TEAM!! We're all on the case, and this is how you know it :)</p>

            <p>Ah <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a>, the game that left the collective consciousness long ago. In her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/starfield-review">review</a>, Alice Bee (RPS in peace) said that it was such a large thing it ultimately felt "small, cold and unlived in". I remember thinking the same. Would I have thought differently if it had copious amounts of gore? No. But would I have had a better time? Probably yes. Well, a former senior artist at Bethesda has revealed in an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebSmOGZnmeM">Kiwi Talkz podcast</a> (cheers <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/starfield-was-originally-going-to-be-much-gorier-former-bethesda-artist-reveals/">VGC</a> for the spot) that they'd originally planned for it to have decapitations but decided against them in the end.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Dennis Mejillones, who worked at Bethesda for almost 12 years - was asked why Starfield didn't end up as bloodthirsty as other games in the back catalogue, like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>. He explained that it had more to do with technical limitations than anything else, specifically "implications with the different suits" and how certain helmets might react to being cut and having the "meat caps for the bottom where the flesh is".</p>
<p>Eventually, Mejillones says, the systems "turned into a big rat's nest of all these things you had to account for". The game's character creator also "evolved quite a bit" during development, which played a big part in the difficulties.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>Mejillones goes on to contrast Starfield's style with that of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout">Fallout</a>, with Fallout full of "tongue-in-cheek humour" like the Bloody Mess perk where folks just "blow up into goo". Starfield "was meant to be more lowkey and realistic", he said.</p><p>"We were inspired a lot by things like The Expanse and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-trek">Star Trek</a>, stuff like that, so I think it just didn’t fit thematically," Mejillones explained. "And on top of that you have the technical overhead cost to get it to work, so we were kind of like ‘it’s probably better not to include it in this game’."</p>
<p>Deep down I know that a gorier Starfield wouldn't have made up for the game being a drag, but man, it would've been a little less of a drag if I could've rended some space lad's head from his shoulders with a space shovel or something. At least the streaks of red would've added a splash of colour to the grey.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Marvel Rivals players are using Invisible Woman to spot bots in their matches.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/marvel-rivals-players-using-invisible-woman-confuse-bots/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>, RivalsAssembled (via barky1616) recently shared an interesting video on <a href="https://x.com/RivalsAssembled/status/1878843645740380395" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> of a player uniquely using Susan Storm’s abilities. As the Invisible Woman, one of her abilities allows the character to turn invisible. Marvel Rivals players are using this ability to confuse the bots and bring them to a standstill.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the video, this Marvel Rivals player uses Invisible Woman’s ability to prop themselves near a staircase, which confuses the bots. The bots are programmed to follow a set trajectory to reach the location, and Invisible Woman’s ability acts like an invisible barrier in their way. A typical player could tell that there’s something off, but as they are bots, they do nothing but stand still until Susan’s ability wears off.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The opponent team consisted of the Hulk, Adam Warlock, Iron Man, Winter Soldier, Peni Parker, and Mantis. Four of the six came to a standstill when Invisible Woman blocked them. Peni Parker and Iron Man were the only heroes who progressed. Once the ability wore off, all four characters started attacking Invisible Woman.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It’s not new to fill lobbies with bots to shorten the wait times for quick matches, and it seems Marvel Rivals has been implementing them, too. However, if players are able to block their paths completely, it won’t take long for them to obliterate these lobbies.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-professor-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5 more heroes, including Professor X</a>, are reportedly coming to Marvel Rivals. Also, the game just hit <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-new-peak-player-count-steam-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new peak player count</a> and has topped the Steam charts.

            <p>In an alternate timeline, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> could have been a much gorier game than the one we actually got.</p>
<p>According to former Bethesda character artist Dennis Mejillones, there were once plans for Starfield to have a much more graphic depiction of violence. That included the evergreen gore-filled death - decapitation.</p>
<p>However, heads would not literally roll in Starfield for a number of reasons. The first was due to technical implications with things such as the different space suits. Speaking on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebSmOGZnmeM">Kiwi Talkz podcast</a>, Mejillones explained that if Bethesda ultimately went down the decapitation route, it would have required the developer to factor in all the suits and how they would react to being severed.</p>

</figure>
<p>"From a technical perspective there's a lot that has to go with it, you know... If you have to cut the helmet in a certain way, and it's got to come off, and you've got to have meat caps for the bottom where the flesh is," Mejillones said when asked about the game's lack of gore.</p><p>Bethesda did have "systems for all of that", he continued, but getting it implemented began to turn into a "big rat's nest of these things" the team had to take into account. He highlighted the helmets' "crazy hoses" as one such consideration.</p>
<p>Mejillones added the character creator in Starfield had evolved from the studio's previous games and now characters' bodies could be more different shapes and sizes, so that was also a factor.</p>

 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer/Bethesda</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Away from technical implications, Mejillones also reasoned Starfield has a very different overall tone compared to other Bethesda games, such as the ever chaotic Fallout. "Fallout is very stylised in this regard. It's meant to be... that's part of the tongue in cheek humour," he said, commenting on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a>'s Bloody Mess perk.</p><p>If you weren't aware, this perk increases the chances of enemies exploding into, well, a bloody mess (see video below). This over-the-top gore and theatrics is part of the fun of Fallout, and something which translated really rather well into Amazon's TV adaptation.</p>

<p>"It's like those old-school animes like Fist of the North Star - they punch each other, and gushes of blood would forever come out. It's just, nobody can hold that much blood but you're like 'oh man, that's cool'. It adds to that style," Mejillones continued, before concluding:</p>
<p>"I think for Starfield it was definitely meant to be more low-fi and realistic. We were inspired a lot by things like The Expanse and Star Trek, stuff like that. So I think [over the top gore] just didn't fit thematically... And on top of that you have the cost, the technical overhead cost to get that to work, so we were kind of like 'it's probably better not to include it in this game'."</p>
<p>So, would you have preferred Starfield to have featured more gore, or do you agree it needed to keep with its more grounded tone?</p>

<p>Away from the base game, last year Bethesda released its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-shattered-space-review">Shattered Space expansion for Starfield</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-shattered-space-warps-bethesdas-final-frontier-into-full-on-horror">introduced a bit of horror to spice things up</a>.</p>
<p>Bethesda's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesdas-todd-howard-confirms-at-least-one-more-starfield-expansion-after-shattered-space">Todd Howard previously confirmed at least one more DLC for the space epic</a> following Shattered Space.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> players have spotted references to the Game Boy games in the background of many cards.</p>
<p>The digital card game launched with unique immersive cards to take players inside the artwork, but it's the more basic cards that have caught the attention of fans.</p>
<p>Over on reddit, user asch_win has used card artwork to spot the exact location of the characters. For instance, the Spearow card has buildings and trees in the background that are likely part of Pokémon Fire Red / Leaf Green's Celadon City, outside of which Spearow can be caught.</p>

		<p>Everyone knows that Nintendo like’s to take their time making games, but even by their standards, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> has been a long time coming. As it’s finally expected to release this year, it’s easily one of our most-anticipated games, not least because of the impending announcement and release of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>…</p>
<p><iframe title="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMAgmdR8jwU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/13/metroid-prime-4-in-development-for-nintendo-switch/">Metroid Prime 4 was first announced back at E3 2017</a> but the project did not progress as well as expected, Nintendo taking the drastic measure of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/01/25/nintendo-reboot-metroid-prime-4-development-with-retro-studios/">restarting the project in 2019</a> with series producer Kensuke Tanabe reuniting with Retro Studios, who had first revitalised the Metroid series in the early 2000s with the original Metroid Prime on GameCube.</p>


<p>After 2019, Nintendo kept very, very quiet about Metroid Prime 4 until they were ready to do <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/18/metroid-prime-4-beyond-gameplay-has-been-revealed-its-coming-out-in-2025/">a whole new game announcement and reveal last June</a>. In the intervening years, there was the popular launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/06/metroid-dread-review-switch/">Metroid Dread</a> in 2022, as well as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/10/metroid-prime-remastered-is-a-perfect-reminder-of-this-gamecube-great/">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> in early 2023 to keep fans of the series engaged.</p>
<p>So, what can we expect from Metroid Prime 4: Beyond? Well, the brief snippets of gameplay in last year’s re-reveal featured the classic Metroid Prime morph ball mode, locking onto enemies during combat, and spooky alien environments with a haunting synth-y soundtrack. Given that it’s now 17 years on from Metroid Prime 3’s release, it’s no surprise that the game looks significantly more expansive than what was possible on the Nintendo Wii, with some much larger environments and more dynamic AI running around and battling. There was a glimpse of returning antagonist and rival bounty hunter Sylux, who comes with Metroids in tow. Samus will have her bounty hunting hands full!</p>

<p>As exciting as Metroid Prime 4 is in its own right, perhaps what’s more intriguing about the game is how it can and will tie in with the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. We’re publishing this Most Wanted on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/14/nintendo-switch-2-reveal-heavily-rumoured-for-thursday/">what is reportedly the eve of the Nintendo Switch 2’s announcement</a>, and given that there’s no release date for Metroid Prime 4 just yet, it’s easy to speculate that this will be a cross-gen release that makes the most of both Switch and Switch 2, taking on the role that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> had for the transition from Wii U to Switch.</p>
<p>That could be a pretty hefty burden to put on Samus Aran’s shoulders – Breath of the Wild had an attach rate of over 100% to the Switch in the early days of that console’s release – but the Switch 2’s launch will be rather different when Nintendo has confirmed backward compatibility. There’s less pressure to be a must-buy exclusive because of that, and there’s as-yet-unconfirmed rumblings of some other more mainstream games, as well.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Here be your first moving-picture look at The Blood of Dawnwalker, the dark fantasy RPG in the works at Rebel Wolves – the studio founded by a bunch of former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> devs. As hinted at a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-3-director-forms-new-studio-with-cdpr-veterans-making-a-dark-fantasy-rpg">couple</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dawnwalker-is-the-revolutionary-dark-fantasy-rpg-from-former-witcher-devs-rebel-wolves">times</a> over previous years, when it was known simply as Dawnwalker, you’ll be playing as a vampire, employing various spooky powers to fight militiamen (and, it seems, at least one giant mechanical spider-thing) amidst a deadly plague outbreak.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, in retrospect, the trailer also has big The Witcher vibes. The stringy orchestral music? The dramatic monologues? The horrible things happening to armoured grunts? This thing’s really playing the Polish fantasy hits.</p>

<p>"You play as Coen, a young man turned into a Dawnwalker, forever treading the line between the world of day and the realm of night", so says the trailer blurb. "Use your skills and combine vampiric strength with human resolve as you take on a quest to save the ones you love. Face your foes – be they human, monster, or the ticking clock itself. But remember – the real evil may bask in the sun's light, and the most loyal of allies could lurk under the cover of night."</p><p>Given that some of the air-quotes "gameplay" glimpsed at the end takes place in daylight, I’m interested to see how that fun-hating bastard The Sun affects your vampiric form. You obviously don’t crumble to ash at the slightest glimmer of UV light, but maybe your smoke-transmogrifying, magically head-exploding powers don’t work outside the night. Which would be a pretty big advantage loss, given that the vamps here have an enviable range of abilities, up to and including curing lethal illnesses by touch. I had a cold for literally all of December so hell, I’d be happy with just that one, let alone all the superhuman fighty stuff.</p>
<p>Rebel Wolves have also said that The Blood of Dawnwalker is the first entry in a "saga", which is an ambitious framing for an infant studio, although if they’re dead set on making a spiritual successor to The Witcher then it probably would need to be a trilogy. No release date yet so it’ll be a while before we can see if this first game lays an appropriate foundation for said saga, though more in-game footage is promised for Summer 2025.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/legend-zelda-wind-waker">The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</a> has today had its soundtrack added to the Nintendo Music app.
</p>
<p>
An impressive 133 tracks are included, lasting 3 hours and 40 minutes from start to finish. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's GameCube classic - later remastered for Wii U - remains one of the most beloved entries in the Zelda series, with some truly iconic themes, such as Dragon Roost Island, The Great Sea and that toe-tapping tune that plays when you're inside the pirate ship (titled "Inside the Pirate Ship").

<p>
If you're out of the loop, the Nintendo Music app is a relatively new extra for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers, available on iPhone or Android devices via the App Store and Google Play.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo Music offers a decent alternative to listening to soundtracks on YouTube or cover versions on Spotify, and allows you to lengthen some tracks to loop for up to an hour. (And yes, you can do this for Beedle's Shop Ship theme.)
</p>
<p>
Alternatively, you can dip into music from specific moments within the game, such as the cue that plays at daybreak each morning while sailing. (The climactic Setting Sail is also a bit of a tearjerker).
</p>
<p>

		<p>The simulator genre is an unusual and ever-evolving array of experiences. Some might task you with specific or bespoke roles that people dream about, like becoming a paramedic or a train driver, while others let you become a car mechanic and dive into the nitty-gritty of how an engine works. Shine Research’s latest, with support from publisher Nacon sees you becoming an architect, with Architect Life: A House Design Simulator giving people the opportunity to build and design incredible homes without the lengthy or expensive university education. Sounds like a pretty good deal, right?</p>
<p><iframe title="Architect Life: A House Design Simulator | Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HXyH9aJs2qA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The official trailer immediately shows off the kind of builds that are going to be possible, aping ultra-modern or Grand Designs-styled properties with clarity. It’s clear that you’re going to be put to work by a range of clients, whose every wish you have to try and turn into a series of workable walls with a roof on top of them. It’s an intriguing set-up, and who knows, maybe you’ll find you have a taste for working in this field. Equally, you might discover that you hate people, but we’ll wait and see how needy these particular clients turn out to be.</p>
<p>It’s all very precise, with each section of the build displaying the kind of measurement details and iconography that you’d expect to see in a blueprint or architectural diagram. Don’t let that put you off though, as it seems as though the building itself looks very intuitive, at least with a keyboard and mouse in tow, though the team have been clear to say that it’s just as easy to control with a controller. Once you’ve built the building itself, you have to dress it as well, channelling your inner interior designer for maximum effect.</p>


<p>There’s two main modes, with a 60-mission campaign – that’s a lot of clients – and a sandbox mode where you can let your imagination run riot without constraints or someone breathing down your neck. Things can still go wrong though, and you have to also become a site manager, ensuring that the build continues on schedule despite inclement weather or supply delays.</p>
<p>Architect Life : A House Design Simulator will be available on PC, PS5, Xbox Series and Nintendo Switch in June 2025.</p>

            <p>
The "spance" of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/annihilate-the-spance">Annihilate The Spance</a> is apparently “an ancient, roiling storm of matter and energy” that harbours both “extreme and inexplicable phenomena” and “unfathomable riches”. I’m happy to discover this explanation, because at first I thought that “spance” was just a litigation-avoiding, supermarket rebrand of “space”. I was bracing to send the good news to developers Skyglow Softworks that, so far, nobody has managed to copyright “space”, though I’m sure somebody’s tried. Maybe, um, God? 
</p>
<p>
It’s a relief to know that God won’t be suing Skyglow Softworks for breach of copyright, because off the back of two demo missions, Annihilate The Spance is worryingly compelling. It’s a mixture of space RTS and autobattler, wherein you construct bases that produce spanceships who autopilot towards the nearest and largest concentration of enemies. According to the developers, it’s inspired by the 2011 Flash game <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/582330">Obliterate Everything</a> by CWWallis (RIP), which I dimly recall playing while I was running a browser game blog for AOL. Anyway, here’s a trailer.

As you’ve hopefully deduced, the rough flow here is that you clip modules for building, resource generation, and turret defence to the outside of your base core. It’s as though you’re growing a pearl from a chunk of asteroid dust. A pearl that proceeds to spawn huge armadas of spanceships. The ships range from zippy, brittle fighter craft through tougher, point-defence escorts to armoured cruisers and heavy beam artillery. You can give them waypoints by circle-painting an area of your base, then dragging out a line, but they’ll do all the warring themselves. You can also decide which shipyards produce what, and synchronise construction outputs to firm up your offensive.
</p><p>
It’s almost reminiscent of crowd control in Humanity, though the better comparison is of course another autobattler, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mechabellum">Mechabellum</a>. Nic will be spitting mad that I’ve played this before Mechabellum, after all his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mechabellum-review">strenuous advocacy</a>. And in fairness to Battlemaster Reuben, Annihilate The Spance doesn’t seem as polished: the controls and presentation are on the functional side, with drag-selection a chore when your base hits a certain size. There’s also a surprising amount of plot involved, with some robustly written, ponderously scrolling mission briefings that may annoy those who just want to see two rolling hillocks of spanceships, sutured together by webs of laser fire.</p>
<p>Still, I had a blast playing the demo last night – there’s a nice rhythm of fussing over construction, then sitting back to watch your cloud of astral locusts softly consume another base. It seems targeted at older players who get back cramp if they have to micromanage too often. The kind of older player who can remember the golden age of Flash. Awww.

The game’s out in early access today, boasting 22 campaign missions, two playable factions, 50 or so warships and 20 base structures. The 1.0 release, slated for end of 2026, will add a third playable faction, the remaining story missions, and a level editor. There’s still <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1706360/Annihilate_The_Spance/">a demo on Steam</a> at the time of writing.

            <p>Two new Sony patents have been spotted that would allow players to aim their DualSense like a gun, and use AI to predict player inputs.</p>
<p>The first of these, spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/sony-dualsense-gun-accessory/">GameRant</a>, was filed in June last year and made public earlier this month. The patent is for a trigger attachment for the DualSense controller to add realism to gunplay.</p>
<p>Players would theoretically hold the controller sideways with one controller arm, using the space between the R1 and R2 shoulder buttons as an aiming sight.</p>

<p>The patent also suggests this could be paired with other hardware or accessories, including a VR headset. Though with PS VR2's Sense controllers I don't know why this would be necessary.</p>
<p>What's more, the controller arms don't seem long enough to me to house player hands and a trigger system, while the weight of the controller would be uneven to hold up for long periods.</p>

<p>The second patent is, perhaps, more interesting as it could be used to reduce lag in online games by using AI to predict player inputs ahead of time (thanks <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/sony-patents-latency-predicting-inputs/">tech4gamers</a>).</p>
<p>The patent involves using a camera to view the player and controller, record actions, and let AI predict what inputs will be pressed next. Another option would be to use incomplete controller actions instead, allowing AI to guess players' intentions.</p>
<p>Essentially this would help to reduce latency - the delay between player input and in-game action - which can be a major issue during online games.</p>

<p>Other recent patents spotted by tech4gamers include using AI accounts to impersonate players and catch cheaters, and providing real-time in-game location information to assist frustrated players - as well as detecting erratic button mashing and verbal outbursts.</p>
<p>Of course, these patents don't mean these ideas will necessarily come to fruition, but it's always interesting to see what companies may be working on.</p>
<p>Previous Sony patents include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-latest-patent-suggests-its-developing-a-dualsense-controller-that-can-provide-gameplay-hints">predictive AI assistance features</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-patents-ability-for-games-to-adjust-difficulty-levels-on-the-fly">adaptive difficulty</a>, or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-patents-game-replay-from-trigger-points-over-streaming">allowing players to replay a game from specific trigger points</a>. Many patents appear to be addressing accessibility issues.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
