              <p>Will gen AI be part of <em>Stellar Blade 2</em>‘s development? It doesn’t sound entirely outside the realm of possibility after recent comments from developer Shift Up’s CEO. The South Korean game studio is currently working on a sequel to the <a href="https://kotaku.com/stellar-blade-game-review-ps5-bayonetta-nier-dmc-sekiro-1851432247">2024 sci-fi action game</a> and its boss thinks AI is the only way to compete with the massive development teams coming out of China.</p> <p>“We devote around 150 people to a single game, but China puts in between 1,000 to 2,000,” Hyung-tae Kim, who also served as director on&nbsp;<em>Stellar Blade</em>, said during a recent conference briefing according <a href="https://www.gamemeca.com/view.php?gid=1770030">to<em> GameMeca</em></a> (translated <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/stellar-blade-director-says-using-ai-will-be-essential-for-competing-with-overwhelming-manpower-of-china-and-us-developers/">v</a><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/stellar-blade-director-says-using-ai-will-be-essential-for-competing-with-overwhelming-manpower-of-china-and-us-developers/">ia <em>Automaton</em></a>). “We lack the capacity to compete, both in terms of quality and volume of content.”</p>

 <p>The remarks were part of the Shift Up CEO’s address during the “2026 Economic Growth Strategy” conference held on January 9. South Korea’s president, Lee Jae Myung, was in attendance. Kim went on to suggest that generative AI and LLM tools will be important for evening out the playing field.</p>

 <p>He argued that with AI, “one person can perform the work of 100 people.” Will this lead to mass layoffs? Not according to the Shift Up CEO. That’s because global competition will require countries to still utilize every possible worker. Sounds fun!</p>

 <p>Was Kim actually worried about rising competition from China, or was he just flexing his geopolitical muscle as <em>Stellar Blade</em>‘s popularity catapults Shift Up into the big time? After all, that game sold millions of copies across <a href="https://kotaku.com/stellar-blade-pc-steam-release-date-soulslike-scifi-ps5-1851696612">console and PC</a> without the help of AI, even as Tencent, Net Ease, and other major Chinese publishers flood the market with AAA free-to-play games.</p>

 <p>For now at least, Shift Up employees are being well taken care of. <em>Seoul Economic Daily</em> <a href="https://www.sedaily.com/NewsView/2K773GI6BZ">recently reported</a> that all 300 employees at the studio were given AirPods Max, Apple Watches, and a bonus $3,400 to celebrate the company’s profitable 2025. Why no video game consoles? It already gifted PS5 Pros and Switch 2s <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/shift-up-ceo-gifted-all-his-employees-nintendo-switch-2-to-celebrate-stellar-blade-3-millions-sale.1685455/">last year</a>.</p>

 <p>Shift Up is currently aiming to release <em>Stellar Blade 2</em> <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/20/stellar-blade-developer-plans-to-release-a-sequel-before-2027">before the end of 2027</a>. Hopefully it’s not relying on gen AI to do it.</p>

<p>The first handful of games coming to the PlayStation Plus Game Catalog in January 2026 have been leaked ahead of the official reveal.</p>



<p>Known leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-extra-premium-on-connait-les-titres-majeurs-de-janvier-2026-60850" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Billbil-kun</a> has revealed the first six games that will be announced. </p>







<p>For PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium subscribers, five of the games being added this month are Resident Evil Village (PS5 | PS4), Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth (PS5 | PS4), Expeditions: A MudRunner Game (PS5 | PS4), A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead (PS5 | PS4), and art of rally (PS5 | PS4). </p>

<p>All of the games, per the report, will be available starting January 20. </p>







<p>While those six games are likely based on Billbil-kun’s track record, it should be taken with a grain of salt until the official announcement.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/roundup/marvel-rivals-everything-we-know-about-neteases-super-hero-charged-shooter/</link>
            <guid>1405186</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="overview">
			
<p><strong>Marvel Rivals</strong> arrived on the shooter scene right at the end of 2024, and it arrived with such a bang, it made it seem like all Blizzard actually needed to do with Overwatch was make all the characters Marvel heroes. The third-person shooter expanded on the momentum built by its massive launch and has definitively wedged itself into the shooter genre and earned a spot among the other live-service free-to-play shooters.</p>



<p>As NetEase is charging up to make Marvel Rivals <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-producer-calls-2025-a-warm-up-wants-to-make-it-the-biggest-game-possible/">"<em>the biggest game possible</em>,"</a> here's everything we know about the MOBA shooter stuffed with Marvel characters.</p>



<h2 id="h-release-date-platforms-pricing">Release Date, Platforms, Pricing</h2>



<p>Marvel Rivals initially arrived on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S on December 6, 2024. On September 12, 2025, a version of the game was released for PlayStation 4. It has always been a free-to-play title with in-game microtransactions for cosmetic items and battle passes.</p>



<p>Premium transactions in Marvel Rivals are made with Lattice, which is one of several in-game currencies players can collect in the game, and the only one that can be purchased with real-world money. Untis, Chrono Tokens, Costume Coins, Unstable Molecules, and limited-time event-based currencies make up the rest of the in-game currencies you can collect.</p>



<p>Lattice, however, is the currency that you need to concern yourself with since it is the one used to buy battle passes and the only one you can buy with real-world money.</p>



<p>The price of Lattice, like other premium currencies in free-to-play games, can fluctuate with sales and sometimes price increases, but the current cost for the different amounts you can purchase is:</p>



<ul>
<li>100 Lattice = $0.99 USD</li>



<li>500 Lattice = $4.99 USD</li>



<li>1000 Lattice = $9.99 USD</li>



<li>2180 Lattice = $19.99 USD</li>



<li>5680 Lattice = $49.99 USD</li>



<li>11,680 Lattice = $99.99 USD</li>
</ul>



<p>The cost of the battle pass is 990 Lattice, making the battle pass just under $10 USD and leaving you with only 10 Lattice if you purchase the 1000 Lattice option. Just enough to get the battle pass, but nowhere near what you'd need to get something else. </p>



<h2 id="h-genre-setting-and-story-premise">Genre, Setting, and Story Premise</h2>



<p>Marvel Rivals is a third-person, free-to-play hero-shooter set within the Marvel universe, featuring Marvel characters from every corner of the comic books, though unsurprisingly leading with some of the most popular ones in today's age due to the popularity of the numerous Marvel movies that have been made in the past two decades.</p>



<p>The story, as you might have been able to guess considering the game includes Marvel characters from across space and time, is a <strong>multiverse-based</strong> story, which begins with two versions of <strong>Doctor Doom</strong>, one from the future and one from the present. Both Doom's separately worked on combining magic and science in order to gain control of the multiverse, and when the present-day Doom tries to execute his work, he ends up running into future Doctor Doom from 2099.</p>



<p>The fight that ensues between them causes chaos and leaves the multiverse in a fragile state, threatening to destroy everything until <strong>Galacta</strong>, the daughter of Galactus, contains the problem within a few mixed-up and muddied timelines. With several Marvel heroes and villains now seemingly stuck in the middle of both Doom's fighting, they all take sides as they agree or disagree on how to move forward. Meanwhile, Galacta keeps the whole thing contained as she gets a steady diet of <strong>Chronovium</strong>, her food of choice, rather than trying to eat planets like her father.</p>



<p>That is essentially the setup for why these characters, whether allies in the comics or not, are all fighting together in this seemingly never-ending bout. Each season adds new elements to the story with new playable characters introduced, and while it feels like a premise that is stretched thin to make the gameplay work, it's realistically not the craziest foundation for a story in Marvel history.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-season-of-marvel-rivals-so-far">Every Season of Marvel Rivals so far</h2>



<p>This section will be continuously updated with the release of new seasons in Marvel Rivals, so the following list is only as complete as it can be at the time of this writing.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Season 0: Dooms' Rise</strong> - December 6, 2024-January 10, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Season 1: Eternal Night Falls</strong> - January 10, 2025-April 11, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Season 2: Hellfire Gala - </strong>April 11, 2025-July 11, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Season 3: The Abyss Awakens</strong> - July 11, 2025-September 12, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Season 4: Heart of the Dragon </strong>- September 12, 2025-November 13, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Season 5: Love is a Battlefield </strong>- November 13, 2025-January 16, 2026</li>



<li><strong>Season 6: Night at the Museum</strong> - January 16, 2026-March 20, 2026</li>
</ul>



<p>When Marvel Rivals first launched, its Season 0 lasted five weeks, with Seasons 1 and 2 then lasting three months. After those initial three seasons, NetEase Games established a new seasonal structure, with every season lasting two months, with a major update in the middle of each, dividing seasons into halves. Each half of a season adds a new character and a map to the roster, while the battle pass for each season runs for the entire two months.</p>



<p>New cosmetics, game modes, limited-time modes, and balance changes vary from season to season with how they are introduced.</p>



<h2 id="h-gameplay">Gameplay</h2>



<p>Marvel Rivals is, at its core, a third-person shooter. Players are divided into two teams, with six players on each side. You can choose between a Quick Match or a Competitive Match to begin, with Quick Match including four game modes and Competitive featuring three.</p>



<p>Quick Match includes Domination, Convoy, Convergence, and Resource Rumble, while Competitive features Domination, Convoy, and Convergence. There's also Arcade Modes, which include Conquest, Doom Match, Conquest (Annihilation), Free Fight, Clone Rumble, and Giant-Size Brain Blast. There's also a Practice mode where you can practice against computer-controlled enemies. </p>



<p>Beyond the various game modes, which change up the rules of engagement, the other layers of gameplay come from the heroes you can choose to play as. Heroes are categorized as Duelists, Vanguards, and Strategists. Vanguards are the frontline heroes that you want charging into the fight, while Duelists are your more specialized characters that can take down enemies quickly and deal huge amounts of damage.</p>



<p>Strategists are your support heroes, who help round out the full team to ensure you're approaching each game mode with a winning mixture.</p>



<h2 id="h-hero-roster">Hero Roster</h2>



<p>The following list is the current roster of heroes, and with new heroes getting added with each season, this list will only ever be as accurate as possible at the time of publishing. Just like the Seasons list, we'll update this list as new heroes are added.</p>



<ul>
<li>Adam Warlock - Strategist</li>



<li>Angela - Vanguard</li>



<li>Black Panther - Duelist</li>



<li>Black Widow - Duelist</li>



<li>Blade - Duelist</li>



<li>Bruce Banner - Vanguard</li>



<li>Captain America - Vanguard</li>



<li>Cloak &amp; Dagger - Strategist</li>



<li>Daredevil - Duelist</li>



<li>Deadpool - Duelist</li>



<li>Doctor Strange - Vanguard</li>



<li>Emma Frost - Vanguard</li>



<li>Gambit - Strategist</li>



<li>Groot - Vanguard</li>



<li>Hawkeye - Duelist</li>



<li>Hela - Duelist</li>



<li>Human Torch - Duelist</li>



<li>Invisible Woman - Strategist</li>



<li>Iron Fist - Duelist</li>



<li>Iron Man - Duelist</li>



<li>Jeff the Land Shark - Strategist</li>



<li>Loki - Strategist</li>



<li>Luna Snow - Strategist</li>



<li>Magik - Duelist</li>



<li>Magneto - Vanguard</li>



<li>Mantis - Strategist</li>



<li>Mister Fantastic - Duelist</li>



<li>Moon Knight - Duelist</li>



<li>Namor - Duelist</li>



<li>Peni Parker - Vanguard</li>



<li>Phoenix - Duelist</li>



<li>Psylocke - Duelist</li>



<li>Rocket Raccoon - Strategist</li>



<li>Rogue - Vanguard</li>



<li>Scarlet Witch - Duelist</li>



<li>Spider-Man - Duelist</li>



<li>Squirrel Girl - Duelist</li>



<li>Star-Lord - Duelist</li>



<li>Storm - Duelist</li>



<li>The Punisher - Duelist</li>



<li>The Thing - Vanguard</li>



<li>Thor - Vanguard</li>



<li>Ultron - Strategist</li>



<li>Venom - Vanguard</li>



<li>Winter Soldier - Duelist</li>



<li>Wolverine - Duelist</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-tech-and-specs">Tech and Specs</h2>



<p>As a free-to-play shooter with a heavily stylized visual style, Marvel Rivals isn't the kind of game that wants to push your hardware to its limit. It doesn't take too much to run, and if you have the hardware for it, you'll be able to push it as far as possible to maximize your framerate, a key factor for any competitive player.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has announced an AI ban in its workplace. The tabletop studio known for the iconic <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em></a> has stated that none of its staff are to use AI in either content or design, insisting that senior management aren't excited about the technology.</p><h2>Games Workshop's AI Ban Announcement</h2><p>In an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-maker-games-workshop-bans-its-staff-from-using-ai-in-its-content-or-designs-says-none-of-its-senior-managers-are-currently-excited-about-the-tech" rel="nofollow">IGN report</a>, Wesley Yin-Poole uncovered that the Games Workshop AI ban was announced during a UK financial report. Games Workshop's CEO, Kevin Rountree, stated that GW staff are barred from using generative AI to produce anything.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/games-workshop-space-marine-artwork.jpg?itok=pq8MIgj5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="824">

  </picture><p>Rountree qualified this stance by stating that the use of AI is a broad topic on which he is not an expert and that a "few" senior managers are experimenting with the technology.</p><blockquote><p>"We do have a few senior managers that are [experts on AI]: none are that excited about it yet. We have agreed an internal policy to guide us all, which is currently very cautious e.g. we do not allow AI generated content or AI to be used in our design processes or its unauthorised use outside of GW including in any of our competitions. We also have to monitor and protect ourselves from a data compliance, security and governance perspective, the AI or machine learning engines seem to be automatically included on our phones or laptops whether we like it or not.</p><p>“We are allowing those few senior managers to continue to be inquisitive about the technology. We have also agreed we will be maintaining a strong commitment to protect our intellectual property and respect our human creators. In the period reported, we continued to invest in our Warhammer Studio — hiring more creatives in multiple disciplines from concepting and art to writing and sculpting. Talented and passionate individuals that make Warhammer the rich, evocative IP that our hobbyists and we all love.”</p></blockquote><p>This stance is in step with Games Workshop's attitude towards generative AI. They updated the rules and guidelines for their <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/games-workshop-imposes-golden-demon-ai-ban-preventing-its-use-in-miniature-painting" rel="nofollow">Golden Demon</a> miniature painting competition to ban any use of AI in submissions. This announcement just extends that ban from fans and enthusiasts in the Warhammer community to the people making the miniatures and writing the rulebooks.</p><p>The Games Workshop statement also stands in stark contrast to other studios in the gaming space. Larian's own Sven Vincke has been raked over the coals for his statements regarding generative AI in the development of the upcoming game, <em>Divinity</em>. Wizards of the Coast's CEO Chris Cocks spoke about the benefits of AI in tabletop development <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-ceo-chris-cocks-expresses-support-of-ai-in-dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow">in 2024</a>, which was at odds with the company's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-clarifies-stance-on-ai-artwork-in-their-books" rel="nofollow">ban of AI art</a> in <em>D&amp;D</em> books. The list goes on.</p><p>In an environment where generative AI is being forced into every field to justify its existence, it is refreshing to see Games Workshop's stance be so direct.&nbsp;</p></div><div><p><span><div>

                <p>So much time has passed between Fallout games that modern players may believe the lighthearted comedic tone of Fallout 4, Fallout '76, and Prime Video's Fallout series were the way the franchise has always been portrayed. But Chris Avellone--one of the designers of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-2/" data-ref-id="5000-137">Fallout 2</a> and a writer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-new-vegas/" data-ref-id="5000-42960">Fallout: New Vegas</a>--believes that Bethesda has lost sight of the way that the games were originally intended to be received.</p><p>When asked on X whether Bethesda hates the franchise, Avellone responded, "They just don't fully understand its roots and arguably, don't care--they own the franchise, and they just want to do their spin on Fallout and make that the norm. This usually translates into a colorful, shallow theme park (with some interesting DLC exceptions, like Far Harbor, Point Lookout--and I was one of the ones who liked The Pitt)--still, theme parks are fun for some folks, so if people enjoy it, that's fine with me."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/ChrisAvellone/status/2009456971339149774?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2009456971339149774%7Ctwgr%5E99f1ee048f913fdce98a2199dfe0f1e4cd7a6c94%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.windowscentral.com%2Fgaming%2Fzenimax-bethesda%2Flead-fallout-new-vegas-dev-says-bethesda-strayed-away-from-the-rpgs-origins" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">This usually translates into a colorful, shallow theme park (with some interesting DLC exceptions, like Far Harbor, Point Lookout - and I was one of the ones who liked The Pitt) – still, theme parks are fun for some folks, so if people enjoy it, that’s fine with me.</p>  — Chris Avellone (@ChrisAvellone) <a href="https://twitter.com/ChrisAvellone/status/2009456971339149774?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 9, 2026</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Avellone went on to explain that he doesn't hate Bethesda, and he praised the publisher's open-world games before calling out its weaknesses regarding its linear stories and "their inability to understand how to use the Speech skill.

                <p>Hellblade developer Ninja Theory announced Project Mara in 2020, but it may not be going forward--and that might not be a very surprising thing. The game was <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2020/01/22/ninja-theory-announces-project-mara/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">described as</a> an "experimental title that explores new ways of storytelling." Now, reporter Jez Corden has <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/2010993531037302935" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> the game was "only ever a concept" and was not guaranteed to be seen through to release anyway.</p><p>He added: "It could be developed into a game some day, or evolve into something else."</p><p>In 2020, Ninja Theory said Project Mara would be a "real-world and grounded representation of mental terror." The description continued: "Based on real lived experience accounts and in-depth research, our aim is to recreate the horrors of the mind as accurately and realistically as possible."</p><p>Even back then, Ninja Theory referred to the project as "experimental" in multiple instances and said it was aiming to be a "showcase of what could become a new storytelling medium."</p><p>As for what Ninja Theory may be working on, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-in-2026-what-to-expect-from-team-green-this-year-and-beyond" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Corden reported</a> that the developer's next title, which he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/KPhoHILH4Wo?t=2176s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said on the Xbox Two podcast</a> could be Hellblade 3, "will be more combat-involved and interactive" than the first two Hellblade titles. Those games were highly cinematic in nature, which pleased some and bothered others. In any event, Corden reported that Ninja Theory's next game will retain some of the cinematic qualities of those games.</p><p>Microsoft's development teams are said to be working on numerous upcoming projects, including a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-3-and-new-vegas-remakes-wolfenstein-3-new-warcraft-mobile-games-are-rumored/1100-6537247/" data-ref-id="1100-6537247">StarCraft shooter, Wolfenstein 3, remakes of Fallout 3 and New Vegas, and a new Warcraft game.</a></p><p>2026 is the 25th anniversary of Xbox, and Microsoft is planning many celebrations.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-season-6-release-date-deadpool/</link>
            <guid>1405147</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>NetEase Games</strong> is getting set to launch <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-deadpool-joins-roster-season-6-the-game-awards-2025/">Season 6: Night at the Museum</a></strong> of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/marvel-rivals-everything-we-know-about-neteases-super-hero-charged-shooter/">Marvel Rivals</a></strong> this coming <strong>Friday, January 16, 2026</strong>, which includes the introduction of the game's latest duelist, everyone's favourite merc with a mouth, <strong>Deadpool</strong>.</p>



<p>After <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-season-5-adds-rogue-gambit-new-game-mode-new-map-and-more/">Season 5 introduced Rogue and Gambit</a>, Season 6 will start with Deadpool, with Elsa Bloodstone to follow at the halfway point. As NetEase does with every new season, ahead of its launch, the studio has debuted a gameplay trailer showing off the new hero's skills, with today's trailer showcasing Deadpool's lethal arsenal and the various ways in which players can take advantage of his skills.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Deadpool: The Merc with a Mouth | Character Reveal | Marvel Rivals" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6Y1sQPyhz5s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>More than just a Duelist, Deadpool is actually a triple-threat hero. He's a Duelist, a Strategist, and a Vanguard. You can also unlock upgrades for his skills mid-game to make him even more deadly. With all of that built into one character, it's not surprising that in Quick mode games and Competitive mode games, there can only be one Deadpool on either side.</p>



<p>Along with Deadpool entering as the new character for the first half of Season 6, NetEase is introducing a significant update to the Hero Proficiency system. "<em>The cap will be raised for each hero and new rewards added such as Units, Unstable Molecules, Nameplates, Titles, Nameplate Frames, Badges, Dynamic Avatars, and more</em>," writes NetEase in a press release. </p>



<p>Season 6 also introduces a photo mode to Times Square, and Times Square will also be getting a new area called the Clobberin' Club, where you can challenge other players to duels. Then, on January 29, the Museum of Contemplation map will be introduced.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Season 6: Night at the Museum // Dev Vision Vol. 13" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rmU6RtypJ3w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>And as always, there are plenty of bug fixes and balance changes that are coming with the new season, though those will be <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/">revealed in the full patch notes</a>.</p>



<p>This is the season that is kicking off 2026 for NetEase Games and Marvel Rivals, and if NetEase is to be believed, 2026 will be the year that the studio really shows how much it can grow its third-person hero shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-producer-calls-2025-a-warm-up-wants-to-make-it-the-biggest-game-possible/">after calling 2025 a "<em>warm-up</em>."</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Why Is CODE VEIN II a Numbered Sequel in a Different World? Bandai Namco Explains Time Travel and the Rebuilt Partner System]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-interview-time-travel-partner-system/</link>
            <guid>1405123</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>More than six years after <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/code-vein-blood-blood-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the release of the first game</a>, <strong>Bandai Namco Studios</strong> returns with <strong>CODE VEIN II</strong>, the sequel to the Soulslike action RPG that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-shipped-over-3-million-copies-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold over three million copies</a></strong> across all platforms. While not a smashing success, the game undoubtedly garnered a sizable following. However, the developers are still making changes to several aspects in this new iteration; for instance, it is set in a completely different world with new characters. The first CODE VEIN also allowed co-op multiplayer, whereas this new entry focuses on expanding the Partner System that powers AI companions.</p>



<p>Following a recent press event <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-hands-on-preview-kill-the-past/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">where we went hands-on with the game</a> ahead of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-set-january-30-2026-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scheduled <strong>January 30</strong> launch</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, we sent a few questions to Bandai Namco Studios to uncover more details about CODE VEIN II. The answers were provided by CODE VEIN II producer <strong>Keita Iizuka</strong>-san and game director <strong>Hiroshi Yoshimura</strong>-san. As a reminder, <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-vein-ii-character-creator-demo-release-date-bandai-namco/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Character Creator demo will be released on January 23</a>, one week before the full game's debut.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>What were some of the challenges your team faced when it came to overhauling the combat and giving it more impact in CODE VEIN II?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Keita Iizuka:</strong> In the previous game, players opted to play without a partner to focus solely on combat. To give players the option to explore alongside a partner while focusing on enemy encounters, <strong>we’ve introduced a new “Assimilation” mechanic to the partner system in this installment</strong>.</p>



<p>We rebuilt the partner system from scratch to ensure players can choose between the traditional “Summoning” mechanic and the newly added “Assimilation” mechanic, while also incorporating cooperative elements such as the Restorative Offering mechanic.</p>



<p><strong>If Code Vein II is in a separate universe with no connections to the first title, why go with a numbered sequel rather than calling it something different?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hiroshi Yoshimura: </strong>This second installment in the series continues the core concept of CODE VEIN: challenging, exploration-focused action alongside a partner character. By introducing time travel and the idea of intervening in a character's past, we felt that we could powerfully depict the drama of two species—humans and Revenants—living in different timelines.</p>



<p><strong>However, we also considered that if players experience returning to the past and altering it, and then ultimately encounter the continuation point of the previous game, they might feel the urge to intervene in that world as well. We felt that if we allowed this, it would negate the lives of the characters from the previous game, and the stories players experienced themselves.</strong></p>



<p>Considering these points, we ultimately decided to create a new story in a world distinct from the previous one. For these reasons, while this is the second installment in the series, it depicts a story set in a different world.</p>



<p><strong>What was the design philosophy your team had in mind when it came to creating the levels and encounters in CODE VEIN II? Is this intended to be more difficult than the original title?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Keita Iizuka:</strong> We've taken care to prevent unreasonable melee encounters from occurring, allowing players to stay focused on combat. Even when group battles do occur, this game features an enemy group-behavior control system that maintains a satisfying level of challenge while letting players enjoy the back-and-forth combat against enemies.</p>



<p><strong>How much player agency will there be when it comes to the time travel? Can players choose not to change events in the past?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Hiroshi Yoshimura:</strong> Travel between the present and past worlds is relatively unrestricted. Even while progressing the story in the past, you can return to the present world and explore it. <strong>As the story advances, you will encounter several major turning points where you must choose whether to return to the past.</strong> At these points, it is possible to advance the story without intervening in the past more than necessary.</p>



<p><strong>How many routes/endings will there be in CODE VEIN II?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Keita Iizuka:</strong> While we can’t share specific numbers, we can say that <strong>the game includes multiple scenario branches and endings</strong> that reflect the choices and changes players make throughout their journey.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

<p>Two weeks into 2026, and Nintendo has finally released its Year In Review for Switch and Switch 2 players. </p>



<p>To access your Nintendo 2025 Year In Review, simply go to the <a href="https://year-in-review.nintendo.com/en-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recap’s landing page</a> and sign in with your Nintendo Account. From there, you’ll see stats such as the number of games you played, and the amount of time spent on the system.</p>







<p>In addition, you’ll find out the games you played the most, the types of games you favored, and a month-by-month breakdown of how much you played. </p>



<p><strong>“Your Nintendo Switch 2025 Year in Review has arrived,” </strong>Nintendo said on social media. <strong>“Check out not only your 2025 adventures, but memories from past years with your Nintendo Switch as well.”</strong></p>



<p>Nintendo joins other platforms like Steam and PlayStation with their “wrapped” or year in review features. The only one of the major platforms that didn’t release one for 2025 was Xbox. Microsoft skipped this year, reportedly, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbbox-wrapped-not-coming-budget-constraints/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due to budget constraints</a>. </p>



<p>As far as why Nintendo waited so long to release this time around, that hasn’t been mentioned. Past versions came in the weeks leading up to Christmas, making 2025’s the latest one yet. </p>







<p>What did your Nintendo Year In Review reveal about your playtime on the Switch and/or Switch 2? Leave your recap details down in the comments, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

                <p>We're a couple of weeks into 2026, but Nintendo is already looking back at last year, releasing its annual year-in-review wrap-up for 2025. While Nintendo (and most companies and services) traditionally <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-nintendo-switch-year-in-review-for-2024-is-available-now-get-a-free-2025-calendar/1100-6528550/" data-ref-id="1100-6528550">releases these summaries in December</a> of each year, it pushed back its Switch wrap-up to January for reasons unstated.</p><p>While it missed the usual <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-2025-wrap-up-see-how-much-you-played-this-year/1100-6536799/" data-ref-id="1100-6536799">wave of yearly wrap-ups</a>, the plus side is that Nintendo's 2025 summary includes your December play time, so your many hours of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond just might eke out on your list of most-played games.</p><p>The personalized wrap-up sums up how many games you played on Switch and Switch 2 and how many hours you played, showing a month-by-month breakdown and evaluating your favorite game genres. Additionally, you can choose a favorite game you played this year and share a graphic that summarizes the data, and you can download a free 2026 calendar at the end to print out.</p><p>If you want to go further down the rabbit hole, Nintendo's website also pulls Switch data going back to the console's launch in 2017. If you're patient enough to scroll all the way to the bottom, you can download a video that displays this data.</p><p>2025 was an important year for Nintendo, with the Switch 2 launching in June to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-continues-to-be-a-massive-hit-selling-over-10-million-units-in-six-months/1100-6535903/" data-ref-id="1100-6535903">massive sales success</a>. Nintendo-published highlights in the Switch 2's first months on the market included Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, Kirby Air Riders, and Pokemon Legends: Z-A. Indie hits like Hollow Knight: Silksong and Hades 2, along with third-party games previously released on other platforms like Cyberpunk 2077 and Star Wars Outlaws, also graced the Switch 2's early software lineup.</p><p>In the coming year, Switch 2 owners may return to the timesink known as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-is-nintendos-cheapest-paid-upgrade-yet/1100-6537334/" data-ref-id="1100-6537334">Animal Crossing: New Horizons with a cheap upgrade</a>. Other upcoming Nintendo titles include Mario Tennis Fever, The Duskbloods, and Yoshi and the Mysterious Book, with third-party offerings including Resident Evil Requiem and 007 First Light.</p>

                <p>Deadpool is coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/" data-ref-id="5000-624043">Marvel Rivals</a> alongside Season 6 on January 16, and in a first for the hero shooter, he will be able to play any role he chooses--Duelist, Vanguard, or Strategist.</p><p dir="ltr">As explained by Deadpool himself in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmU6RtypJ3w" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marvel Rivals Dev Vision video</a>, he's heard the community's "non-stop complaining online about how the game needs more Vanguards and Strategists," so he decided to do the NetEase development team a favor and just be all three roles.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmU6RtypJ3w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rmU6RtypJ3w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That's far from the only unique part of Deadpool. In another meta move, Deadpool actually earns XP over the course of the match based on how "stylish" his actions are. That XP can then be used to upgrade his abilities via a comic book depending on what role he's playing until he's a self-described "server admin."</p><p dir="ltr">When he's a Duelist, Deadpool uses his dual pistols and katanas to shoot and slice his way through the enemy team. While playing as a Strategist, those same weapons can target friendly teammates to heal them. If he's taking on the role of a frontlining Vanguard, Deadpool can throw out unicorn plushies that deploy shields to protect teammates and block incoming damage.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Y1sQPyhz5s" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6Y1sQPyhz5s" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Judging from his gameplay trailer, Deadpool looks to be a true menace, not only dashing around the battlefield and bashing his foes but also pummeling them with a variety of visual effects, whether it's a chibi Deadpool bonking an opponent with a hammer or a screenful of little Deadpools that make it difficult to tell what's going on. True to his nickname as the Merc with a Mouth, he also never stops talking, which will probably get old before long but is definitely in line with his character.</p><p dir="ltr">Deadpool will launch alongside Season 6 on January 16. In addition to Deadpool, Season 6 will also add a new map set in the Collector's museum and introduce a photo mode. It will also add a dueling arena, bring big changes to hero proficiency rewards, and make a number of major hero and team-up balance changes. Halfway through the season another hero, Elsa Bloodstone, will join the game's roster, keeping true to the team's goal of releasing a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-shortening-seasons-releasing-a-new-hero-every-month/1100-6530612/" data-ref-id="1100-6530612">new hero every month</a>.</p>

This includes a nerf for the akimbo variant of the Velox 5.7 pistol in Warzone, and the Maddox RFB assault rifle now has decreased damage ranges in multiplayer and Zombies.</p><p dir="ltr">For multiplayer and Zombies, the patch notes detail major adjustments for the Maddox RFB assault rifle. This includes a reduction to movement speed, added recoil, and significant decreases to the gun's damage range. The developer says the Maddox RFB has been very strong because of its quick time-to-kill in close quarters, but the controllable recoil let it stretch its effectiveness out to longer ranges than intended.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"We'd like to keep the close-range damage high, as that was core to the weapon's identity in Black Ops 4," Treyarch says. "It has received significant range and recoil nerfs to reduce its versatility."</p><p dir="ltr">Several adjustments are made to the AK-27 assault rifle Battle-Scar conversion to make the weapon more viable to use. The conversion kit previously turned the AK-27 into a slow-firing hybrid between an assault rifle and marksman rifle, but the developer says the conversion made the fire rate too punishing. The new buffs include a reduction to the weapon's fire-rate penalty, removed movement penalties, and fast aim-down-sight speed.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the Season's new Sturmwolf 45 now has increased damage range and less recoil, making the gun more powerful and easier to handle.</p><p dir="ltr">A few adjustments are made to guns in Warzone. Previously, the akimbo variant of the Velox 5.7 pistol was dominating the close-range meta for battle royale in Season 1. The developer has now nerfed with a 50% damage reduction when using the akimbo attachment.</p><p dir="ltr">The AK-27 assault rifle's Battle-Scar conversion also received an adjustment here, but this buff is limited to just removing the movement penalties previously associated with the gun's conversion kit.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/12/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-01-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Black Ops 7</a> and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2026/01/call-of-duty-bo7-warzone-season-01-reloaded-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Warzone</a> can be found below, as shared by Activision.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty's Season 1 Reloaded update released last week, bringing new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fallout-themed-cod-collab-lets-you-wield-power-armor-or-be-a-vault-dweller/2900-7390/">game modes and events</a> themed around the Fallout TV show. Maximus and The Ghoul characters can be unlocked in the current <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-fallout-event-how-to-unlock-all-skins-new-smg-and-rewards/2900-7393/">Fallout event passes</a>.</p><h2>BLACK OPS 7 GLOBAL</h2><h3>Weapon Tuning: MP &amp; ZM</h3><p>Today’s weapon update includes Maddox RFB adjustments, improvements to the Sturmwolf 45 and AK-27 Battle-Scar Conversion based on early feedback, and adjustments to the M15 MOD 0 and Dravec 45. There are several changes to Prestige Attachments as well, which we will continue to make sure are offering a compelling choice for all weapons.</p><h4>General</h4><ul><li>Base Sprint to Sprint Fire Time (used with Gung Ho perk) now matches base Sprint to Fire Time for all weapons.</li></ul><h4>Assault Rifles</h4><h3>Maddox RFB</h3><p>The Maddox RFB has been very strong because of its quick TTK in close quarters and controllable recoil that lets it stretch its effectiveness out to long ranges. We’d like to keep the close-range damage high, as that was core to the weapon’s identity in Black Ops 4. It has received significant range and recoil nerfs to reduce its versatility.</p><p>Additional Maddox RFB Adjustments</p><ul><li>Recoil increased.</li><li>All movement speeds reduced by 0.05m/s.</li></ul><p>Additional 13" MFS Echo-Fire Barrel Adjustments</p><ul><li>Recoil increased.</li></ul><h3>M15 MOD 0</h3><p>The M15 MOD 0 continues to be stronger than we’d like in its versatility, mainly when it comes to the mid-range. The most significant changes here are to the Max Damage Range and the damage in the Mid Damage range, which removes the ability to reduce TTK with a single headshot mixed in. The weapon will continue to be effective at these ranges thanks to its low recoil, but there is a smaller window now where that ease of control also pairs with a better TTK than other ARs.</p><p>Additional M15 MOD 0 Adjustments</p><ul><li>Slide to Fire Time increased from 420ms to 430ms.</li><li>All Hip Spread values increased by 0.1 degrees.</li><li>All movement speeds reduced by 0.05m/s.</li></ul><p>16" Reticulated Barrel Adjustment</p><ul><li>Headshot multiplier improved from 1.55x to 1.6x.</li></ul><h3>AK-27</h3><p>The Battle-Scar Conversion for the AK-27 was designed as a slow-firing, heavy-hitting hybrid between an Assault Rifle and Marksman Rifle. The reliance on headshots for a competitive TTK made it too punishing at its original Fire Rate, and the penalties pushing it towards Marksman Rifle mobility and handling were steep as well. We’ve improved all these attributes to bring it back closer to an Assault Rifle, but still with a uniquely slow Fire Rate that requires good accuracy and rewards headshots.</p><p>AK-27 Battle-Scar Conversion Adjustments</p><ul><li>Fire Rate penalty reduced from 100% to 70%.</li><li>Removed movement penalties.</li><li>Aim Down Sight Time penalty reduced from 60ms to 30ms.</li><li>Sprint To Fire Time penalty reduced from 60ms to 30ms.</li><li>Addressed an issue where the Comb attachments used by the Battle-Scar Conversion could remain on the weapon after removing the Conversion attachment.</li></ul><h3>X9 Maverick</h3><p>14.6" MFS Pulse Load+ Barrel Adjustment</p><ul><li>Damage Range penalty reduced from 25% to 13%.</li><li>Aim Down Sight Time improvement increased from 20ms to 30ms.</li><li>Sprint To Fire Time improvement increased from 15ms to 25ms.</li><li>Movement Speed improvement increased by 0.03m/s.</li></ul><h3>DS20 Mirage</h3><p>Mirage Tandem Launcher Adjustments</p><ul><li>Burst Fire Delay improved from 350ms to 300ms.</li><li>Swap Time to and from Prestige launcher improved from 550ms to 420ms.</li></ul><h4><b>SMGs</b></h4><h3>Sturmwolf 45</h3><p>The Sturmwolf 45 is designed around low recoil and favorable headshot damage compared to the other SMGs. We want it to be a bit more effective than where it’s currently sitting, but wary of making it too versatile by pairing the recoil with range, mobility, or handling improvements. We’re opting to double down on the headshot characteristics across the base weapon, the Damage Barrel, and the Prestige Attachment. The Prestige magazine will also have less recoil than it’s first iteration.</p><p>Additional Sturmwolf 45 Adjustments</p><ul><li>Headshot multiplier increased from 1.2x to 1.26x.</li><li>15" Regnant Barrel</li><li>Headshot multiplier increased from 1.25x to 1.35x.</li><li>Vertical Recoil penalty reduced from 45% to 30%.</li><li>Horizontal Recoil penalty reduced from 20% to 15%.</li></ul><p>MFS Tigris .40 Cal Mag Adjustments</p><p>Additional Sturmwolf 45 + MFS Tigris .40 Cal Mag Adjustments</p><ul><li>Headshot multiplier increased from 1.2x to 1.26x.</li><li>Vertical Recoil penalty reduced from 80% to 65%.</li><li>Horizontal Recoil penalty reduced from 40% to 30%.</li><li>Recoil Deviation penalty reduced from 50% to 35%.</li></ul><h3>Kogot-7</h3><p>This is a minor adjustment, but prevents the Kogot-7 from further reducing its TTK at long range with headshots.</p><h3>Ryden 45K</h3><p>Ryden 45K Adjustment</p><ul><li>Adjusted Gun Kick and View Kick to reduce harshness of recoil pattern.</li></ul><h3>Razor 9mm</h3><p>12" MFS Sidewinder Barrel Adjustments</p><ul><li>Horizontal and Vertical Recoil improvement increased from 10% to 25%.</li><li>Recoil Stabilization improvement increased from 15% to 25%.</li><li>Aim Down Sight Time penalty increased from 15ms to 20ms.</li><li>Sprint to Fire Time penalty increased from 15ms to 20ms.</li></ul><h3>Dravec 45</h3><p>The Dravec 45 is receiving a substantial range reduction across the board. The combination of great range and extremely low recoil continued to make this weapon too versatile, even with slower mobility and handling. We still want to keep the recoil for the same reason we’ve mentioned in the past, which is keeping each weapon in a class feeling unique. By reducing the range, the base Dravec 45 trades away more power for its consistency.</p><h4>Dravec 45 Damage Adjustments</h4><p>Dravec 45 Adjustments</p><ul><li>Aim Down Sight Time increased from 230ms to 235ms.</li></ul><h3>Carbon 57</h3><p>The Carbon 57 is on the low end of SMG usage, so we’re making some sizeable changes. In a lot of ways, the Carbon 57 will now fill the space previously occupied by the Dravec 45 as a mid-to-long range SMG with some Assault Rifle DNA. It has higher recoil, though, which gives us a valuable tuning knob to help keep the weapon in check without losing its core identity (high ammo, mid-rangey, and slower AR hybrid).</p><p>Additional Carbon 57 Adjustments</p><ul><li>Aim Down Sight Time increased from 240ms to 245ms.</li><li>Sprint to Fire Time increased from 170ms to 180ms.</li><li>Tactical Sprint to Fire Time increased from 290ms to 300ms.</li><li>Slide to Fire Time increased from 360ms to 380ms.</li><li>Dive to Fire Time increased from 440ms to 460ms.</li><li>Addressed an issue that caused ironsights to be misaligned in ADS.</li></ul><h3>MPC-25</h3><p>Aside from a slight recoil improvement, we are pre-emptively making some adjustments to a couple of hip spread attachments for the upcoming release of the new ContraBloom Laser. The Prestige barrel also receives some nice range improvements to further counteract the loss of raw TTK.</p><p>MPC-25 Adjustment</p><ul><li>Reduced random deviation in Gun Kick and View Kick.</li></ul><p>Kühn Ported Comp Adjustment</p><ul><li>Sprint Fire Hip Spread improvement reduced from 25% to 15%.</li></ul><p>8.6" MFS Stratus-X Barrel Adjustments</p><p>VAS Tactical Scale Stock Adjustment</p><ul><li>Sprint Fire Hip Spread improvement reduced from 15% to 10%</li></ul><h4>LMGs</h4><h3>Sokol 545</h3><p>Some recoil changes come to the Sokol 545, both to give the weapon a small lift in general and especially help the slower fire mode feel significantly more accurate than the faster one.</p><p>Sokol 545 Adjustments</p><ul><li>Reduced recoil of default fire mode.</li><li>Reduced View Kick strength and deviation experienced later into the recoil pattern of the fast fire mode.</li></ul><h4>Marksman Rifles</h4><h3>M8A1</h3><p>The Prestige Attachment for the M8A1 revolves around Tac Stance, and we have a couple of changes to improve that build path.</p><p>MFS Striker Tactical Stock Adjustments</p><ul><li>Tac Stance Spread improvement increased from 63% to 66%.</li><li>Flinch penalty reduced from 40% to 18%.</li></ul><p>2mw Adaptive Tactical Laser Adjustment</p><ul><li>Tactical Stance Aim Walking Speed improvement increased from 0.4m/s to 0.9m/s.</li></ul><h4>Sniper Rifles</h4><h3>XR-3 Ion</h3><p>XR-3 Ion Adjustments</p><ul><li>Improved shot queuing window to prevent accidental follow-up bursts.</li></ul><h4>Pistols</h4><h3>Velox 5.7</h3><p>The Prestige barrel on the Velox 5.7 is all about close quarters agility and aggressive movement. There was an issue with the Swap Speed improvement that we’ve fixed. We’re also juicing up some of the accuracy and weapon motion improvements, since it goes up against Damage Range in its node (which is especially valuable for pistols).</p><p>4" MFS Celeste Barrel Adjustments</p><ul><li>Now also improves regular Hip Spread by 15%.</li><li>Jumping and Landing stability improvement increased from 40% to 60%.</li><li>Addressed an issue that prevented the Swap Speed benefits from applying.</li></ul><h3>CODA 9</h3><p>The new Adaptive Discharge Mod and the Prestige attachment for the Coda 9 interact in a way that is detrimental to its ADS fire. We always try to design new attachments to be compatible with a weapon’s Prestige attachment and ideally have them synergize, too. In this case, we’ve looked at some options to make these two attachments work together, but due to the implementation we would have to compromise the current design or tuning of one of the two. And since we like how the two currently sit on their own, we’ve decided to just block players from equipping both and accidentally bricking the weapon. If we end up making changes to either of these attachments down the line, we’ll take the opportunity to reevaluate.</p><p>General Adjustments</p><ul><li>The Coda 9 Adaptive Discharge Mod and MFS DeltaCell Bulk Mag can no longer be equipped together.</li></ul><h4>Launchers</h4><h3>A.R.C. M1</h3><p>General Adjustments</p><ul><li>Shots no longer queue during the overheat cooldown, to prevent accidental fire.</li></ul><h4>Special Weapon</h4><h3>NX Ravager</h3><p>General Adjustments</p><ul><li>Addressed an issue that caused the NX Ravager from having a slightly slower velocity and greater arc than intended.</li></ul><h4>Melees</h4><h3>Ballistic Knife</h3><p>Getting swapped off the Ballistic Knife after firing the last blade felt bad. It will now stay in the player’s hand so they can go for a melee attack or retrieve a blade.</p><p>General Adjustments</p><ul><li>The Ballistic Knife will no longer automatically stow itself when it runs out of ammo.</li></ul><h2>MULTIPLAYER</h2><h3>Maps</h3><ul><li><b>Fringe</b><ul><li>Added collision to areas where players could get out of the map.</li></ul></li><li><b>Yakei</b><ul><li>Added collision to an area where players could get out of the map.

The Velox 5.7 Akimbo has also been adjusted, which had been dominating the close-range meta.</p><h3>AK-27</h3><p>Attachment Adjustments</p><ul><li><b>Battle-Scar Conversion</b><ul><li>Removed Movement Penalties</li></ul></li></ul><h3>DS20 MIRAGE</h3><p>Attachment Adjustments</p><ul><li><b>Mirage Tandem Launcher</b><ul><li>Burst Fire Delay improved from 350ms to 300ms.</li><li>Swap Time to and from Prestige launcher improved from 550ms to 420ms.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>X9 MAVERICK</h3><p>Attachment Adjustments</p><ul><li><b>14.6" MFS Pulse Load+ Barrel</b><ul><li>Reduced Range Penalty by 10%</li><li>Sprint to Fire speed improved from 8% to 13%</li><li>Aim Down Sight speed improved from 8% to 12%</li></ul></li></ul><h4>SMG Adjustments</h4><p>WeaponAdjustments</p><h3>CARBON 57</h3><ul><li>Addressed an issue that caused ironsights to be misaligned in ADS.</li></ul><h3>RAZOR 9MM</h3><p>Attachment Adjustments</p><ul><li><b>12" MFS Sidewinder Barrel</b><ul><li>Vertical Recoil benefit improved by 15%</li><li>Horizontal Recoil benefit improved by 15%</li><li>Recoil Stabilization improved by 10%</li><li>Sprint to Fire speed slowed from 9% to 17%</li><li>Aim Down sight speed slowed from 8% to 11%</li></ul></li></ul><h3>RYDEN 45K</h3><ul><li>Adjusted Gun Kick and View Kick to reduce harshness of recoil pattern.</li></ul><h3>M8A1</h3><p>Attachment Adjustments</p><ul><li><b>MFS Striker Tactical Stock</b><ul><li>Tac Stance Spread improvement increased from 63% to 66%</li><li>Flinch penalty reduced from 40% to 18%</li></ul></li><li><b>2mw Adaptive Tactical Laser</b><ul><li>Tactical Stance Aim Walking Speed improvement increased from 0.4m/s to 0.9m/s</li></ul></li></ul><h3>XR-3 ION</h3><ul><li>Improved shot queuing window to prevent accidental follow-up bursts.</li></ul><h3>VELOX 5.7</h3><p>Attachment Adjustments</p><ul><li><b>Akimbo Velox 5.7</b><ul><li>Now has a 50% Damage Reduction</li></ul></li></ul><p>We recognize this may seem like an extreme nerf but the intention of this change is to bring it more in line with what we expect of close range weapons and akimbo attachments.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Ahead of its release in February, Nacon and Cyanide Studio have dropped <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3290690/Styx_Blades_of_Greed/">a demo for Styx: Blades of Greed onto Steam</a>, letting players check out the first hour of the game. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/styx-blades-of-greed">Styx: Blades of Greed</a> is launching across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on 19th February.</p>
<p><iframe title="Styx: Blades of Greed - Pre-Order Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OwliU5XsytQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This is a time-limited demo, which will be pulled from availability at some point, but if you do slink in to check it out on PC and buy the game on that platform, then your save will carry across to the full game.</p>
<p>The demo kicks off from the very start of the game, where you’ll get to experience Styx infiltrating a golem and destroying it from the inside out, and then take on his first real mission to steal a zeppelin right out from under the Inquisition and break through their blockade of The Wall.</p>
<p>This is just a taster of what the full game has to offer, with Styx and his crew visiting three open environments to sneak through, and picking up new tricks, powers and tools to let him explore further and further. There’s things like a grappling hook and glider, there’s new Quartz powers for mind control and time shifting, and a story that weaves together the human Inquisitors, Orcs and Elves in variously nefarious ways.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/15/styx-blades-of-greed-preview-may-the-quartz-be-with-you/">I previewed Styx: Blades of Greed back at Gamescom</a>, and it was this opening section of the game that I had the chance to play back then. After a lenghty hiatus between games, I said,&nbsp;“It’s genuinely great to see Styx: Blades of Greed bringing the mouthy goblin assassin back for a new generation. The previous games had a scrappy upstart kind of charm to them, and that’s continuing through here, with Cyanide getting more ambitious in how they construct the game into a stealthy playground. Styx might never be a truly revolutionary series, but it’s still plenty of fun, and I’m looking forward to the game’s release later this year.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Daedalic Entertainment and developer gameXcite have announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/20/star-trek-voyager-across-the-unknown-lets-you-rewrite-the-worst-90s-star-trek/">Star Trek: Voyager – Across the Unknown</a> will let you re-experience and retell the tale of Star Trek: Voyager on 18th February 2026. Additionally, the game will launch on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> alongside PC, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> and Xbox Series X|S.</p>
<p>Now, try as I might, I couldn’t get a sensible Stardate calculation for that headline – Stardates all started in reference to the 24th century, so trying to figure one out for the 21st century just gives some ludicrous negative number like -296868.49 – but 18th February will line up with Stardate 48315.6, when Voyager is whipped across the Galaxy by the Caretaker.</p>


<p>That’s your starting point in the game, after which you need to navigate the perilous path back to the Alpha Quadrant, encountering the Kazon, the Borg and much more.</p>
<p>You can check this out for yourself with the free demo now available across PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. This is an updated demo compared to last year, which will also come to Switch 2 and PC soon. This updated demo brings an improved UI, better ship controls, refined combat and notifications for when you reach key decision moments.</p>

<p>Somewhat disappointing is the reveal of a Deluxe Edition of the game. This features more missions, more heroes and more technologies that you can tap into from aliens across the Delta content. I don’t know how I feel about gatekeeping that kind of content in this instance.</p>

              <p>Peter Molyneux is a veteran game designer who’s been pushing the boundaries of what players expect from the medium for over 30 years. Peter Molydeux is a Twitter account created back in 2009 to parody the <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-man-who-promised-too-much-1537352493">famous developer’s often absurd-sounding promises</a>. With the real Molyneux’s seemingly final game, <em>Masters of Albion</em>, releasing later this year, the creator of Molydeux says it’s time to hang up the fake persona.</p> <p dir="auto">“Games evolved to the point where the ideas I was parodying were no longer outside the box,” wrote the account’s author, 3D environment artist Adam Capone, in a retirement announcement <a href="https://telegra.ph/The-last-message-01-13">posted on January 13</a>. “I never thought I’d cut ties with this account. But after reading Peter Molyneux recently saying his upcoming game would be his last, it does feel like the right moment. It’s still surreal to remember being invited to a photoshoot with the very person I was spoofing.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">You play a hole, you must move around an environment making certain elements fall into correct targets at the right time.</p> <p>— petermolydeux (@PeterMolydeux) <a href="https://twitter.com/PeterMolydeux/status/154802887241908224?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 5, 2012</a></p></blockquote>  <p dir="auto">In the early 2010s, back when Twitter still felt (mostly) new and fun and wasn’t a factory for <a href="https://kotaku.com/elon-musk-grok-ai-deepfakes-undressed-images-2000658486">AI-powered bots removing women’s clothing</a>, Peter Molydeux was one of the many spoof accounts cropping up in the gaming space, among other well-known ones like <a href="https://x.com/kazhiraiceo">CEO Kaz Hirai</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/porygonnews">Porygon News</a>. The Molydeux account would tweet outrageous video game concepts like, “Online side scrolling co-op 8 player game where each person controls a leg of an octopus. Each leg can attach guns which the player can fire.”</p>

 <p dir="auto">They were funny because of how they played off of Molyneux’s own penchant for expressing grandiose ideas that never quite come together, but they were also very clever in their own right. Each concept had the kernel of something that did actually sound very cool in it, just like the Lionhead Studios cofounder’s ideas. Here’s a great 2012<em> Wired</em> article about the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20130208085301/https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2012/10/ff-peter-molyneux/all/">symbiotic relationship between the two</a>.</p>

  <p dir="auto">For anyone unfamiliar with the <em>Fable</em> designer’s reputation for ambitious overpromises, <i>Project Milo</i><em>&nbsp;</em>is a good example. It was supposed to be a Kinect game for Xbox 360 in which players interacted with a child. Molyneux demonstrated the game at a 2010 TEDGlobal talk where he boasted that his team had managed to “create a real, living being in a computer.” Microsoft, more than a decade away from going all in on AI, was unimpressed and canceled the game. In some ways, <i>Project Milo</i> became the platonic ideal of a Molyneux game: one that lived in the imagination of what might be rather than the disappointment of what actually shipped.</p>

 <p dir="auto">Now back to the fake Twitter account:</p> <blockquote> <p dir="auto">I remember pulling up in a taxi to see him casually smoking outside the studio. He welcomed me in, excitedly showing <em>Curiosity</em> but also sharing excitement about another random small indie game he was playing and giving me his ipad to play it. Then later in a pub he was hinting at his ambition for Curiosity. That enthusiasm for the player experience, regardless if they land or not is at the heart of this industry.</p> <p dir="auto">I think the industry lost something when Molyneux vowed never to speak on stage again. Over time, that kind of unfiltered excitement has been replaced by carefully rehearsed pitches and bullet points. Fewer people go off-cue. Fewer let passion drive the conversation rather than marketing.</p> <p dir="auto">I hope every generation creates its own Molyneuxs. Joseph Fares at Hazelight reminds me [of] an early Molyneux, i.e developers who get carried away talking about their “baby” instead of selling a product. I’ll always be grateful for Molyneux and what he gave to the industry.</p> <p dir="auto">I promise this is 100% not actually Peter Molyneux writing this.</p> </blockquote> <p dir="auto">Capone, who was just laid off as part of Ubisoft’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-halifax-shutdown-unionized-rainbow-six-mobile-2000657752">shuttering of its recently unionized Halifax studio</a>, used Molydeux’s final sign-off to call for game developers to prioritize creative risk-taking over chasing metrics. “As the industry inevitably rebuilds, I’m convinced it’ll be the small, weird games from over-excited enthusiastic designers in control of their games as they continue creating new experiences and nudging us forward, step by (baby?) step,” he wrote.</p>

 <h2 dir="auto"><em>Masters of Albion</em> offers a last shot at redemption</h2> <p dir="auto">Will one of those be Molyneux’s own <em>Masters of Albion</em>? The pitch is an open-world “god game” that borrows elements from across his past work, which includes the early, influential god game <em>Populous</em>. A new trailer for <em>MoA </em>dropped this week and a release date of April 22 was revealed. “<em>Masters of Albion</em> is the culmination of my life’s work, a game that owes so much to titles like <em>Dungeon Keeper</em>, <em>Black &amp; White</em>, and<em> Fable</em>,” the veteran director said in a statement. “It’s a totally unique game that we hope will delight players, a game that brings God Games into the modern gaming landscape and puts the genre firmly back on the map.”</p>

 <p dir="auto">While some take inspiration from Molyneux’s romanticism, others have called him out for what sometimes seem essentially like lies. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/peter-molyneux-interview-godus-reputation-kickstarter">In 2015 he rejected those accusations</a>. Last year he told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/its-about-redemption-peter-molyneux-says-masters-of-albion-will-make-up-for-decades-of-overpromising-on-things/"><em>Edge</em> magazine</a>, “I admit now that I did overpromise on things, and said things that I shouldn’t have said about <em>Curiosity</em>. But I only ever did that because I thought it was the right thing to do at the time.”</p> <p dir="auto">He called <em>Masters of Albion</em> a” redemption title.” One thing helping give players more confidence in this one than they had in his last project, <a href="https://kotaku.com/peter-molyneuxs-next-game-is-a-blockchain-business-sim-1848201920">a blockchain business sim that went nowhere</a>, is who else is on board. <em>LittleBigPlanet</em> director Mark Healey, <em>Black &amp; White 2</em> designer Iain Wright, and other game development veterans are all involved, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/media-molecule-co-founder-and-bullfrog-veterans-on-board-for-peter-molyneuxs-final-god-game-masters-of-albion/">according to <em>VGC</em></a>. Hopefully it’s a good game, or at least a fitting send off for Peter Molydeux.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’re here because you haven’t gotten a verification email for Hytale, you’re not alone in this regard. This is a widespread problem preventing many users from buying the sandbox title.</p>



<p>It’s one problem after another, isn’t it? If it’s not servers, it’s something else. In this case, it’s a pesky verification email not sending as intended. Many aspiring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-controller-support-playstation-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytalers</a> have found themselves unable to even buy the game and start it up, so let’s go through what we know so far.</p>







<h2 id="h-why-am-i-not-getting-hytale-verification-email">Why Am I Not Getting Hytale Verification Email?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Could be a long wait. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The accepted reason for Hytale email verification not working as intended is due to the Hytale servers being overloaded, causing a huge backlog of emails and applications.</strong></p>



<p>If you check the official Hytale Discord Server, Reddit, or search for “Hytale email” on X, you will find you’re most definitely not the only one suffering from this issue.</p>



<p>Quite simply, Hytale is proving to be EXTREMELY popular. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-expects-one-million-players-at-early-access-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale was expecting one million players for the early access launch</a>, and one would suspect that it’s comfortably surpassed this. A wall is being hit, though, as thousands of potential buyers aren’t getting the email verification notice.</p>



<p>It was recommended that all interested parties buy the game and install the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/download-hytale-launcher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale Launcher</a> before the official early access release day on January 13. If you have left it until its debut, you are likely one of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of players, all trying to verify purchases and access the game simultaneously, which is presumably more than the current server capacity can handle.</p>



<p>To be clear, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-server-status-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hytale servers</a> are working on launch day, and the email verification is a separate issue.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-i-get-my-hytale-email-verification">When Will I Get My Hytale Email Verification?</h2>



<p><strong>The fact is, you will receive the email verification notice for Hytale, but it will take time to come through. If it does, and it’s past the time limit cutoff, try again.</strong></p>



<p>The system will catch up, and the developer is likely working on increasing capacity or manually addressing the problem. The team hasn’t officially acknowledged the issue (as of writing), but rest assured that the issue won’t fall on deaf ears. Keep checking for emails, request a new one if you have to, and be patient as it all works itself out.</p>



<p>Conversely, if you’ve found a workaround that guarantees you get the email verification and proceed, let other players and those in the community know through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>, so the message can be shared far and wide.</p>
