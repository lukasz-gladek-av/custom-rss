            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/19/24300863/minecraft-movie-trailer-jack-black-steve<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24235698/minecraft-movie-trailer"><em>A Minecraft Movie</em></a> has a new trailer giving us a taste at the kind of story moviegoers can expect. The trailer predominately features Jack Black as Steve, the silent protagonist players embody in <em>Minecraft</em>. In the trailer, Black’s Steve is way more chatty, giving us his backstory as a child who quite literally yearns for the mines. As an adult, Steve finds a special blue cube that transports him to the <em>Minecraft</em> world where, “anything you can imagine is possible.” </p><p>It should come as no surprise that the movie, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review"><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em></a> before it, is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isekai">isekai</a>. A group of unsuspecting folks including Danielle Brooks, Jason Momoa, Emma Myers, and Sebastian Eugene Hansen are magically transported to the world to find a blocky paradise of Steve’s making. The trailer features another look at the movie versions of popular <em>Minecraft </em>devices like redstone-powered minecarts, crafting tables, and ender pearls. There’s even a reference to the crazy contraptions players can create in the game with an automatic chicken cooker that uses lava as a heating element.</p><p>In conjunction with the trailer’s release, Xbox has published a blog that goes into detail about all the devices seen in the trailer. Check it out <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/19/minecraft-movie-official-trailer-game-features/">here</a>. And you can watch Jack Black and Jason Momoa chew the scenery when <em>A Minecraft Movie</em> releases April 4th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The next iteration of Valve’s Steam Controller appears set to enter mass production. According to a <a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1858925211363553316" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new claim from Valve insider</a> Brad Lynch, Steam Controller 2, codenamed “Ibex” is in deep development.</p>



<p>According to Lynch, Steam Controller 2 is “being tooled for a mass production” in factories and is in a “later [stage] of productization”.</p>



<p>In addition to the production news, Lynch says that the new controller from Valve will have symmetrical sticks and that it’s “not far off from Steam Deck input”.</p>



<h6 id="h-help-insider-gaming-take-our-2024-reader-survey">HELP INSIDER GAMING:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/wvT7oBtvjZLVmrEv9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Take Our 2024 Reader Survey</a></h6>



<p>Aside from from the Steam Controller 2, Lynch touched on a controller codenamed “Roy” for Valve’s “Deckard” VR headset. Not only is that device also heading for mass production, but he says that it will have a directional pad, bumpers, grip buttons, triggers, ABXY buttons, and a system button. That’s lead to speculation that it will be able to work as a stand alone controller away from “Deckard”.</p>



<p>Lynch didn’t give a timeline on when players could expect to see or hear something official about either the Steam Controller 2, “Deckard”, or “Roy”.</p>



<p>Valve also hasn’t commented on the latest rumors or confirmed the existence of any of the devices.  </p>

                <p>Destiny 2 players who were waiting to start their week after the reset might have noticed something different this time around. Alongside Tess' Eververse products--which include a sweet, new Blanka from Street Fighter mask--Guardians can visit Banshee-44 for some really good loot, but you have to have completed at least one dungeon and specific dungeons for certain weapons.</p><p>The Tower's gunsmith is brandishing top-tier weapons with really good roll perks attached to them on the second page of his menu. The Stasis-powered grenade launcher, VS Chill Inhibitor, is available but players need to have completed the Vesper's Host dungeon in order to nab. The same goes for the Indebted Kindness sidearm with the Warlord's Ruin dungeon.</p><p>As for the rest, the <a href="https://x.com/Destiny2Team/status/1858938507571720632" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Destiny 2 Team Twitter</a> account laid out the perks with the weapons available.

Our goal is to get you some perk combinations that were a bit harder to earn due to the RNG perk issue that was fixed in our previous update," the post read.</p><p>Just eyeballing the perk combinations, the build for that Compass Rose is really wild, stacking up the range and stability, especially with Slideshot attached. Same with Hothead and the Clown Cartridge feature, which randomly overfills the weapon from its reserves. </p><p>As of now, there's no end date for when these will be available, but it sounds as if these are different from the usual randomly rotating items Banshee offers each week. </p>

<p>The PlayStation 5 is four years old, and that means its time for rumors for the next-generation PlayStation 6 (PS6) to pick up more steam. According to a new rumor on a Chinese forum from <a href="https://www.chiphell.com/thread-2652187-1-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">known hardware leaker zhangzhonghao</a>, the PS6 will use AMD’s next-gen UDNA GPU architecture within the console.</p>



<p>It’s the same architecture AMD will use in its Radeon 9000 series GPUs starting in 2026. It was also reaffirmed that the console itself will utilize either a Zen4 or Zen5 CPU. The CPU decision, however, remains undecided, per the claim.</p>



<p>Rumors of the PS6 using AMD is nothing new. It was reported in September that the system would stick with AMD over Intel in order to preserve <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-6-will-have-amd-chip-with-backwards-compatibility-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">features such as backward compatibility</a>. Lastly, it was said that Sony’s PlayStation handheld, will also use AMD hardware. </p>

<p>It’s important to keep in mind that none of this has been confirmed by Sony in any capacity as its far too early for the company to begin publicly commenting on its next system. Insider Gaming has also yet to independently verify the legitimacy of the rumor, so, please, take the information with a grain of salt.</p>



<p>As far as when to expect to see the PS6, the latest documents Insider Gaming has seen show a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-ps6-coming-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">back and forth on a potential release</a> year, though 2028 looks likely. There are also claims that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-2-socs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony has two SoCs</a> (Systems on a chip) in development for the next-gen console.</p>

                <p>Starfield has crossed a new player milestone, reaching 15 million players, as developer Bethesda Game Studios also released a new update that includes the next land vehicle, a new quest, fixes, and more.</p><p>Starfield reached 6 million players on launch day--September 7, 2023--becoming the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-already-has-over-6-million-players-making-it-bethesdas-biggest-launch-of-all-time/1100-6517567/" data-ref-id="1100-6517567">biggest launch in Bethesda's history</a>, and a launch no doubt fueled by Game Pass. The game climbed to 13 million players as of December 2023, and has now added at least two million more.</p><p>"We're thrilled that so many of you have embarked on this journey with us, and we appreciate your feedback.

Additionally, all Starfield Creations released through Bethesda's Verified Creators program will now work with achievements.

However, achievements will not retroactively unlock.</p><p>Additionally, the newest land vehicle, the Deimog, is available now for everyone. "Built for speed and endurance, the Deimog features a fully enclosed cabin to keep you protected as you race through rugged landscapes," Bethesda said, noting that it has "exceptional handling."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=urwankF0m64" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/urwankF0m64" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Then, in the spirit of the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday in the US, Starfield has added what's called "The Perfect Recipe." This is a new quest where players meet a person, Harbhajan, who is a gifted mechanic with a passion for cooking. "When you stumble upon a dusty recipe book during your travels, you learn it belongs to Harbhajan--a once-hopeful chef whose ambitions were set aside for a more practical life," Bethesda said. "Returning the recipes ignites a spark, rekindling old dreams of becoming a galaxy-renowned chef. But could it be too late for a second chance?"</p><p>You can see the full patch notes below.

            <p>
A new report detailing the drama behind the three <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a> spiritual successors all simultaneously announced last month has outlined a convoluted web of connections, fallouts, and legal action, suggesting the beloved RPG's legacy remains as messy as ever. 
</p>
<p>
Disco Elysium's original developer ZA/UM was, of course, at legal loggerheads with various former team members for quite some time; but while ZA/UM has said those lawsuits are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-studio-says-lawsuits-from-former-members-have-been-resolved">now resolved</a>, it seems drama has continued to swirl around those involved, even as they move onto other ventures. Those ventures include new projects at Dark Math Games and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-in-development-from-leads-of-cancelled-sequel">Longdue</a>, two UK-based studios comprised of former Disco Elysium developers, who both announced Disco Elysium spiritual successors back in October. It also leads us to Argo Tuulik - one of the original writers on Disco Elysium and a key creative on ZA/UM's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cancelled-standalone-disco-elysium-spin-off-would-have-been-most-hardcore-disco-since-disco">cancelled Disco Elysium spin-off X7</a> - who followed up those announcements by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-former-zaum-devs-have-set-up-another-studio-but-they-are-definitely-not-working-on-a-disco-elysium-sequel">revealing he'd also co-founded a new studio</a>, Summer Eternal, with former ZA/UM developer Dora Klindžić.
</p>
<p>
And now a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-wild-story-behind-disco-elysiums-spiritual-successors-allegations-legal-threats-and-a-usb-stick">report by IGN's Wesley Yin-Poole</a> has delved deeper into the tangle of the three new studios, laying out the financial links between the two UK-based teams (Longdue founder Riaz Moola is also an investor in Dark Math Games), and revealing Tuulik and Klindžić both previously worked at Dark Math - as director and narrative director on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/detective-rpg-in-the-works-from-breakaway-group-of-former-disco-elysium-developers">recently announced XXX Nightshift</a> - <em>and</em> later at Longdue. It's fascinatingly convoluted stuff.

<figcaption>Dark Math Games' XXX Nightshift was unveiled in October.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-QlFNp2WtgE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
IGN reports Tuulik and Klindžić both departed Dark Math this July after the company elected not to renew Tuulik's contract due to "creative differences". Tensions are said to have come to a head after Tuulik claimed Dark Math boss Kaur Kender (who was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-legal-battle-reaches-court-centres-on-alleged-48m-fraud">also previously embroiled in a bitter legal dispute with ZA/UM</a> over the ownership fo the Diso Elysium IP) had shown him - and other staff members - naked photos of his ex-wife. Speaking to IGN, Kender disputed the claim, saying the woman - who was to serve as inspiration for characters in XXX Nightshift - was wearing a bikini in some photos, and was fully clothed in others. Dark Math, meanwhile, told IGN it would "not be commenting on the past".
</p><p>
And it only gets more fractious from there. Tuulik and Klindžić are then said to have moved over to Longdue via parent company CoGrammar, with Tuulik working as a consultant on the studio's still unnamed "psychological RPG". However, the two later resigned, leaving at the end of September, ultimately leading to legal action that saw CoGrammar successfully obtain an injection in England and Wales on the basis of breach of contact - preventing the pair from working on anything at their new studio Summer Eternal until April 2025.
</p>
<p>
Tuulik called the verdict an "absurdity" in a message sent to IGN, while a statement shared by CoGrammar claimed that prior to its legal action, the company had offered to release Tuulik and Klindžić from contractual restrictions - blocking them from working with other studios within six months after their departure - but the duo declined to sign the release contracts.
</p>
<p>
And that's still not the end of it. Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM, in the midst of all this, is said to have filed a legal notice against Tuulik, alleging breach of contract, breach of confidentiality, and copyright infringement - all related to a USB stick containing a playable, 20-minute build of Disco Elysium follow-up X7 that Tuulik is said to have shown Longdue and Dark Math employees. But it's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-wild-story-behind-disco-elysiums-spiritual-successors-allegations-legal-threats-and-a-usb-stick">worth reading IGN's full report</a> for the details on that particular thread.
</p>
<p>
It is, in other words, all a bit of a mess. And that's without factoring in what Disco Elysium lead writer Robert Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov - who were both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/report-details-allegations-of-toxic-behaviour-ip-theft-at-disco-elysium-developer">fired from ZA/UM in 2022 amid allegations of mismanagement and misconduct</a> - will do next. The pair have set up their own studio, Red Info, to make a game with the backing of Chinese company NetEase. The race is on, then, to see which Disco Elysium spiritual successor gets out the door first.

The show alternates between that grim reality and the future lives of some of those girls, 25 years later, as they struggle to reconcile what happened in the wilderness and how it continues to haunt them. With an incredible cast including Melanie Lynskey,  Christina Ricci, Tawny Cypress, Lauren Ambrose, Sophie Nélisse, Jasmin Savoy Brown, and Sophie Thatcher, the show was a breakout hit when it debuted in late 2021.</p><p>Season two was a bit disappointing, primarily because the two timelines weren’t always aligned in severity. While the teen timeline depicted harrowing events like a stillborn birth, the first death in their group, and their only shelter burning to the ground, the adult timeline leaned too heavily on a demented cult led by adult Lottie (Simone Kessell) and adult Shauna (Melanie Lynskey) dodging an investigation into her first-season murder of her extramarital fling—an arc that predictably goes nowhere. The show is at its best when all the main characters are confronting their issues together, but the second season spent far too long reuniting the adult timeline’s “gang.”</p><p>By the looks of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/yellowjackets-season-3-first-look-awards-insider?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=dhtwitter&amp;utm_content=null&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/story/yellowjackets-season-3-first-look-awards-insider?utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=dhtwitter&amp;utm_content=null" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Season 3 promo photos</a></span>, the new season may address this issue. The images depict the adult and teen versions of each main character together—some embracing, others standing as though unaware of one another, and some exchanging glances. Not only does <em>Yellowjackets</em> co-creator Ashley Lyle tell <em>Vanity Fair</em> that these photos hint at character-specific overlaps of timelines in the new season, but she also reveals, “We are going to learn more about what happened in the wilderness that [the adults] are so afraid of coming out.”</p><p>The teaser trailer released today also shows glimpses of the third season’s mayhem. We see what appears to be a few of the teens dressed in animal fur, choking and threatening each other, along with teen Shauna (Sophie Nélisse) once again yelling her heart out into the void. With their cabin being burned down in the middle of winter at the end of the second season, it appears life as  scavengers is turning the girls mad.</p><p>Cuddle up with your valentine this February. We’re going deeper into <em>Yellowjackets </em>mania. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

So let me help you with your upcoming TV purchase by giving you some tips on what to look for in a TV, what’s important, and a recommendation or two if you really don’t want to shop around. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196230" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="217" data-playlist="196230,196143,196447" data-current="196230"><div><p>This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21779.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I promise we’ll get you through this process and by the end you’ll have a new shiny TV to play video games on! Or at the very least, you’ll be more informed about what to look for when you or someone you know goes TV shopping. </p><h2 id="h4138"><a id="1"></a> 3 Must-Have Features</h2><p>In 2024, there will be a lot of features and options included on the box of all modern TVs. UHD this, VRR that, etc. However, not <em>all</em> of them are equally important to gamers. Here are the three big things to make sure your potential new TV has:</p><h4 id="h4139"><a id=""></a><strong>1. A 4K/120hz screen is a must</strong></h4><p>These days, you really should be investing in a 4K/UHD television set. While a 1080p/720p TV set is much, much cheaper in 2024, the price gap is getting smaller and the amount of content designed for 4K is growing rapidly.</p><p>Xbox Series X, PS5, and PS5 Pro all support 4K games and video. Even if you don’t own one of those consoles yet, future devices will all support 4K (or higher) so you’ll want to make sure your TV is future-proof.</p><p>Oh and make sure it’s at least 120HZ so you can play games like <em>Fortnite </em>and <em>Call of Duty</em> at a higher framerate than the standard 60 FPS. This will make your games look silky smooth. It will be hard to go back to 60FPS <em>Fortnite </em>once you play it at 120, trust me.</p><h4 id="h4140"><a id=""></a><strong>2. Plenty of HDMI 2.1 ports</strong></h4><p>Playing games at 4K/120 FPS is very awesome, but to do this you’ll need more than just a new fancy TV. You’ll also need to make sure your TV has HDMI 2.1 slots. And preferably more than just one. </p><p>HDMI 2.o only supports 4K/60FPS, meanwhile HDMI 2.1 will let you play games at 4K resolution at 120 FPS, assuming you have a 2.1 cable, too. (The HDMI cable included in your PS5 or Xbox Series console is 2.1 capable, in case you were wondering.) So make sure your next TV has 2.1 ports.</p><p>You might think all new TVs have tons of HDMI 2.1 ports, but you’d be wrong. Many cheaper sets include just two or three HDMI ports. And sometimes only one HDMI 2.1 slot. Or sometimes none! So make sure you look at the box closely and check online that the TV you are eyeing has the proper amount and type of input you need. </p><p>If you have more than two modern consoles and other devices that plug into a TV, like a Blu-Ray player or PC, a lack of HDMI 2.1 ports will quickly be a problem. </p><h4 id="h4141"><a id=""></a>3. OLED Or Bust</h4><p>Technically, you can still buy some nice LED/LCD TVs. (They are basically the same thing these days, as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/oled-vs-qled&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/oled-vs-qled" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em> explains in this very helpful guide</a></span>.) However, I’d avoid these TVs if you are looking to upgrade your gaming screen. </p><p>LED/LCD screens can’t provide the same high brightness and deep, dark blacks as OLED TVs. Also, if you go too cheap with an LCD/LED TV, you’ll likely get a set that uses edge lighting which will create a halo effect on the outer ridge of your screen. These TVs also have trouble being seen in a bright room and during darker scenes you’ll notice the telltale grey-black in the night sky or in a dark room. OLED, on the other hand, will provide you with pure black night sky and shadows due to the way the pixels can be turned off completely, which provides a much better-looking image. </p><h2 id="h4142"><a id="2"></a>2 Nice-To-Have Features</h2><p>Depending on how much you are willing to spend and what you want out of your new TV, here are two features that might be nice to have. </p><h4 id="h4143"><a id=""></a>1. VRR (Variable Refresh Rate)</h4><p>If the idea of uncapping a game’s framerate or running it at over 30 but under 60 doesn’t sound appealing to you or confusing, you might not need VRR. If you play games and never notice framerate hiccups or screen tearing, then also, you probably don’t need VRR. </p><p>But if you do care about how smooth your image is and you do like to tinker with visual settings on console or PC games, then VRR is worth looking for in your next TV. The tech basically allows your TV’s display rate to change on the fly to match your content, providing a smoother image. It’s not a miracle worker and really poorly optimized games that drop frames all the time and bounce around from 20 FPS to 50 FPS won’t be smoothed over by VRR, but for many console games that just dip down from 60 FPS to 5oish FPS, this tech will make it harder to spot the drops. </p><h4 id="h4144"><a id=""></a>2. A Nice TV Operating System</h4><p>If you plan to only use your TV for gaming, then you’ll not really need to worry about the software it’s running as you’ll just turn it on, boot up your console, and move on with your day. </p><p>But if you plan on watching movies or using smart TV apps like YouTube or Max on your new television, then I’d recommend doing some research on the various OS different sets use. </p><p> Your best bet to figuring out what OS works best for you is to check Reddit and YouTube. Watch videos of people playing around with TV menus and read up on which operating systems are slow and if your desired television is too low-powered to properly run the TV’s software. </p><p>Of all the manufacturers, LG tends to have the best sets and best operating systems. It’s snappy, clean, easy to use, and offers up the options I care about. The LG app store isn’t as big as Roku or Google TV’s offerings, but it does include YouTube and most other “big” apps.</p><h2 id="h4145"><a id="3"></a>Some 4K TV Recommendations</h2><p>Okay, maybe you don’t want to do any research and just want me to tell you which TV to buy. I can do that, but I still recommend checking out some basic facts on a TV before buying it. You might be spending $1,000 or more on this thing, so make sure it’s something you actually want! </p><p> Both of my recommendations are LG sets because in my experience (and talking to other TV freaks out there) the company really makes the best, easiest to use, and most reliable 4K televisions currently on the market. </p><p>Anyway, here are my two recommendations. </p><h3 id="h4146"><a id=""></a>The “Cheap” Option</h3><p>If you want a solid 4K/120FPS gaming TV and you don’t want to spend over $1,000, then your best bet is probably <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.link/6jm8vv44cnygh&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.link/6jm8vv44cnygh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LG’s B4 48-inch OLED set</a></span>. It comes with 4 HDMI 2.1 ports and supports VRR tech via Gsync. And LG’s software is nice and snappy. You can usually find this TV selling on Amazon and Best Buy for under $700 and it’s worth it. </p><h3 id="h4147"><a id=""></a>The “Expensive” Option</h3><p>If you want a bigger, better TV to play games on, and you don’t mind spending over $1,500 on a TV, then you should probably buy the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.link/qh9gdvpaylovf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.link/qh9gdvpaylovf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LG C4 OLED set</a></span>. So what does the extra $700+ get you over the B4 option above? Well, you get everything the B4 includes, plus a bigger screen as I recommend either the 55-inch or the 65-inch depending on your room. You also get a brighter picture with better contrast, too. And it features a better processor inside which should help with navigating menus, but will also allow the TV to upscale content better. </p><hr><p>Ultimately, either TV is going to likely be a big upgrade over anything that’s been sitting in your gaming room for more than five years. Especially if that TV was a cheaper LCD you bought on a Black Friday sale years ago.</p><p>Really it just comes down to how much you care about little features and how much cash are you willing to spend. Either way, the B4 or the C4 are great options and worth hunting down this holiday season either for yourself or that gamer in your life who keeps complaining about their old TV. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Apparently, players have also been helping Niantic create a 3D model of the world, which is being expanded via AI into a Large Geospatial Model.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.404media.co/pokemon-go-players-have-unwittingly-trained-ai-to-navigate-the-world/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">404 Media</a>, Niantic made <a href="https://nianticlabs.com/news/largegeospatialmode" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the largely unnoticed announcement</a> earlier this month. These plans have seemingly been in the works for a long time, and the company states that it is attempting to "help computers perceive, comprehend, and navigate the physical world." It also compares Large Geospatial Models to the Large Language Models used by OpenAI's GPT, Grok, and others.</p><p>Because Pokemon Go players are able to visit locations that cars can't access, they've given Niantic views of buildings and areas that other models haven't been able to see until now. Niantic explained that only the fronts of buildings have been identifiable from previous models, but the Large Geospatial Models can teach computers how to see and identify the other sides of buildings on a global scale.</p><p>One way Pokemon Go players have unwittingly contributed to this is through the recently released Pokemon Playgrounds feature, which lets them leave behind a Pokemon at a specific spot that can be found by other players. Niantic states that 10 million locations have been scanned through that feature from around the world, and 1 million new scans arrive every week.</p><p>According to the map of the model on Niantic's site, the company is far from mapping the entire globe. Most of the locations captured appear to be in North America and Europe, while Africa, Australia, and a large portion of Asia remain uncaptured for now. South America also has a long way to go before it will be fully captured by Niantic's AI model.</p><p>Outside of Pokemon Go, the franchise continues to thrive.

			<p>If you're still enjoying Warhammer 40,000: Darktide and all it has to offer, you are in for more content coming on December 3, 2024. Fatshark has announced that the Grim Protocols update will be released on all platforms as of December 3. This update introduces a lot of new content as well as quality-of-life improvements to celebrate <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-darktide-patch-13-preview-and-qa-class-system-overhaul-xbox-specs-and-pc-performance-boost/">the second anniversary</a> of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide. To celebrate the announcement made by Fatshark today, a narrative trailer was released to accompany the news.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - Grim Protocols | Narrative Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oC1HRacColU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First and foremost, the Grim Protocols free update will be adding a new game mode to the game named Havoc. Havoc is specifically an end-game experience where it tests the limits of the player and their experience in the game thus far. There will be plenty of challenges to complete, which can net the player cosmetic rewards.</p>
<p>Additionally, players will get to dive into a new mission in Warhammer 40,000: Darktide. The mission is titled Dark Communion and sees players return to the Carnival, where you have to face off against hordes of cultists who are trying to complete their ritual. You'll have to be prepared to fight them off and make sure to do everything in your power so that they don't achieve their dark communion.</p>
<p>Playable content isn't the only thing that is being added in the Grim Protocols update for Warhammer 40,000: Darktide. There are now three new weapon families that you can experiment with. If you've wanted to feel even more robust than you already are, you can now use Two-Handed Force and Power Swords, as well as the Ogryn Heavy Stubber. It will provide a great experience to the chaos and bloodshed ahead of you and allow you to feel stronger than ever in melee combat.</p>
<p>To celebrate the second anniversary of Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, there will be a special Anniversary event taking place within the game which will allow players to get a unique weapon trinket.</p>
<p>While these are the main attractions of the free update to Warhammer 40,000: Darktide, there are other quality-of-life improvements that have been added to the Grim Protocols update, including expanding the Penance progression track and improving the Party Finder feature.</p>
<p>This update will be available for PC players via Steam and Windows Store, Xbox Series X|S and the game is <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/EP4122-PPSA21255_00-0888672453602469" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available for preorder on PlayStation 5</a>, where the game is set to release on December 3, 2024, alongside the new update.</p>

Their surprise availability with the launch of Season 1 was welcomed by players deep into the Call of Duty grind, but their equally surprising removal caused an outcry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time, developer Treyarch said it patched the legacy XP tokens out of Black Ops 6 because their accidental introduction, which it blamed on a UI bug, "introduced some potential risk to game stability."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elsewhere, today’s update improves the hitmarker user interface to help identify shots more easily, and fixes a number of bugs across Multiplayer and Zombies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Taking on Zombies mode?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/remedy-reveals-how-many-copies-control-2-and-firebreak-need-to-sell-to-break-even<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The million dollar question.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Remedy has provided a rare insight into the business of making video games, even going as far as to reveal exactly how many copies its future games need to sell in order to break even.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The video game industry is typically secretive when it comes to its commercial realities, and rarely does it provide development or marketing budgets or sales projections. But Remedy, developer of Alan Wake 2, has done just that in <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/capital-markets-day-2024/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an investment-focused meeting</a>, discussing the upcoming Control 2 PvE shooter FBC Firebreak.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth prefacing this by saying Remedy is talking about the sales needed to make a 100% return on investment (ROI) on these games, and that’s expected over a period of three to five years after. The game budgets, Remedy said, were set with their price points and expected sales in mind, and are “realistic.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/19/screenshot-2024-11-19-161612-1732034421560.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image credit: Remedy Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s start with FBC Firebreak, Remedy's new multiplayer game set in the Control universe billed as a three-player co-op experience (it’s worth bearing in mind FBC Firebreak will be available day one on Xbox Game Pass and PS Plus Extra, which will secure additional revenue from Microsoft and Sony).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The development budget for Firebreak is 30 million euros (approx $31.7 million), and will carry a mid-price point. To secure 100% ROI, it needs to sell three million copies during its lifetime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving on to Control 2, as a full-price triple-A game Remedy is set to self-publish (and therefore retain a larger cut of revenue), the development budget is higher: 50 million euros (approx $52.9 million). Control 2 needs to sell between three and four million copies to break even. Control 2, by the way, is an action RPG, Remedy said today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Is that realistic? According to Remedy, the first Control game has now sold over 4.5 million, so it’ll be hoping Control 2 can reach or even exceed that figure. Encouraging the studio will be the fact that Control has reached an impressive 19 million players with the help of various subscription services, so the audience interested in the sequel should be significant.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You’re only as good as your last game, though, and for Remedy that’s Alan Wake 2. The horror adventure is now up to 1.8 million copies sold, and it still hasn’t turned a profit (although it’s close to doing so).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The triple-A video game market is particularly brutal right now, with thousands of developers losing their jobs and an ever growing list of studios shutting their doors. Throughout it all Remedy has remained independent, although in September it received a 15 million euro (approx $15.8 million) loan from Tencent as part of its self-publishing push.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Remedy is also working on remakes of the first two Max Payne games for GTA 6 developer Rockstar Games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>Blizzard has revealed its new Overwatch 2 hero, Hazard, in an animated trailer. Ahead of the launch of season 14 on December 10, you'll be able to play with the character from November 22-25.</p><p>Named Hazardous Tactics, the animated trailer showcases a heist on Oasis, spearheaded by The Phreaks gang. Hazard, nicknamed Haz by the video captions, fuses himself with a strange substance to gain supernatural strength, with visible spikes around his body. In addition, he has a minigun for a right arm, and a Scottish accent. Developer Activision Blizzard said there'll be new details on Hazard and his abilities later this week.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sR8N3cXWxqM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/sR8N3cXWxqM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/overwatch-classic-is-bringing-back-6v6-in-overwatch-2-for-a-limited-time/1100-6527689/" data-ref-id="1100-6527689">Overwatch: Classic</a> is still available in Overwatch 2 until December 2. In this mode, you can only access the original roster of 21 heroes, as well as their original abilities.
