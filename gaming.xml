            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>One of the most unique video games of 2024 was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/indika">Indika</a>, a third-person adventure game where you play as a nun who has a connection to the Devil itself. It's a surreal, absurd adventure and it addresses faith, religion, and authority with a darkly comic (and tragic) tone.</p>
<p>And now, Odd Meter's extremely unusual title is coming to Switch on <strong>17th November</strong>, with a physical version following over a week later, on <strong>28th November</strong>. The above trailer (via Gematsu) <em>really</em> doesn't give away much except that there's nothing else quite like it!</p>
<p>But, if you need a little encouragement, just last month, Indika won the Game Designers Award at the Japan Game Awards, presented by none other than <strong>Smash Bros.</strong> and <strong>Kirby</strong> maestro Masahiro Sakurai.</p>
<p>At the ceremony, Sakurai gave the audience some background on the game, and detailed what makes it special — in the form of a short movie. Well, it's a lot of recorded gameplay with some explanations of some of the mechanics.</p>
<p>Sakurai praises the variety, the atmosphere, the story, and the questions it pushes onto the player (approximately translated via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NyLPvWz3_lY">the Japan Game Awards stream</a>).</p>
<p>For more details on the game, we'll throw it over to the press release:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A Surreal Journey Through 19th-Century Russia<br></strong>Set in an alternative Russia at the turn of the 19th century, <em>INDIKA</em> follows a young nun as she ventures beyond the monastery walls, accompanied by the most unexpected companion imaginable: the devil himself. What begins as a simple errand quickly transforms into a surreal and darkly comic odyssey, exploring themes of faith, authority, comedy, and tragedy with a uniquely inventive twist.</p>
<p><strong>Meet Indika: Not Your Ordinary Nun<br></strong>Indika appears to live a quiet, monastic life, but her unlikely friendship with the horned tempter drags her into a world where the sacred collides with the profane. Every step reveals new mysteries and challenges, immersing players in a story reminiscent of Dostoyevsky’s depth and Bulgakov’s surreal humour.</p>
<p><strong>Explore a Bold Indie Vision<br></strong>Developed by Odd Meter, <em>INDIKA</em> blends atmospheric exploration, dark humour, and inventive puzzles across surreal landscapes. Its distinctive style is punctuated by 2D pixel-art mini-games that reveal hidden layers of Indika’s past.</p>
<p><strong>Key Features:<br></strong>- Third-person, story-driven adventure with darkly comic tones<br>
- A young nun’s journey of self-discovery across a surreal reimagining of 19th-century Russia<br>
- The devil as an unlikely and mischievous companion<br>
- Puzzle-solving and exploration interwoven with narrative<br>
- Surreal, atmospheric environments with striking visual design<br>
- 2D pixel-art mini-games that illuminate Indika’s backstory</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Our sister site Push Square reviewed the game back in May 2024, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/indika">were full of praise</a>. One for the radar, we think.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Indika launches on Switch next month on 17th November. Will you be checking this one out? let us know in the comments!</em></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Mark Cerny Seems to Tease PlayStation 6 Arrival In “A Few Years Time”]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/sony-amd-mark-cerny-jack-huynh-project-amethyst-ps6-playstation-6/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mark-cerny-seems-to-tease-playstation-6-arrival-in-%E2%80%9Ca-few-years-time%E2%80%9D.1320847/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, in a new video published by Sony and AMD, PlayStation console architect Mark Cerny and AMD's senior vice president and general manager of computing and graphics, Jack Huynh, talked about Project Amethyst and the two companies' "<em>shared vision</em>" for the future of gaming technologies and hardware. While most of the video was focused on what these three technologies will be, Cerny did slide in a slight tease for when we'll be seeing PlayStation 6 and that next generation of hardware.</p>



<p>"<em>Overall, it's of course still very early days for these technologies, they only exist in simulation right now, but the results are quite promising, and I'm really excited about bringing them to a future console, in a few years time</em>," Cerny said towards the end of the video after <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-unveils-radiance-cores-neural-arrays-universal-compression-next-gen-rdna-gpu-architecture/">discussing advancements like Neural Arrays, Radiance Cores, and Universal Compression</a> for most of the video.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="From Project Amethyst to the Future of Play: AMD and Sony Interactive Entertainment’s Shared Vision" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ItXPvGrI6gY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>It's not a lot to go off, of course, but it does at least give us public confirmation of the timeline that Cerny, Sony, and AMD have in their heads for when we can expect PlayStation 6.</p>



<p>The PlayStation 5 was released in 2020, with its mid-generation refresh and improved 'professional' version arriving last year in 2024. It wouldn't be surprising to see the PlayStation 5 generation last at least seven or eight years, putting an estimated release window for PlayStation 6 in 2028 or even 2029.</p>



<p>Even with the next generation still being years away, we've already heard several rumours about what the PS6 will include, like rumoured specs that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps6-specs-rumor-34-40-tflops-6-12-rt-performance-uplift/">estimate it'll have somewhere between 34 and 40 teraflops</a>, and even what it'll not include, like a built-in disc drive that's tied to the console. It'll instead <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-reportedly-have-detachable-disc-drive-at-launch-ps6/">have a detachable disc drive at launch</a>, which lines up with the current state of new PS5 consoles, since the disc drive on every model PlayStation makes now is detachable.</p>



<p>The video is an exciting prospect of what's to come from PlayStation hardware and AMD in the future. Hopefully, whenever it does arrive, it'll have been worth the wait.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/uesp-wiki-met-with-bethesda-to-design-a-character-for-the-elder-scrolls-vi-and-left-%E2%80%98extremely-excited-about-what%E2%80%99s-in-store%E2%80%99.1320844/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The team behind the <a href="https://en.uesp.net/wiki/Main_Page" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">UESP wiki</a>, the Unofficial Elder Scrolls Pages (the most reputable fan-made wiki dedicated to The Elder Scrolls franchise), <a href="https://x.com/UESP_net/status/1976097106516639813" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that they have met with Bethesda Game Studios to design a character for The Elder Scrolls VI. They also claimed to have left the meeting 'extremely excited' about what's coming.</p>



<p><em>We just finished up a meeting with Bethesda where we got to design a character for The Elder Scrolls VI. Honestly, a lot of us went into the meeting pretty nervous and even reserved, but now we're all extremely excited for what's in store.</em></p>



<p>Now, they did not clarify exactly what they're excited about. They might have been given a rough outline of what will be in the game; they might have actually seen footage from an early build; or they might just be talking about that character they have designed and how it's coming along. They won't be able to say anything more for now due to the Non-Disclosure Agreement they were no doubt forced to sign beforehand.</p>



<p>Either way, this will get TES VI fans talking for a while. After all, it's been a very long time since Bethesda formally announced The Elder Scrolls VI. It was at E3 2018 that the studio let everyone know about its existence, but it was just a reassurance that the studio would not abandon its trademark single player RPGs following the Fallout 76 experiment. BGS then set to make Starfield, its first new IP in over 25 years, and TES VI <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-officially-in-early-development-but-you-wont-hear-any-more-about-it-for-some-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only entered active production on August 30, 2023</a>, following the launch of Starfield. Elder Scrolls Game Director Todd Howard had teased just a few days before that The Elder Scrolls VI <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-ultimate-fantasy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would be the 'ultimate fantasy world simulator'</a>. </p>



<p>A few months later, in March 2024, Bethesda celebrated the franchise's 30th anniversary by <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-early-builds-are-being-played-right-now-at-bethesda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealing</a> that early builds of TES VI were being playtested internally. Its release window is still far from our grasp, but chances are it might happen between 2027 and 2028. It would certainly be a fantastic year for Western RPG fans if The Witcher IV and The Elder Scrolls VI launched in the same year, and that's not so far-fetched as things stand.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-pikmin-short-animated-film-mario-zelda-app-2000633651</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo%E2%80%99s-short-films-feel-like-they-could-be-the-start-of-something-much-bigger.1320835/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Fans spent a lot of time trying to decipher <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-just-shared-a-4-minute-pixar-like-animated-short-with-no-explanation-2000632524">possible clues hiding in a recent Pixar-like Nintendo short film</a> featuring a baby and, as it turned out later on, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendos-mysterious-animated-short-was-a-pikmin-tease-after-all-2000633212">Pikmin</a>. Were they a tease for a new <em>Pikmin</em> game? Rosalina’s origin story in the <em>Mario Galaxy</em> movie? Apparently not. Nintendo now claims this short film experiment was all just for fun. It’s easy to see where it could go in the future, though. Are these the first building blocks of Nintendo’s version of a Disney-style streaming library?</p> <p>“These are the first short films created by Nintendo Pictures Co., Ltd.,” the company <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1976272772725923992">posted online this morning</a>. “Nintendo Pictures will continue to explore new creative possibilities through video content.”</p> <p>The <em>Pikmin</em> shorts come just a couple months after a series of claymation<em> Mario</em> videos that felt like something out of <em>Sesame Street</em>. While they turned out <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-announces-mario-claymation-show-as-part-of-new-kid-themed-my-mario-product-line-push">to be hocking</a> new merchandise for the <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> 40th anniversary, it was easy to imagine a whole streaming series based around a similar aesthetic and visual gags. This isn’t even the first time Nintendo has experimented with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ANpP2PebOW0">short movies and made <em>Pikmin</em> the stars</a>.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We hope you enjoyed the two “Close to You” videos released on October 7 and 8.<br>The second video is available on Nintendo Today!, a free app available on your smart device.<br>These are the first short films created by Nintendo Pictures Co., Ltd.<br>Nintendo Pictures will continue to… <a href="https://t.co/GKizLT0Ckv">pic.twitter.com/GKizLT0Ckv</a></p> <p>— 任天堂株式会社 (@Nintendo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nintendo/status/1976272772725923992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 9, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It’s notable that the second of the two<em> Pikmin</em> short films is only viewable inside the Nintendo Today! app, a strange Switch 2-era digital curio that Nintendo still seems to be figuring out. It’s part of a growing and weirdly aligned set of entertainment touchpoints for the brand. There’s the music app with soundtracks dating back to the NES days, Switch Online’s library of classic games, new theme parks, and box office blockbusters like the upcoming <em>Mario Galaxy</em> and<em> Zelda</em> movies. Also alarm clocks, amiibo, Lego, and a whole adjacent universe of <em>Pokémon,</em> whose streaming app inside Switch <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/64104/~/discontinuation-of-pok%C3%A9mon-tv-on-nintendo-switch">was killed off a year ago</a>.</p>

 <p>I would never expect Nintendo to do something so sane, rational, and predictable as trying to wrap all of this stuff into one coherent super-app, but it is easy to see an opening for more Nintendo content on streaming. The company doesn’t need an entire platform of content to win people over with a few hits. Millions of households sign up for Disney+ <a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-plus-price-raising-bluey-season-4-jimmy-kimmel-2000627947">just for <em>Bluey</em></a>. Where is Nintendo’s <em>Bluey</em>? I say that not as some writer cosplaying as an industry analyst, but as a parent with three children who love Mario and have run out of <em>Bluey</em> to watch.</p>

  <p>They still occasionally watch the old <em>Mario</em> cartoons from the ’90s that I grew up with. What else are they going to do when they finish <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> and get tired of streaming <em>The</em> <em>Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> for the 50th time? If your answer is “Go back and play<em> Super Mario Bros 3</em>,<em>“</em> than you’ve never watched young kids who weren’t raised on 8-bit graphics try to grapple with the low-stimulation limitations of unforgiving 2D platforming.</p> <p>Nintendo execs have spoken in the past about how the company’s biggest competitors aren’t PlayStation or Xbox but Netflix and the smartphone. It gave up trying to put games on mobile marketplaces dominated by free-to-play casinos, but it’s finally seeing if there’s a place in the ever-expanding universe of short-form video for a <em>Mario</em>-sized respite from all the algorithmic junk. That would be nice! I would take that <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-alarmo-preorder-scalpers-bed-1851670175">over an Alarmo 2</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dji-osmo-mobile-gimbal-stabilizer-falls-to-a-price-even-lower-than-prime-day-feels-like-clearance-2000633375</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dji-osmo-mobile-gimbal-stabilizer-falls-to-a-price-even-lower-than-prime-day-feels-like-clearance.1320832/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>You let me know if anything like this has happened to you. You’re trying to record something eventful on your phone. Maybe it’s your kid on their way to scoring their first goal in their peewee soccer league. You decide to run alongside them to keep up with your phone camera capturing this precious moment. But then afterwards, you look to the new video in your camera roll and see that it is an unwatchable mess. The frame is unstable, bouncing around with every step you took. You can’t even tell what is happening in the shot.</p>
<p>That’s why any professional or amateur video aficionado is going to want to keep a gimbal stabilizer in their kit. Even though Prime Big Deals Days has passed, Amazon still has a couple of DJI’s phone stabilizers on sale. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4668/">The DJI Osmo Mobile 7P which normally goes for $149 has come down to just $120</a>. Likewise the DJI Osmo Mobile 7 has dropped from $89 to just 75.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4668/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>Now the Osmo Mobile 7 and Osmo Mobile 7P are pretty similar, but the 7P has a couple enhancements over the standard 7. Mainly, the 7P is equipped with a retractable extension rod inside the handle, providing your with more flexibility when using it as either a selfie stick or tripod.</p>
<p>Mounting your phone to the gimbal couldn’t be easier. The DJI Osmo gimbals use a magnetic connection to pair the phone so you can start filming immediately.</p>



<h2>Intelligent Tracking</h2>
<p>Both gimbal stabilizers from DJI can make your filming life so much easier by tracking your subject and eliminating any unwanted camera jitter that comes from shaky hands or you needing to move while shooting. Even if your subject quickly changes direction, the Osmo Mobile 7 or 7P will be able to adjust automatically, keeping them in the spotlight at all times. Even if your subject is momentarily obscured like if they pass behind a tree, the gimbal can maintain continuous tracking ensuring your footage is fluid throughout.</p>
<p>Record or take photos in selfie mode with no one behind the camera. The Osmo 7 and 7P’s handles convert into a tripod base so they can stand upright on their own. You can then use gesture controls to direct the shot from afar. Raising your palm tells the gimbal to start or stop tracking you. Making a “double-L” with your thumbs can be used to adjust framing. Then making a V or peace sign gesture will tell it to take a photo or start or stop video recording.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4668/">The battery will reliably last your for 10 full hours. Then when you’re done recording, the gimbal can be quickly folded back up into a portable form factor.</a></p>

<p>Activision has seemingly heard the cries of players, and a major change for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 multiplayer is coming to the game at launch. In a post on the game’s website, the publisher announced that Black Ops 7 will have non-disbanding multiplayer lobbies at launch. </p>



<p>That means once you find a game lobby, you’ll remain in it until you either leave or it’s disbanded. </p>



<p><strong>“We’ve heard the community discussion and dialogue around lobby disbanding, and as we mentioned earlier during the Beta, we’re focused on keeping players together from match to match more often,”</strong> <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Activision said</a>. <strong>“Today, we’re excited to announce we’ll have persistent lobbies at launch for Black Ops 7. We’re committed to improving this experience for players, and will be sharing more details soon.”</strong></p>



<p>In addition to persistent lobbies, Activision also announced that it <strong>“open matchmaking with minimal skill consideration will be the default for Black Ops 7 multiplayer.</strong> In other terms, that means skill-based matchmaking is being taken out of Black Ops 7</p>



<p><strong>“Simply put, imagine the matchmaking experience of Open Moshpit from the Beta, but as the standard in Black Ops 7 on day one,”</strong> they said. <strong>“Our team feels strongly about providing players with a more varied experience, and the Beta proved to be a great opportunity to test this approach. We’ll be sharing more details as we get closer to launch!”</strong></p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launches on November 14 for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</p>

                <p>A new video with PS5 lead architect Mark Cerny and AMD SVP Jack Huynh has shed more light on the technology that could potentially power the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-6-everything-we-know-about-sonys-next-generation-console/1100-6533561/">yet-to-be-announced PlayStation 6 console</a>. AMD and Sony have been collaborating through Project Amethyst, an initiative designed to push gaming technology forward, and Cerny added that he's really excited to bring recent breakthroughs to a "future console."</p><h3>Expect a "game-changer" in future upscaling technologies</h3><p>According to Cerny and Huyn, there have been three big developments recently. Cerny explained that current technologies like FSR and PSSR are extremely demanding on GPUs and system memory. The first new concept revealed was Neural Arrays, which Hyung explained was designed to overcome inefficiencies encountered by subdividing neural network problems across many compute units. Neural Arrays allow compute units to "team up" and share data, and the end result here is that this can lead to better FSR and ray tracing effects, more efficiency, and better scalability as a workload grows.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1LCMzw-_dMw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1LCMzw-_dMw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Neural Arrays will allow us to process a large chunk of the screen in one go, and the efficiencies that come from that are going to be a game-changer as we begin to develop the next generation of upscaling and denoising technologies together," Cerny explained.</p><p>Cerny and Hyung also expect ray tracing to improve through the use of Neural Radiance Caching--which was unveiled at Computex earlier this year--and Radiance Cores. Together, ray tracing and path tracing can be handled together in real time, allowing developers to access a new level of realistic lighting while also allowing the CPU to focus on geometry and simulation tasks. "A cleaner, faster, and more efficient pipeline built for the next generation of ray-traced games," Huynh said.</p><p>The other big reveal was Universal Compression, a new system designed for future GPUs and software-on-chips as a way to dramatically reduce memory bandwidth usage. This is an expansion of current technologies utilized on PS5 and PS5 Pro, and Universal Compression will evaluate and compress every piece of data on its way to the system memory. This will then lead to lower power consumption, higher visual quality, and improved performance.</p><p>"It's still very early days for these technologies, they only exist in simulation right now, but the results are quite promising and I'm really excited about bringing them to a future console in a few years' time," Cerny concluded.</p><p>This year will mark the fifth anniversary of the PS5's launch, but there have been a few hints from Sony regarding its plans for a successor console. O<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-will-go-modular-with-optional-disc-drive-report/1100-6534538/" data-ref-id="1100-6534538">ne proposed idea is a detachable disc drive</a>, giving the rumored console a layer of modularity. We also know that Sony <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-ps6-sony-is-betting-on-hardware-power-not-the-cloud/1100-6532420/">will continue to rely on hardware over cloud technology</a>, as it's aware that its users prefer the "local execution" of games that comes from a physical disc or having the software directly downloaded to the system.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>This year marks the 15th anniversary for MachinesGames and to celebrate the milestone, the developer is releasing a new update for <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> tomorrow, on October 10. It will add the heavily requested New Game+ feature to the game, which includes a new ending sequence, a new but classic Indy outfit, and additional voice-over languages.&nbsp;</p><p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle launched on Xbox Series X/S and PC last December, and it hit PlayStation 5 earlier this year. Players on every platform can expect this free anniversary update tomorrow, and you can get a look at the new features in a special trailer below:&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4u-QnuhfLmE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4u-QnuhfLmE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As you can see, the main highlight of the update is New Game+. Once you've completed the main story, New Game+ will be available right from the main menu. All you have to do is select a save slot containing a completed playthrough of the story, and a New Game+ menu will appear. MachineGames says, "Because you'll be significantly stronger this time around, we recommend bumping your difficulty up," and notes you can adjust this during the initial New Game+ setup.&nbsp;</p><p>As for what carries over, you will have all collected and unlocked Adventure Books as well as any unspent Adventure Points, local currency, and Medicine Bottles.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> is finally releasing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> and Rebirth as a physical double pack.</p>
<p>These games are the first two parts of the Remake trilogy, which reimagines the original PS1 classic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy 7</a>.</p>
<p>Available from 4th December exclusively on PS5, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> Twin Pack Physical Edition (as it's known) will cost $59.99 / €69.99 / £59.99. You can pre-order it now from the <a href="https://gb.store.square-enix-games.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-_-rebirth---twin-pack-physical-edition?_gl=1%2Alcp8u1%2A_gcl_au%2AMjM5MjUyNTcuMTc1NjcxNjY0MQ..&amp;_ga=2.95225759.2068626468.1760015048-116765061.1756716641">Square Enix store</a>.</p>

<p>Rebirth alone currently costs £69.99 on the PSN store, so it's decent value.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-gets-switch-2-release-date">Final Fantasy 7 Remake will also be coming to Xbox and Switch 2</a> on 22nd January next year, which will be followed by Rebirth afterwards, though that remains without a release date.</p>
<p>It's unknown, therefore, if an equivalent double pack will make its way to other consoles in the future.</p>

<p>What's more, there's still the third part of the trilogy to arrive at some point in the future, which is due across all platforms. Will a triple pack of the complete Remake trilogy be released physically? It would seem likely, but don't expect it at launch if the wait for this twin pack is anything to go by.</p>
<p>The Xbox and Switch 2 versions of Remake will come with Pixel Remaster-style boosts to help progression, which will also be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remakes-progression-helping-boosts-arent-exclusive-to-switch-2-and-xbox-will-also-arrive-via-patch-for-ps5-and-pc">retroactively added to the PS5 and PC versions too</a>.</p>

<p>Final Masterpiece Edition is coming this year</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="1bc9826b0b856"><a title="Layers of Fear" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1bc9826b0b856/layers-of-fear.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bloober Team</em></figcaption></figure><p>Bloober Team has announced that it is releasing a new version of <strong>Layers of Fear</strong> on the Nintendo Switch 2 later this year.</p>
<p>Dubbed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/layers-of-fear-final-masterpiece-edition">Layers of Fear: Final Masterpiece Edition</a>, the game was announced as part of the company's <a href="https://ir.blooberteam.com/2025/10/09/bloober-team-ujawnia-aktualny-kalendarz-wydawniczy-swoich-projektow/">latest financial report</a>, in which it describes the release as "a complete edition of the iconic Layers of Fear series".</p>
<p>With this in mind, it's not completely clear what this actually is. Bloober launched the original <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/layers_of_fear">Layers of Fear</a> in 2016 and followed up with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/layers_of_fear_2">a sequel</a> in 2019. The original was re-released on the Switch in 2018 as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/layers_of_fear_legacy">Layers of Fear: Legacy</a>, and Bloober then created a remake/sequel in 2023 that was also called <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/layers_of_fear">Layers of Fear</a>. Yeah, not confusing at all.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067kvszrl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>Our assumption is that the Final Masterpiece Edition will be an enhanced port of the latest Layers of Fear, and not another re-release of the original 2016 game. This means it'll take full advantage of Unreal Engine 5 on the Switch 2 while combining stories from the first two titles.</p>
<p>We're certain Bloober will be sharing more details soon either way, so we'll be sure to update you as soon as we hear more.</p>
<p>In addition, it's also been confirmed that the isometric title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/i_hate_this_place">I Hate This Place</a> has been delayed into the new year and will now launch on <strong>29th January 2026</strong>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-should-cost-70-achieve-maximum-sales-potential/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gta-vi-should-cost-70-to-achieve-maximum-sales-potential-midia-research-recommends.1320769/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Games industry analyst firm MIDiA Research has published a new report titled “The winning formula for Grand Theft Auto VI” where they explain why Take-Two Interactive should price GTA VI at $69.99.</p>



<p>To reach this consensus, the analysts used the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gabor%E2%80%93Granger_method" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gabor-Granger method</a> and surveyed more than 2,000 United States consumers. According to their findings, the rumored $100 launch price (<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launch-for-100/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advocated by Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter</a> but <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-why-gta-vi-likely-wont-be-priced-100-according-to-an-analyst/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opposed by Alinea Analytics analyst Rhys Elliott</a>) would reduce both unit sales and overall revenue. In contrast, the industry-standard price of $69.99 would maximize the sales potential and align with consumer expectations.</p>



<p>The study found that 79% of consumers interested in GTA VI said they would “definitely” or “probably” buy the game for $49.99, compared to 16% at a theoretical $149.99. Among superfans, the willingness to purchase at $149.99 was nearly twice that of the average consumer (9% versus 5%), but it was not enough to offset the overall loss in demand. </p>



<p>At the suggested optimal price of $69.99, MIDiA Research reckons approximately 8.6% of the U.S. adult population would purchase the game, for 22.9 million copies sold and $1.6 billion in revenue.</p>



<p>Perry Gresham, Head of Data at MIDiA Research and co-author of the report, said:</p>



<p><em>Our research suggests that GTA VI will generate more revenue at a standard $69.99 price point than the much-discussed $100. A $100 price point would actually leave money on the table. Below the optimum price, increasing price increases revenue, but prices above the optimum can result in loss of both unit sales and revenue. This is because the revenue increase from those who still purchase will be less than the lost revenue from those who do not.</em></p>



<p>Brandon Sutton, Games Analyst at MIDiA and co-author of the report, added:</p>



<p><em>Our research shows that 59% of consumers have some interest in purchasing GTA VI, highlighting the immense appeal and commercial potential of the game. This notoriety also makes GTA VI the perfect test case to understand consumer expectations around video games pricing. Our findings should serve as a caution to game developers looking to raise game prices in the future.</em></p>



<p>As a reminder, Grand Theft Auto VI was originally scheduled to launch in Fall 2025 but <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was delayed to May 26, 2026</a>. Fans are hoping there won't be any more delays, but with Rockstar, it's hard to say.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">They say “insanity” is doing the same thing over and over again while expecting a different result, but if I believed that, I wouldn’t play video games – and I certainly wouldn’t be playing roguelikes. They are, by definition, doing a lot of the same things over and over again and expecting that this time, <a href="https://youtu.be/6TMOMTtAMBI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>this time</em></u><u>, Steve, shall be different</u></a>. This time, I am going to bash my head against that boss until that mother goes <em>down.</em> <em>This time</em>, I’m going to make it to the end of the run, and I’m going to look fabulous doing it. <em>This time</em> will be different. Those are the things I tell myself as I die for the umpteenth time in Absolum, a roguelite beat ‘em up that’s fun enough to convince myself it just might be true every single time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There is, of course, the undeniable possibility that I’ve gone ‘round the bend, full on cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs, lock-me-in-a-padded-room, Looney-Tunes-finger-on-lips bonkers. I’ll leave that up to you. The point, reader, is that if you’d put a gun to my head five hours into Absolum and demanded that I score it on the spot, it’d be a lot lower than the score you see on the bottom of this page. But I’m a professional, and you don’t turn the movie off halfway through. There are large parts of Absolum’s fusion of genres that don’t work, and those growing pains are most obvious early on. But if you push through that weak start and get to the point where you’ve got some permanent rewards, have opened up the map, and runs end with you operating with a full kit and making good progress, it comes together quite nicely, even if it’s still never quite the game I wanted it to be.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Roguelite beat ‘em up” is a combination of words that I never expected to see, much less put in a sentence, but here we are. Because it’s a roguelite, you need a reason to die, and a reason to come back. The reason to die is simple: the land of Talamh, broken by a magical cataclysm (bro, what is it with mages and magical cataclysms? Why can’t they ever bumble their way into magical utopias?), has been taken over by Sun King Azra. Wizards are enslaved, and the general populace, still a bit miffed by the whole “breaking the world” thing, are understandably not super upset about it. You play as one of the rebels using that forbidden magic in an attempt to bring him down. That’s the “how you’ll die” part.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The “why you’ll come back” part is because you’re working for Uchawi, the last of the Root Sisters, and as you bite it, she swoops in and saves your ass from being condemned to a permanent end. Live, die, get saved by Uchawi, repeat. The Sun King must die. And you gotta kill him.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The story goes to some cool places eventually, but it takes a while to get there.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, don’t get me wrong: I love a good ol’ fashioned “somebody done somebody/a lot of somebodies/society/the world at large wrong and now that somebody gotta die” story as much as the next guy, but Absolum’s problem is that the story isn’t that interesting for a good chunk of its runtime, especially early on. Yeah, there are some compelling character moments, the general history of the world is cool, and some conversations enticingly imply more questions than they answer. There’s more going on here than meets the eye, but a lot of it is couched in a fairly generic fantasy setting. Dwarves live underground, they delved too greedily and too deep (figuratively), bad things happened; elves have a mythical, lost land; the strong rule in many places so you can gain entrance by beating up The Current Big Boss, blah blah blah. The story does go to some cool places eventually (and, like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hades-2-early-access-review">Hades</a>, you really gotta play it to completion multiple times to see everything), but man does it take a while to get there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s good, then, that the playing part of Absolum <em>rules</em>. In a lot of ways, it’s a standard beat ‘em up with four different characters to pick from (though you only start with the first two listed here): Karl, the bruiser dwarf with a gun; Galandra, the elven knight with a massive sword; Cider, a nimble thief who is almost more machine than woman; and Brome, the frog-shaped spellcaster. Each character has a standard combo, a throw, a strike unique to that character – Galandra uses her sword, Cider pulls herself to enemies, and so on – a couple of unique special attacks tied to a meter, and an Ultimate Attack. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The real sicko stuff comes when you combine everything to form long combos, bounce enemies off walls or each other, and chain moves together in a symphonic beatdown that would make the deepest action game aficionado blush. Absolum was made by the teams behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/streets-of-rage-4-review">Streets of Rage 4</a>, and, as you’d expect, it absolutely has the sauce. I particularly loved the way so many moves paid homage to the greats: Cider’s Gyro Drop is essentially Ryu Hayabusa’s Izuna Drop, many of Galandra’s moves recall Devil May Cry’s Dante, and so on. If you know, you know. If you don’t, they’re just cool moves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The big thing separating Absolum from its beat ‘em up brethren, aside from the whole “man, can you get lost in this sauce and it <em>tastes good</em>” combo-mad gameplay, is its focus on defense. You can dodge, which is pretty normal for a modern beat ’em up, but if you dodge toward an enemy at the right time, you can deflect their attacks, potentially opening them up. If you’re feeling particularly spicy, though, you can time your strikes with an enemy’s attack to cause a clash and stun them for a hot second, allowing you to lay into them with a sweet, sweet punish combo. This is harder, but the payoff is huge. And it feels great when you land it against a boss who was kicking the crap out of you and then the timing clicks and they can’t hit you no more. On a moment to moment gameplay level, Absolum’s bona fides are unimpeachable. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Absolum's combat bona fides are unimpeachable, but problems stem from its roguelite structure.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Its problems instead stem from its structure as a roguelite. Unlocking new rituals that power up your attacks, deflects, clashes, dodges, and so on each run is fine. I particularly like the ones that spawn throwable knives and allow you to extend combos by locking dudes into a bubble or hitting them with chain lighting. Finding a mount to help you out? Awesome. Buying or finding some trinkets to boost your stats or hiring a mercenary (or finding a chicken) to follow you around and help out in combat? That stuff is great. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What sucks is that parts of each character’s kit have clearly been chopped up and segmented into upgrades called Inspirations for you to temporarily acquire during your runs. Galandra’s dive kick? Amazing. Life-changing. The same is true of her three-hit sword combo. She should always have it. She doesn’t only because this is a roguelite and we have to have something to upgrade, a reason to choose that path that you know will end in an Inspiration. When you go from that one hit sword attack to the three-hit combo, it’s like being struck by lightning. The same is true of Cider’s Legally Distinct Izuna Drop or her ability to dash through enemies. “Oh,” I said, after getting them once. “This is how it should <em>always </em>be.” These are core parts of these characters’ identities and kits. They shouldn’t <em>all</em> be locked behind random upgrades. Like, give me <em>something </em>here that I don’t have to unlock besides my strikes and special attacks, y’all. Just a little bit of fun, as a treat. Admittedly, once you learn what paths lead to upgrades (Absolum is a roguelike, but its map does not change), you’ll quickly learn what the optimal path is, and likely never deviate from it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The other problem is the persistent progression. Absolum isn’t a game you’re meant to beat on the first run. You’re supposed to die – a lot – while you build up the currency needed to acquire permanent upgrades (and find new paths full of rewards) to get you through future runs. Yeah, sure, if you’re really good at Absolum, you might be able to progress faster, but the margin of error early on is very, very small. In both solo and co-op, I often felt like I was dying because my numbers just weren’t high enough. It doesn’t help that Absolum is pretty stingy on health pickups. This structure might work in a game like Hades, but there’s very little narrative meat to chew on between runs, and in a beat ‘em up – a genre where you’re traditionally able to get by on sheer skill – it feels bad to be a slave to the Evil God of Numbers. I genuinely hate it when RPG elements get in the way of my action game, and that happens a lot in Absolum’s early hours.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the beginning, runs feel like you’re going through the motions. You always start at the same place, and you have very limited paths to choose from. That means seeing the same enemies, environments, and bosses over and over and over again with very little room for change. Yes, there are quests, and exciting new things do pop up from time to time – I’ll never forget the first time I went to [redacted] (trust me, you’ll know when it happens) – but there is a lot of repetition here, and Absolum doesn’t handle it the way the best roguelikes, like FTL, for example, do. In the early hours, I often felt like a broken record, testing that definition of insanity. Even the joy of finding a secret chest is dulled by the fact that it’s <em>always there</em>, in the same place, every time. While the stuff you’ll get changes and new things do get added, the map itself never fundamentally changes. There’s not enough Rogue to this roguelite. It can’t just be a progression system. It has to be everything around that, too, and implementing that clashes with the way beat ‘em ups work.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Will's Favorite Action Games</h3><p>Rise of the Ronin is Team Ninja's latest foray into the action genre. Here's how it stacks up against my favorites.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It does eventually click; around 8 hours in, my mastery and Having Enough Numbers dovetailed, and I started to make more and more progress on each run. The jump was pretty substantial, and once that happened, I began to enjoy myself a lot more. On the one hand, yay, less repetition! On the other hand, I think there’s something to be said for games using mechanics and structure to reinforce their narrative. Dying over and over again while you work to take down a tyrant would suck! It would wear on you! I think that decision helps Absolum’s story, but I don’t think that story is strong enough, especially initially, to earn that. It doesn’t feel intentional; instead, it feels like padding out a runtime that could (and should) be much shorter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it sucks to feel that way, because so much of Absolum is so good. When it hits, it <em>hits</em>, kids. It’s beautiful, the soundtrack is wonderful, the combat has the sauce, there are cool build opportunities, and on and on it goes. But man could I have gone without the repetition. There’s a better version of this game somewhere that’s about half of the 20 or so hours it took me to see the conclusion of the main story. Unfortunately, it’s not the one we got, and if I wasn’t reviewing Absolum, I probably would have bowed out before it ever clicked. My co-op partner did, and I can’t blame him for it.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Absolum is an excellent beat ‘em up let down by a roguelite structure that doesn’t serve it. I hate being limited by numbers instead of skill in action games, and in the early hours here, it feels like you’re a slave to them. Once you get to the point where each run has you making substantial progress and the story picks up, Absolum is very compelling. But it took me a long time to get there. Gorgeous artwork, an excellent soundtrack, and smart combat spread out among several distinct characters do a lot to carry it, but they can’t fix the feeling of dread when I died, again, and realized that I would have to do some variation of the same exact thing once more. I’m not against failure; I just wish there was more variety to it, and Absolum doesn’t find that until a good way into its runtime. That it manages to emerge as an exciting beat ‘em up in spite of that is a testament to the skill and work of its developers. But it would be a lot better if it just got on with it. Unlike Absolum’s heroes, I’ve only got one life to live.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/absolum-review]]></content:encoded>

This changes the game for neural rendering: bigger ML models, less overhead, more efficiency, and far greater scalability as workloads grow.​</li><li><strong>Radiance Cores</strong> –&nbsp; A new dedicated hardware block designed for unified light transport. It handles ray tracing and path tracing in real time, pushing lighting performance to a whole new level. This lets the GPU focus on what it does best: shading the scene. The result? A cleaner, faster, and more efficient pipeline, built for the next generation of ray-traced games.​</li><li><strong>Universal Compression</strong> – A system that evaluates every piece of data headed to memory, not just textures, and compresses it wherever possible. Only the essential bytes are sent, dramatically reducing memory bandwidth usage. This means the GPU can deliver more detail, higher frame rates, and greater efficiency.​</li></ul></blockquote><p>While these technologies currently only exist in <a title="Genres > Simulation [847 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">simulation</a>, they are planned for inclusion in “a future console in a few years’ time.”</p><!-- AD: content -->

<p>The first creation from Nintendo Pictures</p>

<p>Posting on <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1976272772725923992">X</a>, Nintendo simply said, "These are the first short films created by Nintendo Pictures Co., Ltd.<br>
Nintendo Pictures will continue to explore new creative possibilities through video content". As such, it seems reasonable to assume that the videos are nothing more than that – videos.</p>
<p>So don't expect 'Close To You' to lead into some new game announcement or update, because it sounds like this was merely a one-off for Nintendo Pictures; a proof-of-concept, if you will, to demonstrate the studios talents.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We hope you enjoyed the two “Close to You” videos released on October 7 and 8.<br>
The second video is available on Nintendo Today!, a free app available on your smart device.<br>
These are the first short films created by Nintendo Pictures Co., Ltd.<br>
Nintendo Pictures will continue to explore new creative possibilities through video content."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Still, it was a nice little distraction in what has otherwise been a fairly quiet week so far. It's also a nice indication of the sort of quality we can expect from Nintendo Pictures going forward – it was really good!</p>
<p>We'd love to see a new Pikmin game, of course, but we're not expecting one anytime soon. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> was released in 2023, a whole <em>decade</em> after the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/pikmin_3">previous entry</a> on Wii U. We did recently theorise, however, that it would make for a really good Nintendo Switch 2 Edition. Make it happen, Nintendo.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced three more SNES games making their way to the Nintendo Switch Online library, and if you're looking for more opportunities to spend time with some of the most iconic platforming mascots around (and Bubsy), then this one's for you.</p>

<p>As a quick reminder, unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-online-klonoa-mr-driller" rel="nofollow">Game Boy Advance</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forsaken-64-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">N64</a> games, SNES titles are available for everyone who subscribes to Nintendo Switch Online, regardless of whether you pick up an Expansion Pack addon or not.</p>

<p>The first game being introduced to the SNES lineup for Nintendo Switch Online this month is&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Wario</em>, a puzzler that has never been released in the West before. This one, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-paint-nintendo-switch-online" rel="nofollow">like <em>Mario Paint&nbsp;</em>before it</a>, comes complete with Joy-Con 2 mouse support as well (in fact, it's required to play).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mario-and-wario-nintendo-switch-online-october-2025.jpg?itok=JcLryI_H 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mario-and-wario-nintendo-switch-online-october-2025.jpg?itok=u4v548cJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Mario &amp; Wario&nbsp;</em>is leaving Japan for the first time this month.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not in a puzzling mood, however, there are two more games being added to the Switch Online SNES lineup this month, so don't worry.</p>

<p>The first of these two is the pun-tastic&nbsp;<em>Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind</em>, a side-scrolling platformer which stars a mascot who, with the best will in the world, apparently refuses to die despite the industry's best efforts.</p>

<p>As&nbsp;<em>Bubsy&nbsp;</em>games go, this one probably isn't quite as offensive as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/bubsy-paws-on-fire-review-stop-making-bubsy-games" rel="nofollow">some of the little bobcat's other offerings</a>, which isn't a ringing endorsement, but hey - if you've exhausted all of the other Switch Online platformers, this one might kill an hour or two.</p>

<p>Finally, the last game to be added to the SNES contingent of Nintendo Switch Online this month is&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury Special</em>, a one-on-one fighter that features the cast of&nbsp;<em>Fatal Fury 2</em>, plus new fighters to get to grips with.</p>




<p>It looks as though all three of these games are available to check out via Nintendo Switch Online right now, so if you're a member and you're interested, just fire up your console and you should be able to play them all.</p>

            <p>The word choom gets on my nerves a bit, to be honest. Probably because it feels like it's said every five minutes in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. There's now a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-cyberpunk-2077-mods">mod</a> which might persuade me to reverse my stance, though. It's called Gonkle and allows the game to serve you daily Wordle-style puzzles which might improve your Cyberpunk vocabulary.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"GONKLE brings daily word puzzles to Night City," modder MisterChedda wrote of their <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/24847?tab=description">latest creation</a>, which you can find in the dairy aisle of Nexus Mods. "Every 24 hours (specifically midnight UTC), you'll get a new puzzle delivered as a text message on your phone - same word for everyone, so you can compare results with others." Yep, Wordle, but for Cyberpunk.</p>
<p>As such, the modder's made sure the terms you'll have to guess if you sign up to the in-game text service which delivers these little puzzle boxes to you daily are suitably Cyberpunk, having thumbed through the game's sourcebooks to add a bunch of universe-specific lingo to a manually-collated eligible word list. That means <a href="https://cyberpunk.fandom.com/wiki/Streetslang">streetslang</a> and jargon like chromed, eddies, ripperdoc, and of course choom can pop up as the thing you've got to guess. Gonkle'll automatically track your correct solve streak and progress auto-saves, meaning each daily puzzle will be ticked off as done across all of your saves when you complete it in just one of them.</p>

<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="GONKLE!" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fe0Qe858LhY?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>To get a bit more in-depth as to how the mod works, its application programming interface-based innards sound similar to one MisterChedda previously set up to serve <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/20381?tab=description">daily cat facts</a> in Cyberpunk. "The mod makes a single API call to fetch today's puzzle (the word, date, etc), but it doesn't send any personal data back. There's no tracking or telemetry. Your guesses, stats, and progress are saved locally on your machine," MisterChedda outlined.</p><p>"One GET request is sent to a <a href="https://misterchedda.com/api/wordle">custom API endpoint</a> I made for this mod when you open the game," they continued. "This retrieves information about today's puzzle. Nothing about you, your game, or your V leaves your computer. The mod uses an open source http client called '<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/14192">RedHttpClient</a>' to execute this, so anyone can verify the source code. The API endpoint is also open source."</p>
<p>As well as RedHttpClient, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/7780">Codeware</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/14139">RedData</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/13378">RedFileSystem</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077/mods/1511">redscript</a> are all requirements to get Gonkle up and running.</p>
<p>I'm not sure the puzzles are something that'd stay a priority in any Cyberpunk playthrough of mine once the initial novelty wears off. If nothing else they're an optional roleplaying aid for folks who go all-in on netrunning, but quickly realise the cyborg boffin they've created is far too cool to be accepted into the wider deckhead community. Deckhead, of course, being a bit of cyberslang I've accidentally ended up reminding myself of while writing about embiggening cybervocabularies. Also, an alternative netrunner term for the real world is apparently to dub it 'the meatspace', which somehow feels less appropriate to deploy in serious situations than choom.</p>

              <p>PC gaming handhelds have taken off dramatically in the last several years with the advent of the Steam Deck and then later competitive devices in the form of the Lenovo Legion Go and well as the Asus ROG Ally.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The developers of Hyper Light Breaker are ending development on the game and laying off a number of employees at the studio.</p>



<p>First reported by Game Developer, Heart Machine has confirmed its plans to wrap up the game’s development. However, they didn’t confirm how many people would be losing their jobs. </p>



<p><strong>“As we wrap up our work on&nbsp;Hyper Light Breaker, we’ve had to make the difficult decision to part ways with a number of talented team members,” </strong>a Heart Machine spokesperson <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/heart-machine-making-layoffs-and-ending-development-on-hyper-light-breaker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">told the outlet</a>. <strong>“This was not our ideal path, but rather the only one available given the circumstances.</strong></p>



<p><strong>“While this path will include a conclusion on the project, it reflects broader forces beyond our control, including shifts in funding, corporate consolidation and the uncertain environment many small studios like us are navigating today.”</strong></p>



<p>As far as that “conclusion on the project” is concerned, the studio says it still has something planned for the game in January that will be “meaningful and as polished and complete” as they can. </p>



<p><strong>“We’re doing our best to refine what we can, complete key systems, and have the game culminate in a satisfying punctuation point,” </strong>they said. <strong>“Given our limited resources with team members rolling off the project, we won’t be releasing any more updates or hosting any Q+As for the rest of this year. We want to make sure the team can focus fully on getting this next release into the best shape possible.”</strong></p>



<p>Hyper Light Breaker, a prequel to 2016’s critically acclaimed Hyper Light Drifter, launched in January 2025 in Early Access to generally mixed reviews. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a title="Companies > Square Enix [5,393 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> will release a physical edition of <em><a title="Games > Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade [22 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> &amp; Rebirth Twin Pack</em> for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,579 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> on December 4 for $59.99 / €69.99 / £59.99, the company <a href="https://twitter.com/finalfantasyvii/status/1976271756118868009" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>. <span id="more-999008"></span></p><p>Previously only available as a digital bundle, <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade &amp; Rebirth Twin Pack</em> includes both <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> and <em><a title="Games > Final Fantasy VII Rebirth [29 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a></em>.</p><p>Here is an overview of each game, via Square Enix:</p><blockquote><p><strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em></strong></p><p><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em> is the first game in the <em><a title="Games > Final Fantasy VII Remake [107 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> Trilogy</em>, and is set entirely in the city of Midgar.</p><p>This circular steel city is built on the power of mako—the planet’s lifeforce, which is processed and turned into energy by the Shinra Electric Power Company.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The story begins when mercenary Cloud Strife joins the anti-Shinra resistance group Avalanche on a mission to destroy one of their mako-siphoning reactors. It’s meant to be a one-time gig, but before long Cloud is sucked into an <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,621 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a> that puts him on a collision course with a dark figure from his past: Sephiroth.</p><p>It’s a fast-paced tale that combines action and spectacle with powerful character moments. The iconic party of Cloud, Barret, Tifa, and Aerith are portrayed in greater depth than ever before—and by the time the credits roll, you’ll love them like friends.</p><p>The action’s pretty great too though. The combat system fuses intense real-time action with menu-based commands—in other words, the exhilarating action of a modern <a title="Genres > Action [3,119 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action game</a> with the deep strategy of a <a title="Genres > Turn-Based RPG [1,320 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/turn-based-rpg">turn-based RPG</a>.</p><p>As well as the main <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em> story, the <em>Intergrade</em> edition of the game also includes “EPISODE INTERmission.” This two chapter tale takes place concurrently with the main campaign and stars fan-favorite ninja Yuffie Kisaragi.</p><p>With a new character to control, new parts of Midgar to explore and the endlessly entertaining Fort Condor minigame, it’s an essential play before you head into the next game in this pack…</p><p><strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></strong></p><p>The second game in the remake series follows Cloud and his comrades as they step out of the city of Midgar and into the wider world in pursuit of their enemy, Sephiroth.</p><p>This globe-trotting tale is full of amazing stories and unforgettable places—the war-torn region of Junon, the glitz and glamor of the Gold Saucer, the verdant forests of Gongaga and much more.</p><p>New playable party members join the team too. You’ll take control of Red XIII, Yuffie and Cait Sith, each offering new playstyles and abilities in battle. In battle, you can use new Synergy abilities that let characters team up to deliver powerful attacks.</p><p>The world of <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em> also provides plenty of diversions and opportunities for a talented mercenary. You can take on side jobs, scour the world for valuable intel, battle powerful fiends, play a few hands of the card game Queen’s Blood, become a chocobo jockey in fast-paced races, take on the many challenges of the battle simulator and much more.</p><p>In short, it’s an incredible game—there’s a reason it won more than 40 Game of the Year awards in 2024!</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-rebirth-twin-pack-ps5-physical-edition-announced]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Controversial billionaire <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1975064769729327545" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Elon Musk made a bold claim</a> this week that his xAI game studio will deliver a "great" AI-generated game by the end of 2026. The comment was soon met with a wave of criticism from industry professionals, and publishing director Michael "Cromwelp" Douse from Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian Studios didn't mince his words in response to Musk's plans.</p><p>"Genuinely, what this industry needs is not more mathematically produced, psychologically trained gameplay loops, [but] rather more expressions of worlds that folks are engaged with, or want to engage with," <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1975327370924994657" rel="nofollow ">Douse posted online</a>. "AI has its place as a tool, but we have all the tools in the world, and they aren't compensating for the incredible lack of cogent direction. AI isn't going to solve the big problem of the industry, which is leadership and vision."</p><p><a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1975328682680914329" rel="nofollow ">In a series of follow-up posts</a>, Douse explained that he believes the human factor and connecting with audiences are the keys to success. "Those who will succeed are those who are people building something for people," <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1975329606602248386" rel="nofollow ">Douse added</a>, while also decrying how the technology sector had fallen victim to "cash-grabs" led by venture capital firms. "There is no craft without the human touch; the relative skill issue, or 'the exhibition of otherness.' To turn games into digital, emotionless content is to abandon all resonance--which is why people play!"</p><p>Douse's comments echo some of the sentiments from a speech <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-ceo-weighs-in-on-the-single-player-games-are-dead-argument/1100-6530174/">given by Baldur's Gate 3 director Swen Vincke</a> during The Game Awards last year. During his time on the stage, <a href="https://youtu.be/YvRm4HKK4gQ" rel="nofollow ">Vincke spoke</a> about how the winning formula for a game was "stupidly simple" but somehow kept getting lost.</p><p>While it remains to be seen if the xAI-developed game will ever materialize, it is worth noting that Musk has a long history of overpromising and underdelivering on his projects, including plans for the high-speed Hyperloop project, self-driving cars that don't require human interaction, and landing people on Mars by 2024.</p><p>As for Larian, the studio's next project--codenamed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-says-next-game-is-codenamed-excalibur-no-idea-what-it-is-yet/1100-6523807/">Excalibur</a>-- is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-now-giving-full-attention-to-next-game-codenamed-excalibur/1100-6528758/">currently in development</a>.</p>

<p>The publisher went on to say that the anti-cheat tools in Black Ops 7's beta "adapted and improved" over time, helping to ensure "more players experience the clean matches they expect."</p><p>Activision added that it has spent years investing in and refining the anti-cheat tools to get to where things stand today, and it's not the end. The publisher said it will continue to work on improving the anti-cheat tools so that people feel can feel confident they played a clean and fair match.</p><p>"We're not done yet," Activision said.
