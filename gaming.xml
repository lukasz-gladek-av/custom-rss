            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>'s many <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oops-battlefield-6-features-revealed-by-leaked-battlefield-labs-footage">leaks</a> have earned it a bit of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deadlock-valves-new-multiplayer-shooter-now-has-a-barebones-steam-page">Deadlock-style buzz</a>, but it seems things haven't been going well behind-the-scenes. A new report from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/07/behind-the-next-battlefield-game-culture-clash-crunch-and-colossal-stakes/">Ars Technica</a> based on conversations with current and former developers details a budget that's beyond big, a campaign that's running "massively late" following a studio closure, and an unrealistic-sounding executive goal of attracting 100 million players.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to the report, the game codenamed Glacier is costing EA "well north" of $400 million, with that number being way more than any entry in series has previously commanded. The execs have their eyes set on competing with Call of Duty and Fortnite, so they've put plans in place for a single-player campaign alongside a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-rumoured-to-get-a-battle-royale-mode-as-leaker-finds-footage-of-an-exploding-dam">free-to-play battle royale element</a>, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/just-over-a-week-on-from-the-last-one-theres-a-fresh-battlefield-6-leak-here-that-shows-the-return-of-rush">classic multiplayer modes such as Rush</a> and "a community content mode" dubbed Portal all chucked into the big FPS stew.</p>
<p>That scale has reportedly also led the suits to slap Battlefield 6 with equally huge goals: "100 million players over a set period of time that included post-launch", according to one source. "Obviously, Battlefield has never achieved those numbers before," an EA employee told Ars, with another adding that "over about that same period, [Battlefield] 2042 has only gotten 22 million." <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-1">Battlefield 1</a>, believed to be the series' peak, has apparently attracted "maybe 30 million plus" in total, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-looking-to-bring-battlefield-premium-type-service-to-more-properties">shifting about 15 million copies</a> between its October 2011 launch and June 2012.</p>
<p>It'll probably not surprise you to learn, then, that "very few people" actually working on the game reportedly believe the 100 million figure is achievable, with much resting on there being "such an appetite out there for shooters of this kind that we will just naturally be able to get the audience that we need".</p>
<p>The rest of the report details the game's single-player element as running "massively late" following EA's <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ea-shuts-down-ridgeline-games">February 2024 closure of Ridgeline Games</a>, something that could lead to a massive day one patch, delayed features and/or devs being pushed extra hard to fit everything in before deadline.</p>
<p>There's also reportedly tension between staff at long-time Battlefield developers DICE in Sweden and the newer US-based leadership team EA drafted in for the series, and Ars have heard "several first-hand accounts of people working on Glacier who had to take stress or mental or exhaustion health leave, ranging from a couple of weeks to several months".</p>
<p>All in all, it doesn't sound like a game that'll be fun to get over the line. We're wishing the best to the devs on the ground working on it.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-reportedly-has-a-100-million-player-albatross-around-its-neck-and-its-single-player-is-running-massively-late]]></content:encoded>

The news has caused Ready or Not's Steam user review rating to hit "mostly negative" for recent reviews, although overall the review rating remains "very positive." Most of the negative reviews complain about "censorship." </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in a new <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1144200" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>statement</u></a>, VOID set out "full visibility" into what has, and has not, changed, including before-and-after screenshots. It insisted "the effects of gore and violence have not been toned down."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We recently shared that Ready or Not’s PC version underwent minor content changes to support stability and align with policies enforced by global platforms and age rating bodies," the statement began. "These adjustments were made to ensure a smooth global launch across platforms — while fully preserving the game’s tone, themes, and intensity. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Unfortunately, we’ve seen misconceptions and misinformation circulating around the scope of these changes. We want to ensure our entire community has full visibility into what has — and has not — changed. We’re including before-and-after visuals to show that the game’s tone, atmosphere, and graphical impact remain intact. The effects of gore and violence — key to the game’s immersive realism — have not been toned down."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">VOID stressed that missions such as Elephant, Neon Tomb, and the infamous Valley of the Dolls "remain unchanged," adding it has "always believed in creative freedom and the right to build experiences that push boundaries in the service of immersion and realism. That will not change."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"At the same time, we operate in a global ecosystem of platform standards, age rating boards, and local legal restrictions," the studio added. "While we may disagree with how some content is treated, we’ve only made changes where absolutely required, and only to the letter of the regulations — no further. As a hyper-realistic tactical FPS, Ready or Not faces different scrutiny than more stylized or fictional games. That’s a reality of the world we publish in — not a change in our creative vision or values."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Warning!</strong></em><em> Potentially distrubing images of Ready or Not follow:</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team then outlined specifically what the "six targeted visual changes" entailed: </p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Twisted Nerve: The girl is now depicted as sleeping instead of convulsing  </li><li>A Lethal Obsession: Nudity involving the ghillie suit suspect has been adjusted </li><li>Hide and Seek: Female hostages now wear underwear </li><li>Narcos: Police informant hostage now wears underwear </li><li>23 Megabytes a Second: ‘Photo of Minors’ objective model was revised, also to better connect narratively with the later ‘Sinuous Trail’ mission</li><li>Post-mortem dismemberment has been disabled (note: dismemberment for living characters remains unchanged).</li></ul><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Ready or Not Before-and-After Screenshots July 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's not about the specifics, it's a matter of principle," <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1144200/eventcomments/596279376609306968?snr=2_9_100000_#c596279376609307117" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>wrote</u></a> one respondent in the comments.

<p>Other PS5 console exclusives from Chinese developers include Lost Soul Aside and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phantom-blade-zero-aims-to-beat-black-myth-wukong-and-revive-the-golden-age-of-kung-fu-cinema">Phantom Blade Zero</a>, with the former listed as part of Sony's <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/china-hero-project/">China Hero Project</a> to boost development in the country.</p>
<p>The hugely successful <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> was also something of a PlayStation exclusive, even if unwittingly - it's set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-finally-gets-xbox-release-exactly-a-year-after-playstation">arrive on Xbox this August</a>, a year after its PS5 equivalent.</p>

<p>Where Winds Meet is an open-world action-RPG set during the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms Period of Chinese history. Its combat and aesthetics are inspired by classic Wuxia fantasy, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/where-winds-meet-brings-wuxia-to-the-west">developers aiming to bring the genre to the west</a>.</p>
<p>A final beta test for the game will take place later this month, on 25th July for players on PC (via Steam) and PS5 across the globe. <a href="https://research.easebar.com/htmls/007fb7/paper.html">Registration for access</a> is now open.</p>
<p>The test will include regions from previous tests, as well as the urban region of Kaifeng (pictured above).</p>
<p>The success of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-black-myth-wukong-has-changed-the-game-for-chinese-developers">Black Myth: Wukong has surely impacted the Chinese games industry</a>, as development has shifted towards console game releases in recent years.

<p>The thing is, eagle-eyed fans have already discovered what the new pricing structure for Nintendo Switch Online will be, since specifics have already been divulged via the Switch eShop.</p>
<p>As detailed by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/26lcooper/">26lcooper</a> over on Reddit, the new prices are as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Product</th>
<th>Previous Price (CAD)</th>
<th>New Price (CAD)</th>

<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Individual Membership - 1 month</td>

<p>As a reminder, Nintendo of Canada is also changing the price of the Switch, Switch Lite, Switch OLED, digital and physical games, accessories, and amiibo. Given that the cost of NSO memberships has gone up, we can probably expect something similar with the rest of Nintendo's product portfolio.</p>
<p>We'll be sure to update you on further price changes in Canada come 1st August 2025.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-bet-wrong-horse-subscriptions-says-analyst/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-bet-on-the-wrong-horse-with-subscriptions-says-analyst-following-latest-round-of-layoffs.1234881/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The main takeaway from the latest round of Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">layoffs</a> may well be that Xbox is losing its multi-year battle to dominate the gaming industry with Game Pass.</p>



<p>It was in October 2017's earnings call with investors that Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-ceo-game-pass-netflix-games/">told</a> the world that the company sought to replicate Netflix's success with a similar subscription service for gaming. Game Pass had launched a few months earlier, but Sadella's statement made it crystal clear that the company would go all-in with that plan.</p>



<p>To lure more users to Game Pass, Microsoft spent a lot of money acquiring new Xbox studios starting in 2018: Ninja Theory, Compulsion Games, Playground Games, Undead Labs, inXile Entertainment, Obsidian Entertainment, and, in 2019, Double Fine. All their games would launch day one on Game Pass, making it a very enticing proposition for consumers. </p>



<p>Over time, though, the Xbox division realized that this wouldn't be enough to convince dozens of millions of users to subscribe. To make a real impact, Microsoft decided to open its wallet and spend $76.2 billion in the consecutive record-breaking acquisitions of Bethesda parent company ZeniMax Media and Activision Blizzard, two of the biggest publishers in the industry. That gave them access to intellectual properties like Elder Scrolls, Fallout, DOOM, Call of Duty, Warcraft, Starcraft, and many more.</p>



<p>However, it quickly became clear that such franchises could not be confined to a single console platform, never mind a flailing one such as the Xbox. They would lose a lot of money by not putting those games on PlayStation and even Nintendo consoles. This led to the multi-platform strategy that a lot of fans have complained about lately.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Game Pass growth <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-falls-fall-short-of-microsoft-growth-targets-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stagnated</a> well below Microsoft's lofty ambitions. Despite the overtures of Xbox executives, the subscription service still isn't allowed on Sony or Nintendo platforms, and its growth on Xbox consoles has reached the point of full saturation. PC Game Pass is growing, but it's not enough to get where Microsoft wanted, and cloud gaming hasn't taken off nearly as much as originally believed.</p>



<p>To delve deeper into the causes of this failed bid from one of the tech industry leaders, we reached out to our good friend Rhys Elliott (Head of Market Analysis at <a href="https://alineaanalytics.com/">Alinea</a>), who shared with us some thoughts, chiefly that subscriptions just aren't a good fit for gaming.</p>



<p><em>Like many industries, gaming overextended itself following the black swan event that was the COVID-19 pandemic. During those difficult times, everybody was at home, interest rates were low, and engagement with – and spending on – games skyrocketed. The growth-at-all costs mindset became dangerous. Many companies thought that double-digit growth would continue, greenlighting risky projects and strategies and going on M&amp;A sprees. But the market is very different now, and many moves ultimately did not pan out. The games market has reached its maturity phase. Now, inflation rates are high, money is considerably more expensive to borrow (for consumers and companies alike), there is a cost-of-living crisis, and publishers have been forced to lay off employees and adapt to this new normal. But with Xbox, there is more at play.</em></p>



<p><em>The Xbox One was the beginning of those troubles, and Xbox has been in a constant state of recovery ever since. The Game Pass strategy was Xbox’s main remedy, but the games never arrived with the impact needed. Xbox bet on the wrong horse with subscriptions. Many proclaimed that subscriptions would become the de-facto way consumers access game content, just like Spotify, Netflix, and the like are ruling distribution in music and video. Despite companies’ best efforts, subscriptions will not be the main method of game distribution. For now, consumers – and the market – have spoken.</em></p>



<p><em>The reasoning is clear: the attention economy is already oversaturated, and consuming game content is more demanding than other mediums. A consumer can:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Listen to hundreds of tracks on Spotify each month</em></li>



<li><em>Watch dozens of movies / TV episodes</em></li>



<li><em>But the majority only has time to play a few games maximum – and that extends to even highly engaged players</em></li>
</ul>



<p><em>This is just the tip of the iceberg about why multi-game subscriptions are only worth it for the most dedicated players:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Most gamers are already served by the free-play markets</em></li>



<li><em>Others are happy to buy a few premium games a year</em></li>



<li><em>Xbox was also following that trend on console despite a recent boost from adding Call of Duty to Game Pass, the service's new baseline</em></li>



<li><em>Subscriptions with day-one launch games are good for consumers, but they cannibalise game sales on Xbox’s core platform. And stagnating growth in that strategy has led Xbox to shift its strategy towards becoming a third-party publisher.</em></li>



<li><em>Another wrinkle is that Microsoft’s acquisitions of Bethesda and Activision Blizzard were meant to reshape its gaming business. And they have – just not in the way many imagined. Xbox is now a giant publisher, with a back catalogue that includes Call of Duty, Minecraft, Elder Scrolls, Fallout and many more. But the division is in flux, caught between its historic role as a console platform and a future that is increasingly platform-agnostic – third party. Whether this results in a more successful Xbox, or simply a more diluted one, remains to be seen. But I am not optimistic, truthfully. The Xbox of old is fading, and it’s sadly come with casualties. Too many casualties.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>There's little doubt that Game Pass has so far failed to be as relevant as Microsoft had hoped. There are just too many games on the market, and more and more of those games are continuing to get content for years after launch, stealing attention away from the new titles. There just isn't enough time to play all this content. Quality, not quantity, will win and get away with increasing premium prices. But let's face it, Microsoft never really managed to shine with quality games.</p>



<p>That is not to say Xbox is dead, but as others have noted, Xbox as we knew it is certainly dead, and its Game Pass push hasn't gone well enough to meet estimates. Furthermore, it was Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer who <a href="https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-championed-game-pass-even-against-his-own-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">championed</a> Game Pass at all costs, even against internal concerns. However, despite rumors to the contrary, it doesn't appear that he'll be <a href="https://wccftech.com/phil-spencer-retire-following-next-gen-xbox-launch/">retiring</a> from his position any time soon.</p>

        <p>All three receive suspended sentences</p>

            <p>Three former higher-ups at Ubisoft have been found guilty of sexually and psychologically harassing the women who worked for them at the company's Paris studio. A French court handed out suspended sentences to the three executives, as well as fines, the highest of which was €45,000. It's the final ruling in a sordid trial that has seen the men accused of forcefully trying to kiss female employees, ordering them to do handstands in skirts, and angrily throwing equipment across the office. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>Former editorial vice-president Thomas François was found guilty of sexual harassment, psychological harassment and an attempted sexual assault, as reported in <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/jul/02/three-ubisoft-video-game-chiefs-guilty-enabling-culture-sexual-harassment">The Guardian</a>. The court handed him a three-year suspended prison sentence, and a €30,000 fine for the crimes. </p>
<p>François was accused of tying a woman to an office chair with a roll of tape and pushing her into an elevator. Another woman told the court how she was forced to do handstands when she came to work in a miniskirt. </p>
<p>"He was my superior and I was afraid of him," she said. "He made me do handstands. I did it to get it over with and get rid of him."</p>
<p>At a themed Christmas party in 2015, François said he liked a female co-worker's 1950s style dress, then allegedly tried to kiss her on the mouth as his colleagues restrained her. During the trial, François put much of his behaviour down to a "culture of joking around". Another Ubisoft staff member put it differently, calling the culture at the studio a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-boys-club-above-the-law-former-ubisoft-execs-in-court-for-alleged-sexual-harassment-and-abuse">"boys' club above the law"</a>.</p>
<p>At the same trial, Serge Hascoët, former chief creative officer at Ubisoft was found guilty of  psychological harassment and complicity in sexual harassment, although he was ultimately acquitted of the charge of sexual harassment itself. He got an 18-month suspended prison sentence and a €45,000 fine. </p>
<p>The court heard that Hascoët's alleged bullying behaviour includes ordering assistants to do personal tasks unrelated to their jobs, such as going to his house to collect parcel deliveries. The court heard how he once blew his nose into a tissue and handed it to a young woman working for the studio. "You can resell it," he allegedly told her, "it’s worth gold at Ubisoft." Hascoët's lawyer said that the former Ubisoft chief is considering an appeal. </p>
<p>Meanwhile Guillaume Patrux, a former game director, was found guilty of psychological harassment. He got a 12-month suspended sentence, alongside a fine of €10,000. Patrux was accused of a variety of harassing behaviour which includes drawing swastikas on a woman's notebook during a meeting, throwing office equipment around, cracking a whip near colleagues faces, and holding a cigarette lighter so close to a male employee's face that his beard caught alight. All three men had denied the charges.</p>
<p>The trial's verdict brings some level of justice to those women, although many complaints which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-vow-to-investigate-allegations-of-sexual-harrassment-and-abuse">surfaced back in 2020</a> have not necessarily been addressed. Back then Ubisoft responded to an outpouring of allegations that overwhelmed the company, saying that they would investigate those stories. When these and other allegations came up throughout Ubisoft's worldwide studios, some workers reported that HR had been informed, yet nothing ever happened. In the end it took the force of France's policing and legal system to do anything about it, following <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-ubisoft-executives-taken-into-custody-over-sexual-abuse-claims-according-to-reports">the arrests in 2023</a> of the above accused and two other workers. We've asked Ubisoft for their comment on the verdict.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/three-former-ubisoft-execs-found-guilty-of-sexual-and-psychological-harassment]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Glum is not your usual game protagonist. He has no chiselled jaw, no artfully coiffure ‘do and absolutely zero charisma. In fact, he’s a completely unlikeable stinky little goblin, which paradoxically makes him charming in his own way. What he does have, though, is the kind of feet that not even the darkest parts of the internet would pay to take a look at. It is fortunate that quite early in the game you’ll find a boot to cover up the offending appendages, as you’ll be spending a lot of time staring at that foot.</p>
<p><iframe title="GLUM | Official Early Access Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QRQDbVo5oJQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Glum begins with the titular ‘hero’ locked up in a barracks. Your first task is to find a way to escape and this takes the form of a well designed tutorial. You learn how to kick objects, obviously, but also how to use kicks to jump higher and even chain jumps together. As you progress you’ll also find a magical boot that you can fire off to reach distant objects and enemies. You’re not entirely restricted to kicking, however, as you can pick up some objects and carry them so that you can, well, kick them at things. Look, kicking is what this game is about, OK?</p>


<p>The world of Glum is bright and colourful and feels like it’s been taken straight out of a Shrek film. You’ll face hordes of armoured knights and archers, all just needing a swift kick in the face to conquer. Combat is made more interesting by the vast numbers of hazards scattered around the environment, from fires to iron maidens. Kicking foes into these reminds me a lot of the classic <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/06/bulletstorm-full-clip-edition-review/">Bulletstorm</a>, with obvious nods to the grandfather of kicking games, Dark Messiah of Might and Magic.</p>


<p>As an Early Access title, Glum currently offers one major level to explore, as well as the tutorial area. This might not sound like much, but the map is fairly large and has a decent amount of hidden areas and secrets. As well as the core objective (in this case ringing bells to disturb the local commander) there are gnomes to smash and – <em>ahem – </em>&nbsp;mature magazines to track down. These unlock extra boots and abilities respectively and this looks to be one of the biggest areas of potential in the game with skills that can change the way you play hopefully added as development progresses. Finding these hidden items adds a welcome amount of depth and replayability.</p>
<p>Gnomes can be tracked down by listening out for their sinister little chuckles whilst the jazz mags are either hidden away behind intricate platforming sections or rewards for sidequests. These sidequests are appropriately bizarre, too, with highlights being kicking rats into a sentient campfire or feeding a chicken to a mysterious creature in a well. I don’t think Glum will be getting any PETA recommendations to be honest.</p>

<p>Once you’ve finished the main questline of the level you get to face a wonderfully ludicrous boss battle that would be a shame to spoil. This encounter requires that you use all of your abilities to triumph and is a good demonstration of what the full game will hopefully offer. Once you’ve cleared the narrative part of the game there is an arena mode to enjoy, but an update killed my save so this wasn’t unlocked for me to try out.</p>
<p>This latter point is core to the Early Access experience. If you like the sound of Glum and want to support the devs as they bring it to completion then it’s well worth the price, but there can be snagging issues along the way. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2235550/view/544485372295381678">A roadmap has been outlined</a> by CinderCat Games, with a festive clown-filled level, another arena mode, building up to a Halloween level this autumn.</p>
<p>It’s always important to know what you’re signing up for. In Glum’s case, I think there’s plenty of fun to be had in its current form and I will definitely be going back in for more once the extra levels are added.</p>

From Retro Fighters, the <strong>BattleDock</strong> essentially turns your Switch 2 into a functional GameCube (well, <em>sort of</em>) with the inclusion of four ports for wired GameCube controllers.</p>
<p>To be clear, this isn't a replacement for your official dock, but rather an extension. So, according to the details on the Kickstarter page, your official dock simply slides into the BattleDock (dock-ception!) and is then connected via USB-C.</p><div><figure data-videoid="FHjNdrGk2jw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FHjNdrGk2jw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FHjNdrGk2jw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FHjNdrGk2jw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4052a3lqgwrt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FHjNdrGk2jw" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The priority here is low-latency compatibility with GameCube controllers for competitive play, with the pads fully supported with titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a>.</p>
<p>Included with the BattleDock are four magnetic covers to give it some personality. As standard, you get Spice Orange, Indigo, Jet Black, and Platinum Silver (though the Spice Orange variant is way more yellow than it is orange, in our opinion), but a stretch goal at $100K will also include Smoke Black, White, and Comet Red.</p>
<p>The campaign will be fully funded at $10K, and each BattleDock costs <strong>$36</strong> for backers (MSRP is set at $39.99). You can sign up now to be notified of its launch if you're interested in giving it your support.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074">petition to the UK government by the Stop Killing Games initiative</a> has passed the 100,000 signatures threshold to be considered for a debate in parliament. <a href="https://eci.ec.europa.eu/045/public/#/screen/home">A similar petition in the European Citizens’ Initiative</a> is also nearing its 1 million signature threshold to be considered by the European Commission.</p>
<p>The UK government already responded to the petition after it passed the 10,000 signature threshold in February, saying “We are aware of issues relating to the life-span of digital content, including video games, and we appreciate the concerns of players of some games that have been discontinued. We have no plans to amend existing consumer law on digital obsolescence, but we will monitor this issue and consider the relevant work of the Competition and Market Authority (CMA) on consumer rights and consumer detriment.”</p>


<p>However, a debate in parliament is always good, and UK residents will be able to have their voices heard on the matter through their local MP – if this matters to you, then firstly the petition remains open until 14th July to add your signature and receive notifications, and you should try to get in touch with your MP to add weight to this argument. EU residents have until 31st July to help this petition cross the line.</p>
<p>Stop Killing Games is a consumer movement that came into being <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/14/the-original-the-crew-is-going-offline-in-march-2024/">after Ubisoft’s announced shutdown of The Crew’s online servers last year</a>, arguing that many modern games “are sold effectively as goods – with no stated expiration date – but designed to be completely unplayable as soon as support from the publisher ends.”</p>

<p>In the interests of game preservation and of simply letting people continue to play the games that they have paid for, SKG hopes to petition lawmakers to implement rules to prevent publishers from effectively killing games. This is not a call to for publishers to support games and host servers indefinitely, or even to release source code,&nbsp;but rather to provide an end-of-life plan for titles with core online components that ensure that the game remains playable in some state. In SKG’s proposal, this would still enable subscription-based games, MMORPGs, free-to-play titles and the many business models and styles of game that publishers have created, and existing games would not be affected, but plans would need to be put in place for future games to have this end-of-life version to ensure an offline mode.</p>
<p>For more on this, and the various edge cases and counterarguments that have to be catered to, please see <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/faq">the Stop Killing Games FAQ</a>, because <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIfRLujXtUo">there’s some frankly bizarre and prehaps wilfully misconstrued pushback</a> which was recently addressed by SKG’s founder Ross Scott – this video arguably spurred these two petitions on to some semblance of plausibility.</p>
<p>And the thing is, we already have a practical example of how this is possible for publishers to do in the modern games industry, let alone with historical examples. Following the public backlash to The Crew’s server shutdown, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/11/the-crew-motorfest-and-the-crew-2-are-both-getting-offline-modes/">Ubisoft pledged to update both The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorsport to ensure that they have offline modes</a>, ready for whenever it is that the online servers are shutdown. While multiplayer is a key component in these games, they can also be played as purely single player experiences.</p>
<p>There’s further examples, such as Gran Turismo Sport having online-only progression at launch, but Polyphony <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/29/gran-turismo-sport-server-shutdown-confirmed-for-january-2024/">switching this to local progression for single player for the server shutdown</a>. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/03/knockout-city-is-shutting-down-but-a-pc-private-servers-will-help-it-live-on/">Velan Studios made Knockout City private servers available</a> to the public, and more.</p>
<p>This should be the default course of action for companies to take, and we would encourage you to sign and follow these petitions, if you’re in the UK or EU.</p>

            <p>Hey, deez two. Sorry, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a> has just gotten a fresh patch following on from its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2s-new-update-adds-in-more-weapon-variations-boss-challenges-and-oh-no-a-really-hot-portrait-for-narcissus">beefy Unseen update</a> last month. The big news? Supergiant say this latest batch of tweaks "will likely be our final patch before our v1.0 launch".</p>
<p>Damn, maybe it's time for me to dive back in and get some extra practice taking down those pesky sirens that try to smite you mid-gig like they're aquatic Van Halen. Ok, maybe I actually mean fire the game back up to stare at Narcissus. Sue me.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/512962085601150265">Patch 10</a> largely consists of tweaks to the stuff added in by the Unseen update, as well as some handy general fixes. That said, the most noteworthy aspect of its notes is Supergiant revealing: "We'll keep monitoring your feedback, though this will likely be our final patch before our v1.0 launch, whenever that will be!"</p>
<p>So, still no full release date for the godly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> yet, but further confirmation that we're getting perilously close to its emergence from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-early-access-review">early access</a>, which'll see Melinoë's story get its "true ending".</p>
<p>Anyway, to help tide you over, let's get into the highlights of this patch. Supergiant have reduced the chance of "successive attacks causing you to become 'stun-locked'", as well as making sure any temporary armour you've got from the likes of Hephaestus' Security System is chipped down by damage before it starts affecting your regular protection.</p>
<p>Several of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nocturnal">Nocturnal</a> Arms and their aspects have been boosted up or tuned down. The Sister Blades' omega attack is now uninterruptible by enemies and the Umbral Flames' omega special projectiles do more damage, but orbit more slowly. The Argent Skull's omega special wave projectiles don't stagger folks anymore, and the Black Coat has had several aspects of it buffed.</p>
<p>Patch 9's Oath of the Unseen looks to have been rendered a bit more difficult via tweaks to the Vow of Frenzy and Vow of Scars, with the former drafting in fresh foes more quickly and the latter now reducing your recovery as intended.</p>
<p>Other changes affect everyuthing from boons, to Daedalus Hammer upgrades, and hexes. One other fix that's caught my eye ensures that "Heracles no longer sometimes ominously just stands around after his encounters". Maybe he's just been waiting for news on that full launch date, Supergiant. </p>
<p>Right, now everyone disperse promptly. We can't just ominously linger, Hades 2's devs might start digging into our code.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2s-latest-patch-is-likely-the-last-one-before-it-emerges-from-the-early-access-underworld]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> won't be retiring from his position at Xbox "anytime soon".</p>
<p>Yesterday, Microsoft announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">swathes of layoffs across the entire company</a>, including its gaming division. The likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">Everwild</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">Perfect Dark and a new Zenimax MMORPG</a> have been cancelled in the process.</p>
<p>However, Spencer - Microsoft Gaming CEO - will remain at the company for now. In a statement to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696922/phil-spencer-xbox-microsoft-gaming-retiring">The Verge</a>, head of Xbox communications Kari Perez said: "Phil is not retiring anytime soon."</p>
<p>The news followed a rumour on social media suggesting Spencer would be retiring after the launch of the next generation Xbox, with Xbox president Sarah Bond set to take over. This is now confirmed to be false.</p>
<p>Spencer has led Xbox since 2014, and was promoted to Microsoft Gaming CEO in 2022. As such, he's overseen the company from the Xbox One years, including its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a> and numerous rounds of layoffs.</p>
<p>"I recognise that these changes come at a time when we have more players, games, and gaming hours than ever before," wrote Spencer in a statement confirming the layoffs yesterday.</p>
<p>"Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we're seeing currently is based on tough decisions we've made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritise the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come."</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-says-hes-stopped-trying-to-move-all-players-over-to-xbox">Spencer discussed the decision to publish Xbox games on competitor systems</a>. "I'm not trying to move them all over to Xbox anymore," he said at the time. "We're all so invested in where our games are, let's just allow more people to play. And yes, the 70 percent that we make on games on other platforms is helpful to us being able to build great portfolios, like we showed at Developer Direct, and I hope this will continue to show through the rest of the year."</p>
<p>Last year in an interview, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ive-made-some-of-the-worst-game-choice-decisions-says-xbox-boss-phil-spencer">Spencer joked he'd made "some of the worst game-choice decisions"</a>, in terms of turning down some successful projects such as Destiny and Guitar Hero.</p>
<p>"I'm not a regrets-type person," Spencer said. "Maybe that's a fault of mine, but I passed on so many games. I could look back and say-," he clenches his fist, "-but no, I try to look forward and be positive about the things that we are doing."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-microsoft-gaming-ceo-not-retiring-from-xbox-anytime-soon]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Blizzard has announced that WarCraft Rumble will not be getting anymore new content, though there will still be support to address bugs and in game events. While it is not explicitly stated, this move could be another fallout from the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/02/microsoft-confirms-mass-layoffs-across-xbox-gaming-and-all-its-divisions/">mass layoffs affecting all divisions</a> that Microsoft enacted yesterday. The biggest hits of that was the closure of The Initiative and the cancellations of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/02/perfect-dark-everwild-cancelled-by-xbox-the-initiative-shutdown-rare-turn-10-affected/">Perfect Dark.</a> Everwild has also cancelled and there have been layoffs at Rare, Turn 10, and Halo Studios too.</p>

<p>In a statement, Blizzard said,<em> “We have an important update on the future of Warcraft Rumble. After much deliberation, we’ve arrived at an extremely hard decision. Moving forward, we’ll continue supporting Rumble with updates focused on regular, systemic in-game events and bug fixes, but no new content.  </em></p>
<p><em>Warcraft Rumble began development nine years ago as a love letter to Azeroth and launched back in 2023, reflecting input from enthusiastic players around the globe and the effort of a passionate team—some of whom continue to support Rumble or other Blizzard games, and some we’ve had to sadly part ways with. Since launch, Rumble has struggled to find its footing relative to our ambition for its long-term success, and for some time now the team has been listening to player feedback, refocusing in certain areas, and exploring different options. Some of that work showed signs of progress, but ultimately wasn’t enough to put the game on a path to sustainability.  </em></p>
<p><em>During this transition, we are focused on supporting our teammates. We’re deeply grateful to everyone at Blizzard and in the community for helping bring Warcraft Rumble to life and embracing the joy that makes this game so special. Your enthusiasm and feedback mean the world to us.”</em></p>

<p>The Microsoft job cuts yesterday lead to 9,000 people losing their jobs across the company. We hope everyone impacted is able to find new roles soon. If you have been affected check out<a href="https://gamejobs.co/">&nbsp;GameJobs.co</a> for roles available in game dev.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Tensions are very high among Xbox developers after the latest round of Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs</a>, which appears to have removed hundreds of jobs across the whole gaming division. The Initiative and its Perfect Dark reboot <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">are no more</a>; ZeniMax Online's upcoming MMORPG, Project Blackbird, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">canceled</a>, and the studio founder left; Rare's new IP, Everwild, was also <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">canceled</a>, and veteran Gregg Mayles also left; and Turn 10 also saw the majority of its employees <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-motorsport-developer-turn-10-hit-hard-layoffs/">fired</a>.</p>



<p>But it does not stop there. Engadget has <a href="https://www.engadget.com/gaming/xbox/even-before-the-xbox-layoffs-there-was-tension-at-halo-studios-002031995.html?guccounter=1">reported</a> that five employees were also cut from Halo Studios. Furthermore, the report doesn't paint a favorable picture of both Microsoft's overall plans for gaming and the progress of future Halo projects.</p>



<p>The anonymous source understandably expressed contempt for Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer's internal memo, which the executive started with the reminder that Xbox is registering record numbers when it comes to users, games, and gaming hours.</p>



<p><em>I'm personally super pissed that Phil's email to us bragged about how this was the most profitable year ever for Xbox in the same breath as pulling the lever. I wasn't sure what part of that I was supposed to be proud about.</em></p>



<p>The source also said that Halo Studios is now working with contracted studios across the United States and Europe, which they didn't really like.</p>



<p><em>Xbox in general feels years behind the curve in game development, and it leads to a lot of wasted time and effort.</em></p>



<p>The kicker came when they shared the impression that Microsoft is trying to replace as many human jobs as possible with AI.</p>



<p><em>They're trying their damndest to replace as many jobs as they can with AI agents.</em></p>



<p>It is no secret that Microsoft has invested heavily in AI, and this very possibility has been dreaded for years. Whether it's actually the case remains to be seen, but it's certainly a worrying report.</p>



<p>Lastly, the anonymous source wasn't confident that one of the Halo projects currently in the works will meet the expected standard of quality:</p>



<p><em>I don't think anybody is really happy about the quality of the product right now. There's been a lot of tension and pep talks trying to rally folks to ship.</em></p>



<p>Just two days ago, Halo Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-studios-whats-next-for-halo-halowc-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> a reveal for their next project coming at the HaloWC 2025 event, which will take place in October. Needless to say, they cannot afford another blunder after Halo Infinite, else they might find themselves in the same position as Turn 10 - or even The Initiative - after the next Microsoft review.</p>

            <p>Edwin gave <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2549930/Ostrich_Farm/">Ostrich Farm</a> header honours in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-mecha-break-ice-protest-charity-bundles-and-vibrant-ostrich-farming">this week's Maw</a>, and with good reason I think. "Breed vibrant ostriches", he wrote. I misread it as "breed violent ostriches" and got excited. I still liked the concept even after realising my mistake. I pinned the Steam page tab (aka "The Coward's Wishlist"), and forgot about it for a couple of days.</p>
<p>This morning, I clicked on the tab again while browser tidying. "I wonder how Steam likes the ostrich game?", I mused. One review. A single, negative review. "The performance tanked for me once I had around 70 ostriches and made the game totally unplayable".</p>

<p>I have questions, but I'm mostly just now more intrigued about the true nature of the ostrich game. Is this a normal quantity of ostriches to have in Ostrich Farm, or did the player implement some sort of rampant Muskoid breeding schedule? The maximum number of ostriches shown in a screenshot is 42 ostriches. It does not seem unreasonable to ask for 28 more.</p>
<p>I picture a single vibrant plume fluttering down to land on a fried motherboard, the air alight with dust-mote delicate feather fragments and the smell of singed components. How many ostriches must someone have before their world collapses in on itself, is not a line from Blowin' In The Wind but probably should have been.</p>
<p>I cannot rightfully say that the ostrich game deserves better because I haven't played it yet. One may argue that an ostrich game that cannot bear the weight of 70 ostriches has no right calling itself an ostrich game in the first place. Still, I feel many of the world's problems could be solved if more people realised that if 60 ostriches do not bring one happiness, it's very likely the extra ten ostriches will not improve the situation.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-performance-tanked-for-me-once-i-had-around-70-ostriches-is-my-new-favourite-negative-steam-review-of-all-time]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Toys! Small toys shaped like things I know from videogames! With rules so I can make them fight each other! Again!  <a href="https://monsterfightclub.com/pages/the-witcher-no-mans-land">The Witcher: No Man's Land</a> is a miniatures skirmish game set (I assume since Letho is still palling around with Nilfgaard) somewhere around <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-2-assassins-of-kings">The Witcher 2: Assassins Of Kings</a>.</p>
<p>There's a <a href="https://monsterfightclub.com/pages/the-witcher-no-mans-land">starter set</a> out later this year with Geralt, Letho, a Griffin, a Striga, and some mates. It uses some of the same models from Cyberpunk publisher R. Talsarion's Witcher <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, so you can <a href="https://monsterfightclub.com/collections/witcher">peruse or pick up a few of these already</a>. I would recommend waiting if you're tempted, though. Starter sets generally come with a chunky discount over buying models individually, and you'll get the extra bits like cards that you need to play the game.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>For the blissfully uninitiated, skirmish games are effectively very small tabletop wargames. You only need a handful of models instead of dozens, and this focus usually means that the rules are more characterful and snappy. Personal faves include <a href="https://ttcombat.com/collections/carnevale">Carnevale</a> (Lovecraftian Venice with drunk Pulcinellas riding ostriches) and <a href="https://shop.moonstonethegame.com/">Moonstone</a> (Brian Froud-ian folklore weirdos and fairyfolk).</p>
<p>On the subject of snappiness, The Witcher: No Man's Land has one of my favourite miniature games rules, namely counterattacks. If you've ever had fun with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-darktide">Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-rogue-trader">Rogue Trader</a>, know that the 40K tabletop equivalent here is waiting for whoever rolled the highest number to shoot at you for 45 minutes before you get to do anything (I'm simplifying, but that's the gist). In No Man's Land, you've got a reaction system where you can counter wounds your opponent inflicts with your own attacks and abilities, or just run off.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Monster Fight Club</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I also just really like these models, especially that elfy alchemist. Lotsa character. Slightly goofy and exaggerated. but not too much.</p>
<p>It also sounds like there's both co-op and PvPvE options with the monsters, which feels nicely thematic. The game controls the creatures, so you might get a rampaging griffon interrupting your duels, things like that. No exact release date or price on this yet, but you can sign up on the website to stay up to date. Monster Fight Club also make some Cyberpunk skirmishers that reviewed quite well. I'm oddly charmed by <a href="https://monsterfightclub.com/products/combat-zone">the miniature Arasaka crate in this one</a>, for some reason.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ease-the-witcher-4-wait-with-tiny-plastic-geralt-in-a-new-skirmish-miniatures-game]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Two key parts of the creative team on HBO’s The Last of Us TV series have stepped away from the production ahead of Season 3. Neil Druckmann is leaving to focus on his work at Naughty Dog and on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/13/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-naughty-dogs-next-big-game/">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, while the Last of Us Part 2 co-writer Halley Gross is also leaving the writer’s room.</p>
<p>Druckmann writes on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/druckmann/p/DLnTt7ZPVbJ/">social media</a>:</p>


<p><em>“I’ve made the difficult decision to step away from my creative involvement in The Last of Us on HBO. With work completed on season 2 and before any meaningful work starts on season 3, now is the right time for me to transition my complete focus to Naughty Dog and its future projects, including writing and directing our exciting next game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, along with my responsibilities as Studio Head and Head of Creative. </em></p>
<p><em>“Co-creating the show has been a career highlight. It’s been an honor to work alongside Craig Mazin to executive produce, direct and write on the last two seasons. I’m deeply thankful for the thoughtful approach and dedication the talented cast and crew took to adapting The Last of Us Part I and the continued adaptation of The Last of Us Part II.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLnVeDnPz9B/">Gross says</a>:</p>

<p><em>“With great care and consideration, I’ve decided to take a step back from my day-to-day work on HBO’s The Last of Us to make space for what comes next. I’m so appreciative of how special this experience has been. Working alongside Neil, Craig, HBO, and this remarkable cast and crew has been life changing. The stories we told – about love, loss, and what it means to be human in a terrifying world&nbsp;are exactly why I love this franchise.</em></p>
<p><em>“I have some truly rad projects ahead that I can’t wait to share, but for now, I want to express my gratitude to everyone who brought Ellie and Joel’s world to life with such care.”</em></p>
<p>This leaves the show entirely in the hands of Craig Mazin to produce, direct and lead the writing of the last two seasons of the show. He had already shouldered the bulk of the adaptation through the first two seasons of The Last of Us, the sole writer on 11 of the 16 episodes released so far, with Druckmann writing one himself, and broader collaborations for the Season 1 opening and finale, and the final two episodes of Season 2.</p>
<p>The announcement has left viewers and fans of the game and show a bit unsure of how to feel. Similar to The Last of Us Part II as a video game, the narrative direction that featured in Season 2 of the TV series was less universally beloved than the first, but beyond still controversial narrative choices, it also had to contend with telling only a part of the second game’s story. In general, many are happy that Druckmann is able to focus his efforts on the Intergalactic, but there’s less consensus over Mazin’s adaptation of the second game.</p>
<p>Anyway, we’ll just have to wait and see.</p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.instagram.com/druckmann/p/DLnTt7ZPVbJ/">Neill Druckmann</a>, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLnVeDnPz9B/">Halley Gross</a> via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/neil-druckmann-halley-gross-stepping-away-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-druckmann-focusing-on-naughty-dog-intergalactic.1234278/">Resetera</a></em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696676/microsoft-forza-motorsport-turn-10-studios-layoffs-xbox-cuts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">report</a> by The Verge, Forza Motorsport developer Turn 10 Studios was among those hit the hardest in the latest <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive round of Microsoft layoffs</a>. </p>



<p>The sources cited by the publication suggest the 'majority' of the employees were fired. The number given was more than 70. As a result, the remaining employees would be just enough to continue supporting the latest Forza Motorsport game, which launched in October 2023 to positive critic reviews. Our own Chris Wray <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-motorsport-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a> at the time:</p>



<p><em>While Forza Motorsport is a good game with more than enough things going for it, there's something that just isn't that exciting. Forza Motorsport is a good game, and it's a return to form for the core Forza series - one that seriously faltered while the Horizon spinoff went from strength to strength. If, for an odd reason, you have yet to pick this up on Game Pass (or otherwise), then take this as a recommendation. Forza Motorsport is a very good racing game, a return to form for the series, and a good sign for the future of the series.</em></p>



<p>However, long-time fans did not share the same enthusiasm as critics did. The aforementioned lack of content and the RPG-like car progression system were highly criticized. While Microsoft never shared player figures, it is widely believed that the game did not meet sales expectations.</p>



<p>Needless to say, Xbox fans might be wondering where this leaves the future of such a core Xbox franchise like Forza Motorsport. Will Microsoft bring in new hires to work on a new project, and if so, how long will it take? These are just two more questions among a veritable sea of doubts and concerns sparked by the latest Xbox cuts.</p>

You, as a surviving “Meta,” must fight to survive across a vast 256 km² seamless map.

<p>DK...Donkey Kong!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We're now just weeks out from the smashing arrival of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> on the Switch 2 and Nintendo has now released a overview trailer.</p>
<p>It uploaded plenty of these in the leadup to key releases during the Switch generation and this trend continues with eight minutes of footage for the new Switch 2 exclusive. It highlights DK and Pauline's abilities, transformations, boss battles, and much more.</p>
<p>Just keep in mind this overview is only available on Nintendo's Japanese YouTube channel at the moment but if we get an English version, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Earlier this week we also shared our final preview of Donkey Kong Bananza here on Nintendo Life, and despite some minor technical concerns, his latest adventure is showing all the signs of becoming his greatest outing to date. The game's developer has been confirmed as well.</p>

<p>Fingers crossed</p>

<p>Bandai Namco ended its latest showcase with another look at <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/digimon_story_time_stranger">Digimon Story: Time Stranger</a></strong>. If you were wondering about the possibility of a Nintendo release, there's reportedly been a new development.</p>
<p>As highlighted by multiple sources, a new listing has popped up on the EAN database in Europe which includes a code for an apparent "Switch 2 version". These codes are used by retailers to identify products at sale.</p>

<p>Nothing has been officially announced, so it's probably best to treat this one as a rumour for now. In saying this, Bandai Namco has already got games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/shadow-labyrinth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Shadow Labyrinth</a> coming to the Switch 2, so it wouldn't be the biggest surprise.</p>
<p>The Switch generation also saw multiple Digimon games released physically and digitally. Digimon Story: Time Stranger is currently confirmed for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S and Steam, and will launch on these platforms in October.</p>
