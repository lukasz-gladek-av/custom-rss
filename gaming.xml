<p>A new comic book one-shot inspired by the immensely popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=marvel+rivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> game, titled Marvel Rivals: Ignite #1, is coming to comic book shops this summer. The series features stories from some incredible Japanese comic book artists, including some who’s character designs have already appeared in-game.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-ignite-first-of-likely-many-game-inspired-comics">Marvel Rivals: Ignite First of Likely Many Game-Inspired Comics</h2>



<p>Marvel <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/marvel-rivals-ignite-new-comic-book-series-variant-covers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> today that Marvel Rivals: Ignite #1 will feature a trio of stories from comic book artists Peach Momoko, Yuji Kaku, Mitsuyasu Sakai and Ryusei Yamada. Each of the three stories will feature two playable characters doing head-to-head. Sai (Psylocke) will take on Venom, Luna Snow will travel to Asgard to face Hela, and Punisher goes “face-to-face” with Peni Parker.</p>



<p>Momoko, who is authoring and drawing the Venom vs. Sai story, became a popular face in the comic book world though her own “Momoko-verse,” where she reimagined various Marvel characters through the lens of Japanese folktales. She’s currently writing the Ultimate X-Men series, but she’s contributed designs for in-game Peni Parker and Spider-Man skins based on her own unique style. It’s possible these skin designs of hers eventually launch in-game around June 11th, when Marvel Rivals: Ignite hits stores. Today’s announcement says that “Momoko’s new wave of in-game costumes take center stage” in Marvel Rivals: Ignite #1.</p>







<p>Manga artist Yuji Kaku is writing and drawing the Punisher vs. Peni Parker story. Kaku has only contributed to a couple of Marvel projects recently, but is famous for penning the Hell’s Paradise: Jigokuraku manga, which was adapted into an anime in 2023. Finally, writer Mitsuyasu Sakai and artist Ryusei Yamada will take on the story featuring Luna Snow and Hela. Sakai has written scripts for Japanese animation for nearly 30 years, including the episode “The Duel” from the Star Wars: Visions series. Ryusei Yamada adapted the anime REVENGER into a manga series in 2023.</p>



<p>Today’s announcement from Marvel implies that more one-shots inspired by Marvel Rivals could hit comic book stores in the future. Will you be heading to the comic book shop to pick up Marvel Rivals: Ignite #1 on June 11th?

There’s 3D audio, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keyboard and mouse control support includes new control customization options, including full control remapping, primary and secondary bindings for keyboard and mouse control, and an adaptive mode that allows players to combine keyboard and controller inputs. There’s full gamepad support, while DualSense controllers feature full haptic feedback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The Last of Us Part II Remastered on PC offers a wide range of graphics settings and presets, to ensure the best possible experience on hardware ranging from high-end PCs to handheld gaming devices,” Sony said.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Last of Us Part 2 PC specs:</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/20/tlou-specs-1742492089994.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">TLOU 2 Remastered PC specs. Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving on to No Return mode, two new characters are being added: The Last of Us Part I’s Bill and Marlene.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb from Sony:</p><blockquote>Like with each No Return combatant, these characters offer their own unique playstyles, and should offer both new and returning fans an exciting new opportunity to test their mettle. Bill is a “Smuggler” playstyle who can access a custom pump shotgun from dead drops, and receives double rewards from drops as well. He’s stronger against melee attacks but can’t dodge. Marlene, meanwhile, features a “Risk Taker” playstyle that includes a Custom Assault Rifle, “All or Nothing” gambits, can reroute her No Return path once per run, and more.</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/20/54393525277-2ff5b3926b-o-1742492128554.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">New characters are coming to No Return mode. Image credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Four new maps are coming to No Return, too.</p><blockquote>Overlook, which is set high above the city of Seattle and features plenty of verticality, is the memorable site of a Seraphites encounter in the campaign. School is, during the campaign, the abandoned elementary school in which Ellie and Dina face off against the W.L.F. Streets is set in the overgrown Seattle neighborhood of Hillcrest, while Nest will be familiar to players who have played as Abby through an Infected-infested building. We’ve been so overjoyed about the reaction to this mode since Part II Remastered debuted on PS5 last year, and we hope these new maps further offer more variability and thrills as players tackle new runs.</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/20/54396469192-cc5a754825-h-1742492165310.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">No Return is set for four new maps.

But if you do log in to PSN, you get PlayStation overlay and PSN Trophies. As an extra incentive, Sony said those who sign in with their PSN account also get access to 50 in-game points to activate bonus features, as well as a new skin for Ellie featuring Jordan A. Mun’s jacket from Naughty Dog’s new PS5 game, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/20/54394636943-89001e0b8f-o-1742492213413.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Ellie has a new skin featuring Jordan A.

It’s included in the 2.0 patch and unlockable via in-game bonus points.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, The Last of Us director Neil Druckmann shared more details about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet"><u>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</u></a>. In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJUab499PVA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>interview</u></a> with Alex Garland, the writer of zombie movie 28 Days Later, Druckmann talked candidly about the development process, confirming Intergalactic has been in the works for four years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I joke about this with the team. We made a game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-last-of-us-2">The Last of Us 2</a>, we made certain creative decisions that got us a lot of hate. A lot of people love it, but a lot of people hate that game," Druckmann said, to which Garland joked: "Who gives a shit?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Exactly," Druckmann added. "But the joke is like, you know what, let's do something that people won't care as much about — let's make a game about faith and religion."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, which stars Tati Gabrielle as Jordan A. Mun, takes place in an alternate historical timeline and features a "pretty prominent religion" that has "changed and bastardized and evolved" over the years, Druckmann said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The PC version of The Last of Us 2 Remastered arrives ahead of Season 2 of HBO's hit TV adaptation. Showrunners Druckmann and Craig Mazin have confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-druckmann-says-theres-a-dramatic-reason-spores-are-back-for-the-last-of-us-season-2"><u>“spores are back” following their omission from Season 1</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

lots of gamers that [GTA 6 will be] the only thing they play," Rice said. "It'll be the opportunity to get in on the new console generation and see what else is out there. So it's definitely gonna be a big economic boost for the games industry, and will be a multiple billion-dollar title, but I don't think that it's at competition with [indie games]."</p><p>GTA 6 is set for release in Fall 2025 on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, but Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-still-on-track-for-release-in-fall-2025/1100-6529307/" data-ref-id="1100-6529307">he cannot rule out a delay</a>. The video game industry hasn't been growing at the level some had expected in recent years following a pandemic-level boom, but the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-and-switch-2-will-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-predicts/1100-6526016/" data-ref-id="1100-6526016">GTA 6 and Switch 2 in 2025 could help turn things around.</a></p><p>GTA 6's first trailer debuted in December 2023, and in the 15+ months since then, Rockstar has not uttered a word about the game, and Take-Two has only spoken about it at the highest level. Fans are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-wait-for-gta-6s-second-trailer-just-broke-a-sad-record/1100-6528595/" data-ref-id="1100-6528595">eagerly awaiting any more news and a trailer</a>, but as of yet, there is no word when that might happen.</p>

                <p>Spring is officially here, and Fanatical is celebrating with an excellent <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-play-on-the-go-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-steam-deck-verified-games-like-high-on-life-ultrakill-and-more-for-just-7-each%2F1100-6530255%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Build Your Own Play On The Go Elite Collection bundle</a>. You'll get to choose your own games from a list of 21 Deck Verified titles, and the more games you bundle together, the more money you'll save. <b>Purchase five or more games to get each for $7, three or more to get each for $7.25, or at least two games to get each for $7.50</b>. All games are delivered as official Steam Keys, and there's no limit on how many you can pick, so you're free to add all 21 to your bundle if you want. As a bonus, you'll get a 5% off coupon for your next Fanatical purchase.</p><p>There are some impressive games to choose from, many of which regularly cost at least $20. High on Life is arguably the most popular title of the bunch, and having the chance to add it to your collection for just $7 is a great deal. Created by the folks responsible for Rick and Morty, it features a bizarre sense of humor and a unique arsenal of weapons with their own special abilities. Our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/high-on-life-review-talking-heads/1900-6418014/" data-ref-id="1900-6418014">High on Life review</a> gave it a solid 7/10, and it's certainly worth a closer look as a part of this bundle.</p><p>Other notable titles include side-scrolling Metroidvanias like Haiku The Robot, Death's Gambit: Afterlife Deluxe Edition, and the Guacamelee Collection (which includes both Guacamelee and Guacamelee 2). If you're into creepy horror adventure games, The Mortuary Assistant is worth adding to your bundle, while those who prefer cheerier, cozier vibes can check out Bear's Restaurant and Critter Café. There's also 8-Bit Adventures 2, which offers a modernized take on classic pixel art console RPGs like the original Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy. </p><p>Fans of 3D action games will want to check out Ultrakill, which is a wild blend of old-school shooters like Quake and flashy action games like Devil May Cry. The game is still in Early Access, but so far, reviews are overwhelmingly positive--and since it usually costs $25, this bundle is the ideal way to grab it for cheap. Star Wars fans, meanwhile, can pick up Star Wars: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles to channel their inner Jedi. Using the Force and your trusty lightsaber, you'll be tasked with fending off hordes of droids as you fight to reclaim the Naboo Royal Palace.</p><p>There are plenty of other games to add to your <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-play-on-the-go-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-steam-deck-verified-games-like-high-on-life-ultrakill-and-more-for-just-7-each%2F1100-6530255%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Build Your Own Play On The Go Elite Collection bundle</a>, and we've listed the full lineup of choices below.

            <p>
With The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered now exactly two weeks away from its PC release, Sony has detailed the platform-specific features it's implementing - and in the case of PSN requirements, <em>not</em> implementing. That's alongside word of new content coming to all platforms.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/20/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-features-and-new-no-return-content-detailed/">highlighted on the PlayStation Blog</a>, The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered for PC includes all the improvements seen in last year's PS5 version - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-ps5-tech-analysis">Digital Foundry called "accomplished"</a>. That's in addition to the newly announced platform-specific stuff, including support for Nvidia DLSS 3 Super Resolution, AMD FSR 3.1 and AMD FSR 4 (including upscaling and frame generation), DirectStorage, and Ultrawide monitors. Unsurprisingly, there's also full gamepad support, and a variety of control customisation options for keyboard and mouse players.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, tweakable settings include VSync and framerate cap options ('uncapped' being one of them), LOD distance range, plus adjustable quality options for textures, volumetrics, shadows, reflections, and ambient occlusion. The PC version also features various graphics settings and presets - as detailed in Sony's system requirements below.

<p>
The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered launches for PC via Steam and Epic on 3rd April, and Sony reiterates - as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-pulls-controversial-psn-account-requirements-for-marvels-spider-man-2-and-other-games-on-pc">previously announced</a> - the mandatory PlayStation Network account requirements that have controversially dogged the company's PC releases over the last year will no longer apply. However, as an incentive to sign in with PSN, players that do so get 50 in-game points to activate bonus features, as well as a new Ellie skin featuring Jordan A. Mun's jacket from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s upcoming Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.
</p>
<p>
Sony notes the jacket will also be available to PlayStation 5 players as part of Remastered's 2.0 update, which comes to the console alongside the PC release. This also brings new additions to the roguelike No Return mode, including two new characters - The Last of Us Part 1's Bill and Marlene (sporting the Smuggler and Risk-Taker playstyles respectively) - plus four new maps.
</p>
<p>
There's Overlook, set high above Seattle, as well as an abandoned elementary school map, simply titled School. Streets, meanwhile, takes places in the overgrown Seattle neighbourhood of Hillcrest, while Nest is the building teeming with Infected previously explored by Abby. All this, including new Trophies and additional bug fixes, will be available on both platforms.
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered's PC and 2.0 release comes just ahead of The Last of Us TV adaptation's highly anticipated season two. It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-will-be-shorter-so-every-episode-feels-like-a-blockbuster">comprised of seven episodes</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-long-awaited-season-2-finally-gets-a-start-date">begins on 13th April</a> - and if you'd like a cheeky peek at what's to come, you'll <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-new-hbo-the-last-of-us-part-2s-trailer-is-here-and-april-cant-come-quickly-enough">find the latest trailer here</a>.

		<p>Among all the enemies to assassinate and castles to pillage, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> also has base building element in it too. This hideout functions as a place for all your allies to gather so you can chat with them, a place for you to upgrade your equipment, and a place to build structures that provide various bonuses. Most of this is optional, but you will need to engage with them at least a little bit to ensure your equipment is up to date.</p>
<p>Whilst you’re there though, you may as well get yourself a few bonuses as well – you’ve been carrying hundreds of construction materials around all this time, after all. There are quite a few options open to you within Assassin’s Creed Shadows hideouts, so we’ve had a look to see which options are most useful and should be prioritised, since you can’t just build it all at once.</p>
<h2>In this guide</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="#section1">How to build Hideout rooms in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#section2">Best Hideout upgrades in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#section3">Themed Hideout rooms in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#section4">How to unlock Pets in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#section5">What else can you do at the Hideout?</a></strong></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="section1">How to build rooms in Assassin’s Creed Shadows Hideouts</h2>
<p>When you’re at your hideout, there are two ways to transition to the building menu, either by interacting with the table in the main building or by venturing into the build area and holding triangle. Either of these will open the build menu, allowing you to select the room, path, decoration, or pet you want, then you’ll be able to place it from a top down view. If you misplace something you can select it and choose to move it or press Triangle / Y on your gamepad to erase things from the top down view.</p>
<h3 id="section2">Best Hideout upgrades in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h3>
<p>The basics of the hideout are the main rooms. The first room, the Hiroma, is built during the mission that introduces you to the hideout system. From there, you’ll be given some hideout related missions, the most important of which is to go and find a blacksmith. Once you’ve completed that mission you’ll be able to build a <strong>forge</strong>, which allows you to upgrade equipment.</p>


<p>Not all of this is introduced through missions, so there are a few other main rooms to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>kakurega</strong> manages the kakuregas (safehouses) that you can find whilst exploring Japan. Building and upgrading it makes it more efficient and can unlock things like additional kakuregas to use out in the world and reduce their costs.</li>
<li>The <strong>dojo</strong> allows you to upgrade allies that you can summon during combat, making them tougher and even allowing you to call on two at once.</li>
<li>The <strong>study</strong> is all about scouts, who are an invaluable tool. Scouts collect large resource piles that you find and mark whilst exploring, and the study allows you to increase the number you can have available, reduce the cost of replenishing them, and can also reduce the search area for quest markers.</li>
<li>The <strong>stables</strong> are already built, but they should be upgraded as soon as possible. Those aforementioned large resource piles that scouts gather cost two scouts to collect, but the first upgrade to your stables halves this cost to one scout. This doubles your capacity for liberating the resources and hopefully cuts down a bit on having to skip them because you have run out of scouts, which is frustrating.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section3">Themed Hideout rooms in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h3>
<p>Most themed rooms provide a bonus once they’ve been built, such as the <strong>Tera</strong>, which passively increases experience you gain by 10%, or the <strong>Nando</strong>, that will reduce costs of replenishing scouts in kakuregas. The <strong>gallery</strong>&nbsp;allows you to create and switch between weapon loadouts for both characters, whilst the remaining two rooms are customisable to be decorated however you like.</p>
<p>I focused on the Tera so that I could level up a little quicker, and on the Nando so it’s a little cheaper to replenish your scouts without waiting for a season to pass. The more scouts you have the more resources you can gather for building, after all.</p>
<h3 id="section4">How to unlock Pets in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h3>
<p>Pets can be unlocked very simply by finding animals and interacting with them in the world, after which they’ll be available to place in your hideout exactly like a building or other scenery.</p>

<p>It is a little strange that Naoe and Yasuke just wander around Feudal Japan cloning people’s pets, but that’s fine as long as we can have a small zoo of them to fuss over. If you’re desperate for a pet, one will be marked on the map near the hideout’s location once the open world opens up. Simply head over, pet it, and you’ll get yourself a dog!</p>
<h3 id="section5">What else can you do at the Hideout?</h3>
<p>The other items for the Hideout are all cosmetic, allowing you to customise the look of your hideout until your heart’s content. There are a lot of items to be found all over Japan, whether it’s in chests, from enemies, or from merchants, and all of them can be placed from the build menu by cycling through the tabs.</p>
<p>Everything from trees, foliage, and rocks to lighting, there’s even some engawas to connect your buildings together so your allies don’t have to step out into the rain if they don’t want to. This is optional of course, but if you’re building a bunch of buildings they may as well look nice, right?</p>
<hr>
<p>And that’s everything you need to know about the hideout. It isn’t an especially deep system, but there’s some useful bonuses to be found if you spend a little time building and upgrading things. If you’re so inclined, you could make a very pretty garden as well, which might be a nice way to pass time after diving onto fifteen guards wristblade first.</p>

To celebrate, Blizzard released a new animated trailer featuring her doing some sick acrobatic tricks and taking out synthetic omnic goons. That’s all well and good, but what fans are honing in on are the final moments in which Freja is given a bounty hunting contract that hints at a long-awaited character finally making their debut. However, if you’re not super tuned into <em>Overwatch </em>lore, you might have no idea who he is.</p><p>Emre Sarioglu is a Turkish hero from the titular organization’s heyday before the events of the games, and has appeared only a few times in the series’ extended lore. His most prominent appearance is in a group photo of much of the OG team with a young Pharah; otherwise he’s mostly only been seen in the margins of the lore in things like the <em>Overwatch: Declassified </em>book. Sojourn has a voice line in <em>Overwatch 2 </em>saying Emre wanted to retire to Havana, but that’s pretty much it. The guy’s mostly an enigma, and that mystery has made him a bit of a running joke within the <em>Overwatch </em>community. Now, however, it seems like Blizzard may actually be bringing him into the fold with Freja, and fans are losing it.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196880" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="218" data-playlist="196880,195460,196049" data-current="196880"><div><p>Ranking Overwatch 2 Season 10's Biggest Changes</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196880/196880_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22434.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>While it’s exciting that we might finally learn more about Emre, it’s unclear if this thread will be picked up any time soon. <em>Overwatch </em>loves to introduce characters in external media and then not get back to them for several years. For example, Mauga was first introduced in the short story <em>What You Left Behind </em>in 2019 and wasn’t added to the roster until <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s eighth season in 2023. At the very least we know Blizzard hasn’t completely forgotten him.</p><p>Freja’s test period will last from March 21 to 24; she’ll then officially join the roster in season 16 on April 22.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This consists of LightSpeed Studios’ latest research and development breakthroughs, which push the boundaries of graphics and performance to enhance in-game realism, as showcased in workshops during GDC 2025.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>LightSpeed Studios Sets the Stage for a New Era for LightSpeed Japan Studio</strong></p><p>Building on this approach, legendary game director and head of LightSpeed Japan Studio, Hideaki Itsuno, is revealing at GDC 2025 that he’s entering the arena and embarked on the early stages of bringing his own visionary AAA game title to life. Drawing on his extensive experience directing games and building incredible teams at <a title="Companies > Capcom [2,570 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> that drove the remarkable successes of <em>Devil May Cry</em>, the Capcom <em>Alpha</em> series, <em>Capcom VS. <a title="Companies > SNK Corporation [412 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/snk">SNK</a></em>, and many more iconic game titles, Itsuno is ready to apply the same principles of creative freedom, efficiency, and humility to assemble an outstanding team and create something truly groundbreaking.</p><p>“We’re building a creative environment that combines diverse cultural perspectives with cutting-edge technology,” said LightSpeed Japan Studio general manager Hideaki Itsuno. “Our focus is on developing gameplay elements that offer players entirely new experiences—the kind of innovations that make players say I’ve never seen that in a game before.”</p><p><strong>Leveraging Global Talent and Nurturing Creative Freedom</strong></p><p>Additionally, to foster fresh perspectives in original game development, LightSpeed Studios is adopting a model that enables each studio to shape its own culture, advocating for original thinking within teams. Bringing to the table Eastern and Western game philosophies, LightSpeed Studios is positioned to encourage regional teams to exchange ideas, blend cultural influences, and unite under a shared vision—creating truly global gaming experiences.</p><p>A standout example of this approach is being led by the vice president of LightSpeed Studios, Steve C. Martin, known for his commitment to five-year development cycles. Focused on bringing his original AAA open world action title, Last Sentinel, to life, Steve has assembled a world-class, global team. Despite talent from prestigious studios like Rockstar Games, Meta and EA Games, LightSpeed LA has fostered not only a culture of creative freedom but ensures product efficiency, thanks to Steve’s emphasis on humility and a willingness to embrace constructive feedback.</p><p>“Any game studio’s ambition lies with developing original games,” said Martin. “The creative freedom of creating your own lore from scratch, building a compelling narrative, and all the upsides from this is the dream of any studio, and that’s why LightSpeed Studios is the place to be.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Last of Us Part II Remastered PC system requirements have been <a href="https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/the_last_of_us_part_2_remastered_pc_features_new_no_return" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> today, detailing the system requirements for different resolutions and target framerates.</p>
<p>To run the game at low settings, 720p resolution @ 30 frames per second, users won't need a beefy system, as either an Intel Core i3-8100 or AMD Ryzen 3 1300X CPU and either a GTX 1650 or RX 5500XT will be enough.

After the game’s opening act, your first line of business is to find Tomiko and establish your hideout. This is your base of operations where you’ll accrue allies and build facilities, though you’ll quickly find one of the most valuable ones is locked off: the Forge. You’ll see that this building has the prerequisite “Recruit a Blacksmith,” so naturally, you’ll want to knock that off your to-do list.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195776" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Assassin's Creed Mirage" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="157" data-playlist="195776,195922,196345" data-current="195776"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Assassin's Creed Mirage</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21286.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>To get your own blacksmith, look for the quest “Way Of The Blacksmith” in the Objectives tab of your main menu under Tomiko’s icon</strong>. You might recall that Tomiko mentions recruiting a blacksmith named Heiji in the cutscene where she and Naoe discuss the first two Onryo to hunt, so you’ll almost certainly have access to this quest if you’re reading this. Of course, assuming you’re playing on the game’s default settings, you’ll have to do a tiny bit of legwork to track Heiji down, so you can check out his location below if you just want to get to him right away.</p><h2 id="h1268173"><a id=""></a>’The Way Of The Blacksmith’ quest location</h2><p>As the game’s hints directly indicate, <strong>Heiji is located in Sekai</strong>. <strong>You’ll find this area directly southwest of the hideout</strong>. Sekai is also where you’ll begin your hunt for the Golden Teppo, so you can kill two birds with one stone by going there first. Well, technically you kill one bird and recruit another bird, but you get the picture.</p><figure id="" data-id="533b6b01d42b410b8e920346ea2ccec3" data-recommend-id="image://533b6b01d42b410b8e920346ea2ccec3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the map in Assassin’s Creed: Shadows.

They’re common foes, so dispatch them however you please; you can easily complete this battle even if you’ve not bothered to level up or grab new equipment. Talk with Hieji after the battle and you’ll learn about the circumstances that have broken his spirit. Pick whichever dialogue option feels best to you, and Heiji will make his way to Tomiko’s hideout. Once you gather enough resources, you’ll finally be able to build a forge at your hideout.</p><h2 id="h1268174"><a id=""></a>How to best use the Blacksmith</h2><figure id="" data-id="dc27ad6ee1d80021a144eedc27265b77" data-recommend-id="image://dc27ad6ee1d80021a144eedc27265b77" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot from Assassin’s Creed: Shadows.

Upon talking with him, you’ll have access to the following options:</p><p><strong>Upgrade</strong>: Invest resources into any piece of equipment to increase its level. Equipment cannot be higher than your character’s level (level equivalent gear simply won’t appear). You can use Gold to immediately upgrade a piece of equipment to your current level, but Gold is a rare resource that should not be confused with normal currency (Mon). <strong>Save your Gold for bigger upgrades down the road; don’t use it by accident in the early game</strong>!</p><p><strong>Engrave</strong>: Apply one of your found Engravings to an applicable piece of gear (it will say “Visit the Hideout’s blacksmith to engrave a perk” under its stats). Engravings are not consumed upon use and can be overridden, though note this process will consume Mon every time.</p><p><strong>Salvage</strong>: Break down a piece of gear into upgrade materials.<br></p><p>In short, if you find a great piece of gear that proves essential to your build, come here to refine it as you play to keep its stats relevant. And if you’re just beginning your journey in <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, be sure to keep some resources on hand for when Yasuke joins your party! <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is Ubisoft’s first Day One release on Steam it’s already climbed the platform’s all-time player peak charts to become third in series history.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3159330/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/assassin-s-creed/not-even-1-day-after-release-assassins-creed-shadows-player-count-on-steam-already-has-valhalla-beat-and-now-its-coming-for-odyssey-and-origins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games Radar</a>), Assassin’s Creed Shadows is off to a great start on Steam, achieving an all-time player peak of 41,412 on the first day (at the time of writing). To compare, Shadows has more than doubled AC Valhalla’s numbers, which peaked at 15,679 2.3 years ago. It is less than 150 players away from beating AC Origins’ peak, 41,551, which arrived 7.4 years ago. AC Odyssey still stands strong at the moment, peaking at 62,069 6.4 years ago.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Regarding AC Shadows reviews on Steam, things seem to be going well for Ubisoft, with the platform categorising it as “Very Positive”. If you are interested in an in-depth review of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, you can check out <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s review</a> of the title, where we described the game as “Great, But The Blade Still Needs Sharpening”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the latest instalment of Ubisoft’s popular series. For those unaware of the game, the new setting takes players to Feudal Japan, where they explore a fresh narrative set in a vast open world through the eyes of dual protagonists.</p>



<p>The new protagonists are Yasuke and Naoe, both featuring distinct playstyles. One is a stealthy Assassin, and the other is a legendary Samurai; players must master both characters to take down enemies with precision and power. The game also introduces a fully customisable hideout where you train your crew, craft/upgrade weapons, and interact with characters.&nbsp;</p>
