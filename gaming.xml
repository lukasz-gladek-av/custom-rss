            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutants-unleashed-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p data-cy="paragraph">In 1991, I went to see Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles II: The Secret of the Ooze. The Turtles were barely using their weapons now, Casey Jones was gone, and April O’Neil wasn’t Judith Hoag anymore – which was like coming back after holidays to find the classmate you had a crush on had changed schools. Put simply, it wasn’t what I’d expected, and I find myself in a similar position with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed. What I <em>expected </em>was a basic 3D beat ’em up that would be over in a few hours. What we <em>got </em>is actually a 14-hour light RPG, with a basic 3D beat ’em up tying together long sections of exposition and relationship building. Unfortunately, like with The Secret of the Ooze, moving in an unexpected direction doesn’t automatically make the end result good. Despite a clear effort on the part of developer aheartfulofgames to make Mutants Unleashed a juicy and authentic follow-up story to 2023’s Mutant Mayhem film, it quickly becomes tedious thanks to a significant lack of enemy variety and small selection of constantly reused levels. It’s not ninja crap, but the T.U.R.T.L.E. power is limited.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As far as I’m concerned, the original 1990 TMNT movie is untouchable, but I do feel Mutant Mayhem is the best TMNT movie <em>since </em>the first. Its deliberately imperfect, hand-drawn appearance is remarkable, its soundtrack is impeccable, and – as the father of a 16-year-old – it contains easily the most believably teenage Turtles ever.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>[The graphics] ably ape the hastily sketched, asymmetrical look of Mutant Mayhem – from its crude, 2D scribbles for smoke and light sources, to Bebop’s distractingly droopy pierced nipples. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Mutants Unleashed comes impressively close to recreating two of those pillars itself. While the graphics don’t reach par with the exquisite, painterly appearance of the movie, they ably ape the hastily sketched, asymmetrical look of Mutant Mayhem – from its crude, 2D scribbles for smoke and light sources, to Bebop’s distractingly droopy pierced nipples. The four main Turtles themselves are also in sync with their movie counterparts, largely thanks to the fact the voice stars of the movie have returned here. If the budget could’ve stretched to include some of the film’s licensed music, they could’ve had the trifecta. It sadly didn’t but, unfortunately, Mutants Unleashed has several more pressing problems than a lack of iconic ’90s hip hop up in here (up in here).</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Can I Kick It?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While a 14-hour TMNT RPG may sound like slam dunk value on paper, Mutants Unleashed is actually stretched to a breaking point over that surprisingly lengthy duration. The main story missions quickly become dreary once you notice it’s constantly rehashing the same stages.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mutants Unleashed tries hard to obfuscate how many levels it actually has by having us run backwards through ones we’ve previously completed, or switching up the fixed camera to a different angle, but it’s very transparent. There’s also far too much loading required as we complete sections, which just feels like a cheat to shuffle the order of environments used for each mission without blending them together. Either way, clambering across the same construction site, running through the same pipe, riding up and down the same elevator, and scurrying over the same cargo ships gets old, quick.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Worse, very little exploration is possible. Yes, there are hidden objects – and pieces of street art to find for Mondo Gecko – but Mutants Unleashed generally only punishes us for trying to veer off the path. I lost track of the number of times I tried to jump to a spot that appeared fine to land on, only to plummet to the street off camera – or be met with an invisible wall. On one stage I completely trapped myself somewhere I clearly wasn’t meant to be. I’ve only ever found hidden art by accidentally going the way I thought I was supposed to go anyway. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat itself is totally serviceable, although enemies aren’t very smart, and they’re not always great at tracking you through the environments. The Turtles all have distinct fighting styles that can be upgraded with new moves as you progress specific relationships for each. There’s little need to get into the weeds with it, though, and it’s totally a button masher. This makes it accessible, but fairly mindless. I’d try out new moves, but mostly to get the tutorial boxes to leave the screen, where they sometimes cover up your Turtles thanks to the fixed camera. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That camera didn’t really bother me for the most part; I get that it’s ultimately a bit of a halfway house between an entirely third-person brawler and the 2D beat ’em ups of yesteryear, and Mutants Unleashed creatively replaces your character with a scratched silhouette when they’re hidden by pieces of the environment. However, I did have instances where the angle was a real burden. There’s not a ton of technical platforming in Mutants Unleashed, but lining up jumps and rail grinds from a 45-degree angle is like leaving your TV and trying to keep playing Tony Hawk from the toilet with the bathroom door ajar.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Most disappointingly, Mutants Unleashed seems built primarily as a single-player game. The Turtles you <em>haven’t</em> selected will simply dip out at the beginning of every level, so you never feel like you’re part of a fighting foursome – which is what TMNT is all about. Sure, it has two-player co-op, but it’s not four-player, so that still doesn’t feel right. You don’t even get AI Turtles raising shell in the background. The special assist moves make it seem like a second Turtle is going to get involved, but activating them doesn’t actually bring one of your brothers physically into the space. It’s just… implied that they dropped in and bugged out, perhaps while you were blinking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also doesn’t help that enemies are just the same handful of mutants for the entire game. Trash crabs. Zebra squids. Hippo luchadores. A couple more. But it’s over a dozen hours of these same few baddies. Yes, I understand a licensed tie-in game isn’t going to be able to introduce important opponents from the TMNT universe – like the Foot Clan or such – before the film’s inevitable sequel. Hell, I wouldn’t let it either. That’s how you get Emperor Palpatine returning to Star Wars in… Fortnite. At 6am Australian Eastern Daylight Time on a random Sunday morning. But Mutants Unleashed really needed more enemy variety.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a host of side missions, but unfortunately these only contribute to the repetition. Civilian missions involve beating up a bunch of the same mutants across a couple of levels you’ve almost certainly been to before. Contagion missions involve running through a level you’ve almost certainly been to before, beating up the same mutants again, although this time some of them will be highlighted as key targets. Pizza deliveries are just speed runs through the same levels once more, although the enemies have been removed, and the map is now full of giant inflatable bounce pads and boom gates for no discernible reason. And no one’s carrying a pizza.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mutants Unleashed features a time progression system, where each mission or conversation encounter takes either a day or a night, and then the day moves on. This puts a limit on the amount of side activities you can tackle before needing to do a main mission, but there’s more than enough time to complete everything in a single playthrough. There’s about two months of tasks, but I had weeks up my sleeve before needing to do the final couple of story missions and I was already out of side missions, so the time component doesn’t really add a great deal. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">No Diggity</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The RPG-style conversational component of Mutants Unleashed does add a lot of unexpected exposition, although I think the story of a new wave of mutants descending on New York and finding themselves at odds with the existing human population <em>is </em>an effective and totally logical follow-up to the movie. It continues the themes that hatred and prejudice are repugnant from any side they’re projected and, while “do unto others” is admittedly a message that’s been embedded in kids’ cartoons for decades, that doesn’t make it any less authentic in this new TMNT world where mutants and humans have suddenly been thrown together.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, not every conversation is particularly riveting, and not all of them are actually voiced, either. These sections are also entirely passive, so there are definitely times when they’re simply filler. Even moments that seem custom made for a minigame – like Donatello visiting an arcade to play a dancing game – ultimately aren’t interactive. An indirect dig at how rubbish Raph is in the original TMNT game is cute, but otherwise there’s a bit of a weird clash of approaches at times. I raised my eyebrow as the script worked quite hard to concoct an entire fantasy catalogue of parody John Hughes films to not mention him by name – but then, on other occasions, overtly references the likes of Clint Eastwood and Chuck Norris. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Cutscenes are totally hamstrung by the glacial cadence of conversations.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest problem, however, is the pacing of the dialogue. Cutscenes are totally hamstrung by the glacial cadence of conversations, which waits line-by-line for huge dialogue boxes and canned reaction animations to pop up. This creates highly-unnatural pauses between sentences and very much kills the momentum of conversations. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">These scenes can mostly be skipped, or slightly sped up by hammering a button, but they’re nonetheless necessary if you want to progress the Turtles’ relationships with their friends around the city and unlock new upgrades. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-will-run-two-6v6-tests-in-season-14/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Exactly three months ago, Overwatch 2 Game Director Aaron Keller <a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-team-is-exploring-how-to-test-6v6-in-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">began</a> the discussion between the development team and the community on how to bring back the 6v6 mode that was initially removed in the sequel. A few hours ago, Keller <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24151413/director-s-take-continuing-the-6v6-discussion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> an update and shared concrete details on when and how 6v6 tests will happen.</p>
<p>There will be two tests in Season 14. The first one will begin a week after the season's debut and will feature a variation of Open Queue. Each team of 6 must have at least one hero of each role and no more than three. According to Keller, this opens up a lot of different team compositions that players haven't seen before in Overwatch 2. Roles can be switched during a match, as long as it doesn't break the 'min 1, max 3' limit. This test also aims to give Blizzard a look at how Overwatch 2's heroes, abilities, and updates work in a 6v6 environment.</p>
<p>The second 6v6 test will take place later, during Season 14's mid-cycle, and it will feature the classic 2-2-2 matchup with some twists (such as less CC and hero rework). Both 6v6 Tests will have their own map in Unranked alongside other modes and will not replace other types of game modes such as Seasonal Events or Quick Play: Hacked. Blizzard will also introduce several balance changes that will only apply to these two test modes: for example, tank power and survivability will be reduced in these 6v6 formats, and the studio will evaluate whether they need many of the passive abilities that were added in Overwatch 2.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in Season 13, Blizzard will also experiment with two 5v5 formats. In the first one, called Limit 2, the maximum number of each role will be limited to two. This includes Tanks, but they will be tuned to Open Queue balance, so they will have less health. The second format is being dubbed Kingmaker; here, the maximum number of each role is still limited to two - however, the player alone in their role gets some kind of bonus.</p>
<p>Towards the end of his article, Keller also hints Blizzard now sees a world where 5v5 and 6v6 are both available on a permanent basis in Overwatch 2. Of course, it will depend on how these tests are received. Whether that will be enough to inject some much-needed lifeblood into the game remains to be seen.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, during the Indie Horror Showcase hosted by DreadXP, Nightdive Studios released a new gameplay trailer for The Thing Remastered. The new trailer provides a detailed look at the bloody and mangled events inside Outpost #31 and the crew's desperation as they attempt to escape from a gruesome, corporeal alien menace.</p>
<p>The Thing Remastered is a remaster of 2002's squad-based third-person shooter horror game. Originally developed by Computer Artworks, it was obviously based on John Carpenter's seminal horror movie, released in 1982. Nightdive Studios, which specializes in remasters and remakes (<a href="https://wccftech.com/quake-ii-remaster-announced-quake-ii-64-new-expansion-machingames/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Quake II</a>, DOOM and DOOM II, System Shock, <a href="https://wccftech.com/turok-turok-2-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Turok</a>, Blade Runner, and Star Wars: Dark Forces just to name a few), has ported the old game to its proprietary KEX engine. This enabled a series of improvements: 4K resolution and up to 120 frames per second support, not to mention enhancements to character models, textures, animations, lighting, and atmospheric effects. Nightdive has also added brand new Trophies and Achievements on all platforms.</p>
<p>The Thing Remastered is slated to launch later this year on PC, PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5, Xbox One and Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch. For more info on the remaster, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-xsufeLmxk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nightdive's Deep Dive podcast</a>.</p>

<p><em>You are Cpt J.F. Blake, leader of a U.S. Special Forces rescue team sent to investigate the blood-curdling events and enigmatic deaths of the American scientific team that transpired at the Outpost 31 research facility located in the frozen wastelands of Antarctica. Within these inhospitable surroundings your team encounters a strange shape-shifting alien life-form that assumes the appearance of people that it kills. Trapped by the elements and infected by this horrific entity, using all your team members is critical if you hope to accomplish your objectives, let alone survive.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>In 20 frightening levels, lead your team against terrifying monsters, from the scuttling head-spiders and human-like walkers to gigantic multi-tentacled beasts.</em></li>
<li><em>Advanced trust/fear interface adds a new level of interaction – How you influence your team's psychological state determines whether or not they will co-operate with you.</em></li>
<li><em>Use awesome firepower like machine guns, explosives, and flamethrowers to torch your enemies.</em></li>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-game-franchises/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-owns-20-game-franchises-that-have-exceeded-1-billion-in-revenue.1019115/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-game-franchises/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Microsoft is a powerhouse of the gaming industry, and that much is certain. Most of that value has come from lucrative acquisitions that the company has made over the years, such as the snapping up of ZeniMax Media and, more recently, Activision Blizzard King. In a recent financial report, it was stressed that the tech titan now owns 20 franchises that have each exceeded <strong>$1 BILLION </strong>in revenue.</p>



<p>The ‘Annual Report 2024’ that was published by the firm recently outlines just how staggering Microsoft’s gaming portfolio has been – and continues to be. </p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-over-time">Over Time</h2>



<p>It’s worth stressing that many of the franchises Microsoft is referring to are decades old and have pieced together their lifetime revenue over <strong>many years</strong>. For instance, Warcraft, Elder Scrolls, Gears of War, Diablo, and Halo. Microsoft has little in the way of new IP under that umbrella, and even the gem of the collection – Call of Duty – was acquired after being on the market for more than 20 years.</p>



<p>Here’s the <a href="https://microsoft.gcs-web.com/static-files/2e135de7-7104-4bca-b2c4-e584199eabeb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">snippet from the financial update</a> that was dug up <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/101314/xbox-has-20-video-game-franchises-that-have-earned-1-billion/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by TweakTown</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are bringing great games to more people on more devices. With our acquisition of Activision Blizzard King, which closed October 2023, we’ve added hundreds of millions of players to our ecosystem. </p>



<p>We now have 20 franchises that have generated over $1 billion in lifetime revenue—from Candy Crush, Diablo, and Halo, to Warcraft, Elder Scrolls, and Gears of War. And with Xbox cloud gaming, we continue to innovate to offer players more ways to experience the games they love—where, when, and how they want.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The financial update gassed up the Xbox Game Pass subscription service to no end, singing the praises of the paid-for platform that boasts ‘over 400 first- and third-party console and PC titles’. It’s not the be-all and end-all, though – the ecosystem’s cloud gaming platform was also spotlighted, even if competition is running rampant.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Xbox and our cloud gaming services face competition from various online gaming ecosystems and game streaming services, including those operated by Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Tencent. We also compete with other providers of entertainment services such as video streaming platforms.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a dog-eat-dog world, that’s for sure.</p>



<p>This year, Microsoft’s gaming revenue increased by 39% – $6 billion – thanks to growth in Xbox content and services, it was revealed. Microsoft is putting a lot of faith in the recent ABK acquisition to further bolster growth going forward: <em>‘The acquisition will accelerate the growth in our gaming business across mobile, PC, console, and cloud gaming.’</em></p>



<p>What’s your favourite Microsoft-backed franchise that has made more than $1 billion in its lifetime? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Undisputed, the first boxing game to be a smash hit in more than a decade, has just passed one million sales. It entered early access last year but was released in full on October 11, being scooped up and praised by boxing fans worldwide. In a recent interview, one of the founders of the developer, Steel City Interactive, spoke about this milestone and what’s coming next.</p>



<p>Esports has always been on the table for Undisputed, and it’s about time to realise that vision.;</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-new-opportunities">New Opportunities</h2>



<p>The esports industry is dominated by shooters, MOBA games, and the FGC. Typically, sports-based titles aren’t all that popular where esports are concerned, and that’s mostly because the real-world examples of these sports are there and readily available. It’s not possible to watch <strong>real-world shootouts </strong>unfold on a competitive level now, is it?</p>



<p>Despite that, Steel City Interactive is ready and willing to make Undisputed one of the next best esports games.</p>



<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/undisputed-hit-an-indie-made-boxing-game-featuring-real-fighters-has-just-sold-1m-copies" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Ash Habib, one of Steel City’s founders, spoke about the competitive future of Undisputed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Esports was part of the original vision for the game. </p>



<p>I didn’t want the esport element to feel like a bolt-on or something that needed doing separately. With that in mind, we partnered with the WBC, where there will be an esport element where you can actually win a physical WBC belt, given by Mauricio Sulaimán, who is the president himself. So esports is in our plans, and will form a big part of Undisputed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Recently, we sat down with Ash Habib to learn about the ins and outs of this marvellous new boxing game that has been turning heads for years.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>One million sales are just the start for Undisputed. If the game can generate a popular enough esports ecosystem, it’ll be in a league of its own, as there’s nothing else to compete with it at present.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-stream-friday-the-13th-movies<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A streaming guide for the slasher saga.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section><p data-cy="paragraph">After the success of Halloween (1978), Friday the 13th kicked off the 80's by taking the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-slasher-movies">slasher genre</a> to gorey new heights. Jason Voorhees first appeared (sort of) to terrify teens at a Crystal Lake summer camp, and its safe to say the original Friday the 13th is essential viewing for any horror fan. 12 movies and 11 directors later, the hockey-mask wearing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-top-31-horror-movie-villains">horror villain</a> has become a zombie, gone to space, and battled a fellow slasher icon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those looking to watch or rewatch the films ahead of Halloween or the next Friday the 13th in December, here's where you can stream all of the Friday the 13th movies right now.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Watch the Friday the 13th Movies Online </h2><div catalogid="c47a9a39-a644-4b37-b515-8776ebd77b36" id="135369"><div id="135369" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>7 Days Free Paramount+ Free Trial</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Includes a 7-day free trial.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Over the years, the Friday the 13th movies have been pretty hard to find online. This October, the first eight Friday the 13th movies ("the original series," if you will) have finally found a home at Paramount+. The more recent films, including the 2009 reboot, are available to stream on Max. All of the Friday the 13th movies are available to rent or purchase from digital storefronts, which is unfortunately the only way to get your hands on Jason Goes to Hell (maybe that one's for the best) and Jason X. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Friday the 13th Movies on Blu-ray </h2></div><div catalogid="f986598b-93bb-4442-9838-53081531c46b" id="87884"><div id="87884" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Shout! Factory Friday the 13th Collection [Blu-Ray]</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Includes 16 discs with the original movies in HD, special features, audio commentaries and more.</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Friday the 13th movies may be all over the place online, Shout!Factory released a collected set of all 12 movies on Blu-ray back in 2020. The set also includes what can only be described as a ludicrous amount of bonus features. If you don't need the Blu-ray or all those extras, you can also grab a <a href="https://zdcs.link/9wGJmp?object_uuid=c0a96dbc-3ecc-400f-8f4c-fe1e52e642dc&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">DVD set of the first 8 movies</a> for around $20. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Order Should You Watch the Friday the 13th Movies</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Friday the 13th franchise, like most of the 80's slashers, has a lot going on. We're talking spin-offs, reboots, crossovers, and some good ol' time travel. For those interested in the Jason timeline, we've also covered <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-friday-the-13th-movies-in-order">how to watch the Friday the 13th movies in chronological order</a>. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Will There Be More Friday the 13th Movies? </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While the 2009 reboot may have intended to bring back the series, complicated legal drama over franchise rights has stalled the production of any new Friday the 13th movies since. Instead, the biggest release the franchise has seen in the past 15 years was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/friday-the-13th-the-game">Friday the 13th: The Game</a>, which, due to more legal drama, was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/friday-the-13th-the-game-will-no-longer-be-available-to-buy-after-this-year">delisted at the end of 2023</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, we may finally get that 13th Friday the 13th movie. Earlier this year, Horror, Inc announced they would be working with some of the original license holders to build up a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jason-universe-horror-inc-announces-multi-platform-expansion-of-friday-the-13th-franchise">multi-platform Jason Universe</a>. Yes, of course that's what they're calling it. While the Jason-verse will seemingly kick off with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/friday-the-13th-prequel-series-finds-new-showrunner-following-bryan-fullers-exit">Crystal Lake TV show</a>, hopefully we see Jason back on the big screen sooner rather than later. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Blythe (she/her) is an SEO Coordinator at IGN who is always looking for the next great horror story and turn-based RPG.</em></p></div></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Oct 25, 2024 1:30 am</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the summer of their third year in high school, Korone—the lively mood maker who brought the oddballs together—reaches out after a long time.</p><p>Looking forward to their reunion, they all arrive at the meeting place… or so they thought.</p><p>When they regain consciousness, they find themselves in a small room with no exit. The room is decorated as if themed after <em>Alice in Wonderland</em>. In each corner of the square room, there is a chair and a table for each girl, as well as a lovely tea set.

It figures to move even more into the mainstream with the arrival of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Like-Dragon-Yakuza-Season-Trailer/dp/B0D9PPR5FY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Like a Dragon: Yakuza TV series</a> on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/prime/pipeline/signup?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Prime Video</a> today, October 24. In honor of the new TV series, several retailers are holding sales on the entire Yakuza series, making now the perfect time to get into the beloved Japanese crime saga. You'll find deals on console and PC versions of the games, including an Amazon discount that drops the most recent game, <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Like-Dragon-Infinite-Wealth-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CJHD3JZ8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Like A Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a></strong>, to just $30 (normally $70).</p><p dir="ltr">This nearly 60%-off deal is the best price we've seen for Infinite Wealth since its release earlier this year. The discount applies to the PS5, PS4, Xbox (cross-gen) versions of the game, but it's only available for a limited time, so grab it while you can. As mentioned, Infinite Wealth is a direct sequel to Yakuza: Like a Dragon, which starts a new story arc with a brand-new protagonist Ichiban Kasuga. Like a Dragon is a great game to start with if you're new to franchise.

            <p>
With <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> almost upon us (or already upon us <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-times">depending on your geographical location</a>), analysts have been weighing in on the impact it's likely to have on Xbox Game Pass, with some reckoning it could bring as many as 4m new members to Microsoft's subscription service, albeit at a cost of up to 6m sales.
</p>
<p>
Black Ops 6 will, of course, be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-alert-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-xbox-game-pass-launch">first Call of Duty title to launch day one</a> on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass, the move marking a critical test for Microsoft's subscription service strategy following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">$69bn USD acquisition of Activision Blizzard</a> last year.
</p>
<p>
And Black Ops 6's Game Pass launch will lead to a significant surge of new subscribers according to analysts<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-could-boost-game-pass-subscribers-by-25m-to-4m"> interviewed by GamesIndustry.biz</a>, albeit at the expense of game sales. Wedbush Securities managing director Michael Pachter, for instance, believes Microsoft will see between three and four million new members following Black Op 6's Game Pass launch, although he reckons the move could result in up to 6m lost sales, based on the idea 25 percent of Game Pass subscribers may have bought the game anyway.

<p>
Ampere's head games analyst Piers Harding-Rolls, meanwhile, was slightly less optimistic about Call of Duty: Black Ops 6's Game Pass allure, telling GamesIndustry.biz its introduction will likely only result in a 10 percent subscriber boost to Game Pass Ultimate - equating to approximately 2.5m members - while noting not all of those will be completely new users, given some will be upgrading from lower Game Pass tiers.
</p><p>
"Microsoft will be trading premium full-game sales in exchange for a bigger audience that can be monetised in-game instead," he continued, adding, "Call of Duty is increasingly a live-service game first and foremost that monetises strongly in-game". This fact alone, he noted, raises questions about "how [Black Ops 6 will be] monetised and whether there is a bigger onus on in-game monetisation compared to previous entries in the franchise."
</p>
<p>
"Nobody knows what Microsoft's expectations are for Game Pass growth past launch," Katan Games' Dr Serkan Toto added, "but if Black Ops 6 does not meet targets, things can become very grim very quickly. I also wonder if Black Ops 6 will be able to retain subscribers in the long run or if numbers will drop sharply again early next year, after the initial hype runs out."
</p>
<p>
And as for how Black Ops 6's Game Pass launch might impact PlayStation, given Sony has traditionally positioned itself as the primary place to play Call of Duty through its previous marketing and exclusivity deals with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a>, Harding-Rolls doubts the "longer-term audience on PlayStation will be significantly disrupted".
</p>
<p>
"Those who own both Xbox and PlayStation consoles may be swayed to play the game on Microsoft's devices," he explained, "but cross-platform play and multi-platform accounts mean this is not necessarily a permanent decision".
</p>
<p>
Expect Microsoft to be trumpeting numbers loudly if Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 proves to be the Game Pass success it's hoping for. The company most <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-game-pass-now-has-34m-fully-paid-subscribers">recently shared membership figures</a> back in February - for the first time since 2022 - reporting 34m "fully paid" subscribers, up from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-pass-now-has-over-25-million-subscribers">25m members announced previously</a>. As for Black Ops 6 itself, the most interesting thing to come out of its launch so far is that some of its characters are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/are-your-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-characters-blue-make-sure-youve-disabled-high-contrast-mode">inadvertently turning blue</a>.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s next seasonal celebration, the Halloween-themed Festival of the Lost, will offer new ways to get some highly sought-after rewards. The annual event is bringing a means to get its best piece of armor, the ability-combining <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-get-exotic-class-items-in-destiny-2-the-final-shape-and-how-they-work/1100-6523922/" data-ref-id="1100-6523922">Exotic class item</a>, that allows you to skip <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review/1900-6418239/" data-ref-id="1900-6418239">the (excellent, but potentially arduous) two-player Dual Destiny mission</a>. The Festival of the Lost will also see the return of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-the-superblack-shader-in-destiny-2/1100-6522602/" data-ref-id="1100-6522602">Superblack</a>, an all-black cosmetic shader players haven't been able to get in the game since the launch of the Final Shape expansion.</p><p>Bungie laid out the details for how to get both rewards in its latest <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/twid_10_24_2024" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This Week in Destiny blog post</a>, where it also provided a bunch of information about the Festival of the Lost event, which launches on October 29. During the Festival, players can earn an event-specific currency--candy, because it's Halloween--that can be spent with Eva, the vendor for holiday events. With 2,500 candy and one of the Festival's specific gear drops, an Eerie Engram, you can buy an Exotic class item directly from Eva.</p><p>Currently, players need to complete Dual Destiny, a two-player story mission, located in the Pale Heart of the Traveler location that was added with The Final Shape. It's one of Bungie's best missions, in fact, but some players have struggled with or complained about its requirements. Dual Destiny can't be completed alone, and because it requires a lot of communication and teamwork in the same way Destiny 2's raids and dungeons do, the mission doesn't support matchmaking. Thus, if you don't have a good teammate with whom you can communicate to complete the mission with, you can't unlock the Exotic class item.</p><p>Buying the class item from Eva gives players a new route around Dual Destiny to get the item, although there are some caveats. First, you still need to own The Final Shape in order to get a class item.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4390101-destiny2exoticclassitem.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390101" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4390101-destiny2exoticclassitem.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390101"></a><figcaption>The Destiny 2 Exotic class item for Hunters.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4390101-destiny2exoticclassitem.jpg"></figure><p>Exotic class items carry two special perks, which are drawn from other Exotic armor pieces, which allows players to combine those abilities to create special new builds. Those perks are assigned randomly, and you can buy as many class items as you want to try to get the combination of perks you're looking for. However, if you <em>do</em> complete Dual Destiny, you can unlock the ability to "attune" the class items you buy from Eva to get the specific rolls you want. So players who haven't completed the mission can still buy random Exotic class items from the vendor, but they can only get random rolls, not attuned ones.</p><p>Alongside the class items, the Festival of the Lost will also offer an opportunity for players to earn Superblack, possibly the best shader in the game, or at least the most requested. To get it, you'll need to really lean into the Festival of the Lost, though. The shader is the reward for the Ghost Writer event challenge, which requires you to complete 15 event challenges. Those are the special Triumphs that are part of the Festival's Event Card, so they're likely to require a lot of participation in the Festival.</p><p>Shaders recolor weapons and armor and usually several different colors and textures based on a specific theme, but Superblack stands apart because it's the only all-black shader in the game. Superblack was first released in the original Destiny, but it wasn't a part of Destiny 2 until Into the Light, the event that Bungie released ahead of The Final Shape. If you completed a lengthy list of objectives as part of Into the Light, Superblack was your reward--but when Into the Light ended ahead of The Final Shape's release, Superblack went with it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4390102-superblack.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390102" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4390102-superblack.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390102"></a><figcaption>Superblack</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4390102-superblack.jpg"></figure><p>This is the first time Superblack has been back on the menu for players. Unlike with the Exotic class item, though, you can get Superblack as a free-to-play Destiny player. The Festival of the Lost itself is also free.</p><p>The Festival of the Lost doesn't sound like it's changing too much from previous years, requiring players to take on different haunted Lost Sectors to defeat bosses and earn candy, usually while wearing Festival of the Lost-specific masks. The event is adding seven more masks this year, as well as Arcane Embrace, a shotgun with a new special archetype that fires two shots in quick succession.

While those may be the final big game releases from the publisher in 2024, Sega officially caps off its year of releases with a TV show based on the Yakuza game series. That’s a cause for celebration, and, more importantly, some discounts. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the new TV show Like a Dragon: Yakuza <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-watch-like-a-dragon-yakuza-show">premiering today on Prime Video</a>, Amazon has dropped prices on most of the Yakuza games. The critically acclaimed turn-based RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a> is at its lowest price yet. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">$40 Off Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth on PS5 or Xbox Series X</h2><div catalogid="a0712628-1cdf-4bf2-ada6-3589574b52ab" id="209660"><div id="209660" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth is the most recent addition to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yakuza-games-in-order">Yakuza timeline</a>, and $40 off brings the game down to its <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0CJHD3JZ8?" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">lowest ever price</a>. In my experience, 60% off a same-year release of this quality is about as good as video game deals can get.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To clear up some confusion, the Yakuza series rebranded as "Like a Dragon" in English localizations back in 2022. If you’re an OG Yakuza fan, have no fear: The recent Like a Dragon games carry the spirit of the original PS2 series through and through. Here’s what <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/person/tristan_ign_au">Tristan Ogilvie</a> had to say in his <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-review">9/10 review of Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</a>: </p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Yakuza Games on Sale</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/yakuza-like-a-dragon">Yakuza: Like a Dragon</a> (2020) and the spin-off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/like-a-dragon-ishin">Like a Dragon: Ishin!</a> (2014) are also included in Amazon's deals. If you want to check out some of the OG Yakuza series, you're in luck. While not the same level of price slashing, the remastered collection of Yakuza 3, 4, and 5 is 25% off. The collection was released for the PS4 back in 2020, but because of the PS5's backward compatibility the games work on either console. Same goes for Yakuza Kiwami 2, a remake of the original Yakuza 2, which is also slightly discounted. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Preorders for Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii Are Still Full Price</strong></h3></div><div catalogid="73cb2eaf-df62-41ec-ac64-06de169b8249" id="207607"><div id="207607" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii - PlayStation 5</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The one Like a Dragon game that isn’t on sale is, as you could probably guess, the one that isn’t out yet.

The best map for getting started, especially for beginners, is the Liberty Falls map. Here we'll explain how to gain access to the Pack-a-Punch machine, as well as the costs associated with those upgrades for your weapons.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to find and unlock the Liberty Falls Pack-a-Punch</h2><p dir="ltr">When starting a match on Liberty Falls, the Pack-a-Punch machine will be on the opposite end of the gas station rooftop where you'll spawn. This will take some time to earn enough points to access the area you need to go.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also more than one path you can take, with doors to unlock on the left and right side of your starting area, but we recommend choosing the right side. This will give you quicker access to the most essential perks of Juggernog and Quick Revive.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390067-libertyfallsbarrier.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390067" data-ratio="0.56277056277056" data-width="1848" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390067-libertyfallsbarrier.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4390067"></a><figcaption>Liberty Falls cemetery barrier </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4390067-libertyfallsbarrier.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Unlock barrier 1:</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Spend the 1,500 essence points needed to unlock the right-side barrier.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Unlock barrier 2: </strong></p><p dir="ltr">Head behind Ollie's Comic Shop to unlock the second barrier needed.

There's another Arsenal machine in the parking lot opposite the church.</p><p dir="ltr">Weapon rarity upgrades are paid for with the salvage currency dropped by fallen zombies.

Remember Balatro's free Friends of Jimbo collaboration update back in August, which saw the acclaimed poker-themed rogue-like adding a bunch of card cosmetics inspired by popular video games? Well it turns out there was more where that came from, and players can now adorned their desks with cameos from the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>.
</p>
<p>
Balatro's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatros-free-collaboration-update-adds-the-witcher-vampire-survivors-among-us-more">original Friends of Jimbo update</a> gave players the option to swap out the game's usual Kings, Queens, and Jacks with characters from The Witcher, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dave-the-diver">Dave the Diver</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/among-us">Among Us</a>. So if fancied bolstering your deck with a beaming Jaskier, for instance, or a little red space-pal, then you were well and truly catered for.
</p>
<p>
And now, Balatro developer LocalThunk is doing it all again with the free Friends of Jimbo Pack 2, featuring cameos from The Binding of Isaac and Slay the Spire, alongside Cyberpunk 2077 and Stardew Valley. That means you can now set Johnny Silverhand as your ice-cool King, Isaac's Mother as your varicose-veined Queen, even Stardew Valley's general store manager Pierre as your Jack - with all 12 new card faces getting an airing in the trailer below.

And beyond that, there's not a lot more to report - other than the fact Balatro's free Friends of Jimbo Pack 2 update is available now on PC, PlayStation, Switch, Android, and iOS. As for what's next, LocalThunk previously confirmed he's working on a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-passes-2m-sales-with-free-major-update-due-in-2025">major free content update</a> - promising to "bring new ideas and strategies to the game" - that'll launch sometime next year.
</p><p>
And if you've yet to play the absurdly compelling Balatro, it's definitely work a look. Christian Donlan had good things to say about its rogue-like spin on poker in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-review">four star review</a> earlier this year, calling it, "So striking and so brilliantly constructed, and something that has given me such pleasure for the last week".

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278781/overwatch-2-season-14-6v6-test<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blizzard is <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24151413/director-s-take-continuing-the-6v6-discussion/">bringing back 6v6 matches</a> in testing for <em>Overwatch 2</em> when it launches its next season in December. The company had previously switched the series to a 5v5 format, and Blizzard is now trying these tests to find how it can “make the core game even stronger” through a balanced new version of the classic 6v6 mode that lets each team have multiple tank characters once again.</p><p>Game director Aaron Keller says Blizzard knows the 5v5 format appealed to and brought in a new group of players, and developers are hoping to repeat that success with the addition of 6v6 (which won’t replace current formats). For a detailed write-up of what’s changing, you can read <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24151413/director-s-take-continuing-the-6v6-discussion/">the full director’s take</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/25/24206210/overwatch-2-six-player-team-multiplayer-test">In July</a>, Keller noted some of the issues 6v6 faced were hero balancing, game performance, and how to make sure players can still get into games quickly if it splits the population between 5v5 and 6v6 game modes. One hero balancing change includes giving tanks less survivability and making them not as powerful.</p><p><em>Overwatch 2</em> Season 14 will have two different opportunities to try 6v6; the first will use a new “Open Queue” format where each team of six must have at least one of each role (tank, damage, support) and no more than three of any role. You’ll also be able to switch roles on the fly. The second 6v6 test will happen in the middle of the season and will let you have two of each role per team.</p><p>There will also be a 5v5 test in Season 13 in which there will be a maximum of two players in each role, and tanks will be weaker than previously.</p><p>My colleague Richard Lawler, who is an avid player, said <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s change that removed one tank player from each team <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/25/24206210/overwatch-2-six-player-team-multiplayer-test">made the game simpler</a>, but also “made it seem like the outcome of the game depended a little too much on that one role.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Titled <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em>, the gritty crime drama follows the series’ longtime protagonist Kazuma Kiryu across two timelines: one as a teenage orphan in 1995, and the other as a hardened yakuza after ten years in jail in 2005. The adaptation is borrowing quite liberally from the beloved series, remixing numerous elements of the first game and its prequel, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yakuza-0-kiwami-like-a-dragon-amazon-show-1851662354&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-0-kiwami-like-a-dragon-amazon-show-1851662354"><em>Yakuza 0</em></a></span>, but controversially, it’s also charting its own path, and the move isn’t quite to everyone’s liking.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196578" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Total Recall: Why Yakuza Is So Much More Than A Japanese GTA" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="387" data-playlist="196578,194088,195755" data-current="196578"><div><p>Total Recall: Why Yakuza Is So Much More Than A Japanese GTA</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196578/196578_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22135.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>In one big change from the source material, Amazon’s adaptation appears to be mostly a straightforward and gritty drama. The <em>Like a Dragon </em>games<em> </em>are well known for their soapy melodrama, convoluted plots, humongous casts, and cinematic direction, but they also have a well-established penchant for irreverence. The streets of Kamurocho, where the games mostly take place, are filled with weirdos, like Mr. Libido, who gyrates and thrusts in a manic and sexual frenzy in casual conversation. There’s a yakuza family in the games composed of grown men in diapers who clearly have some oedipal complex. The next game in the series casts one of its best characters, Goro Majima, as a amnesiac pirate, and Kiryu could (and maybe <em>should</em>) leave behind the criminal underworld for a career in the arts, because that man fucks up a karaoke night like no one else.<br></p><p>And yet, <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em> features no diaper-wearing yakuza, nor are there any heart-wrenching renditions of “Baka Mitai,” and that is sure to disappoint a lot of people. This new show seems to cast aside many of these flourishes and embellishments, which the untrained eye might consider the fat of the <em>Like a Dragon </em>games. However, you’re far more likely to find fans who call these distractions and detours the very soul of the franchise, and I’m inclined to agree.<br></p><p>The cast and crew behind <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza-amazon-kiryu-actor-interview-1851592856&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza-amazon-kiryu-actor-interview-1851592856">aren’t without reverence for the source material</a></span> though. Interviews with the actors have provided insight into the production, revealing that developing Kiryu’s combat prowess in a logical way was a huge factor in the lead actor’s preparation. Ryōma Takeuchi, who plays Kiryu in the show, has gone on the record saying that Kiryu’s fighting style differs between the different eras covered in the series and is meant to be consistent with his growth and outlook on life, and his performance seems to be one of the more universally agreed upon highlights of the adaptation. There has also seemingly been an emphasis on Kamurocho itself, and capturing the way that the red-light district (based on the real-world Kabukicho) evolves over time similarly to how it does in the games, which span the decades between the late 80s and the present day. One spinoff even takes place in the mid-1800s, but that’s a conversation for another day.<br></p><p>Outside of the strength of its primary cast, though, <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza </em>seems like a bit of a murky adaptation. Some reviews accuse it of oversimplifying storylines in order to fit them into a too-short six-episode season. With the action of two huge games being blended into just a handful of hours, it appears that some beloved characters have been minimized. The action choreography doesn’t seem to always leap off the screen, and the show appears to provide very little time and space for the audience to wrap their heads around the complicated structure of Japanese organized crime, which involves a lot of “families,” patriarchs, captains, and more that I’m <em>still </em>learning.<br></p><p>All in all, critics are divided, with some feeling that it’s another outstanding game adaptation in a year that’s already given us <em>Fallout</em> and that its concessions to realism still allow for enough of the surreal spark of the games to shine through, while others find it to be a creative misfire, lacking everything that makes the games so memorable. Here’s what some critics are saying about Amazon’s <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza.</em><br></p><h2 id="h74192"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/like-a-dragon-yakuza-review-prime-video&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.inverse.com/entertainment/like-a-dragon-yakuza-review-prime-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Inverse</a></span></h2><p>The performances by Kiryu (Ryoma Takeuchi), Nishiki (Kento Kaku), and Yumi (Yumi Kawai) are a strong-as-steel foundation for this show to build on, with each giving deeply emotional performances that have real complexity and layers — especially considering we’re essentially seeing two versions of these characters with two time periods. Takeuchi’s Kiryu especially is a tremendous highlight, a daydreaming boy turned into a stoic warrior who nonetheless has a heart of gold that’s never been chipped away. But past that, the rest of the cast also gives stellar performances that make this world feel grounded, from the far too-tired-for-this-stuff Detective Date (Subaru Shibutani) to the deliciously cold and uncaring Dojima (Masaya Kato), head of the Tojo’s Dojima Family.</p><p><em>Like a Dragon</em>’s other biggest strength is that it’s unapologetically authentic. The show is unafraid to use Japanese terms and yakuza jargon, and the set design and costuming in particular are a fascinating glimpse at 1995 and 2005 Japan. The floral shirts and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.inverse.com/gaming/yakuza-7-punch-perm-like-dragon-ichiban-kasuga&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/yakuza-7-punch-perm-like-dragon-ichiban-kasuga" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Punch Perm</a></span> haircuts make <em>Like a Dragon</em> feel like a period piece just as much as a drama, exploring the life and inner workings of the yakuza and the seedy city of Kamurocho. It’s also beautifully shot, making fantastic use of space and angle to heighten the character’s emotions.<br></p><p>But at the same time, this show is taking inspiration from the video games, blending in a sense of surrealism and ridiculousness. There’s just a little edge of unreality to <em>Like a Dragon</em> that gives it extra flavor — from the<em> Fight Club</em>-esque underground combat arena to a secret mass surveillance room run by a police-officer-turned-yakuza. It’s that mix of the familiar and the unknown that makes Kamurocho such a compelling setting; it’s grounded and realistic but with a hint of the unknown.<br></p><h2 id="h74193"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/amazon-prime-video/like-a-dragon-yakuza-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pastemagazine.com/games/amazon-prime-video/like-a-dragon-yakuza-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Paste Magazine</a></span></h2><p>On some level, I’ll admit it: I am biased and went into this TV series with preconceived notions due to my extensive time with these wonderful, dumbass videogames. I was bummed out that the wacky sense of humor was entirely absent from this telling, even if that strangeness would have been challenging to pull off outside of a game where there are more natural ways to create barriers between different modes of storytelling.</p><p>But even accounting for this, Prime Video’s <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em> falls short of its own aims. There are some inspired flashes here and there, and you can see the scaffolding that could have formed a moving, decade-spanning tale of tragedy and revenge. But because the series is so eager to jump from scene to scene, it becomes difficult to care about any individual member of this large cast, robbing these turns of dramatic heft. It all ends up feeling like the show borrows a bunch of surface-level aspects from the games, like names and plot points, but fails to convey the deeper reasons why these characters and their storylines worked, all while it also comes up short of taking things in a new direction. Bad videogame adaptations aren’t exactly unique, but I was hoping for more from the Dragon of Dojima.</p><h2 id="h74194"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-yakuza-review-prime-video&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-yakuza-review-prime-video" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN</a></span></h2><p>The original game’s plot is reduced down to a rote tale of theft and revenge – I’ll save spoiling the specifics, but it’s both an unsatisfying setup <em>and</em> conclusion. And in shifting up the events of <em>Yakuza 0</em> to 1995 from 1988, there’s now no commentary on the absurdity of bubble-era Tokyo real-estate economics. It’s actually strange how much money is now flowing around at a time, when in real-world Japan, it categorically wasn’t.</p><p>That’s not to say the world of <em>Yakuza</em> isn’t rendered well in other ways. The detailed set of Kamurochō is delightful. The show is most enjoyable when you take in all the additional details of its worldbuilding – I especially enjoy the cinema showing posters of period-accurate film listings (even acknowledging the huge splash <em>Forrest Gump</em> made in Japan after it was released there in 1995). The final scenes here throw a ridiculous amount of the show’s budget on extras, and it makes the place feel genuinely alive and breathing<br></p><p>[...]</p><p>Without the <em>Like A Dragon</em> name attached, this series would get very little attention. There’s so little that’s very <em>Yakuza</em> in tone, and it’s so limited in inspiration from the games that there’s hardly much you’ll recognize from them. There’s great character work from some of the cast – particularly Kento Kaku as Nishikiyama – but sadly nothing very interesting for them to do.</p><h2 id="h74195"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/like-a-dragon-yakuza-sega-amazon-prime-video-1235141494/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/like-a-dragon-yakuza-sega-amazon-prime-video-1235141494/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a></span></h2><p>Video game adaptations shouldn’t be constrained with coloring inside the lines so fans can get their reference fix. They should, as <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em> does, feel free to explore different avenues of a game’s mythos, even if that means leaving the series’ wackier elements on the cutting room floor and fully commit to telling a mob story.</p><p>Despite its shortcomings, <em>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</em> not only puts a bold foot forward, making yet another worthwhile <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/t/video-game-adaptation/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/t/video-game-adaptation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video game adaptation</a></span> in the wake of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/fallout-tv-behind-the-scenes-1234999546/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/fallout-tv-behind-the-scenes-1234999546/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon’s <em>Fallout</em> series</a></span>, but it also retains the game’s gripping drama and shades of its humor while teeing up what could be an enthralling second season.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We put five pitches together (each more wild than the last) before they informed us that they were most interested in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a light hearted first-person adventure game set in a haunted house. It took us about nine months to get from that initial pitch to signing the project, by which time the core concept of the game had changed significantly. And since NanaOn-Sha doesn’t keep any fulltime programmers or artists on the books, we also brought U.K.-based development studio Zoe Mode onboard to implement the project. What followed was a 12-month development cycle jam-packed with blood, sweat, and tears unlike what any of us had ever experienced before. Was our mission successful? Well, that depends on what criteria you judge success by—but there are certainly plenty of aspects of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that we can take pride in, and some real takeaways to share.</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer Magazine, June/July 2012.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What went right">What went right</h2><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="1. Successful multinational collaboration">1. Successful multinational collaboration</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With so many parties involved, it was hard to maintain a coherent vision for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. In effect, we had three creative centers—us in Tokyo, our publishing team in Washington, and the Zoe guys in the U.K. One of NanaOn-Sha’s guiding philosophies is that in order to have games with cross-cultural appeal, you need to have staff from different backgrounds (Parappa’s character designer was American, as was the lead programmer for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Vib-Ribbon</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">), and this project certainly fit the mold—indeed, it was our most ambitious yet in terms of multinational collaboration.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course, this approach isn’t without its downsides. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s development was anything but smooth sailing, and we faced creative disagreements at every milestone. This may sound like more hassle than it’s worth, but we really believe that creative conflicts are a great way to tease out unique products with that elusive “universal” feel. Also, we had been reading a lot of articles about failed collaborations between Japanese and Western studios, so we were determined to prove that when done correctly, a multinational partnership can make a game better.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Looking at the final product, we really feel that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> comes across as a “borderless” title. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> doesn’t feel specifically Japanese, American, or British, and it has its own vibe as a result. From the very start of the project, we knew that the game wasn’t realistically targeted at the Japanese market, so anything overtly Japanese would have been a big risk. We did actually sound out several Japanese studios to collaborate with before settling on Zoe Mode, but we weren’t convinced that any of the other developers could grasp what a Western audience would expect from a “haunted house” experience. We needed our development partners to be able to synchronize creatively with us in Tokyo and understand what our U.S. publishing partners would expect. Zoe nailed it on its first pitch, which meant that we could focus on implementation issues instead of endlessly debating core philosophies.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From a practical perspective, there were several things that helped us pull this off. First of all, we hired a Japanese-English translator who translated almost all of our email into each language for the entire project. This meant staff wouldn’t lag behind on certain issues, because they wouldn’t have to read in their second language. Second, we held frequent video conferences, because face-to-face contact helped ensure subtle things didn’t get lost in translation. We also visited Zoe Mode whenever possible to make an effort to get to know each other and understand our cultural differences. Finally, we made sure that we “clicked”—if you don’t have good chemistry with your partners, it’s harder to keep everyone on a unified course.</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer Magazine, June/July 2012.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="2. Robust navigation system">2. Robust navigation system</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When we were pitching the game to Microsoft, two crucial issues came up: the camera and the navigation system. We were pretty confident that for a game that relies on atmosphere and spooks, a third-person camera just wouldn’t cut it. For us, Kinect was an opportunity to get players closer to the screen, experiencing things firsthand. If your avatar looks scared when you aren’t scared, it kind of spoils the immersion. Navigation was an altogether different beast. We ended up with an implementation very similar to our initial vision, in which the player uses his arm to point his flashlight and pan the screen, and walks in place to move forward.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Navigation has been a tricky issue for Kinect, even after 18 months on the market, but we were convinced that in order for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to be a spooky, immersive experience, players needed to physically drive the in-game movement themselves. Every movement forward is a step toward a potential scare, and we really wanted players to feel that anxiety, which we felt would be stripped away by any automove alternatives.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Designing and developing a system in which the player walks in place and points with his arms might sound simple, but it ended up dominating </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s development, and took up about 15 percent of our total resources.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Microsoft was concerned that players would find walking around corridors a chore, so we tackled this in a few different ways. We balanced the parameters so that a minimum amount of movement was necessary to drive the player forward; we implemented an “autoturn” option so that the camera would automatically turn around corners, which was much more complicated than it sounds but definitely worth the effort in the end; and we increased the amount of distractions, such as small scares and wandering ghosts, to break up the monotony of wandering around empty corridors.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite all this effort, which we hadn’t planned for in our initial budget, we were never able to fully convince our publishing partners that our navigation system was the best it could be, and every time they saw a different first-person Kinect title that used alternative methods, we would feel pressured to follow in line. It was a big risk and a big creative judgment call on our part to stick with it, but we feel that this has been justified by the number of reviews praising the system compared to the equivalent scorn poured on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s peers. Indeed, I’ve yet to come across a review that knocks </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s navigation system, and considering the generally harsh approach to reviewing Kinect games by the traditional game press, this praise was hard-earned.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="3. Aesthetics defined early">3. Aesthetics defined early</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Just one week after we had signed the contract, we were informed by Microsoft that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would be featured at the 2010 Tokyo Game Show, which was just three weeks away—and that we needed a video for the announcement. It was a great marketing opportunity that we didn’t want to pass up, but coming up with a high-quality video that would be reflective of the final product in just over two weeks was a real challenge. However, it really served as a catalyst for all of us to define the aesthetics of the title very early in development, and after TGS we seldom had any concerns about the visual style of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During that period, we held Skype meetings with Zoe almost daily. Microsoft wanted </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to have a “Disney’s Haunted Mansion” feel to it, and given that brief we attempted to forge a visual identity that was charming yet with a cheeky darkness to it. Our influences included the classic Italian horror director Mario Bava, Twin Peaks, and Pan’s Labyrinth, which were all pretty “serious” properties. But we knew that as long as the content was sufficiently mild, the game wouldn’t be too scary for our target market.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The only disadvantage to our aesthetic choice was the cost. It took a lot of resources to get the visuals to release-quality levels, and even then the rooms in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> are relatively bare. We now understand why most Xbox Live Arcade titles are 2D or controlled perspective 3D; when players are playing through a first-person perspective, they can’t help but compare you to mainstream retail titles, even if your art budget is minuscule by comparison.</span></p><p>Some of Haunt's in-game paintings.

Modularized approach to Kinect scanning</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By choosing Zoe Mode as our development partner, we were choosing a team with a long experience in camera games, due to their work with Sony’s EyeToy. This turned out to be a massive advantage. After some early experiments, the tech and design teams determined that in order to get the most out of Kinect, we should modularize input systems, rather than layer them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has very few occasions in which you can do more than one interaction simultaneously. Most of the time, you either do a specific gesture, or you don’t. As soon as things get more complicated than this, Kinect gets into slippery territory. Sometimes the player will run into false positives, where the system thinks that the player has done a specific gesture he didn’t do, or false negatives, where the player thinks he’s done a specific gesture but the system doesn’t register it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These issues tormented us when we developed Major Minor’s Majestic March for Nintendo’s Wii, but we handled it much better in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by managing the number of inputs scanned at any one time and then doing whatever we could to reinforce the results to the player. The more plural and complicated the gestures are, the more likely false negatives and positives will frustrate players. This is made doubly dangerous in first-person games, where players don’t have onscreen avatars to visually synchronize their movements with.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The one major exception to this in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is navigation; the system simultaneously monitors feet and knees (to move players forward) and arms (to point the flashlight and access the Xbox Guide). These actions are mapped to different halves of the body, so we could treat them as separate modules instead of layering them and relying on the system to distinguish them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Kinect is a paradox. It’s labeled a “natural user interface,” but many issues prevent most ideas from being implemented in a straightforward manner. We had to do all kinds of hacks to make things feel natural, or as close to natural as possible, and taking this modular approach meant that we were able to test them in isolation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Problems that might ruin your amazing Kinect idea may stem from technical, cognitive, or cultural issues. Our technical issues generally involved balancing lag and smoothing—Kinect’s skeleton tracking jitters heavily, but the more you smooth it out, the more lag you get—and inaccuracy (the false positives problem mentioned earlier, as well as the large percentage of players who don’t calibrate their Kinect properly). Cognitive issues came up when Kinect was unable to map things 100 percent to the real world equivalents due to various limitations—such as the fact that you can’t walk forward much when playing Kinect because you’ll run into the TV. Our hack was to have players walk in place, but as this isn’t a 1-to-1 implementation, players are bound to experience some cognitive confusion.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Finally, there are cultural issues; players can interpret things in different ways. We found that many American players wanted to perform walking with minimum effort, with tiny real-world footsteps amounting to large game-world footsteps, so we implemented the minimum footstep height possible given Kinect’s granular accuracy. If the distance is too small, we’d get false positives, and the camera would move forward in the game even when players were standing still. By the middle of the project we were pretty savvy about Kinect’s capabilities, and we could eliminate ideas that sounded great on paper but would have been crippled by its limitations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the future, technologies like Kinect will (hopefully) become more accurate and reliable; from a player’s perspective, there’s a massive difference between 90 percent reliability and 99 percent. If that happens, game developers will be free to create more action-oriented, high-octane experiences.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But for a spooky game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which encourages slow, deliberate movements, the current technology was a sufficient match.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="&nbsp;5. And introducing...Tim Schafer">&nbsp;5. And introducing...Tim Schafer</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Looking at the legacy of NanaOn-Sha titles, one of our hallmarks is the way we use voice talent. For the Parappa titles, we used musicians, not actors, to voice the characters. Their performances were never going to win any Academy Awards, but their flat deliveries had a certain charm— and the character models in Parappa were technically flat, too!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s vertical slice stage, we were using the partner of a Zoe staffer to voice our game’s only speaking character, mansion owner Benjamin Muldoon. The actor was very gifted, and gave a thespian, ultra-English performance with some gusto that many on the dev team were quite proud of.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, for NanaOn-Sha founder Masaya Matsuura and me, something wasn’t quite right. Benjamin Muldoon—or “Benjy,” as we called him—is a grubby old geezer who came to riches by surreptitious means. And he’s trapped inside a painting. He has intentionally crude animations—his mouth flaps open and his pupils roll, much like a Terry Gilliam talking head in Monty Python. It was pretty cheesy, and we loved it. Sadly, the crude, flat Benjy character just didn’t match the hyper-animated performance of our thespian friend, but we weren’t sure what to do until one day, when we were talking with (Double Fine founder) Tim Schafer at a GDC party in 2011.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tim invited us on a tour of Double Fine’s studio the next day, and after the party I suggested the notion to Matsuura of Tim playing the part of Benjy for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. He loved the idea, and it really seemed like a NanaOnSha thing to do. After the tour the next day, we popped the question to Tim, and after some moments of wild, inner panic, he said “Sure! Fuck it. Let’s do it!” and we never looked back.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’re very happy with Tim’s voiceover—his dry, flat performance is a perfect fit to the 2D painting his character inhabits. But it was a real challenge to get the performance just right; working with nonprofessionals requires that you focus the workload on their strengths and minimize the weaknesses.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first thing we did was allow Tim to rewrite the voiceover script. The original was written by British game designers (myself included), so in order to get a natural-sounding performance, we knew the script had to be in his voice. He wasn’t required to do any accent or place his vocabulary in a certain time or place. It was 100 percent Tim, with the freedom to take on Benjy’s malevolent mindset—which he tackled with relish.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The second key element is that we had to do a couple of re-recordings—Tim would tire as the day went on, and the more we tried to cajole him into tapping into more energy, the more tired his performances became. Doing re-recordings not only gave him a chance to re-energize but also allowed us to check the lines in isolation and weed out required pickups (of which there were plenty!).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Third, we found that the recordings went much better when someone 100 percent familiar with the game was able to attend the session and give some direction. This isn’t easy on an XBLA budget when 5,000 miles separate parties, but we managed to time a session to coincide with E3, which was truly worth its weight in gold.</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer Magazine, June/July 2012.</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What went wrong">What went wrong</h2><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="1. Flawed communications pipeline">1. Flawed communications pipeline</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There was one point of contact at Microsoft, Zoe Mode, and NanaOn-Sha, and generally this worked well. Having one point of contact helps to focus discussions, but sometimes it would clog up development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We would get feedback from our publisher’s top-level management, but by the time it had reached the coder or artist responsible for the implementation, it would have gone through up to five middlemen. This led to a feeling that the feedback was practically an order, rather than a suggestion or topic for debate. In the other direction, when we had to explain certain contentious development decisions—such as our choice of navigation system—we were never really able to take full control of the issue, and subsequently no parties ever felt satisfied.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This was compounded by several management changes at the publisher during development, many of whom we never had an opportunity to meet with, speak to, or even email directly. We had to re-justify our navigation system decisions several times during development, but even then we could tell that the top brass weren’t satisfied. Having to repeatedly make the same arguments proved to be a real distraction, and there was a real sense of frustration and helplessness about not being able to control our vision. We should really have flown to the publisher HQ to communicate our vision and passion for the project and just hammer out these differences, but in the end we never visited and instead these troubles festered throughout the latter half of development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our failure to resolve these differing opinions on the navigation system really shook the publisher’s confidence in the project, which ruined any chance we had of getting marketing support at launch.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="2. Survival by a thousand cuts">2. Survival by a thousand cuts</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When we first pitched our projects to Microsoft in 2009, we did not distinguish between retail and XBLA. Microsoft liked our concept for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and suggested that we pitch it as an XBLA title. The problem was that our initial </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> pitch was envisaged as a title focused around user-generated content, with players creating their own haunted houses, doing their own monster animations via motion capture, and so on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By the time the project was signed, we’d scaled this down massively but were still promising “unlimited replayability” as one of our core pillars as a legacy of that initial concept. Half way through production we were forced to cut that pillar, and the end product features almost no replay value whatsoever. We cut tons of items from our burn list at several points, since it was the only way we could hit the quality bar with the resources available.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This was a major letdown, and most reviews specifically point out that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a short experience with low replayability, which has cost us some Metacritic points for sure. At the time, we were hoping that games such as Limbo had made the prospect of quality-over-quantity titles more acceptable, but this ended up not being the case for us.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From the start, we were committed to using Kinect not as a tool to emulate Wii party games but as a way to bring the players into deeper experiences. For Kinect titles, where a significant amount of resources will be spent on refining the input methods, perhaps this “deeper” form is better off for retail titles, because on our limited XBLA budget, we found that three hours of quality left us with zero room for replayable features.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Perhaps the only thing saving </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from utter disaster was Zoe Mode’s use of Scrum. Throughout development we were able to rapidly reprioritize our focus and iterate on things until they felt right. The scope kept on dropping, but the quality remained high.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I would definitely suggest that any dev team embarking on its first Kinect project plan to at least double the usual contingency into its budget. There’s no avoiding the fact that to make an idea work with Kinect, all kinds of tweaks and workarounds will be required. In order to make room for this we had no option to cut, cut, and cut again.</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer Magazine, June/July 2012.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="3. Moving goalposts and target market confusion">3. Moving goalposts and target market confusion</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was something of an experiment on several fronts. It was originally part of an initiative to get Japanese creators involved with Kinect, but our specific brief was considerably wider. As was the case with Parappa, Microsoft hoped that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> would be a title that appealed to both core and casual gamers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During development, the primary focus shifted like disturbed tectonic plates. At the initial pitching phase the goal was clear—get casual Kinect owners to “dip in” to XBLA—but at kickoff, in order to fit in with Microsoft’s keynote theme for Tokyo Game Show 2010, we were announced as one of a batch of titles intended to appeal to “core” gamers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was never clear which group we should specifically target, so we did our best to appeal to both, and we ended up making </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> easier than core gamers preferred. Having said that, we’re pretty happy that the game does indeed have “universal appeal,” but upon releasing the title, it was evident that XBLA was truly the domain of core users. Should </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have been targeted more at those core users? Should it have been a retail title and marketed specifically to the mainstream? We never really addressed these issues by the time the game shipped. Instead, we were hoping that the game would create a new market, but we hadn’t done any spadework to create that niche.</span></p><p>Image via Game Developer Magazine, June/July 2012.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="4. Nonexistent marketing and community management">4. Nonexistent marketing and community management</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At NanaOn-Sha, we don’t have any aspirations to self-publish. We focus on making games, and we’re happy to let our publishing partners take care of marketing and community aspects.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> wasn’t specifically envisioned as an XBLA title, and we never really adapted our mindset to developing an XBLA game. Microsoft told us on a couple of occasions during development that it wasn’t responsible for marketing XBLA titles, but I don’t think we ever fully took that to heart. The fact that just weeks into the project we were being showcased at TGS perhaps gave us the impression that there was actually room for some marketing assistance, but to be brutally honest, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> faded almost completely out of the public mind after that initial showing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I’m not sure if people in the West are really aware of this, but it’s very difficult to gain mindshare in the West from an office in Tokyo. Out of sight, out of mind. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was never really a part of the conversation in the Western press. Our only real chance to recapture some mindshare was TGS 2011, but we bungled the opportunity. Not only was this TGS notable for its scarcity of Western press, but we had only a single booth that we had to share with two other titles, and most of the time, it didn’t even have a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> sign. Furthermore, our demo featured a level from the middle of the game that was too difficult for newcomers, and the atmosphere of the title was drowned out by the din and glaring lights of the show floor.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Overall, we were semi-aware that marketing was kind of our responsibility, but a number of issues stopped us from really tackling it. We had no in-house expertise in this area, and we all preferred to spend our time making games. Also, we hadn’t budgeted for it, so we couldn’t afford to bring in any specialist resources to help. Finally, any marketing that we wanted to do had to be vetted by the publisher. Put all these together and we had a genuine heads-in-the-sand issue that truly came to bite us when the game was eventually released.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="5. Poor use of usability testing">5. Poor use of usability testing</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Usability testing and playtesting is vital when you’re working with something as analogous as Kinect. How you initially envision the game, how it’s implemented, how Kinect reads players, and how players perceive what they’re doing is all part of an opaque game of telephone in which you’ll inevitably have to make tweaks and additions to make the game as user-friendly as possible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sadly for us, our attempts at usability and playtesting were too few, often flawed, and occasionally detrimental.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our first usability session came after we produced our vertical slice fi ve months into the project. It took place in Washington, and none of the dev team were able to attend, which was a real shame, because certain problems arose that we didn’t anticipate. We didn’t instruct the session manager to calibrate the Kinect sensor before the session, so the Kinect mic didn’t register any sounds by the player, which broke parts of the level. It was so frustrating to watch the videos and be unable to do anything about it. But we took what lessons we could from the experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Perhaps the biggest lesson from this session was that you cannot take for granted players’ understanding of text prompts in the game. Some were interpreted in ways we would never have imagined; one of the attack gestures is labeled “thrust,” meaning players should stab at the ghost to hit it, but one player interpreted it as a pelvic thrust! You can imagine this issue worsening once it was localized, so to hedge the problem we included 3D arrows indicating direction of action for all gestures. Even with this, some players were still performing unexpected gestures, so we also added bodypose silhouettes where we could. Ideally we’d have animated these for maximum clarity, but it was beyond our scope.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After that usability session, we brushed ourselves off and thought, “Never mind, we’ll be more thorough in our preparations for the next one.” Unfortunately, that was to be our fi rst and last true usability session of the entire project. We were unable to secure further access to the usability team, so in the end we resorted to doing impromptu sessions ourselves using staff, friends, and family. It was better than nothing, but by the time we got around to this, there wasn’t really enough time to make changes based on the results.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During the same period, in lieu of any true usability or playtesting, we received occasional feedback from assorted Microsoft employees in Redmond, but it never seemed to correlate with our own data. In the end, usability ended up becoming a political tool for our debates on the navigation system, when it would have been far more useful to focus on the minutiae of the game to improve the moment-to-moment experience.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A haunting experience">A haunting experience</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From a purely selfish perspective, we’re quite happy with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. We managed to release a charming title, with a unique control scheme and a memorable voiceover, and we did it all in just one year.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our biggest mistake was a failure to convince our client that the final product was worthy of marketing support, and our inability to compensate when they didn’t come to that conclusion themselves. Now that the product has been on the market for a few months, and the Metacritic score is comparatively high for a Kinect title, we’re starting to see those reservations thaw. The next step will be to talk about where </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> fits in the overall strategy, because as a digital title, there is still plenty of time for promotions, and some exposure around Halloween could still reap some dividends.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Any title that is unique—and doesn’t fit logically into your client’s portfolio strategy—will always be a risk, and only the customers can decide the outcome of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Haunt</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s destiny. In the meantime, I’m certain that NanaOn-Sha will continue to make innovative, trend-bucking video games. After all, that’s what publishers always ask us for!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-q3-2024-financial-report-cites-growth-for-magic-gathering-and-dungeons-dragons<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Hasbro Q3 2024 financial earnings report has been released. The report by one of the world's largest toy and game companies cites a decline in revenue alongside growth with their tabletop properties, specifically the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> set and the new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> 2024 books.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/static-files/8150e0fd-4d0f-4f25-a904-639e74eb79c2">Hasbro Q3 2024</a> report, the company's revenue decline 15%. Excluding the divestiture of their film company eOne which produced the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-honor-among-thieves-review-adaptation-that-understands-its-roots" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> movie</a>, that revenue decline becomes 9%.</p>

<p>But this doesn't mean Hasbro has lost money. In fact, <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> is marked as a standout in growth for this financial quarter, lead by the release of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/cutest-cards-we-pulled-from-magic-gathering-bloomburrow" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Bloomburrow</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/this-new-mechanic-is-magic-gathering-duskmourns-ultimate-weapon" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Duskmourn</em></a> sets and set to grow with the recently announced licensed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-magic-gathering-marvel-crossover-details-revealed-including-new-secret-lair-and" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Marvel cards</a>.</p>

<p>The wildly popular card game's revenue has increased 3% behind growth in both tabletop and the digital platform <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-gathering-arena" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering Arena</em></a>.</p>

<p>As for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, the Hasbro Q3 2024 report states the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-player-handbook-review-mixed-messaging-around-strong" rel="noopener" target="_blank">2024 Player's Handbook</a> is the fastest selling product in the fantasy TTRPG's 50-year history, beating plan by over 50%. This, combined with ongoing support for D&amp;D Beyond has lead to more than 19 million registered users on the digital platform alongside 60% increase in revenue.</p>

<p>Before this earnings report went live, Hasbro announced <a href="https://toybook.com/hasbro-organizational-changes-fall-2024/">sweeping organizational changes</a>. This "operational streamlining" of their staff included laying off 100 employees. Among those employees were four <a href="https://www.enworld.org/threads/hasbro-hit-with-layoffs-wizards-of-the-coast-impacted.707539/">from Wizards of the Coast</a>, including creator relations manager Dixon Dubow.</p>

<p>Overall, Hasbro has reported a year to date operating profit of $630 million with a $98 million dividend payout to their shareholders.</p>

            <p>I played <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/balatro">Balatro</a> for an hour, had a pleasant time, then uninstalled it. I know a trap when I see one. Perhaps you are made of stronger stuff than I am, however. Perhaps you like that monkey on your back. For you, there's a new free update, which adds a second set of themed card art to the game inspired by the games Binding Of Isaac, Cyberpunk 2077, Stardew Valley and Slay The Spire.

<p>These aren't new cards, they're just card skins and so only make a cosmetic difference to the game. You can switch to the new card art via a new Customise Deck settings menu in-game. Or presumably a "Customize Deck" menu, but I can't bring myself to spell it that way.
</p>
<p>The first Friends Of Jimbo free update dropped back in August and likewise added card art related to four other games: The Witcher 3, Dave The Diver, Vampire Survivors and Among Us. 
</p>
<p>While my time with Balatro was short, other treehouse dwellers here at RPS dove deeper into the decks. Katharine gave it a Bestest Best in her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/balatro-review">Balatro review</a>, and made a strong case for the worthiness of spending time with it:
</p>
<blockquote>Ultimately, Balatro is a game that delights in the art of making numbers go up - big, fast and on fire - by whatever means necessary. It reels you back in not to exploit psychological weakness, but to celebrate the inherent joy of learning, mastering and beating a system gamed around impossible odds, all while being just a teeny bit naughty in the process. It not only invites you to sit at the table, but openly hands you all manner of scalpels to tear into it, make it bleed, and gut it for everything it's worth - and it will smile and applaud you for it every step of the way. Balatro is very generous, in that sense, even when victories are seemingly few and far between. Indeed, the only way I ever felt cheated by Balatro is when I had to stop playing and not spend more time playing Balatro.</blockquote>
<p>Sounds great! I'm still not falling for it, though. Sure, Katharine said all that back in February, but has anyone heard from her since? </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>It has been a long-term concern by fans of the first game that Beyond Good and Evil 2 was no longer in the works. However, it was recently confirmed that it is, and now we've received news via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/fawzi-mesmar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn</a> that Fawzi Mesmar is joining the team as Creative Director. This was announced publicly on LinkedIn, with Mesmar announcing his new role at Ubisoft Montpellier, after previously working as Vice President of Editorial over at Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Emile Morel was the previous Creative Director for the title but unfortunately passed away suddenly last year. This led to Mesmar filling the role. This industry veteran has over 20 years of experience in the industry, working for companies such as DICE, King, and Gameloft. He additionally won an Ambassador Award at the 2024 Game Developer's Choice Awards.</p>
<p>For many, this news comes as a shock, as Beyond Good and Evil 2 was first announced in 2008, with a trailer being released during Ubisoft's 2017 E3 conference, and there has been very minimal information about the sequel since then. The original director Michel Ancel even left Ubisoft in 2020, and now works in a wildlife sanctuary instead. However, he is now consulting on a new Rayman project.</p>
<p>While there hasn't been any news on Beyond Good and Evil 2, a 4K remake of the original was released earlier this year. However, this meant that the original version of the game was removed, and people were forced to buy the 20th Anniversary Edition.</p>
<p>With Beyond Good and Evil 2 still reportedly being in development, this now makes it the longest development time for a AAA game, with Duke Nukem Forever's record being fifteen years. It's said that development has taken so long due to toxic leadership, chaotic direction and constant gridlock when it came to making decisions about how the game was going to look, and what features would be in the game.</p>
<p>In addition to Fawzi Mesmar joining the team, Francide Coldeboeuf is now taking over as Producer on Beyond Good and Evil 2. Considering the <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-sequel-isnt-happening-due-to-low-sales-ubisoft-disbanded-the-team/">struggles Ubisoft</a> has been dealing with their other projects, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-has-only-sold-1-million-copies-since-launch-learning-curve-assassins-creed-shadows/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/xdefiant-isnt-shutting-down-after-season-4-says-producer/"> XDefiant</a> not performing to their expectations, it's quite a surprise that Beyond Good and Evil 2 is still in development all these years later.</p>
<p>However, the title has reportedly passed an internal milestone with positive feedback from the leadership, as <a href="https://kotaku.com/beyond-good-evil-2-bg-e2-director-release-date-dead-1851679744" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported by Kotaku</a>. Whether that means that the game is actually progressing nicely is uncertain, and it's anyone's guess as to when the audience will finally see this game come to fruition.</p>

Highlights in the patch notes include more forgiving stealth conditions in “False Flag” and other missions, fewer collisions while riding speeders, more auto-saves while playing, and scaled “wanted” difficulty based on player progression. A bunch of bugs were also addressed, while overall stability and framerate drops are also supposed to be better.</p><p>Unfortunately, the thing many players on PS5 instantly noticed after booting the game up post-update wasn’t any of these improvements but a noticeable visual downgrade with screen tearing, i.e. ripples across your TV while navigating the world and even menus. The problems are particularly bad in performance mode, which is how most people play their PS5 games. </p><p>“I loaded the game up about half an hour ago and noticed the screen tearing immediately, tried fiddling with the settings for a bit but favor quality (40fps) seems the most stable with very little screen tearing compared to the other graphic settings,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsOutlaws/comments/1gb65at/screen_tearing_on_ps5/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWarsOutlaws/comments/1gb65at/screen_tearing_on_ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote one player</a></span> on the subreddit. “I just hope this gets fixed soon as the visuals are the only thing that game really has going for it and having to deal with screen tearing is just getting in the way of enjoying the game overall.”</p><p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> has one more major update planned for November alongside its arrival on Steam on November 21. That patch is supposed to go even more deeply into fine-tuning combat and stealthy systems, with a Lando-based story pack and free new contract mission types also getting added that month. That’s just in time to make it an extra appealing Black Friday discount pickup for anyone who hasn’t already given the Han Solo simulator a try, at least as long as no more visual bugs get introduced along the way. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
