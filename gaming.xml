            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's not unfair to say that The Wolf Among Us 2 has been through the videogame development wringer. There was a time when we thought the game would never be released, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/telltale-games/">Telltale</a> famously <a href="https://wccftech.com/telltale-games-closing-walking-dead/">went bankrupt and shut down</a>. Then the studio was brought back to life, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/telltale-games-revived/">hope was restored</a> for new Telltale titles, and development on The Wolf Among Us 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-development-reboot-unreal/">was restarted</a>. </p>



<p>But that was five years ago, and it's been three years since we heard that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-gets-first-official-trailer-will-launch-in-2023/">game was supposed to arrive in 2023</a>. Then it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-delayed-beyond-2023-unreal-engine-5/">delayed out of 2023</a>, and in the time since, we've only gotten some <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-gets-first-ue5-screenshots/">nice-looking screenshots</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-wolf-among-us-2-isnt-canceled-confirms-telltale-games/">Telltale's word</a> to make us believe that the game is still in development.</p>



<p>It's all taken far longer than anyone might've initially thought it would, and one former writer at Telltale, Nick Herman, who has long since moved on from the studio to be a co-founder of AdHoc, a team formed by Herman and other former Telltale developers who are due to release their newest title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-telltale-devs-announced-release-date-new-dispatch-game/">Dispatch, in October</a>, has shed a bit of light on what happened with this game's prolonged development.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-the-studio-that-wrote-the-wolf-among-us-2-doesnt-know-whats-going-on-with-it">Eurogamer</a> about Dispatch, Herman tried to answer why the AdHoc team, which was working alongside Telltale to make The Wolf Among Us 2 at the time, stopped working on the game and moved on to Dispatch. Herman also offered a potentially reassuring note, saying that in his mind, what they had written was better than the first game, and if it ever made it into players' hands, "<em>people would love it</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Look, the truth is</em>," Herman began before another former Telltale developer and AdHoc co-founder, Pierre Shorette, interjected in what seems to have been a coy way, since Eurogamer states he did it with a smile, saying, "<em>Yeah why did we stop working on that, Nick?</em>" </p>



<p>Herman continued, saying, "<em>We wrote a season, Season Two. We think it's better than Season One - and we were on Season One. And yeah, we're really proud of it. We were doing tests. We were in cinematics and animation and stuff. And then basically they needed more time.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>They weren't… We weren't running the project. It was Telltale we were doing it in partnership with. And we couldn't wait around and do nothing, so we had to move on to Dispatch to keep the studio moving, and they needed to go their own way.</em> <em>We're looking forward to seeing what they do with it</em>. <em>I don't know how much of our version of the script is going to make it into what they end up making. But if one day we were able to make the thing that we wrote and were in the middle of directing, we think people would love it. So, you know, good luck</em>."</p>



<p>At this point, only those inside Telltale can really tell the tale of what's going on with the studio now and The Wolf Among Us 2's development. Hopefully, it's a story that has a good ending, one where the game does cross the finish line, and lives up to players' expectations.</p>

  <div>
      <div><p>Paizo's recent crowdfunding project, <em>Pathfinder Quest</em>, is a runaway hit on Backerkit. The board game, which promises an authentic GM-less version of the fantasy TTRPG experience, was fully funded in just 90 minutes and has been steadily reaching stretch goals since going live.</p>



<p>According to the campaign page, <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/paizo-inc/pathfinder-quest" rel="nofollow"><em>Pathfinder Quest</em></a> is a cooperative board game designed for 1-4 players. Like the beloved <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pathfinder" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder</em></a> TTRPG, players can create their own characters, choosing their ancestry, class, and abilities. Alternatively, they can play as pregenerated characters based on Iconics like Valeros, Harsk, and Ezren.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-quest-game-contents.jpg?itok=slA2NMee 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-quest-game-contents.jpg?itok=bBQOc4k4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Those characters will embark on a campaign spanning 12 possible adventures. These adventures will be packed with exploration, combat, and choices that will ripple throughout the multisession campaign. Each of these adventures is designed to last roughly two hours and strikes a balance between random dungeon crawls and a more curated, in-depth experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Pathfinder Quest</em> isn't a direct translation of the TTRPG. Dungeon navigation, combat, and leveling up are still present, but mechanics are more streamlined. Whenever an action is taken, you roll Quest Dice, which are D6s, and you refer to the game's Challenge Book to determine the results of your action. In addition, it appears damage is not represented as hit points, but as wound tokens.</p>

<p>The game is available in two editions. The standard edition contains everything you need to play. Dice, ability cards, various books, character and enemy standees, etc.. The second is the Backerkit-exclusive Deluxe Edition, which includes special variants of those game pieces and sculpted miniatures. These miniatures are perfectly scaled to work with existing Pathfinder miniatures for your home game.</p>

<p>The pledge levels for <em>Pathfinder Quest</em> are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Apprentice Adventurer for $100:</strong> A standard edition copy of the game, as well as any physical and digital stretch goals</li>
	<li><strong>Veteran Dungeoneer for $120:</strong> A deluxe edition copy of the game, as well as any physical and digital stretch goals</li>
	<li><strong>Dragon's Hoard for $240:</strong> A deluxe edition copy of the game, a unique set of magma dice by FanRoll, four player mats made by GameHead, A Hero Miniatures set by Titan Forge, and a Narrative Companion App by Forteller</li>
	<li>&nbsp;<strong>Miniature Menagerie for $450:</strong> A deluxe edition copy of the game, a Hero Miniatures Set, Early Encounter Creature Miniatures set, Late Encounter Creature Miniatures set, and Time Dragon miniature</li>
	<li><strong>Animal Companion for $1000:</strong> Collaborate with Paizo to create an Animal Companion Card based on your pet or an animal of your choosing. This includes a high-quality art print illustration and 20 copies of the Animal Companion Card to use in the game</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, the <em>Pathfinder Quest</em> campaign has raised&nbsp;<span data-controller="funding-counter" data-funding-counter-amount-value="256592" data-funding-counter-currency-value="$" data-funding-counter-target="amount" id="funding-counter-project-2656">$256,592, more than three times its initial funding goal of $75,000. This has unlocked several stretch goals for the campaign, including additional dice, new undead enemy miniatures, the Oracle class, and a treasure chest-shaped custom organizer for all game components as an optional add-on. The campaign ends on October 17.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagates-2tb-xbox-expansion-card-is-cheaper-per-tb-than-the-1tb-one-all-time-low-ahead-of-prime-day-in-october-2000626069</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Video game files sizes have gotten ridiculous. As time goes on, they continue to balloon to astronomical levels that are frankly unreasonable. This is especially common among western AAA developers. Just this year, we saw&nbsp;<em>Oblivion: Remastered</em> reach a size of over 120GB. I don’t even want to think about just how much space&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI </em>is going to take up. While these game files extending into the triple digits of gigabytes, our Xbox consoles still sit at their base internal storage of 1TB. If you intend to play more than just the same four games back and fourth, you’re going to have to do some regular maintenance of deleting and reinstalling games — but not one want to that. The better solution is to get yourself a dedicated expansion drive. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4009/">Seagate has one made specifically for the Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. For a limited time, you can grab it for a hefty discount.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4009/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>Right now, Amazon has three models of the Seagate expansion card for Xbox on sale. The 1TB model is down from $160 to just $130, saving you $30. The 2TB version comes down from $360 to just $218, a savings of $142. Then we have the massive 4TB model, normally priced at $500 but down to $430. That’s a savings of $70 with the deal. The best deal among the three at this time is for the 2TB version. That $142 savings accounts for a whopping 39% discount.</p>

<p>Since the Xbox Series X only starts with a single terabyte of storage, adding on one of these Seagate drives means you’ll be either doubling, tripling, or quintupling your storage capacity.</p>
<p>The Seagate expansion card is super easy to install. While the PS5 expansion SSDs require opening up the casing of your console, these ones for Xbox simply just plug into a dedicated slot in the back. No tools necessary. Once installed, you can choose to have the games you download save to either your internal storage or the new Seagate drive.</p>



<h2>Play Games Seamlessly</h2>
<p>Games saved to the Seagate drive receive the same benefits as those on your internal drive. One of the features of this generation Xbox that Microsoft likes to show off is Quick Resume. That allows you to suspend your game state of one game while you play another. You can hop from a race in <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> into a quick&nbsp;<em>Rocket League</em> match with your buds, then pop back over to Forza to cross the finish line.</p>
<p>Well, Seagate officially-licensed the Xbox Velocity Architecture which is what makes Quick Resume possible.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4009/"> That means its supported on any game you have downloaded, whether its to your internals or to your new Seagate drive.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When I hear the name “Elder Scrolls,” thoughts of exploration, grand quests, and a character that’s a blank slate come to mind. A toy box of potential and possibilities that I can just have fun in, whether I want to become the most powerful mage in the realm or the master thief with a tendency to steal all of the wheels of cheese in the world. Somehow, the madlads at Chip Theory Games, known for their staggering component quality and games like <a href="https://zdcs.link/av3LpP?object_uuid=e8fcad37-61c7-46a1-8e9e-884d6e47b66f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Too Many Bones</a>, have managed to condense that sense of exploration, discovery, and player choice into a game that I find to be both one of the most approachable and daunting <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign board games</a> I have ever played.</p><div catalogid="24373606-beb2-4a86-a439-c1c94c0fdd2f" id="227820"><div id="227820" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Elder Scrolls: Betrayal of the Second Era</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Predating the video games (all of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-games-in-order">currently existing games</a> take place during the Third Era with exception of Skyrim, which is during the Fourth), Elder Scrolls: Betrayal of the Second Era allows one to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">four players</a> to take in the sights and uncover nefarious plots throughout three-act campaigns of the various realms of Tamriel. Whereas some games – let’s use Gloomhaven as an example – feature a single campaign that can take dozens, if not hundreds, of hours to complete, Chip Theory has designed Elder Scrolls to be a treasure chest that can provide dozens of smaller campaigns to explore. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the base box, you have access to five different regional books – Skyrim, Blackmarsh, High Rock, Morrowind, and Cyrodil – referred to as Gazzetteers. These spiral-ringed notebooks contain all the cities and essential information you need to complete the main quests for that region. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to the different regions you can explore, while Chip Theory could have simply left them as just unique map layouts or quests to pick from, they have gone the extra mile and made each feel like its own unique character. Each one not only features its maps of unique locations and overland spots to explore, but it also comes with special mechanics that impact other elements of gameplay, including adding abilities to enemies you may encounter. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Blackmarsh, for example, features a shifting weather system that will hinder your movement. High Rock has civil unrest that may restrict what actions you can take in towns. These elements further add to the personality and immersion of this adaptation, which makes me appreciate the whole experience that much more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A campaign is composed of three “sessions”, with the party following leads or helping out on a quest given to you by one of the game's eight possible guilds, which, with the end of each session, further provides choices as to how you want it to continue next. Regardless of the quest you choose to tackle during a session, they will never last more than 12 (in-game) days, with each day providing a new activity to partake in, be it stopping by and resting at the nearby town to restock on items and learn new skills, delving into dungeons, or helping a passerby. And if you're like me, who easily gets sidetracked in the video games with the occasional side quest, then you will be pleased to know that there is a large deck of side quests to take part in here too, including some hilarious and more outlandish ones like getting someone some home-cooked meatloaf. No, I’m not kidding. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A single campaign session usually took around 3-4 hours for my friends and me to get through, but this was cut down to around the 3-hour mark once we really had a grip on how Elder Scrolls and our characters worked. This means that it is entirely doable to comfortably complete a whole campaign over a weekend, or even just one day. This fact alone has made Elder Scrolls far more alluring to play, even if it isn’t exactly a small or quick game to set up. Granted, this time can, and will, fluctuate depending on what side quests you decide to tackle, how you plan out your days, and what enemies you face off against.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It is entirely doable to comfortably complete a whole campaign over a weekend, or even just a day.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">My favorite part of the Elder Scrolls video games is the seemingly bottomless rabbit hole that is the character creation system. I’m happy to report this has been carried over into the board game. All of the series’ races, presented on large cards you keep next to your player board, are here, with each option having a different allocation of base stats and a special ability.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is only the start. You also pick from different classes and weapon styles to further customize your avatar, all of which add different dice and actions you can take during the game. And for folks who prefer a more support role, there are options for you too, like being a Pilgrim that specializes in letting your party take free actions while in town, or swapping out treasures, or taking the Speech talent that can help you talk your way out of fights, removing enemies from the board. I’m not going to math it out, but between all of the available options to pick from, there are A LOT of permutations of characters you can play as. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The various stats and skills you decide on are all slotted into your player board into four lines, with two slots open on opposite sides from one another, with six spaces between. You only have access to these six spaces to improve either of the skills that are across from one another, meaning that to improve one, you do so at the possible expense of the other. I love how this makes even leveling up or picking your initial skills so much more of a strategic exercise with consequence, but it also provides even more outlets to mess around in subsequent campaign play-throughs. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, making characters feels a bit like a game in itself, and I will admit to busting open my game box with the sole focus of making a character. And all of this is just the start, as you also collect equipment and other items during your adventure that add additional bonuses to your character, all of which result in Elder Scrolls being a package that will delight fans who enjoy min-maxing their characters in RPGs.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>In fact, making characters feels a bit like a game in itself.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But, what good would a super cool character be if there was nothing cool to wack with them? For fans of Chip Theory’s Too Many Bones, the combat will feel similar in Elder Scrolls. Each attack you use has specific dice associated with it, and its relevant stat – stamina for physical attacks or magicka for spells – and your level in that ability dictates how many dice you can roll. Once a die is rolled, it moves to your cooldown area, making it unavailable to use again until it has returned to your active player board. Some skills even provide bonuses while in your cooldown row, but this row can also be gunked up with fatigue, which makes it take longer for dice to return and be usable again. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat takes place on maps made up from neoprene hexagonal tiles that, depending on the encounter type, are either static or expanded and revealed as you fight, with both enemies and players being represented by Chip Theory’s signature poker chips. Your typical enemies are typically picked by plucking blindly from a bag composed of monster chips, each with an associated level and potentially unique traits, from a general pool and regional-specific ones. This sort of “luck of the draw” approach, along with the inherent randomness of rolling dice for attacks, makes it so encounters can swing wildly in terms of challenge or how long they take to complete, but even the most challenging skirmishes felt more like exciting puzzles to work out than chores to suffer through.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are thinking this all sounds overwhelming, then you aren’t alone. With its nearly 100-page rule book, a standalone tutorial rulebook, multiple sheets devoted to keywords defining monster traits, and more, it can be a lot to take in and process. Just talking about it is making my head spin a bit, and there are more mechanics and other minutiae that I haven’t even touched on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, Chip Theory Games recognizes the game's considerable demands and offers a helpful hand-holding tutorial (a jailbreak in typical Elder Scrolls fashion). I also highly recommend checking out the free digital tutorial on <a href="https://app.dized.com/game/b80d4850-09ab-44ec-a1a2-48731c606f4e" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Dized</u></a>. It does a solid job guiding you step-by-step – its how I learned the game. Thankfully, the moment-to-moment gameplay is pretty straightforward; it is just getting to that point that is the biggest hurdle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of that content results in a massive box weighing in around the 20-pound mark (about 10kg for the rest of the world). A significant factor in this game’s weight, which is on par with a small dog (my Shiba Inu is 20 pounds), is thanks to the component type and materials that Chip Theory is known for – plastic, neoprene, and more plastic. Everything crammed into a box could be dumped into a bathtub with little repercussion (please don’t try this), with the exception of the rulebooks, which I am pretty sure are just plastic-coated paper and may not be waterproof. The quality is spectacular, but the pain in my back from hefting the monster onto my gameshelf is less so.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>All of that content results in a massive box weighing in around the 20-pound mark.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For all that Elder Scrolls has going for it, this is a game for people who know they like board games and have a good deal of experience under their belts playing them, especially complex ones. While the smaller campaign and smart session break-up make this an approachable campaign game from a time-investment standpoint, *waves hands* EVERYTHING else makes this far from a great “<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-beginner-board-games">players first campaign game</a>” option. Folks who love video games should not immediately jump into Betrayal of the Second Era unless they are prepared and willing to tackle the beast of a learning curve this game has. However, as long as you know what you are getting into and are willing to stick through it, Betrayal of the Second Era is worth it and then some. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elder Scrolls: Betrayal of the Second Era is a heavy game (both mechanically and physically) with an equally hefty $225 price tag. But in return, you get one of the richest <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">tabletop video game adaptations</a> as well as one of the most replayable campaign games on the market. The fact that I can enjoy a full story over the course of a weekend, or even a day, shoots this high on my list for game days with friends who I know are into more complex games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chip Theory looks to further expand on the system they have built too, with one expansion, <a href="https://zdcs.link/z6DBYZ?object_uuid=e8fcad37-61c7-46a1-8e9e-884d6e47b66f&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Valenwood</a>, already available and an upcoming crowdfunding campaign, “<a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/chip-theory-games/the-elder-scrolls-heroes-of-tamriel?ref=explore#/section/project-story" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>The Heroes of Tamriel</u></a>”, promising five new expansions “and more surprises” that launches in October. Elder Scrolls: Betrayal of the Second Era has quickly become one of my favorite campaign games in my collection, and I can’t wait to see what else Chip Theory Games has in store for this mysterious era of Tamriel’s history.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Sep 17, 2025 1:30 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Elder Scrolls: Betrayal of the Second Era provides players a sandbox to play around in, with one of the most re-playable campaign-style board games out there. It also has the most flexible character creator I've found in a board game. If you can get past the hurdle of learning and set up, Second Era will leave you champing at the bit to start again.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/elder-scrolls-betrayal-of-the-second-era-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>

These packs deepen Phyre’s story and reveal Seattle’s World of Darkness through their eyes, offering fresh insights into their motivations and new angles on the city’s hidden power struggles.</p><p>Players can choose one of six clans in the base game, each with its own distinct playstyles, outfits, and Disciplines: the rebellious Brujah, blood sorcery masters Tremere, justice-driven Banu Haqim, the persuasive Ventrue, the enthralling Toreador, and the shadow master Lasombra. Players must remain mindful of their surroundings or risk breaking the Masquerade—the absolute law of secrecy that keeps vampire society hidden from humanity.</p></blockquote><p><em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,383 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,915 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [24,263 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/532790/Vampire_The_Masquerade__Bloodlines_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/vampire_the_masquerade_bloodlines_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOG</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Overview Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 - Overview Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NV8gmuZFaM4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-adds-lasombra-and-toreador-clans-to-base-game-overview-trailer]]></content:encoded>

<p>These sections were pivotal to Black Flag's story structure. Following the events of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-97570">Assassin's Creed III</a>, Abstergo found new ways to tap into a host's genetic memories and wanted to use you--the unnamed character during these modern-day segments--as a means of gaining intel on Kenway, the late Desmond Miles, and the power the two were after. You and a host of resistors thwart Abstergo's plans for ultimate power by, well, getting out of and hacking multiple Animuses (Animi?) while also shooting and swashbuckling as the pirate-turned-assassin Kenway.</p><p>To make up for the reportedly cut content, however, Jeuxvideo claimed developer Ubisoft is adding more stuff to the Black Flag remake, including an additional story for the English pirate and fellow assassin Mary Read. Apparently, this is content that never made it into the base game, but it's unclear if this additional story stuff will fill out <a href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/12707" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the game's roughly 24-hour runtime</a>.</p><p>Alongside the apparent removal of modern-day sections, there are other supposed changes and improvements coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-voice-actor-hints-at-a-potential-black-flag-remake/1100-6532817/" data-ref-id="1100-6532817">the unannounced remake</a>. This includes overhauled combat and gear to bring this 2013 open-world pirate adventure closer to more modern Assassin's Creed games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-valhalla/" data-ref-id="5000-511540">Valhalla</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Shadows</a>.</p><p>In other, more substantiated news, Ubisoft just dropped <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-expansion-launches-in-september/1100-6533445/" data-ref-id="1100-6533445">Assassin's Creed Shadows' Claws of Awaji expansion</a>.

            <p>Paradox Interactive, White Wolf, and The Chinese Room have announced that the Lasombra and Toreador Clans have been added to the Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 base game. This follows significant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-sucks-youll-have-to-pay-for-two-clans-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">fan pushback</a> against the original plan to charge players to access these clans as part of launch premium downloadable content.</p>
<p>DLC is coming to the game, in the form of Story Packs, due after release. These two packs will focus on the perspectives of Camarilla Sheriff Benny Muldoon and Primogen Ysabella Moore. These will be included in the Premium Edition’s Expansion Pass and will launch in 2026.</p>
<p>"Thanks to our community for the frank feedback on Bloodlines 2 and the Premium Edition. That feedback made it clear: Lasombra and Toreador belong in the base game, so that is what we are doing," said Marco Behrmann, White Wolf Executive Vice President and Bloodlines 2 Executive Producer. "We’d also like to thank The Chinese Room for their quick turnaround on the concepts for the post-launch Story Packs. We’re constantly impressed by their creativity and skill in weaving enticing narrative threads that expand on the main story in Bloodlines 2."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We were recently invited to watch a presentation of Arkheron, the debut project of Irvine-based developer Bonfire Studios, ahead of its public unveiling, and it's safe to say the game looks very unique. Sure, it explicitly takes elements from other genres, but the final product appears quite unlike anything we've seen.</p>



<p>First things first. Bonfire Studios was founded nearly ten years ago by Rob Pardo, who worked at Blizzard Entertainment as a Designer and later Chief Creative Officer on games like Starcraft, Warcraft III, World of Warcraft, Starcraft II: Wings of Liberty, Hearthstone, and the ill-fated Project Titan (which was eventually repurposed into Overwatch). Pardo brought several former Blizzard veterans along to establish a core team that has now grown to around 70 employees, though Bonfire is still hiring in a few areas like Art, Engineering, and Publishing.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Arkheron has been worked on and iterated on for a long time with the help of a peculiar routine: the development team would play it literally every morning, collect feedback right after every session, and deliver some improvements by the afternoon. Bonfire even started private playtesting with a very small community last year to get more feedback. Now, they are ready to open the first public playtest, which will take place on Steam between Friday, September 19 and Sunday, September 21.</p>



<p>What is the game all about, then? Well, as mentioned in the headline, the elevator pitch is that it combines elements from Diablo, Dark Souls, and PUBG. Its ultimate goal is to create a thrilling team-based PvPvE gameplay experience that constantly keeps players on their toes. It is played from a top-down view like Diablo, but with the significant innovation of a shooter-like free-aim camera system that can be independently controlled and swung around the player's character, allowing for precise aiming, tracking, and split-second decision-making during the game's tense fights. This particular setup also ensures melee and ranged combatants are on equal footing, as the camera is close enough to make close-quarters engagements feel intense and personal without losing sight of ranged targets.</p>



<p>The PUBG part is factored into the main game mode, the so-called Ascension Royale. In Arkheron, fifteen teams of three players each (for a total of 45 players) fight to the death to ascend to the top level of a mysterious tower that, according to the game's lore, is made up of memories from the living world. The tower is effectively a reflection of those who reside in it and, just like any memory, it can change and shift over time. Player characters are indeed Echoes, souls who have died with unfinished business. They are anchored to the tower by the grip of a past they can’t quite remember and driven to do whatever it takes to escape this surreal Abyss.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In each match, Echoes start with bare fists and have to equip themselves by looting items from sources like treasure chests, monster drops, quests, and of course, executed player opponents. After gearing up for a few minutes, the Abyssal Storm begins to sweep across the entire tower level, leaving the beacons that appear on the map as the only safe zones. But there are always fewer beacons than there are remaining teams, making this a bit of a musical chairs type of game, for a team must always secure its own safe beacon to stay in the match. Needless to say, if another team contests your beacon, you will have to eliminate them to ascend to the next level, all the way toward victory, with the final showdown taking place on the tower's fourth floor.</p>



<p>Pardo explained that in Arkheron, items are the heroes. Each item carries a unique ability, such as a sword with a stun skill, a crossbow that can be charged to snipe foes from afar, a crown that can temporarily turn your entire team invisible, or a staff that can raise a wall blocking enemies outside for a few seconds. Since the items are dropped randomly and the characters themselves do not have any abilities, the game forces players to adapt in each match rather than sticking with their favorite build as they would in similar titles.</p>



<p>Each Echo has access to four item slots: two weapons, a crown, and an amulet. Most of the items that can be found in the game are called Eternal Relics and come in sets of four. Collecting two items in a set provides a set bonus, so players could gather up to two set bonuses at a time. Alternatively, when someone is lucky enough to collect all four items in the same set, they can either stay in Echo form and enjoy the 4-piece set bonus or transform into a so-called Eternal. These are the tower's inhabitants with the most lasting ties to the living world through memories they just cannot let go of. Bonfire plans to unfold the narrative of Arkheron over time through the perspective of the Eternals.</p>



<p>From a gameplay standpoint, transforming into an Eternal will grant you a fifth ability, but the flipside is that you won't be able to return to Echo form for the remainder of that match. During the press presentation, Pardo teased that the studio could rotate Eternals in and out of the active roster to shift the meta. By the way, Eternal Relics can also be upgraded up to Rank 3 by finding their duplicates (this includes items found by teammates). </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Matches in Arkheron last up to 25 minutes (if you make it to the tower's top level). Before starting, teams look at the map to choose their drop zone in yet another nod to PUBG and the Battle Royale genre. The map will also show beacons once they become active and outline which ones are already contested. Due to how the game mode is structured, unlike in regular Battle Royale games, there really is no way to avoid fighting and earning the win. It's even possible that the game finishes earlier than the fourth floor if all the remaining teams go to the same beacon; obviously, the last team standing gets the victory.</p>



<p>Besides regular monsters, the game also features a roaming, unkillable enemy called Fury that can show up and completely disrupt fights between player teams. The presentation showed how one player, with the other two downed (they respawn after a successful ascension to a higher floor), skillfully took advantage of Fury's appearance to defeat a full team of three.</p>



<p>Toward the end of the presentation, Rob Pardo noted that Bonfire decided to build game depth and mastery before focusing on approachability. Their reasoning was that a game designed from day one for depth can sustain thousands of hours of play for competitive audiences, and approachability can be layered on later. As such, despite the PvE elements, it's fair to say Arkheron will primarily be a competitive PvP experience. While the play test that kicks off today is only available on PC, the full game will eventually be released on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X, too. Moreover, according to Bonfire, both mouse and keyboard and game controllers are fully supported and on equal footing.</p>

The combat, for instance, was redesigned four different times before they got things right. It sounds a lot like the way Blizzard used to work. As Pardo writes:</p><div><blockquote><p>As we playtested Arkheron internally, something rare happened. The team fell in love with the game. That might sound obvious, but for experienced developers it isn’t. Many of us have been through projects where the work is meaningful, but the daily playtests feel like a chore. With Arkheron it was different. People didn’t want to miss a session. They got frustrated if servers went down on a holiday. They grumbled when a playtest was canceled.</p></blockquote></div><p>He notes that the alpha will be a little rough arounds the edges, but that that’s all part of the process. “Playtesting is how we make <em>Arkheron</em> better,” Pardo wrote. “It’s how we’ll continue to play the game to make the game, listen to our community and let the fun guide us toward launch.”</p><p>Whenever it does launch, the game will be coming to PC, Xbox, and PS5.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/779968/bonfire-studios-arkheron-trailer-alpha-date#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/779968/bonfire-studios-arkheron-trailer-alpha-date]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Earlier this year, Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">laid off a lot of people</a> and cancelled projects at various subsidiary game studios, as part of what company CEO Satya Nadella has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dear-microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-please-prove-that-an-ai-didnt-write-your-insulting-vacuous-blog-about-why-youre-laying-off-thousands-during-a-time-of-huge-profits">whimsically called</a> the "enigma of success". Elder Scrolls Online developers ZeniMax Online Studios were among those making cuts - they buried an unannounced project codenamed Blackbird, which was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-studios-canned-blackbird-game-was-a-nimble-high-flying-shooter-claims-report">reportedly a nimble MMO shooter of some kind</a>. In the process, studio head Matt Firor also left the company. Unionised staff members have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/zenimax-staff-discuss-microsofts-inhumane-mass-layoffs-and-how-the-future-looks-for-the-carcass-of-workers-that-remains">described the reductions</a> as "inhumane", demoralising and counterproductive, with one worker commenting that "a lot of practical knowledge just disappeared overnight".
</p>
<p>
Now, studio game director Rich Lambert and game director Nick Giacomini have been chatting a little about where ZeniMax Online Studios is going next. They still have plenty of ideas for new game projects, apparently, but for the moment, the focus appears to be on streamlining the update process for ESO. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>

"It was super emotional, it was awful," Lambert reflected to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-elder-scrolls-online-heads-on-the-aftermath-of-microsofts-cuts-and-the-future-of-the-long-running-mmo">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, discussing the mass layoffs. "But then after, you pick yourself up off the floor and [...] you realize that we have this responsibility to our community, to the game, to everybody else that is still there to move forward. That's really hard, but that's the goal, to continue to move forward and keep ESO going."
</p>
<p>

The Elder Scrolls fantasy MMO is in "a bit of a transition year", Lambert continued. The development team are looking at switching from the existing bulkier, chapters-based format to a speedier, "bite-sized" updates approach, in line with latter-day seasonal content thinking. Instead of dedicating themselves to one huge expansion for around 18 months, where "most of the team's efforts are focused on building the chapter," they plan to get "smaller, more bite-sized things out quicker," as Lambert explained. 
</p><p>
It's hoped that they'll be able to turn around these dinkier additions in six to nine months on average, and act faster on player requests. "We're kind of too predictable, and we want to shake that up and be a little bit more reactive," Lambert said.
</p>
<p>
That said, game creation remains complex, and there's no guarantee ZeniMax Online Studios will be able to chop development times in half, just by shelving the concept of chapters. 
</p>
<p>
"It takes a long time to build art, because you've got to model it out and you've got to rig it and skin it, all these things," Lambert said. "It takes time to code things out. It takes time when we're building stories: you're writing words on a paper and then you put that in-engine, and then you have to send it out to be voiceovered and localized."
</p>
<p>
In his <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2025/07/24/recommitting-to-our-why-what-and-how/">memo about this year's mass layoffs</a>, which come amid a time of seeming prosperity for Microsoft, Satya Nadella suggested that the overall idea was to transform Microsoft into more of a generative AI business. 
</p>
<p>
"The success we want to achieve will be defined by our ability to go through this difficult process of 'unlearning' and 'learning'," he wrote. "It requires us to meet changing customer needs, by continuing to maintain and scale our current business, while also creating new categories with new business models and a new production function."
</p>
<p>
Nadella added that Microsoft will "reimagine every layer of the tech stack for AI - infrastructure, to the app platform, to apps and agents". He encouraged his minions to maintain a "growth mindset".
</p>
<p>
With all that in mind, are the creators of Elder Scrolls Online making much use of generative AI, as they embark on what seems basically like a mission to pump out faster updates with fewer people? Not a whole lot, going by Lambert's commentary.
</p><p>
"I mean, obviously we've looked into it," he said. "Microsoft has got their big push for AI. But we don't really use a lot of it right now. I use a lot of it for meeting summaries and whatnot, because it just makes my life easier. It helps organise my inbox and stuff like that. But we don't have a ton of it right now."
</p>
<p>As for what ZeniMax Online Studios might do post-ESO-streamlining, Lambert had this to say: "I want to make more games. I'm not done yet, and the team continues to want to make more games as well. I have lots of ideas. Hopefully we'll be able to share those at some point."</p>

              <p>2022’s&nbsp;<em>Strange Horticulture</em> was a breakout indie hit for brother developers Bad Viking. The puzzle game about running an esoteric plant store hid so many depths beyond its species-identifying core, with rich lore, character stories to become invested in, and the rumbling sense of a sinister underbelly. Today arrives its sequel <em>Strange Antiquities</em>, which I’m delighted to report not only maintains everything that made the first game so adored, but also improves it in almost every possible way.</p> <p>Returning to the fantasy city of Undermere, we’re now working in an adorable little antiques shop that sells mystical obscura such as bejeweled statuettes, charm necklaces that vibrate with peculiar energies, and objets d’art that give you the heebie-jeebies when you hold them. The shop’s owner, your boss, has to head out of town for a few days, and you’re left in charge despite not knowing what <em>any</em> of the weird items on the shelves actually are. Thankfully the boss, a Thaumaturge named Eli White, also left behind his copy of <em>Strange Artefacts: A Guide To Occult Objects</em> by T.S. Gill, which contains descriptions of all manner of magical items. Sadly very few pictures of them, but enough information that, upon scouring the shelves and holding each object, you will be able to deduce which might be which, and as such supply them to your customers.</p>  <p>In this sense, things are much the same as in <em>Strange Horticulture</em> and your dealings with its otherworldly plant life. However, in <em>Strange Antiquities</em>, everything is a lot more detailed and involved. For instance, in the previous game you could pick up any plant and look at it, but that was about it. In&nbsp;<em>Horticulture</em>, every strange item in the collection can be investigated in four different ways. You can study its “Color and Composition,” use your “Sense of Touch,” seek out “Scent and Sound,” and apply your “Inner Perception.” The first three are self-explanatory, and each gives you a unique response for the object (unless they’re not applicable), while the fourth is a more psychic response to what you’re holding. For instance, a red bottle with a raised snake motif will tell you it’s made of red clay, while the snake’s eyes are “small green gemstones,” the bottle feeling smooth with the snake as “raised detailing,” and no particular special smell or noise. But you’ll also learn that to hold it is “unsettling,” and “the eyes seem to pierce my soul.” Such details are all essential to narrowing down exactly what this odd red bottle might be, and what it might contain.</p>

 <p>Not only do you consult the indexed pages of Occult Objects, but you also have a tome written by Eli himself called <em>Gemstones &amp; Their Thaumic Properties</em>, an ancient pamphlet entitled&nbsp;<em>On Curses &amp; their Effects</em>, and an ever-growing pile of papers and notes that will provide further information. And then, as if all this weren’t enough, you’ve also got a detailed map of Undermere with which you can interact, clicking on one of its 32 named and dozens more unnamed locations in an effort to discover new antiquities to add to the shelves. Locations are identified through solving puzzles either dreamt during the night, or on notes given to you by clients, and some of these locations then reveal their own detailed maps to explore, such as the two floors of Gleaston Castle, and the Catacombs beneath the city.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000626497" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626497"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626497">© Bad Viking / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>That’s a lot! And yet it never feels unmanageable,&nbsp;<em>Strange Horticulture</em>‘s superb delivery ensures you gain all these elements at a steady pace, and the game is never in a rush. You can take as long as you need for every customer, without any antsy comments or nagging, meaning you can just relax and leaf through the pages of the books, or decide to solve a map puzzle for a break, never pressured. Also, the game comes with a hint system if you ever do get stuck, and it’s a super-smart one. Rather than just spoiling a puzzle, it begins with far more gentle nudges, like reminding you to check a note you received, or asking if you remember what a customer recently said about something. Prompts like these never feel like they’re taking away from your solving the puzzle, rather just turning your head to face the right direction before you start. Keeping asking for more help and things get more specific, of course.</p>

 <p>But even more than hints, the way the game is presented does wonders for clarity. Like <em>Horticulture</em>, the whole game is played in the single location of the store, but this time the shop is so much better arranged. Customers appear in the middle, with shelves stretching off-screen to the left and right, and cupboards and drawers down below. Open the map and it’s spread out beneath the counter, and the same table is also capable of…well, I’m not going to tell you. Hidden all around this are tiny details, little knobs that, if pulled, can reveal secret drawers, and even places just below the counter with room for three of the mystical objects. Place the correct three in the correct order (based on other clues you receive) and even more secrets are uncovered. It means everything feels so special, all that thrill of a beautiful puzzle box, in the cozy setting of a candle-lit magical store.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000626498" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000626498"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000626498">© Bad Viking / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The game’s puzzles, whether the core identification challenges that make up the bulk of what you do, or the extra elements that appear in the form of playing cards or furtively passed notes, are engagingly challenging without requiring Pentagon clearance to solve. Every character is an intriguing oddity, and the game’s overall storyline is much more involving than that of the previous game. The whole thing has a much greater sense of depth, and the sinister undertones feel more pronounced, more intriguing. It is everything a sequel should be: the same superb idea, better developed in every area, to produce something that reaches higher, wider, and deeper.</p> <p><em>Strange Antiquities</em> is out now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2885870/Strange_Antiquities/">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Strange-Antiquities-2888529.html?srsltid=AfmBOoq1YohG3Je7f20IciRveA5b2Pg0pXeXQF4pxEGce_D_fu6vikOD">Switch</a>, for the ludicrously reasonable price of $16.</p>

            <p>Casting details for Amazon's forthcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> TV series have leaked, with fans speculating on which characters from the games will be included.</p>
<p>As shared by entertainment insider <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/mass-effect-138895669">Daniel Richtman</a>, five casting calls have leaked. These are: a young Colin Farrell-type male (30-39) with open ethnicity; a female co-lead alien character requiring prosthetics (34-39); a female human providing a parallel narrative from Earth; a Doug Jones-type male villain (40-60); and a male wrestler-type soldier (30-49).</p>
<p>Amazon has provided no details on the show's story, so it's unclear if it will be based on BioWare's original Mass Effect trilogy or if it will focus on entirely new characters in the same universe.</p>

<p>Still, these vague character descriptions have provided enough for fans to speculate on. In particular, the female co-lead alien seems primed to be fan-favourite blue alien Liara T'Soni.</p>
<p>However, the Colin Farrell-type male could prove the most controversial. Fans have guessed this could be a male Commander Shepard, protagonist of the original trilogy - but this would assume MaleShep is canon over the female option.</p>
<p>Many fans prefer FemShep due to the performance of voice actor Jennifer Hale, so Amazon needs to tread carefully with the TV show if it's following the games and intends to cement certain story decisions - Shepard's gender especially.</p>
<p>The female human on Earth is an interesting prospect, considering the only similar character in the games would be Captain Anderson in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-3">Mass Effect 3</a>. Some fans have suggested journalist Emily Wong could be an alternative, while one proposed FemShep could still exist in the same universe like the twins in Andromeda.</p><p>Saren from Mass Effect 1 would fit the bill for a Doug Jones-type villain (the actor is known for his non-human roles in The Shape of Water and Hellboy), while the male wrestler-type soldier certainly describes James Vega. But most importantly of all: in this scenario, who's playing Garrus?!</p>

</span></p><p>Of course, this could all be entirely incorrect if Amazon chooses a story separate to the games, though you'd surely anticipate the team leaning on familiarity with the games at least for marketing purposes.</p>
<p>Back in July, it was revealed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-mass-effect-tv-series-shares-fallouts-successful-production-team">Mass Effect series would be helmed by many of the team behind Amazon's Fallout show</a>. That's proven particularly successful - and notably takes inspiration from the games without following them directly.</p>
<p>Amazon's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-is-officially-getting-a-tv-adaptation-at-amazon">Mass Effect TV adaptation was officially announced in November</a> last year. At the start of this year, Eurogamer spoke with Jennifer Hale who stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effects-original-cast-should-return-for-the-tv-series-shepard-voice-actor-jennifer-hale-says">game's original cast should return for the TV series</a>, even if just for cameos.</p><p>"I think they'd be really smart to pull as much of the original cast into the show in cameos and Easter eggs and recurring and regular [roles] as possible," she said. "I think that would be an absolutely genius move."</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-digital-edition-revision-amazon/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-digital-edition-cfi-2100-revision-appears-on-amazon-europe.1300485/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The rumored new <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/playstation-5/">PlayStation 5</a> Digital Edition hardware revision, featuring a smaller SSD than the current models, is real and likely to launch very soon in Europe, judging from recent developments.</p>



<p>The CFI-2100 hardware revision leaked earlier this month, identical to the current Digital Edition save for the installed 825 GB SSD in place of the current 1 TB drive, is now listed on <a href="https://www.amazon.it/Playstation-CFI-2100-Playstation%C2%AE5-Edizione-Digitale/dp/B0FN7ZG39D">Amazon Italy</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.fr/dp/B0FN7ZG39D">France</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.de/dp/B0FN7ZG39D">Germany</a>. While the system is out of stock on Amazon France, it can be purchased from Amazon Italy and Germany, although with a delivery date ranging from October 23 in Germany and between November 11 and March 31, 2026 in Italy, suggesting that it has yet to officially launch.</p>



<p>As already mentioned, a very reliable leaker revealed that the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-digital-edition-hardware-revision-smaller-ssd-price/">PlayStation 5 Digital Edition CFI-2100 hardware revision was close to release in Europe</a> earlier this month. However, the new system was initially discovered a few months earlier thanks to certification documents filed in Japan, which detailed how the latest revision had been created to optimize production costs, which is achieved by including an SSD with a smaller capacity than every other PS5 Digital Edition released to date, among other things. Considering the CFI-2100 is launching at the same price as the older versions of the systems sporting a 1TB SSD, it would be a good idea for anyone looking into purchasing a PlayStation 5 in the near future to get any of the older versions of the Digital Edition while they are still available.</p>



<p>Besides launching new Playstation 5 hardware revision, Sony is also continuing to improve the system's firmware. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-september-17-system-software-update/">A new update is rolling out today</a>, introducing new features such as a new DualSense pairing option which allows users to pair the controller with multiple devices at the same, and a Power Saver mode.</p>

The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762883/analogue-3d-delay-q4-2025">Analogue 3D</a>, a console made to display N64 games in 4K, has had its release window pushed multiple times. That frustrated me for a while because I wanted to get my hands on <strong>8BitDo’s slick 64 Bluetooth controller</strong> that was made to go along with the console. Its release was likely planned to coincide with the console, but the controller finally launched just a couple months ago. The white version is down to $27.69 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DK6VCGBC?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, which is a hefty 31 percent off its original $39.99 price.</p><p>The 8BitDo 64 can also be wirelessly connected to a Switch or Switch 2, coming in handy for Nintendo 64 games that you can play if you have a Nintendo Switch Online plus Expansion Pack subscription. It’s one of a few controllers out there that gives you the same set of buttons as the original N64 controller (A, B, and directional C buttons on the right-hand side), but with some modern tweaks to the layout and feature set. The sole analog stick has a Hall effect sensor and is located on the left-hand side, with a D-pad beneath it. Also, the Z button is on both sides of the trigger grips. The controller supports rumble and a turbo function.</p><p>The 8BitDo 64 is also compatible with Windows and Android via Bluetooth or via a USB-C wired connection. If you wind up eventually buying an Analogue 3D whenever it releases, you’ll need a controller like this one because the console doesn’t include one.</p><div><p id="other-verge-approved-deals"><h2>Other Verge-approved deals</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>I’ve been seeing emails in my inbox every week about how RTX 50-series GPUs are in stock at many retailers, but the bigger news is that stock is apparently <em>so </em>plentiful that we’re seeing deals worth sharing.

It’s $15.19 for Prime members right now — a small discount from its original $15.99 price — but the code <strong>MFY2E8L7</strong> will knock the cost down to $8.96 before tax (a tip of the hat to <em><a href="https://slickdeals.net/f/18609412-prime-members-lisen-adjustable-360-degree-rotation-tablet-stand-holder-up-to-12-9-8-96-free-shipping?src=SDSearchv3&amp;attrsrc=Thread%3AExpired%3AFalse%7CSearch%3AType%3Anormal%7CSearch%3ASort%3Arelevance%7CSearch%3AHideExpired%3Afalse">Slickdeals</a> </em>for surfacing this deal).

It took longer than expected to be rentable, but now I know what I’m doing this weekend.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Whether you’re gaming on an Xbox console, PC, or Android device, the first-party Xbox Core controller is still one of if not the very best gamepad out there. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4145/">Right now, it’s been discounted down from $65 to just $50 for the robot white version</a>. That’s a solid $15 discount. If you want something a bit funkier than that, colorways like the deep pink, shock blue, and pulse red are on sale too in the $50 to $55 range.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4145/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>While Sony each generation has decided to push forward, adding on new bells and whistles to its DualShock controller design like a touchpad or haptic triggers, Microsoft had different plans. Xbox firmly planted its flag in the dirt back in 2013 with the release of the Xbox One controller and said “We’re done here.” 12 years later, the design is mostly unchanged with some slight adjustments to keep with modern times such as Bluetooth support and a change over to USB-C. Other than that and some slightly upgraded materials, you’re basically looking at the same controller that launched the same year<em> Grand Theft Auto V</em> came out the first time.</p>
<p>Nothing’s really changed within the form factor of the Xbox Core controller because it just works.</p>

<h2>Unbeatable Controller Design</h2>
<p>I played through <em>Hollow Knight</em> on my PlayStation 5 in the lead up to the release of&nbsp;<em>Silksong.</em> It’s fine, but I decided to gift myself a new Xbox controller for playing the new one on PC Game Pass. I haven’t updated my Xbox controllers since those first few years of the Xbox One. I’d been mostly using either PlayStation or some third-party stuff like 8BitDo’s selection of retro controllers, but unboxing my brand new Sky Cipher Xbox controller felt like returning home.</p>



<p>An underrated, less talked about, standout of the Xbox controller is its D-pad. Dashing and hopping around with Hornet through Pharloom with that just sings. Feels comfortable to grip onto for long game sessions.&nbsp;The textured grips on the triggers, bumpers and back-case are a nice touch which are very welcomed when my hands are dripping with sweat as I go up against the Splinter Sister for an eighth time.</p>
<p>Some new improvements that have actually come in this last decade is a whole suite of customization options. You can map out button layouts to your own personal preference with the Xbox Accessories app. Anything that adds accessibility for folks who need it is a win in my book, even if the person using it is just someone who grew up on Nintendo that keeps forgetting which one is the A button.</p>
