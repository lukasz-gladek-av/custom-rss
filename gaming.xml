			<p>It's been a while since Bethesda Game Studios provided an updated roadmap of what's next for Starfield. Fans have been reaching out to the developer, and now the game's official X account has <a href="https://x.com/StarfieldGame/status/1897709518013997493" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> 'lots of exciting things' coming to the game later in 2025:</p>
<p><em>We know you're eager for an update, and we truly appreciate your passion for Starfield. The team has been hard at work, and while we're not ready to share specific details just yet, we have a lot of exciting things planned for the game this year that we can't wait to talk about when the time is right. We’re always listening and taking your feedback to heart. Thanks for being part of this journey with us.</em></p>
<p>2024 was filled with lots of updates, such as the one that added the much-requested Rev-8 land vehicle, not to mention the Shattered Space expansion. However, the premium DLC wasn't that well-received, getting just a six out of 10 in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wccftech's review</a> by Francesco De Meo:</p>
<p><em>The Starfield Shattered Space expansion leaves a lot to be desired. While it introduces a more focused and engaging story compared to the base game, the average map and quest design, along with the lack of new features, turn the adventure in Va'Ruun'kai into a bit of a slog rather quickly. Although the tighter focus is welcome, the Starfield experience as a whole needs something more substantial to reach its full potential.</em></p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see if the game gets another full-fledged expansion this year or just some free updates. Bethesda's Todd Howard did <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-crossed-14-million-players-will-get-annual-story-expansions-shattered-space-set-on-single-planet-is-far-harbor-sized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">say</a> the team was gearing up to release annual story expansions, but plans might have changed, especially as the studio is very busy with The Elder Scrolls VI.</p>
<p>Still, there is that Starborn trademark that Bethesda&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/starborn-trademark-could-hint-at-starfields-next-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">registered</a> in the Summer of 2024; fans have been speculating it could be the title of the next Starfield expansion. We'll probably learn a lot more about the future of Starfield during June's Xbox Games Showcase. Keep in mind that one of those exciting things could very well be the long rumored PlayStation 5 release, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-starfield-playstation-5-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> to be close now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/goblin-stealth-gaming-returns-in-styx-blades-of-greed-out-in-2025-heres-the-first-trailer<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Cyanide and Nacon have announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/styx-blades-of-greed">Styx: Blades Of Greed</a>, the third in a trilogy of goblin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth</a> games known for puke-based mechanics and many a snarky note-to-self. I never completed the previous <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/styx-master-of-shadows">Styx: Master Of Shadows</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/styx-shards-of-darkness">Styx: Shards Of Darkness</a>, and if I'm honest, I fear Cyanide's impish infiltrator is doomed to forever butt his smirking, warty head against the 6/10 glass ceiling, with Thief's Garrett flashing V-signs on the other side.</p>
<p>Still, I have a certain respect for the series. There aren't many third-person sneakers like this any more, still fewer that have successfully gotten away with a protagonist who sounds like a chaddy Sam Fisher and looks like he should be cleaning toilets in Moria. So a quiet hip-hooray, then, for Blades Of Greed, which is out later in 2025. Here's a trailer.

<p>
What's the Green Plague up to in this one, then? The usual, from the looks of it: clambering up massive citadels, shivving or bamboozling their guards, cracking the bad kind of bad joke, making away with the treasure. You can still sick up a clone of yourself and turn invisible using Amber, but you also get powers derived from a new energy source, Quartz - these include mind control and time manipulation. 
</p>
<p>
The story is about stealing Quartz from the human Inquisition, and takes you via airship to three large environments - "The Wall, which marks the boundary of the human world; the lush orc village of Turquoise Dawn; and the Ruins of the elven capital, Akenash". New areas become available within those sandboxes via "Metroidvania-style" tool-gating. You'll also get to craft weapons and potions before undertaking each heist.
</p>
<p>
The setting has always been Styx's big draw for me. All that cobbled-together, piled-up masonry, buttressed by some respectable grimdark lore. I share Alec Meer's (RPS in peace) distaste for the character's internal monologue, however. "Clearly, a lot of money and skill has gone into making Shards Of Darkness, which only makes the fact that you have to battle past this woeful characterisation to get to the strong stealth meat below all the more tragic," he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/styx-shards-of-darkness-review">wrote of Shards Of Darkness</a>.</p>
<p>Re-reading that review, I'm struck by the mention of rampant fourth-wall-breaking, which I don't remember being quite so abundant in Master Of Shadows. Hopefully they've eased off on it in Blades Of Greed. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3290690/Styx_Blades_of_Greed/">Find out more on Steam</a>.

            <p>Chinese-speaking users accounted for 50 percent of Steam's playerbase last month.</p>
<p>Valve has released its latest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/">Steam Hardware and Software Survey</a>, which revealed a 20.88 percent increase in Simplified Chinese-speaking users in February 2025, making up half of the entire userbase.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/steam-saw-chinese-users-spike-and-exceed-50-of-worldwide-playerbase-in-february-2025/">Automaton</a> noted, February usually brings an increase of Chinese users to Steam as it coincides with Chinese New Year holidays. However, this year's increase was significantly higher than usual - 2024 saw an equivalent increase of 7.26 percent.</p>

<p>English-speaking users are the next highest, accounting for an almost 24 percent proportion of the userbase. Similarly, the Christmas season usually results in a spike in proportion.</p>
<p>The success of Game Science's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> is likely a contributing factor to this increase in Chinese users. While its player numbers have dwindled since launch, it remains a huge success story and has the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-already-steams-most-played-single-player-game-of-all-time">second highest all-time concurrent player count on the platform</a>.</p>
<p>Another factor could be the demo for Mecha Break, a multiplayer mech shooter from Chinese developer Amazing Seasun Games that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfestmostplayed_feb_2025">dominated Steam Next Fest</a> - it reached a <a href="https://x.com/MechaBREAK/status/1897105111476003317">peak player count of over 300,000</a>.</p>
<p>Other contributing factors could be the ongoing success of NetEase's Marvel Rivals that saw its new season launch in this period, as well as the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> at the very end of the month that saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-propels-steam-to-highest-ever-player-count">Steam reach its highest ever concurrent player count</a>.</p>
<p>What's more, this upward trend in Chinese-speaking users is likely to continue. If Mecha Break's demo is anything to go by, its full release later this year will be huge.</p>
<p>Then there's the likes of the PlayStation-published Chinese action game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lost-soul-aside-launches-in-2025-nine-years-after-devil-may-cry-and-final-fantasy-15-inspired-action-games-reveal">Lost Soul Aside</a>, as well as another Chinese action game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-fresh-look-at-chinese-fantasy-soulslike-wuchang-fallen-feathers">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a> (not to be confused with Wukong), while the free-to-play <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fragpunk-console-launch-delayed-as-neteases-shooter-hits-pc-this-week">FragPunk</a> follows Marvel Rivals as NetEase's next big shooter.</p>
<p>It's clear that Chinese studios are thriving, and that's resulting in a surge of Steam users in the country.</p>
<p>Yet political relations between China and the US are causing friction in the industry. NetEase laid off a number of Marvel Rivals developers from its US team despite the game's success. Reportedly, further downsizing is yet to come, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-rivals-surpasses-40m-players-as-netease-denies-abandoning-western-studios">NetEase has denied such allegations</a>.</p>
<p>At the start of the year, Chinese conglomerate <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-labels-tencent-as-a-chinese-military-company">Tencent was labelled a military company by the US</a> - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-threatens-legal-proceedings-if-us-doesnt-overturn-decision-to-label-it-as-a-chinese-military-company">company threatened legal proceedings in response</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Longdue Games have shared the first gameplay image from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hopetown">Hopetown</a>, their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> "spiritual successor" to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a>, coming soon to <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/longduegames/hopetown/">Kickstarter</a>.</p>

<p>At the time, I hoped this tone and tenor of trying too hard<em> </em>was just press release guff. No such luck, if the writing shown off below is any indication.</p>

<p>But let's first back up a moment, because it does <em>look</em> great. So great I'm having some difficulty believing this is what the game looks like, rather than just being concept art. It's stunning. The purple and yellow palette. The painterly style, soft but sharp with detail.</p>
<p>Then you start reading. "Let me introduce myself," says your character to a sweet old lady feeding pigeons. "I don't shit in my own drinking water - though I see that's not a deal-breaker".</p>
<p>In Disco Elysium, your character could find a leather jacket with "Fuck The World" written on the back. If you tried hard enough, you could even convince your partner Kim to wear a complimentary jacket that read "Pissf****t". Someone at Longdue evidently thought those jackets were a good baseline for character development.</p>
<p>Admittedly, I'm viewing this dialogue through eyes pre-exhausted by Longdue's description of your character as "a chaotic, self-destructive provocateur who sees humanity as inherently selfish and cruel" and "unapologetically cynical and dangerously unhinged". Disco Elysium was frequently self-satisfied, show-offish, and overly slick. But it wasn't ever, you know, <a href="https://youtu.be/rr56tvKSe28">Nathan Barley on the bus</a>.</p>
<p>The pigeon lady offers your character a loaf of bread. You've got three responses to that, one of which is categorised "Noblesse N'oblige". I like that name. The dialogue itself is "I'd rather lick the bin [knock the bread from her hands]" - a jejune and obliviously mean-spirited interpretation of why the chaotic cringe comedy options in Disco were so much fun.</p>
<p>Your "Gonzo" option is: "Yeah, feed the masses! So let it be done. EAT UP, SKY RATS! (Take the bread)". You ever see a sentence that reads like someone wrote the exclamation points first and worked backwards from there? The attempts at understated philosophy feel just as unconvincing: "They give the filth on the ground a fighting chance to touch the sky. That's admirable".</p>
<p>I don't expect or even especially want a carbon copy of Disco Elysium from Hopetown, but if you're going to piggyback off the imagination of people that<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-studio-bosses-humiliated-the-cancelled-expansions-lead-writer-for-speaking-to-journalists-claims-report"> have allegedly had their work stolen from them</a>, apparently justified by the sole contribution of a lone systems designer from an outsourced studio (who I'm sure is excellent at their job and likely had no say in the "spiritual successor" marketing angle), I think you should probably make a more convincing attempt to better understand the spirit you're succeeding.</p>
<p>Still, bloody gorgeous art. And, look, I'm obviously cherrypicking lines out of context from a single screenshot. I'd be very happy to be eat crow for doubting pigeons here. If not, there's always two <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yet-another-studio-formed-of-disco-elysium-alumni-has-announced-a-cerebral-sci-fi-rpg-just-to-confuse-you">others</a> anyway.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nintendo has added two more Game Boy titles to its Switch Online subscription catalogue - and you can play them right now. 
</p>
<p>
1994 classic Donkey Kong is the star of the show here - the highly-regarded puzzle platformer that serves as a continuation of the classic DK arcade game, with elements of Donkey Kong Jr, and also the subsequent Mario vs Donkey Kong titles.
</p>
<p>
If you've never played it before, there's a fun surprise after the first four levels - which are the ones found in the original Donkey Kong arcade cabinet. It's safe to say the game is bigger than just those.

Also available today is Mario's Picross - which is, as you'd expect, Picross puzzles to colour in based on Mario and Mushroom Kingdom designs. Originally released for Game Boy in 1995, this was one of the earliest Picross games, and the first to the west.

			<p>It's been exactly a year since Frogwares <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-goes-to-kickstarter-soon-as-frogwares-needs-a-safety-net-from-the-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> its fans that The Sinking City 2 would get a Kickstarter funding campaign. Back then, the Ukrainian studio aimed to launch it shortly, but clearly, there were some hiccups.</p>
<p>The campaign is finally <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2?ref=discovery_category&amp;total_hits=21544&amp;category_id=35" target="_blank" rel="noopener">live</a>, though, and its minimum goal of €100K has already been nearly doubled as of this writing. So far, Frogwares has not shared any info on the stretch goals, but they're sure to come with 29 days left in the campaign.</p>

<p>Wael Amr, CEO of Frogwares, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>After 3 years of this horrid war hanging over our daily lives, we've learned to adapt, though it has never been easy. In 2023 when we released Sherlock Holmes The Awakened with the help of Kickstarter and our loving fans, we built ourselves a safety net that saved us more than once. From power outages and the need for team members to relocate on short notice, to having to pause development for days, this safety net was crucial. Given that The Sinking City 2 is a far more complex and demanding game, we’ve decided to take the same route as before.</em></p>
<p>Frogwares Publishing Director Sergiy Oganesyan also spoke about the previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sinking-city-2-announcement-ue5-horror-frogwares-deliver-ukraine-war/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> slight genre change, moving away from adventure to a full-fledged horror title:</p>
<p><em>When we announced The Sinking City 2 back in 2024, we stated this is going to be our chance to shift our studio into creating games that are more “horror first” focused and the results we’re all seeing internally are extremely promising. We’re not ditching our investigation roots entirely, but the chance to spread and challenge our norms has really helped the team grow. We’ve placed combat and exploration first while still keeping an air of investigation that adds depth but is entirely optional.</em></p>

<p>The Sinking City 2 is being made with Unreal Engine 5 and will launch on PC (Steam, Epic Games Store, GOG), PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-confirmed-to-have-been-co-developed-with-sony/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>AMD FSR 4, the latest version of the upscaling technology made by AMD, was co-developed with Sony. The news came <a href="https://x.com/amdradeon/status/1897741520200962308" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a tweet</a> pushed by AMD itself, where it was added that this is just the beginning:</p>
<p><em>Happy Radeon Day! We’re proud to collaborate with PlayStation on Project Amethyst!</em></p>
<p><em>FSR 4 is looking fantastic! Excited for the co-development with Sony Interactive Entertainment on the models used for the AMD FSR 4 upscaler. This is just the beginning. Stay tuned for what’s next!</em></p>
<p>For those who may not remember, the joint machine learning project Amethyst was announced in late 2024 by Sony. In an <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mark-cerny-qa-we-ask-about-vrr-improvements-pssr-fg-path-tracing-and-ml-project-with-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exclusive Wccftech interview with Mark Cerny</a>, the PlayStation 5 Pro System Architect explained:</p>
<p><em>Pretty much when PlayStation 5 Pro was wrapping up, we began discussions and development of those various aspects of Amethyst. To get more specific, I think we were getting pretty good momentum by the end of 2023. But as you know, it takes a phenomenally long amount of time to go from discussions and concepting to actually having a piece of hardware out in the marketplace.</em></p>
<p><em>We're looking to co-develop performant new AI architectures that can be used freely in any space that anybody chooses to use them, whether that is PC, console, or cloud. For the software, if I look at it today, we have games that run on a TV and there's a certain set of developers that make them, and AMD for PC has games that run on PC monitors that have a somewhat overlapping set of developers that make games for them. There are different needs and different relationships there, so really what we're looking to do is to co-develop those network architectures and those training strategies that can then be freely used in both contexts.</em></p>
<p>The collaboration is specifically on the AI models, then. It's the big AMD FSR 4 change, after all. FSR 1 was just a spatial upscaler, whereas FSR 2 switched to a temporal upscaler. Neither could possibly perform as well as an AI model, though, which has now been proven with the launch of FSR 4, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-better-fsr3-dlss-cnn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described as a massive improvement over FSR 3</a>. Of course, the trade off is that AMD had to restrict it to the new Radeon RX 9000 Series, just like NVIDIA has been doing with DLSS and its GeForce RTX Series.</p>
<p>Still, AMD should definitely be commended for its efforts to catch up with NVIDIA. While the DLSS 4 transformer model remains the gold standard for upscaling, AMD FSR 4 has reduced that gap considerably, a far from easy feat to accomplish given NVIDIA's headstart. The increased competition in the space will no doubt spur NVIDIA to further improvements and so on, eventually benefiting all users.</p>

As in Pokemon Go Fest's previous stops, Niantic will provide a curated route that will let players take in some of Paris' landmarks while keeping an eye out for elusive Pokemon. The Parc de Sceaux will have real-life Pokemon habitats where players can meet Pokemon mascots and trainers, compete head-to-head in the PVP battle ground, and shop for exclusive merchandise.</p><p>"The charm of Paris, its walkability, and its globally recognized landmarks create the perfect playground for Pokémon GO Fest," said Pokemon Go Live Events Marketing Manager Lena Cillis in a statement. "We're eager to see Trainers explore this beautiful city and the elegant Parc de Sceaux alongside France's passionate community and visitors from around the world."</p><p>Before this event, Pokemon Go Fest will visit Osaka, Japan from May 29-June 1, and Jersey City, New Jersey from June 6-8. Following Pokemon Go Fest: Paris, Ninatic will hold a Pokemon Go Fest Global event from June 28-29.</p><p>If you're looking for something to do sooner, Niantic has already shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-march-2025-events-raids-spotlight-hours-community-days-and-more/1100-6529806/" data-ref-id="1100-6529806">the Pokemon Go events for March</a>.

                <p>In WWE 2K25's new Island mode, you'll explore an open-world PvPvE hub full of shops, events, and other players. But one thing you might lose track of is how to change your character's appearance in The Island. In our brief guide, we'll walk you through how to do just that, so your future WWE superstar can look just the way you want them to. Better yet, this same method we'll show you also lets you adjust their moveset to your liking.</p><h2>How to customize your character's appearance and moves in WWE 2K25 The Island</h2><p>There's only one way to change what your character looks like in The Island, since it's a mode split off from your library of create-a-wrestlers (CAWs) and your MyRise story mode superstar. When you create your Island character, the game might usher you right past the customization suite, leaving you to need to get back to it after some brief onboarding into the new mode. </p><p>Once you can freely explore the Island, you'll want to look for a pathway between the pink-colored barber shop and the Nike and Jordan stores. Down that way, you'll see an elaborate building decorated with Cody Rhodes' American Nightmare logo.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4455035-4597630f-d8bd-4d82-b2b6-7d09927064d7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455035" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4455035-4597630f-d8bd-4d82-b2b6-7d09927064d7.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455035"></a><figcaption>Head down the pathway you see in the image behind Larry David here...</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4455035-4597630f-d8bd-4d82-b2b6-7d09927064d7.jpg"></figure><p>Head down that pathway and look to the left of Rhodes' hub. There, you'll see a kiosk called MyBooth--these 2K games love branding by removing the space between words. Interact with the circular kiosk to jump into a menu where you can change your wrestler's appearance or moves. There are other MyBooth stations around the Island, but this is the one closest to where you load into the world. Since the mode strangely lacks a map, we'll just say you can generally expect to find a MyBooth kiosk near a few of the distinct zones within the Island hub. There's another one by the Hall of Legends, for example, and another in the Temple of the Ancestors. </p><p>Everything currently available to your character will be there, and beyond the build options you chose at their creation--like their fighting style, height, and weight--nothing is untouchable, so you can continue to edit them as much as you'd like. As you see in the screenshots here, I tried making Larry David. If you see him around the Island, just leave him be. He hates a stop-and-chat.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4455036-a4a38d44-938d-49f0-a4c3-194f1ed64eb4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455036" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4455036-a4a38d44-938d-49f0-a4c3-194f1ed64eb4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4455036"></a><figcaption>...then interact with MyBooth to change your character's look and moveset.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4455036-a4a38d44-938d-49f0-a4c3-194f1ed64eb4.jpg"></figure><p>For more on WWE 2K25, don't miss the full <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/wwe-2k25-showcase-match-list-all-bloodline-matches-and-rewards/2900-6302/" data-ref-id="2900-6302">Showcase matches list</a>, with all rewards and unlockables detailed.

Frogwares' <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2?ref=checkout_rewards_page">Kickstarter campaign for The Sinking City 2</a> is now live, and has smashed through its crowdfunding target in less than a day - raising over £140K at the time or writing.
</p>
<p>
As part of its crowdfunding drive, Frogwares has shared new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sinking-city-2">The Sinking City 2</a> details - confirming the Lovecratian sequel to be a standalone story featuring new characters and locations. It's once again set in 1920s America, but instead of revisting Oakmont, players'll this time be exploring the flooded streets and crumbling buildings of Arkham itself.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sinking-city-2-will-pivot-to-a-horror-focus">previously revealed</a>, The Sinking City 2 - which is Frogwares' first Unreal Engine 5 game - marks a shift away from the deduction focus of its predecessor. It's a sequel firmly in survival horror territory, with combat and exploration said to be the core mechanics this time around - which is perhaps a gamble given combat has historically been Frogawares' achilles heel.

Investigation work <em>does</em> return, but now it's described as an "optional yet highly useful tool", that'll help players uncover secrets, gameplay bonuses, and lore. The Sinking City 2 is also set to feature a smaller map - explorable both on foot and by boat - that's aiming to provide a "better flow and concentration of things to discover".
</p>
<p>
You'll find a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2?ref=checkout_rewards_page">few more details on The Sinking City 2's Kickstarter page</a>, and there's a look at some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtyEOb2IBZQ">pre-alpha gameplay</a> in the trailer above.
</p>
<p>
Frogwares is aiming to release The Sinking City 2 on  PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S later this year. And if you want to get involved with its crowdfunding campaign - which it says will help "essentially guarantee our team the time and resources needed to explore" new features - there's still 29 days left before things come to a close.
</p>
<p>
The Ukraine-based Frogwares successfully took a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frogwares-remaking-sherlock-holmes-and-cthulhu-crossover-the-awakened">similar crowdfunding approach with 2023's Sherlock Holmes: The Awakened,</a> as  it continued to adjust to life during Russia's ongoing invasion. "This financial safety net proved invaluable to us," the studio writes in its latest Kickstarter campaign, "so we need to do the same now with The Sinking City 2 as this game is vastly bigger and more complex."

<h2>Viral success (for someone else)</h2>
<p>VoltekPlay <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1j3zr6n/comment/mg4va8a/">writes on Reddit</a> that it was only alerted to the existence of <em>My Baby or Not!</em> on iOS by "a suspicious burst of traffic on our itch.io page—all coming from Google organic search." Only after adding a "where did you find our game?" player poll to the page were the developers made aware of some <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@moonliteskye/video/7478018135375842568">popular TikTok videos</a> featuring the iOS version.</p>
<p>"Luckily, some people in the [Tiktok] comments mentioned the real game name—<em>Diapers, Please!</em>—so a few thousand players were able to google their way to our page," VoltekPlay writes. "I can only imagine how many more ended up on the thief’s App Store page instead."</p>
<p>Earlier this week, the $2.99 iOS release of <em>My Baby or Not!</em> was <a href="https://app.sensortower.com/overview/6742455066?country=US&amp;tab=category_rankings">quickly climbing iOS's paid games charts</a>, attracting an estimated 20,000 downloads overall, <a href="https://app.sensortower.com/publisher/ios/1758988688/?page=1&amp;page_size=25">according to Sensor Tower</a>.</p>

<p>The App Store listing credited <em>My Baby or Not!</em> to "Marwane Benyssef," a new iOS developer with no apparent history in the game development community. Benyssef's only other iOS game, <em>Kiosk Food Night Shift</em>, was released last August and appears to be a direct copy of <em>Kiosk</em>, a pay-what-you-want title that was <a href="https://vividev.itch.io/kiosk/">posted to itch.io last year</a> (with a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3126330/Kiosk/">subsequent "full" release on Steam</a> this year)</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1j3zr6n/someone_stole_our_game_from_itchio_renamed_it_and/">a Reddit post</a>, the team at VoltekPlay said that they had filed a DMCA copyright claim against <em>My Baby or Not!</em> Apple subsequently shared that claim with Bennysof, VoltekPlay writes, along with a message that "Apple encourages the parties to a dispute to work directly with one another to resolve the claim."</p>
<p>This morning, Ars reached out to Apple to request a comment on the situation. While awaiting a response (which Apple has yet to provide), Apple appears to have removed Benyssef's developer page and all traces of their games from the iOS App Store.</p>
