			<p>When indie developer Supergiant released the first Hades game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-damned-great/">out of early access in 2020</a>, it was nothing short of a masterpiece. An excellently crafted game that elevated rougelikes by weaving the storytelling and gameplay together in stronger and better ways than we'd previously seen in the genre.</p>



<p>It's a tightly made game, with incredible and twitchy action, a stunning visual language with evocative character and environmental design, and a wonderful score. It's very well written with strong voice performances to match, and above all else, it is an absolute blast. It was my personal pick for GOTY in 2020 and it remains one of the best games I've ever played. </p>



<p>At the time, none of that really surprised me. I've been playing <a href="http://wccftech.com/bastion-sells-500000-copies-wins-60-awards/">Supergiant-made games since Bastion</a>, and I know this is a studio that absolutely does not miss. I also knew that they had, at that point, never made a sequel to any of their games; they just moved on to a different project. I never yearned for a Hades 2, because I didn't expect it, and I just wanted another Supergiant game, whatever it happened to be.</p>

<p>Which is why I was both shocked and endlessly curious when Hades 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-ii-announced-trailer/">was initially revealed</a>. It's the first time Supergiant is making a sequel to one of its games, and while the studio has proven to me that they can make a damn good video game at least four times over, a sequel adds a whole new set of expectations and concerns. Concerns that were quickly dashed, and expectations that were greatly surpassed the more I played Hades 2.</p>



<p>Before I continue, I should add a bit of context here. I know Hades 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/hades-ii-early-access-launch-full-release-2025/">launched in early access</a> last year, and that there are already a lot of people who have sunk dozens, if not hundreds, of hours into the early access version. I am not one of those people, for no reason other than the fact that I didn't play the first Hades until its v1.0 launch, so I wanted to have the same experience here. The only difference this time is that I played the first Hades game on my PC, before getting it on Nintendo Switch, whereas for this review, I've been playing Hades 2 on my Nintendo Switch, though I know I'll soon get it on my PC to play it with sharper graphics.</p>



<p>That's all to say that I shielded myself as best I could from any Hades 2 news and updates since May 2024. I'd heard good things from friends of mine who'd jumped into its early access version, but beyond that, I've been scrolling past anything Hades 2-related for more than a year to come to this v1.0 launch as fresh as possible.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Melinoë in Hades 2. Image credit: Supergiant Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>So if you find yourself in the same boat as me, let me catch you up on where we find our protagonist, Melinoë, daughter of Hades, Princess of the Underworld, an immortal and extremely powerful witch taught by Hecate herself, at the beginning of the game. Chronos, the Titan of Time and father to the Olympians, has escaped his prison under Tartarus and returned to enact his vengeance on his children who sliced him to bits and scattered him across the Underworld, hoping they'd found a way to keep the deathless titan from coming back, since they couldn't necessarily kill him outright.</p>



<p>Melinoë never knew her father, her mother, or everyone's favourite Prince of the Underworld and her brother, Zagreus. She was still a baby when Chronos first attacked, taking the House of Hades for himself and ensnaring her faMelinoëmily. The all-powerful witch Hecate took her in and trained her from the moment she could walk for a single purpose: to kill Chronos.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Tartarus in Hades 2.</figcaption></figure>



<p>So once again, you're moving through the Underworld, though instead of trying to escape it, you're going the opposite way into its depths to find and defeat Chronos, and if you fail, you're sent back to this game's hub world, the Crossroads, a realm in between the Underworld and the Earth's surface. While there, you can unlock permanent upgrades with the resources you've acquired while out on a run, speak to various characters who will each deliver more of the game's narrative as you talk to them in between attempts, and practice with each weapon as you unlock the different Nocturnal Arms.</p>



<p>If you played Hades, then it's all old hat to you, as it was to me. But it's not just everything that was there before with a new coat of witchy paint, like how you unlock upgrades and progress key moments of the narrative by using the big caldron in the middle of the Crossroads and chanting a spell. What I quickly discovered was the running theme for Hades 2 compared to Hades 1: there is so much more to do and delve into.</p>



<p>First off, before even getting into how the build crafting that's possible in Hades 2 is far deeper than what it was in Hades 1, you don't have only one path when you go out on runs. Your main goal when you start the game is to head down into the Underworld and defeat Chronos, but you soon learn that the Olympians need help on Mount Olympus, and after a few runs, you discover the resources necessary to go up, towards Mount Olympus, instead of down into the Underworld.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Something is brewing on Mount Olympus.</figcaption></figure>



<p>You'll fight through four sections in the Underworld and three on your way to the top of Mount Olympus, making Hades 2 bigger than the first game just based on the number of areas you fight through. The areas also do more with the space, like how the Fields of Mourning are wide open spaces instead of a constant stream of close-quarters rooms, an element that the area boss also takes advantage of.</p>



<p>Also, I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that the boss fights in Hades 2 overall outshine the fights in Hades 1. They're still challenging skill checks that can send you back to the Crossroads before you know what happened, but the challenge ramp between them is paced out more thoughtfully and the design of the fights help encourage you to take advantage of all the new options you have in combat.</p>



<p>Regarding the rest of the combat, there's a solid amount of enemy variety, with only a few that feel exactly the same to fight compared to Hades 1. What's more interesting than their variety, though, is how Hades 2 pushes the combat into a slightly slower, more methodical direction. In Hades 1, you're constantly moving to avoid enemy attacks, while getting in your hits while you can. The same is true in Hades 2, but you have greater potential to combo your attacks, without the presence of boons, even, to deal huge amounts of damage.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Melinoë using the Witch's Staff in Hades 2. Image credit: Supergiant Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Melinoë can cast a large circle around her that deals damage to enemies caught inside it and even traps them or slows them down, meaning you can catch an enemy chasing you while you then charge up a stronger attack to combo with your cast and hit multiple enemies at a time. You also have a mana bar on top of your health bar, which charts how much magic you have available to perform your cast, or a charged-up version of your main attack and/or special attack.</p>



<p>Melinoë's movement is also significantly shifted, because you no longer have to mash the dash button. She sprints when you hold it down, which seems like a small shift in the grand scheme of things but makes a massive difference compared to the first game and is a meaningful change that makes the combat in Hades 2 feel different while remaining familiar.</p>



<p>All of your six Nocturnal Arms weapons have non-charged and charged versions of your main attack and special attack, and you can cast your entrapment circle no matter which you're using. Of course, not all of them will be to everyone's tastes, but they're all viable in their own way. I'm personally partial to the Sister Blades, the Moonstone Axe and the Witch's Staff, in part because they are the ones I've spent the most time with, and I've found Aspect variations for each of them that I particularly enjoy.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Melinoë using the Umbral Flames in Hades 2. Image credit: Supergiant Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Build crafting in Hades 2 goes far deeper than unlocking Aspects and levelling up your weapons, though. Of course, there are your boons that you'll acquire while you're out on runs, meeting new Olympians, and seeing design revisions of ones we were already familiar with in the first game. But your Arcana Cards and Animal Familiars, on top of the Keepsakes system from the first game, are significant and intuitive ways that let you shape your build and your run chances before you take your first steps on the path towards Tartarus or Mount Olympus.</p>



<p>Once you do take those steps, there are new Olympians you'll meet like Hestia, Goddess of the Hearth and my favourite symbol to see appear on a run, thanks to all of her boons being extremely useful for my preferred playstyle. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Hades 2 boons from Hermes.</figcaption></figure>



<p>There are also new characters to meet in the middle of runs that grant you their own upgrades or boons, with a personal favourite being Arachne because she'll weave you a dress of armour that can make all the difference in a run, especially with her keepsake equipped.</p>



<p>Your Lunar boons (also called your Hex), granted by the Moon herself, are also one of my favourite changes to the boon system, with all of your strongest special abilities coming from her boons and opening up more space for boons from other characters you meet. Once you choose an ability, every time you meet her again on your path, you can upgrade it via a small skill tree that boosts it in different ways, depending on what you choose to unlock. It's another meaningful improvement on how your strongest attacks in the game work compared to Hades 1.</p>

</div>
</figure>



<p>Frankly, I'm feeling hesitant to say too much because so much of the fun in rougelikes is discovering all of these new intricacies along the way for yourself, so I'll leave off by emphasizing that even after felling Chronos and reaching the peak of Olympus, when I thought I'd seen most of what the combat system and build crafting had to offer, there was still so much more to delve into. </p>



<p>It's astounding at the levels of depth available here for players who want to get into every nook and cranny of this game's combat, and what makes it all shine is how well executed and thought out it is, to go along with what I felt to be a much better-paced challenge ramp compared to Hades 1.</p>



<p>Moving away from the combat and to the story, again, I'm hesitant to really say anything because the fun is in the discovery, but I will say there are more surprises in Hades 2 than in Hades 1. Like who you meet when you get to the top of Olympus, which I won't spoil here. What I can say is that the voice acting and writing quality have remained at the same high level found in Hades, with Melinoë being a charming protagonist, even if she's a little more serious and less fast-and-loose compared to how Zagreus carried himself.</p>

</div>
</figure>



<p>I also have to call out the score, because it's once again a soundtrack that I know I will be listening to, as I have not stopped listening to the Hades 1 soundtrack since it became available. Darren Korb knocked it out of the park again.</p>



<p>Visually, I'm happy to say that, as someone who didn't buy a Nintendo Switch 2 for what I personally believe to be an exorbitant amount of money, Hades 2 looks and runs great on my OG Nintendo Switch and Switch Lite. I went back and forth between the two, playing in my preferred handheld mode over docking it on my TV, and it honestly made my Switch feel new again; it looked that good.</p>



<p>The painterly art style still pops, even at 720p, and it's a smooth 60 FPS the entire time. Sure, it'll look better on a Switch 2, and even better on a PC, but if all you have is your eight-year-old Nintendo Switch to play Hades 2 on, you can grab it with the confidence that it'll still be a good experience.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Overall, I really can't recommend Hades 2 enough. I already loved the first game, and went into this sequel curious as to what Supergiant making a sequel would look like. Now, I really don't want to be doing anything else other than playing Hades 2. I'd rather be playing Hades 2 than writing this sentence right now.</p>



<p>Supergiant doesn't miss, even when it comes to sequels. While Melinoë looks to the Moon and her light for guidance, I'll be looking towards Supergiant to guide me to whatever they do next.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Hades 2 is a stunning follow-up to an already incredible game. It does everything its predecessor did right, and then expands on it in meaningful ways that add depth to the gameplay, narrative, and visual experience (which was already deep in the original Hades). It's a shining example of how a sequel can take everything right about what came before, turn it all up to 11, and even go a bit further.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/capcom-tokyo-game-show-pragmata-gameplay-trailer-no-release-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-shows-off-new-gameplay-trailer-for-pragmata-at-tokyo-game-show-still-no-release-date.1306974/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The floor at Tokyo Game Show 2025 might not technically be open, but this year's annual event has already kicked off through the multiple showcases that have premiered, like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-0-directors-cut-announced/">RGG Summit</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/kojima-unveils-trailers-od-death-stranding-mosquito-physint/">Kojima Productions Beyond the Strand presentation</a>. Today, you can add Capcom's presentation to the list, where a new gameplay trailer for its upcoming third-person action game, Pragmata, premiered, but it unfortunately did so without a proper release date.</p>



<p>The new trailer shows off what will be your shelter in Pragmata, a safe zone where you're able to have a rest between fights, and upgrade your armour and abilities. Your upgrades will let you deal more damage, and have Diana hack multiple enemies at once. You'll also be able to unlock new weapons at your shelter, all of which is pretty run-of-the-mill linear action game fare.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="PRAGMATA - Shelter Overview" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wq0K_qgsQHI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Its familiarity isn't a problem, of course, but it remains an upsetting fact that we don't have a proper date to look forward to. The trailer ends with its previously confirmed 2026 release window, while other major releases from Capcom, like Resident Evil Requiem, have had a date set for months now.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll get a proper release date reveal soon. When Pragmata <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-gen-sci-fi-game-pragmata/">was first announced all the way back in 2020</a>, it was a big mystery project that we didn't really know much about. Then it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-new-gameplay-delay/">delayed, and the radio silence around it</a> started to feel like it would go down in history as a game that never actually made it out the door. </p>



<p>But now that it feels like it's actually close to release, and like it'll be an intriguing blend of quick puzzle solving and third-person shooting combat, it's all the more frustrating to still not have a date to look forward to.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-gamescom-hands-on-preview-an-unexpected-surprise/">Wccftech checked out Pragmata at Gamescom 2025</a>, Francesco De Meo wrote, "<em>While opinion is divided between action game fans regarding the game's unique combination of action and puzzle game elements, I feel that once PRAGMATA is in their hands sometime next year, the general consensus will be generally positive, expecially if the game's quality will be on the same level as that of the Gamescom 2025 demo.</em>"</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/league-of-legends-fighter-2xko-gets-october-early-access-release-date.1306971/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has announced the Early Access release date for&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>fighter&nbsp;<em>2XKO</em>, and if you want to check the game out, you'll be able to do so very shortly indeed.</p>

<p>As part of a new video detailing what's going on with the game,&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>executive producer Tom Cannon revealed that the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/league-of-legends-fighting-game-officially-named-2xko-as-spectacular-new-gameplay-is" rel="nofollow">free-to-play two-on-two fighter</a> will launch on PC via Early Access on October 7th.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there's no word yet on when you can expect the game to land on consoles, although it is due to launch on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S as well as PC. We'll have to wait a little longer to find out when console players can curb stomp Yasuo to their hearts' content.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/2xko-early-access-release-date-darius-braum.jpg?itok=jqIZ3J9f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/2xko-early-access-release-date-darius-braum.jpg?itok=EEZEQFXY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>arrives in Early Access in October.</figcaption></figure><p>As detailed in an accompanying <a href="https://2xko.riotgames.com/en-gb/news/announcements/2xko-early-access-starts-october-7/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>,&nbsp;<em>2XKO</em>'s initial Early Access release will also kick off the so-called Season 0, with five seasons due to take place throughout next year.</p>

<p>Each season will bring a new champion, and that includes Season 0, so there's still one more character to be announced for the game; Riot says you should keep an eye out for the trailer and dev update revealing that champ "soon".</p>

<p>When&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>launches in October, it will bring with it "a full season of content", including combo trials for each character to help you get to grips with their movesets.</p>

<p>Throughout the Early Access period, Riot says it will be introducing features like a battle pass and a ranked play system, as well as "balance tuning", which, if I know the&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>community, will be heavily requested from day one.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>2XKO&nbsp;</em>when it launches on PC via Early Access on October 7th. There's no word yet on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S release dates, so stay tuned for more on this and all other things&nbsp;Riot Games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>release date may have leaked ahead of a potential spot in today's PlayStation State of Play showcase, if two listings on Amazon Japan are to be believed.</p>

<p>While the listings have been removed, they weren't taken down quickly enough to avoid being spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/nioh-3-launches-february-6-2026" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>, and they appear to point to a release date of February 6th for the upcoming Soulslike action RPG.</p>

<p>Listings for both the standard edition and the Treasure Box edition of&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>were spotted on Amazon Japan, and both of them bear the same release date.&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>is currently slated for an early 2026 launch, so while these dates might be placeholders, they feel a little too specific for that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nioh-3-release-date-amazon-japan-leak-boss.jpg?itok=vPhbEpQk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nioh-3-release-date-amazon-japan-leak-boss.jpg?itok=yk4uJj15 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It looks like&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>is launching this February.</figcaption></figure><p>In case you're interested,&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3</em>'s Treasure Box edition will apparently include goodies like an art book, a soundtrack CD, and a furry key chain (that's a key chain with fur on it, rather than the alternative).</p>

<p>While it hasn't been confirmed that&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>will feature during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-state-of-play-september-2025-confirmed" rel="nofollow">today's State of Play show</a>, the game is currently a PlayStation 5 console exclusive, and Amazon Japan listings appearing now (and then being removed) seems to suggest that they were supposed to go live following an announcement.</p>

<p>It's possible that&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3</em>'s release date will instead be announced during tomorrow's Koei Tecmo Tokyo Game Show program, which will be dedicated to&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3</em>, although a release date reveal during State of Play followed by a TGS gameplay deep dive seems more likely to me.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>is, well, it's the third game in Koei Tecmo and Team Ninja's&nbsp;<em>Nioh&nbsp;</em>series, which marries fast-paced hack-and-slash gameplay with Soulslike exploration and boss battles.</p>




<p><em>Nioh 3&nbsp;</em>is set for release sometime early next year (and probably on February 6th) for PC and PlayStation 5. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As <em>Genshin Impact</em>'s fifth anniversary draws near, it's clear that HoYoverse has big plans in store for their most prolific game. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-luna-i" rel="nofollow">The Song of the Welkin Moon arc has only just begun with the Luna I update</a>, but it's a strong indicator of where the developers plan to take <em>Genshin </em>in the coming years.</p>

<p>Surface-level improvements include more expressive character animations, more visually distinct playable areas and NPCs within the same region, and being able to interact with playable characters in the open world via the Anecdotes system.</p>

<p>Chances are that there are behind-the-scenes upgrades too as new characters are starting to get their own unique elemental sub-reactions, bosses are getting more complicated mechanics, and there's even going to be a brand new game mode called "Miliastra Wonderland" where players can create custom game modes and maps for others to enjoy.</p>

<p>Given that <em>Genshin's</em> Luna I update comes with the caveat of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending" rel="nofollow">ceasing operations for the PS4 version of the game</a>, it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to claim that it is also&nbsp;a modernization package in disguise. While the limitations of mobile hardware will likely prevent the developers from going too crazy, this does suggest that HoYoverse wants Genshin to be their "big tent" game with a bit of something for everyone.&nbsp;</p>




<h2><em>Genshin Impact</em>&nbsp;| The Only One Who Can Kill Me is Me</h2>

<p>Ironically, the biggest speed bump in <em>Genshin Impact's</em> new era is going to be HoYoverse itself. Currently, HoYoverse is running five different live-service games at once. When <a href="https://hna.hoyoverse.com/en-us" rel="nofollow"><em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em></a> releases in the future, there are going to be six concurrently running live-service games that will likely have a significant amount of audience overlap.</p>

<p>Most of the promotional material for <em>Nexus Anima</em> shows that it's going to bring together characters from all of HoYoverse's IPs. The obvious problem is that with six different games running at once, fans are going to have to start rationing their time more aggressively.</p>

<p>Of course, no one is forcing anyone to play all six games at once. If we are limiting the discussion to <em>Genshin Impact</em>, <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/en-us/" rel="nofollow"><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></a>, and <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/en-us/main" rel="nofollow"><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em></a>, one can feasibly play all three without much trouble. That's (presumably) not an entirely realistic picture of the games' audience though. Chances are that most people are playing other games at the same time.</p>

<p>HoYoverse would probably love it if people took breaks from games developed by other studios, but that seems unlikely. Even with the Luna I update, <em>Genshin </em>retains some odd mechanics that other HoYoverse games have seemingly abandoned. The most annoying example would probably be how the developers insist on locking character and weapon upgrade materials to certain days of the week.</p>

<p>Smaller, otherwise inconsequential annoyances build up over time as well. <em>Genshin </em>still lacks a stamina overflow mechanic. You have to manually convert resin to Condensed Resin, albeit at better rates with the Luna I update. You can't directly upgrade lower tier materials into higher tier materials from the character screen. There's no way to downgrade higher tier materials either.</p>

<p>There's also the fact that you have to manually collect character level-up materials, another practice that has been minimized with HoYoverse's subsequent games. Granted, this is more of a quirk of open-world games more than a fault of <em>Genshin </em>itself, yet all signs point to <em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em> having its own open-world portion to some degree.</p>

<p>If <em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em> is swooping in with its own open world with potentially improved comparable features, then <em>Genshin's</em> main selling point might start to look like an inconvenience. People will still play <em>Genshin </em>for the story or the user-generated content, but if building characters becomes a hassle, then they might not really bother with farming enemies and collecting random flowers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-nod-krai-fatui-boss_0.jpg?itok=s7-UmxTq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-nod-krai-fatui-boss_0.jpg?itok=aljE2gpz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>At least you can brute force his shields... for now.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Genshin Impact |&nbsp;</em>HP Inflation? In This Economy? It's More Likely Than You Think</h2>

<p>If people aren't putting in the effort to build characters, then that would imply that they don't really need to play the endgame modes to completion, and if they're not playing the endgame modes, then there's less of a need to pull characters. Pulling characters for their open world mobility is an option, although whether this represents a sizable portion of the audience is anyone's guess.</p>

<p>Something has to make way eventually. <em>Honkai: Star Rail's</em> combat can be entirely automated. <em>Zenless Zone Zero's </em>non-endgame activities let you spend an entire day's worth of stamina in literal seconds. You could build up endgame-ready characters almost passively in both games and then focus on the story or events. <em>Genshin </em>has no such luxury, and it's starting to become quite noticeable now thanks to both Imaginarium Theater and the Luna I era of boss mechanics.</p>

<p>It's not as if HoYoverse is allergic to porting mechanics from one game to another. The ability to build your own Artifact didn't originate from <em>Genshin</em>, and <em>Genshin's </em>improvements to the mechanic has made its way to other HoYoverse games to some degree. The same goes for the in-game character guides and the Anecdotes feature.</p>

<p>Alternatively, HoYoverse may be counting on<em> Honkai: Nexus Anima</em> to pressure <em>Genshin's</em> player base to spend more. If there's less time to play, then people might be willing to part with some money to bypass the more tedious activities so that they can concentrate on story and endgame activities. The mechanism already exists in the game, people just have to be desperate enough to spend.</p>




<h2><em>Genshin Impact |&nbsp;</em>Hold Up, Let HoYo Cook</h2>

<p>None of this precludes the existence of a middle ground. <em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em> may have open world elements, but its core gameplay loop appears to revolve around minigames and autochess. Neither particularly encroaches upon <em>Genshin's&nbsp;</em>territory, and it's hard to imagine a scenario where autochess requires any huge commitment of time or attention.</p>

<p>Furthermore, as we've seen with the release of&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> and <em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>, people can just bounce around and take breaks whenever there's a relative lull in content. You might miss out on some premium currency or an event here and there, but if you're planning to play these games over the course of years then it's almost irrelevant.</p>

<p>Regardless, HoYoverse might want to consider ironing out some of <em>Genshin Impact's</em> more annoying quirks to keep people happy in the long run. The Luna I update is certainly a step in the right direction, offering both meaningful content and mechanics that can be used to reduce the tedium of farming (albeit only in the current event).&nbsp;</p>

<p>The real test would be when&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em>&nbsp;releases. Will people stay with <em>Genshin Impact</em> in spite of its somewhat archaic approach to character building, among other annoyances, or will&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Nexus Anima&nbsp;</em>be a good enough open-world replacement? Or will both games be able to coexist? Even if players can manage with an additional game, what about the next game, or the one after that? Only time will tell.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>I don’t envy any designer tasked with expanding upon </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span>, a game so airtight that it could only have crystallized through a process of rigorous elimination. Whenever I go back for another run–which isn’t too often these days, though I did spend at least three solid months of my 2020 malaise deep in a </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span> foxhole–I’m always impressed by the game’s ability to wring near-infinite permutations of itself out of a relatively restrained framework.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I say “restrained” with an asterisk here because, as any </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span> vets well know, the game is packed full with enough ideas to keep things surprising and challenging for many tens of hours. But key to its replayability is its immediately graspable possibility space: there are six weapons, four zones with (basically) one boss each, and a grab bag of themed powerups that all offer unique variations on playstyle. One successful run usually clocks in at around 30 minutes.</span><i><span> Hades</span></i><span> onboards you painlessly, and it’s not long before you’ve internalized the game’s core mechanics and progression systems, free thereafter to relinquish yourself to their combinations. (Contrast with a roguelike like </span><i><span>The Binding of Isaac</span></i><span>, which uses the genre’s randomized, cyclical structure as a vector for dizzying mechanical maximalism, tipping the scale more toward chaos and unpredictability (to great effect) than careful strategizing.)</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000628069" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628069"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628069">©Supergiant Games</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Developer Supergiant Games could have made </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span> bigger, surely, but they didn’t. Bigger would have been unnecessary, and </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span> wasn’t built to sustain the unnecessary. It was built to be </span><i><span>played</span></i><span>, quickly and repeatedly. It cut right to the bone. Why add more?</span></p>

 <p><span>After about 30 hours with </span><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span>, I’m still not quite sure.</span></p> <p><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span> is Supergiant’s first sequel. This tracks for a couple reasons: one, </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span> sold a gazillion copies, and two, it was the studio’s first genuinely excellent video game. I’m warm on </span><i><span>Transistor</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Pyre</span></i><span>, but </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span> felt like a blistering synthesis of all the action game chops they’d been honing for nearly a decade, and it made a deservedly enormous splash. It’s only natural that they’d return to this well, having hit upon a template that represents a perfect alignment of all their skills.</span></p>

 <p><span>If we coldly define “well designed” as “the numbers in this game make sense,” </span><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span> is very, very well designed. All of its weapons are sensibly balanced, all of its progression systems are finely tuned, and it doles out new mechanics and information at just the right pace to keep you grinding out fresh runs. It’s a game made by smart, talented people who know exactly what they’re doing.</span></p>

 <p><span>And if we coldly define a “video game review” as “I tell you whether or not a game is fun,” then yes, </span><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span> is fun. In some ways it’s more fun than the first. Their structures are nearly identical: you control a figure from the Greek pantheon, fighting your way through the underworld in an attempt to reach and eliminate a boss at the end. Here, your player character is chthonic goddess Melinoë, tasked with defeating the titan Chronos. You’re aided remotely by other members of the pantheon via upgrades to your moveset, and the game’s story unfolds gradually across dozens of runs.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000628073" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628073"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628073">©Supergiant Games</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span>’s greatest feat of narrative design, shared with its predecessor, is its reactivity. It responds to your decisions (and mistakes) in granular, entertaining ways: Melinoë may express frustration that she (you) didn’t get as far in a run as she’s used to, or gods may remark upon the fact that you’ve already received boons from other gods, offering complementary boons in turn. Certain characters become more directly involved with your journey as you progress–a standout here is the goddess Nemesis, who, after a certain point, begins making clandestine runs of her own, and will challenge you to petty contests or snipe items from shops should you cross her path. The game successfully sells the illusion that you’re not just going through the same motions ad nauseum; every run, regardless of outcome, is a narrative or numerical step forward.</span></p>

 <p><span>Complicating this reactivity considerably is another, entirely separate route through the surface, beginning in the mythic city of Ephyra and culminating in a battle atop Mount Olympus. The surface route is, effectively, an entire </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span> game unto itself, with its own bespoke zones, enemies, items, characters, and encounter design. There’s an astonishing amount of detail and mechanical inventiveness on display here, though just as impressive is the interplay between the two routes. Surface runs will periodically change or realign certain aspects of underworld runs and vice-versa, gradually engendering a natural inclination to alternate between both without pushing players too forcefully toward either. This is, by a wide margin, the most robust addition <em>Hades 2 </em>makes to the </span><span>formula, a confident and meaningful doubling down on the first game’s most distinctive virtues. On its own, it’s nearly enough to convince me that the existence of a</span> <span>sequel was not only desirable, but necessary. Then they added a bunch of other stuff.</span></p> <p><span>“Stuff” is an ever-shifting variable in game design. One game’s stuff is another game’s foundation. I wouldn’t dream of complaining about weird, fiddly currencies in a game like </span><i><span>Crusader Kings III</span></i><span>, because </span><i><span>Crusader Kings III</span></i><span> is, I say affectionately, designed for people who derive genuine pleasure from poring over minute differences between health insurance plans. I </span><i><span>would</span></i><span>, however,</span><span> complain about weird, fiddly currencies in a game like </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span>, which is about pressing a shitload of buttons as fast as you can until an evil skeleton dies.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000628070" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628070"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628070">©Supergiant Games</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span> has a lot of weird, fiddly currencies. Fundamentally, I get why they’re there: the game is exponentially larger than </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span>, and Supergiant is trying to fill in the margins to avoid any potential long-term redundancy. </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span>’ primary currencies were “darkness,” used mostly for unlocking permanent perks and stat upgrades, and “gemstones,” which unlocked helpful modifications to routes. The game was concise enough to coast by with little else. </span><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span>’s darkness equivalent is “ashes,” but there’s also “psyche,” which can expand Melinoë’s available attunement slots; “moon dust,” which improves Melinoë’s abilities (represented here by an “arcana card” system); “bones,” which are a sort of catch-all currency with which all aforementioned currencies can be bought; and a slew of collectible resources, including various types of ore and flora, which, when combined, modify routes in much the same way gemstones did.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>In theory, all of these interlocking systems should seamlessly coalesce into something that feels holistic and self-sustaining. In practice, they place more obstacles between you and having fun. Just cleared a room? Time to run around hitting rocks with your pickaxe and digging up flowers with your shovel (assuming you crafted the pickaxe and shovel to begin with). Want to harvest psyche from a wandering spirit? Grind your momentum to a halt to play the most braindead take on Simon Says in gaming history. Want to add something to a route that the first game was way less stingy about? Plant a seed in your garden, wait a couple runs for it to grow, pick it, realize you don’t have the other required resources yet and have no clue where to get them, give up and just start another run so you can play a video game again.</span></p> <p><span>I spent the first few hours of </span><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span> being genuinely curious about these systems, the following few hours trying to tune them out, and the remainder of my time actively wishing they would go away. They never impeded my progress to the point that I was compelled to drop the game entirely, though runs eventually began feeling more like obligatory farming missions than intrinsically satisfying arcade action gauntlets. That action is there, but it’s obfuscated by a veil of fussy numbers and half-baked cozy sim mechanics, just intrusive enough that they’re impossible to ignore. The math checks out; the experience doesn’t.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"Less is Moros."</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Supergiant Games</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Top-down roguelike action RPG.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Constantly evolving and reactive design, creative progression, infinitely pliable combat system.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked: </p>                 <p>Overemphasis on fussy resources, uneven weapon movesets, tedious writing.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms: </p>                 <p>PC (played), Switch, Switch 2. </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release date:</p>                 <p>September 25, 2025</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played: </p>                 <p>30 hours.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>It’s especially disappointing, then, that the core gameplay can’t quite compensate. Certainly not for lack of trying–</span><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span>’s weapons are all admirably cerebral, placing a greater emphasis on positioning and multitasking than anything in the original (with the possible exception of the railgun Exagryph, which also happens to be the only one I hardly ever touched). The dual wands, for instance, are designed around constant, careful projectile management, while the axe hits slowly enough that a single improperly-spaced attack, especially in the more unforgiving later zones, can put you at an enormous disadvantage.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>I understand and appreciate the effort to mechanically differentiate Melinoë from </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span> protagonist Zagreus, to make her feel less like an in-your-face rushdown beast and more like a prudent tactician. But–and I know how vague and unquantifiable this sounds–the game isn’t as satisfying to play. Supergiant’s combat design has always been fairly straightforward, and that’s fine, because whatever it lacks in raw complexity it more than makes up for with intuitive, thrilling buttons; those buttons are just a bit more limp here, the game’s ambition again chafing against its uncertainty over what to do with it.</span></p> <p><span>Carried over more directly from the first game is an emphasis–even greater, this time around–on character dynamics and interactions. Melinoë, like Zagreus, is booted back to a central hub after failing a run, wherein she can chat up a number of friends, family members, and frenemies before making her next move. Relationships with these characters, and with the Olympians, deepen naturally over time, and can be deepened further by offering them “nectar,” a resource available in either route. Give someone one nectar and they’ll hand you a personalized, equippable item with unique attributes; give them more, and you’ll begin growing closer with them. Very occasionally, that closeness may blossom into intimacy.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000628066" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628066"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628066">©Supergiant Games</figcaption></figure> <p><span>The stories and characters in these games do basically nothing for me. I was probably willing to be a bit kinder toward </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span> because it was a new, shiny thing with novel ideas about how to structure a video game narrative, but outside of some exciting beats and the occasional funny joke, </span><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span> had my eyes glazing over. This is uninspired fanfiction by nature and in execution, a sanded-down and self-serious reinterpretation of Greek mythology that warps its figures into cuddly, quippy dating sim archetypes. I’m by no means fundamentally opposed to any work of fiction that wants to riff on those myths (though I’m getting a kick out of imagining how much the </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span> games would piss off my high school Latin teacher). I only take issue with </span><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span>’s irritatingly focus-tested writing, which comes off as little more than red meat for fan engagement; directly downstream from this is the game’s dorky faux-eroticism, presupposing the sexual appeal of its characters and then refusing to actually let them do anything sexy. It’s hard to care about cleavage when everyone talks like a gifset.</span></p> <p><span>Let’s all be adults about this: I have not “finished” </span><i><span>Hades II</span></i><span>. I’ve completed a few runs and played several dozens more, though one of the game’s biggest draws is that a successful run is merely another plot point; the story and gameplay both continue evolving long after. I’m willing to accept that there could be an eventual moment, which I have yet to reach, where a new upgrade makes the weapons as engaging as those in the original’s arsenal, or where the writing takes an unexpected turn for the better, or where the resource management evens out into something more relaxed and coherent. I’m also willing to accept the game’s foibles even if they remain uncorrected, because I’ve had, more or less, a great time with it. Supergiant’s core design philosophy is still kinetic enough to cut through the noise, and unpredictable enough that I want to see where it goes. This is still </span><i><span>Hades</span></i><span> we’re talking about, </span><i><span>II</span></i><span> or otherwise.</span></p>

The Disney-owned ABC talk show was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-fallon-colbert-stewart-trump-kirk-2000627249"><span>yanked off the air</span></a><span> following a monologue in which Kimmel claimed the Republican party was using the assassination of right-wing commentator Charlie Kirk for “political points.” The entire fiasco has been seen by many as a high-profile example of the Trump administration making a calculated strike against free speech in an effort to silence the president’s critics, but on Tuesday, September 23, Kimmel retook the stage to deliver a nearly 28-minute monologue about the situation, Trump’s colossal tantrum, and the fact that he </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/trump-autism-tylenol-press-conference-reaction-jokes-2000627950"><span>tried to link autism to Tylenol</span></a><span> with zero scientific backing.</span></p> <p><span>You can watch the full monologue here, in which a teary-eyed Kimmel greets a chanting audience, thanking people for their support over the past week, including the right-wing figures who spoke about how dangerous it was for the president to try to silence his critics. He also gets choked up while saying it was “never [his] intention to make light of the murder of a young man.”&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>Kimmel continued,</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>I don’t think there’s anything funny about it. I posted a message on Instagram on the day he was killed, sending love to his family and asking for compassion. I meant it, and I still do. Nor was it my intention to blame any specific group for the actions of what was obviously a deeply disturbed individual. That was really the opposite of the point I was trying to make, but I undestand that, to some, that felt either ill-timed or unclear, or maybe both. For those who think I did point a finger, I get why you’re upset. If the situation was reversed, there’s a good chance I’d have felt the same way. I have many friends and family members on the “other side” who I love and remain close to even though we don’t agree on politics at all. I don’t think the murderer who shot Charlie Kirk represents anyone. This was a sick person who believed violence was a solution, and it isn’t, ever.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>After clarifying his stance on Kirk’s death, Kimmel’s monologue shifts its focus to the importance of free speech in America, pointing out the hypocrisy of both the FCC and Trump on the subject. He condemns Trump’s continued attempts to undermine the press, and to his credit, he doesn’t take his foot off the gas when talking about Trump. Other public figures with a lot to lose might have pulled their punches against the administration after being taken off the air, but there’s none of that here. He also likens the FCC’s use of threats and intimidation to mafia behavior, going so far as to tag in Robert De Niro for a skit in which the actor puts on his best mob boss persona to play a new FCC chairman. The whole thing’s worth a watch.</span></p>

 <p><span>So how did Trump respond to this? Exactly how you’d expect. The president posted an unhinged rant on his </span><a href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115256938634035559"><span>Truth social account</span></a><span> claiming that “ABC Fake News” told the White House that </span><i><span>Jimmy Kimmel Live!</span></i><span> Had been “cancelled.” He also says the late-night show was “another arm of the DNC” and that would be a “major illegal Campaign Contribution” to…well, he doesn’t specify. But what he does do is gesture at suing ABC for…something? He references the </span><a href="https://apnews.com/article/abc-trump-lawsuit-defamation-stephanopoulos-04aea8663310af39ae2a85f4c1a56d68"><span>2024 defamation lawsuit</span></a><span> in which ABC paid $15 million to Trump’s presidential library fund, so he seems to think he can get more money from the company for…putting Kimmel back on the air?&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>While Kimmel is back on the air in most of the country, several cities were </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2025/09/23/sinclair-nexstar-not-airing-jimmy-kimmel-list/86307443007/"><span>unable to watch the show live</span></a><span> due to some affiliate stations owned by Sinclair Broadcast Group and Nexstar Media Group preempting the show and replacing it with news. Some affected cities included Washington D.C., Nashville, New Orleans, Portland, and Salt Lake City. Those groups can’t stop people from going to YouTube, however, where the monologue has already racked up 9.1 million views since being posted last night.</span></p>

Not only that, but the game is getting a new story expansion called Dark Ties.</p><p>The two experiences will be bundled together in a package dubbed Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties. Kiwami 3, like the previous titles, is a ground-up remake of Yakuza 3 that features improved graphics and reworked brawling gameplay, such as the ability to swap between two fighting styles.</p><p>The first fighting style is Dragon of Dojima: Kiwami, a brawling style boasting the largest number of attack techniques in the series’ history. Second is Ryukyu Style, a new addition described as a technical weapon-based style that lets players unleash combos using eight different weapons.</p><p>Kiwami 3 also features a new team battle mode called Legendary Baddie, Bad Boy Dragon.

Set in Kamurocho, it serves as a prequel to Yakuza 3’s events that tells Mine’s origin story and how and why he joined the yakuza.</p><p>Gameplay-wise, Mine’s combat centers on boxing and his Dark Awakening ability, a mode where he unleashes his inner darkness to wreak havoc on enemies with a ruthless assault. Dark Ties also features Hells Arena, an underground fight club where players can battle opponents under various rules. Survival Hell mode tasks players with fighting through an underground dungeon to reach a goal at the end.</p><p>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties launches on February 12, 2026, for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, PlayStation 4, and PC. Pre-ordering either the digital or physical version rewards the &nbsp;exclusive Ryukyu Gal Gang – Ichiban Legendary Lad DLC that adds fan-favorite hero Ichiban Kasuga to the Ryukyu Gal Gang and Legendary Baddie modes.

In terms of what’s new, it features an HDMI 2.1 port that’s capable of displaying up to 4K at 120Hz on your TV with HDR and variable refresh rate (VRR) support (the previous model was capped at 4K / 60Hz).</p><p>Its sole USB-C port charges at up to 65W (a 20W improvement), and it can handle video input, too, supporting DisplayPort 1.4. Like before, there’s USB-A port for charging an accessory. It’s $59, or $69 if you want the global version that includes travel adapters. It includes a USB-C 3.2 cable with purchase.</p><p>The company is also raising funds for its Shadowcast 3 lineup of capture cards. Like previous models, the $59 Shadowcast 3 looks like a dongle, with HDMI-out on one side, and USB-C-in on the other. This model supports 4K / 60Hz capture (or 1440p / 120Hz, 1080p / 240Hz) when connected to consoles. The previous version was limited to 1080p / 60Hz capture. Genki claims less than 40-millisecond latency with the base model.</p><p>The Shadowcast 3 ships with a USB-C 3.2 cable, which you can plug into a computer to broadcast or save your video feed in OBS, Streamlabs, Zoom, and Discord. If you have a compatible DSLR or mirrorless camera, the Shadowcast 3 can help you use it as a webcam. Alternatively, you can connect the new gadget to an iPhone or iPad via the Genki Studio app (or a different app like <a href="https://orion.tube/">Orion</a>) to display your feed. There’s also a $79 Shadowcast 3 Pro that includes the regular Shadowcast 3 along with an extra component that claims to offer HDMI passthrough with no latency.</p><p>Genki is estimating that these products will ship in December, assuming that the Kickstarter is successful.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/783976/covert-dock-3-shadowcast-3-switch-2-rog-ally-xbox-specs-price#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/783976/covert-dock-3-shadowcast-3-switch-2-rog-ally-xbox-specs-price]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In my second hands-on opportunity with Pokémon Legends: Z-A on Nintendo Switch 2, I played for almost an hour, which still wasn’t nearly enough time to fully sink my teeth into this new, action-forward take on a mainline Pokémon game. However, it did ease some of my early concerns, pique up interest in mastering its battle mechanics, and reveal a few new details: like how you can power up moves with Mega Power, and Mega Evolve repeatedly in the same battle–at least with some caveats.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Wilds Zones - Where There’s Always a Catching Chance</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The modern setting of Legends: Z-A doesn’t exactly do it for me–even in real life I generally prefer exploring ancient forests and temples over cities when traveling–but I did get to explore a Wild Zone in Lumiose City myself during my hands-on this time around, and it was more interesting and fun than I expected. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokemon Legends: Z-A – September 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These Wild Zones are where wild Pokémon live within Lumiose City, and so it’s also where you can catch Pokémon. Like in Legends: Arceus, you can just toss a Poké Ball at a Pokémon to try and catch it, but you can make the task easier by damaging the wild Pokémon first. Legends: Z-A makes an interesting change to the already modified catch mechanic: you don’t have to worry about accidentally knocking a Pokemon out–they’ll “faint” for a while, indicated by stars circling their heads as they wobble in place, giving you a free chance to capture them, instead of “disappearing”--but keep in mind they <em>will</em> disappear if you wait too long after knocking them out.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Legends: Z-A makes an interesting change to the already modified catch mechanic: you don’t have to worry about accidentally knocking a Pokemon out–they’ll “faint” for a while, indicated by stars circling their heads as they wobble in place, giving you a free chance to capture them, instead of “disappearing.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m curious about how this affects capture rate, like how status effects and less HP increase your chances of catching a Pokémon. I actually hope that knocking a Pokémon out resets its catch rate, so there’s still some benefit to formulating a Pokémon-catching strategy with the right moves. Removing tediousness is usually a good thing, but removing tension to streamline things isn’t the change I'm looking for. Doing so completely undermines the satisfaction succeeding would have granted. I understand it’s much more difficult to methodically choose your next move to avoid knocking out a wild Pokémon in a real-time battle, but there needs to be some consequence for doing it. If there is no consequence, well, RIP False Swipe. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Verticality and Challenges </h3><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokémon Legends: Z-A Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Wild Zones in Legends: Z-A use the verticality of a city very well, allowing for exploration in the waterways below and the skyscraper rooftops above, creating micro-habitats for different collections of Pokémon. At one point, I climbed up a building to escape a very angry alpha Houndoom with glowing red eyes, and found a flock of happy-go-lucky Swablu at the top. Apparently, some other trainers at the event went up to a different roof and encountered an alpha Pikachu–who then chased them back down to Houndoom’s domain, making for an even scarier encounter. And I say scarier because the Houndoom was kind of frightening–at about five levels above my own Pokémon, it knocked out my poor Gyarados despite my type advantage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This encounter made me want to experiment with my movements and strategy, where I discovered Gyarados’ Whirlpool remained on the field when I switched it out. I tried to dish out a well-timed Sleep Powder to Whirlpool combo with two different Pokémon, and though I couldn’t quite pull it off well, it had me thinking of what possible combos could exist. The issue with having the moves on different Pokémon is that once you switch out, the new Pokémon’s moves start on a cooldown, essentially replicating the core game’s mechanic of allowing your opponent a free attack if you switch out in the middle of battle. The difference here is that, with quick thinking and positioning, there’s a higher chance of avoiding said free attack. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Legends: Z-A requires quick thinking, too. With it being real-time, there’s not a second to waste ruminating over which move would be the most ideal or efficient, and it doesn’t allow for forgetfulness. You’ll need to know your team like the back of your hand to be able to make appropriate switches at the drop of a hat, unless you want to pause all the time. It can get a bit hectic, actually, especially when I didn’t know the demo team! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, the Wild Zone had more crammed in it than what was suggested by looking at it on the map, made possible by the aforementioned verticality. There are plenty of Wild Zones, but I can’t help but worry how same-y they’ll feel considering they’re all contained within a city.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Trainer Battle Zones and Extra Goals</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">During this demo, I once again got to experience a Z-A Royale battle zone, too, but this time, at the higher W rank. I found some slime blocking my path, which a Water-type attack washed away, suggesting you’ll need a variety of Pokémon on your team in order to adequately explore everywhere there is. You’ll also want a mix of Pokémon and moves on your team to take advantage of extra missions. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As I wandered the battle zone, I picked up glowing bonus cards on the ground, which then provided missions that popped up on the right side of the screen. We could see these in a previous trailer, but I didn’t expect how much more interesting they’d make the battle zones. Instead of just taking out trainers one by one, which I could see becoming a bit monotonous, I kept these special conditions in mind. For example, one instructed me to start a battle with a Flying-type sneak attack, and another to land a super-effective Water-type attack. Successfully fulfilling these conditions gave me more Ticket Points at the end of the battle, getting me closer to a Challenger’s Ticket faster, which would then qualify me for a promotion match. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The promotion match I battled against Rintaro reminded me a bit of a Gym Leader battle, except instead of the trainer having a monotype Pokémon team, he had a “themed” team.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The promotion match I battled against Rintaro reminded me a bit of a Gym Leader battle, except instead of the trainer having a monotype Pokémon team, he had a “themed” team. He works at a restaurant and had a Simisage, Simipour, and Simisear–seemingly a callback to Pokémon Black and White’s restaurant-themed Striaton City Gym, run by Cilan, Chili, and Cress, whose partner Pokémon were the pre-evolutions of this trainer’s lineup. It was a cool battle, and I look forward to seeing other trainers’ teams as I crush their dreams to climb the ranks. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Battling Mega Victreebel and Repeat Mega Evolutions</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, in the fourth part of the demo, I fought a rogue Mega Evolved Pokémon. In the first demo I played at the Pokemon World Championships, I faced a Mega Absol, but this time, it was the larger-than-life, recently revealed Mega Victreebel. I also had three Pokémon capable of Mega Evolution at my disposal–a Houndoom, Absol, and Gardevoir. The battle against Mega Victreebel was more ferocious than the tutorial fight against Mega Absol despite Naveen fighting by my side, but I welcomed the challenge. Its attacks left poison on the ground, making it more difficult to avoid while I simultaneously dished out commands and picked up Mega Power orbs to Mega Evolve my Pokémon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When my first Mega Evolution Pokémon fainted, I thought I was screwed. In the core Pokémon games, you can only Mega Evolve one Pokémon per battle, and can’t Mega Evolve again, even if your first Mega Evolution Pokémon faints. Unexpectedly, that wasn’t the case during this battle in Legends: Z-A–I was able to Mega Evolve all three of my Pokémon, as long as I gathered the required Mega Power. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I didn’t get to test if this works in trainer battles, so I asked–and I was essentially told you’re not limited to single Mega Evolutions per battle–as long as you have the Mega Stone and Mega Power to support it. This is evidently possible when up against Rogue Mega-Evolved Pokemon, and likely possible in Wild Zones since the Mega Ring fills up with each attack and by collecting energy from breakable crystals. I’m curious how exactly this would work in trainer battles. In our demo, we weren’t high enough rank to access mega power in the trainer battle portions–so we’ll just have to test that later. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Plus Moves - The Solution to the (Possible) Repeat Mega Evolution Problem</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Mega Power, this resource does more than just allow your Pokémon to Mega Evolve. See, you can also use Mega Power to power up a Pokémon’s move into a “Plus Move” which packs more of a punch than usual. This power-up can be activated by pressing the plus button on the controller.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I can’t really see a reason to do this instead of saving up Mega Power to Mega Evolve–since Mega Evolved Pokémon’s moves are automatically Plus Moves. However, it could be a great mechanic to help Pokémon unable to Mega Evolve from becoming entirely obsolete. This would be especially important if you actually can Mega Evolve as many times as you want in trainer battles, solving the potential problem this freedom would cause.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Closing Thoughts </h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the thing: it’s so difficult not to compare Legends: Z-A to Legends: Arceus, as the predecessor set expectations I feel like weren’t met. I liked Pokémon Legends: Arceus’ slightly modified battle system–the turn-based battles were just different enough with the introduction of Speed and Strong styles to mix things up. I also loved Arceus’ blast-from-the-past feudal setting, which allowed for some really cool and unprecedented Pokémon lore exploration. It triumphantly set itself apart from the rest of the mainline games’ very modern settings, and this was my highest expectation for the Legends series. It honestly makes me wonder if there will be time-travel stuff in Legends: Z-A to bridge this gap. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m also definitely  a fantasy girly in general–I prefer archaic dungeons and dragons over high-tech spaceships, aliens, or even just modern-day shops and domestic animals. With all of this in mind, I’ve been skeptical from the start whether I’d like Legends: Z-A’s battle system or setting and story nearly as much as Legends: Arceus’, despite any potentially implemented learned lessons or improved systems. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After watching its intro cutscene and playing, overall, more than an hour of Legends: Z-A, I have to say I’m still skeptical if I’ll appreciate this experience more than I did Legends: Arceus. But I didn’t dislike anything I’ve played or seen, and absolutely had fun with it. Legends: Z-A’s gameplay loop is unique, and I’m looking forward to experimenting with and mastering the new, real-time battle system. I appreciate the risks Pokémon is taking here -  I just hope they fully pay off. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-legends-z-a-the-final-preview]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-review.1306833/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">On my first day of work at IGN in 2018, I was asked, “What’s your favorite video game of all time?” My answer then was the same as my answer today: Final Fantasy Tactics. When I first played it on the original PlayStation back in the ‘90s, I was enraptured by the job system, the memorable cast of characters, and a story that offered little in the way of easy answers. Between the PSP re-release (The War of the Lions) with extra content but major performance issues, and mobile versions featuring only touch controls, the landscape of 2025 has long been primed for an updated version of this RPG classic that’s worthy of the original. Did Square Enix deliver with The Ivalice Chronicles? With only a few caveats, it absolutely did.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite all the improvements in the turn-based tactical RPG genre over the last two-and-a-half decades, the original Tactics is one of those classics that still holds up today. The story, told to you by a historian many years in the future, has a powerful beginning in which we learn your character, Ramza, will go down in history as a hated criminal while his brother in arms becomes a legend despite not being all that he seems. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles Review Slideshow</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What starts as a fairly focused tale spirals into conspiracies, backstabbing, the evils of a caste society, supernatural threats, and all the other staples you’d expect from a fantasy political drama. Throughout all of that it keeps Ramza at the center, with a foot in both worlds for perspective. It doesn’t give you tidy endings, and doesn’t shy away from the atrocities that the common people must face when powerful men with armies refuse to set aside their quest for power, and Ramza must continually come to terms with why he’s fighting in the first place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully for our sake, all that awful fighting is still really fun to play through. Final Fantasy Tactics focuses much of the power in individual units rather than their synergy with each other, but the flexibility you have with how you want to use those units is immense. Each of the 20 jobs comes with its own set of action, reaction, support, and movement skills, and once learned they can all be mixed and matched with other classes. Want a Monk that can dual wield both fists (after leveling the Ninja class) while ignoring the elevation of the terrain (after leveling the Dragoon class) so he can jump 30 feet in the air to instantly punch a far-away enemy unit to death? Have at it. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What starts as a fairly focused tale spirals into conspiracies and backstabbing.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you put in the work, you can create some truly busted characters. The act of simply leveling a unit is a joy because you get instant progression feedback from every action you perform, and can easily assess your progress through the new UI. Since progression occurs with each individual action and not by finishing battles, you can either run through a bunch of different maps, leveling as you go, or spend a long time in one map, buffing, attacking, and healing friends and foes alike until you gain just enough experience for the next skill or job. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That old-school grind may not sound fun at first, but having the option to master entire jobs in a single battle or just earn the requisite experience that you need rather than being stuck with one you don’t want long-term gives you constant, concrete goals to achieve as you continue to build your party. And that carrot-on-a-stick feeling of the next job or next spell being within your reach if you do just a little more is essential to enjoying a job system such as this one. Other than Xenoblade Chronicles 3, I honestly can’t think of another RPG job system with such satisfying progression pacing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And you <em>will</em> need to progress, as the balance of the back half of the story is truly nutty. As sword-and-sandals warfare gives way to instant-kill techniques and screen-clearing summons from your enemies, you’re given some fantastically broken options in both late-game characters and classes. And because many of these late battles only require you to defeat one specific character rather than an entire team in order to win, it further emphasizes the outsized importance a single unit can have towards the end of the story, since you can plan around diving through the enemy team to take out its leader. One character you recruit in the very last stretch of story missions is a one-man wrecking crew, as is fitting with his reputation, but his inclusion is indicative of the wild swings Tactics leans into. You’re not forced to use him, but the difficulty is much higher if you don’t.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of classes, you have the standard fare options such as Squire, Knight, Archer, and Black Mage, which can all be powerful on their own – but each character also chooses from jobs that include Geomancer, which use whatever terrain they’re standing on as the basis for their long-range attacks, and Arithmetician, which casts any black magic, white magic, time magic, or mystic arts you’ve learned with that character instantly and without using MP based on the multiples of stats like EXP or current elevation (without distinguishing between foe and friend). It’s crazy stuff that gets pretty broken by the end, but a wrong button press can still wipe out your entire party. It’s a small picture of just how volatile these late fights can be, but you really have to earn your way there as the prerequisites for the class are intense.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>That carrot-on-a-stick feeling is essential to enjoying a job system such as this one.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">All this busted stuff is also completely optional depending on how you build your team, as you could choose to fight your way through most of Final Fantasy Tactics using Ramza and a few chocobos if you really wanted to test yourself. That’s especially true for The Ivalice Chronicles since there are now three difficulty options. I played through on the middle difficulty, and it seemed much the same as I remember aside from some tweaks to stats, requirements for learning skills, and even some enemy placements. Having finished that, I’m now more than halfway through a new playthrough on the highest difficulty, and I am enjoying the extra challenge. Hopefully it maintains this pace through the final chapter, as that’s where many of the balance issues lie.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m also still working through Midlight’s Deep (known as Deep Dungeon in the original Tactics), an optional endgame multi-level dungeon set completely in the dark, with exits hidden on particular squares, that is filled with stronger enemies than you’ll find throughout the story. The harder encounters are fun, but finding the exits without a guide is honestly kind of a chore as you can’t defeat all the enemies until you’ve found the staircase to the next level. It’s truly for the sickos who want to push their parties to the limit, but I can’t see casual fans having much fun with it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The original Tactics did have problems other than the balance issues that have thankfully been alleviated here. It was very poorly localized, with stilted dialogue that rendered the complex political landscape unintelligible at times, and had weird anachronisms like Ramza – a character from a supposedly medieval period – yelling out “Geronimo!” (a reference to an early 20th-century Apache military leader) as a war cry. Much of the depth of its characters was also hidden away in either hard-to-read menus or community guides, and the UI was needlessly clunky and complicated (as was the style at the time), making a lot of vital info a chore to understand. I’m happy to say that nearly every one of these issues, other than some of the endgame balance swings on the standard difficulty, has been addressed in The Ivalice Chronicles.</p><h2 data-cy="title1">A New War</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">None of the extra content found in The War of the Lions version on PSP, including the new playable characters, new jobs, or multiplayer mode are present in The Ivalice Chronicles. I did like Final Fantasy XII’s Balthier as a party member since it’s a cool connection across the Ivalice setting, but I don’t particularly miss anything else from that version, and the original Tactics’ cameos from another Final Fantasy I won’t spoil are still included – now with voice acting, which is really cool to hear. The one holdover they’ve kept from The War of the Lions is the vastly improved translation, which is great to see. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another immediately noticeable improvement is the updated graphical style, which is obviously much higher resolution while preserving the original’s retro isometric look. While I still yearn for a true HD-2D graphical remake with the look of Octopath Traveler or Dragon Quest III, this direction really grew on me after some initial resistance. At first glance, especially through YouTube compression, it looked almost like a smoothing filter over an emulated retro game, but I found that there’s almost a canvas-like quality to the texture of the screen as your toy soldiers march across the battlefield when I played it for myself. At its very worst, it didn’t bother me after a few hours; at its best, especially in scenes with warm lighting around the edges or the added tilt-shift focus, it can look really nice and enhance the illusion that you’re playing with miniatures.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Best Game Menu Noises</h3><p>The games with the best menu sounds, whether they be clicks, beeps, or bodily functions. 

Not the music! Just the UI sounds.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If the new look is too heretical for purists, the original version of Final Fantasy Tactics is also included with The Ivalice Chronicles, but you have to load into a different game completely (as opposed to something like Monkey Island or Halo: The Master Chief Collection, where you can swap back and forth at will) and you can’t even transfer save files between the two versions. I can respect the choice to stick with the classics, but know that doing so means you’ll also miss out on the best parts of this updated version: the new features and voice acting. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I know “quality-of-life improvements” aren’t usually the sexy part of a review, but the myriad changes in The Ivalice Chronicles add up to much, much more than the sum of their parts. Dozens of changes, big and small, have sanded down many rough edges and made this feel like a comparatively modern game. A completely re-tooled interface fits modern TVs and places vital information up front, such as a dynamic turn order list on the left side of the screen, the current Job Points (a vital progression stat) of your character’s class, and optional life bars and names you can toggle on and off with the press of a button. There are quick options to retry a battle instantly or to retool your party before jumping back in, or to load a save straight from the pause menu. You can hold the left trigger and scroll through each character in the order of their actions to see exactly what spell that wizard is casting and where so that you can make sure you don’t walk right into it. You can reset your movement if you haven’t picked anything up in that space or committed to an action afterward. And when deploying your soldiers for battle, you do so on the actual map, not just a floating liminal space that may or may not work out how you planned once you commence the actual fight. You can even fast-forward, an almost necessary feature when revisiting retro RPGs through a modern lens – our tolerance for games wasting our time has shrunk to almost nothing these days, and it’s hard to argue that’s not a good thing.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A completely re-tooled interface fits modern TVs and places vital information up front.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Nearly all of these features and pieces of information were available in the original version, but only if you knew where they were hidden in the archaic menus and behind odd button presses, or by quitting and reloading. When you add up the time and headaches saved over a campaign that lasts for dozens of hours, these changes make a huge difference. All of these battle alterations feel methodical and deliberate, as if the developers cleaned the cobwebs out of a dusty old garage so you can appreciate the gorgeous, shiny car sitting inside of it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Equal care has been given outside of battles. Quick guides for jobs that tell you what attribute damage scales off of and recommended skills to learn, a quick one-sheet of abilities at a glance, a job tree that shows you the requirements of your next unlock, pop-up tooltips that give you the important aspects of skills and equipment, combat sets that allow you to change your roster setup on the fly, the list goes on. You can even avoid random encounters on the newly redrawn map, and trigger previously random encounters at will. They’ve really done a great job with smoothing out the wrinkles without changing what made the original special. </p><h2 data-cy="title1">New Voices</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Another new addition that would be hard to imagine going without is full voice acting, and not just for cutscenes. Battle cries, small remarks during actions, and even pleas to your humanity as you dismiss a unit are expressed with almost universally excellent acting. Common robbers and peasants will speak in a working-class cockney accent, the nobles with florid flair, and mid-battle anger and anguish comes across much more clearly than before when it was just text. Some of the death wails, which used to be kind of a goofy and ethereal sound effects, now really drive home the point that you are killing these people on a battlefield. I was a little shocked by that at first, but it does make more sense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One example of voicework elevating a party member is Rapha, a character I’d never really cared much for previously. Despite her story always being a tragic one, hearing the pain and anger in her voice, as well as her accent being so different from everyone else’s, rounded out her character much more this time around. Also, there are just some world-class insults in here, and it’s fun to finally hear them out loud.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing of note is that often the tone in the Japanese language track is very different than the English one. What can seem like intense anger in the former can be an appeal to reason in the latter. They both work, but if you want emotions constantly ratcheted up a notch, Japanese is the way to go.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With these new voices also come new conversations that you’ll only hear if you bring the right combination of characters into particular story battles. A lot of these are not very interesting, unfortunately – many just see them espouse platitudes about the nature of power and don’t reveal much new information about the characters themselves, and they tend to make battles a bit too chatty. But there are a few that offer genuine insight into relationships between people that were never explored in the original, which I really enjoyed. </p><h2 data-cy="title1">Final Fantasy Chronicles</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">That doesn’t mean all these relationships are easy to keep track of, however, as the story involves several complicated power structures during a civil war, and so many people are double-crossing each other. Fortunately, much like the Active Time Lore feature of Final Fantasy XVI, The Ivalice Chronicles includes a fully interactive timeline called State of the Realm that shows you all the big movers and shakers as you continue through the story. Combined with a full encyclopedia, a list of all the cutscenes and the option to rewatch them, and a bunch of other tabs to keep terms, collectibles, and game tips straight, it helps a lot. While some of these overviews and biographies existed in the original’s Chronicle menu, their ease of access and updated layout here make them much less of a chore to peruse when looking for details I missed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The tutorials have received an overhaul as well, with the layout becoming much more reader-friendly. As an example, the zodiac compatibility chart, a system you could complete the story several times over without knowing anything about, used to be presented in a screen that looked like an ASCII FAQ from the early 2000s; it’s now just written out in plain language and separated by tabs.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The tutorials' ease of access and updated layout make them much less of a chore.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also various criss-crossing side quests in the final chapter that are notoriously hard to follow, but their reputation will have to change now that they all have quest markers pointing you to new and important destinations. This doesn’t make these quests any easier to overcome, as you still have to fight the same tough battles to complete them, but it makes them a lot less frustrating because it saves you from having to look up where to go at every step. It’s just another example of getting you to the fun that was already there.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-review]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nioh - 3 Minutes of 4K Gameplay</p>
      </div>
<p>Nioh 3 sees players step into the boots of a fictionalized version of Japan's first shogun, Tokugawa Takechiyo. With supernatural threats on the rise, it's up to Tokugawa to battle these malevolent forces by using <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nioh-3-dev-shares-how-ninja-gaiden-influenced-the-combat-overhaul/1100-6534898/" data-ref-id="1100-6534898">both samurai and ninja fighting styles</a>. Team Ninja says that its Ninja Gaiden games inspired a shift in the gameplay, and that players can freely shift between these stances.</p><p>The samurai fighting style has a unique Ki Pulse ability that can be used after attacking to recover stamina, while the ninja fighting style has a mist ability that can be used to create a doppelganger of Tokugawa that draws enemy attention away from him.</p><p>Team Ninja’s next game is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4/">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, launching on 21 October. This new instalment in the cult-classic Ninja Gaiden series has been co-developed with Platinum Games.</p>

According to an official statement, the game needs: "additional development and polish time" to ensure Gearbox "deliver the best possible experience to our fans".</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1970609156936868102">According to the public statement</a>, released across all official Borderlands social media channels, all digital pre-orders for Borderlands 4 have been cancelled in accordance to Nintendo policy. These cancellations will occur automatically on 26th September.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-release-date-moves-forward-perhaps-because-2k-knows-exactly-when-gta-6-is-coming-out">Borderlands 4 had its initial release date moved forward to an earlier date</a>, announced by a jubilant Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford in a hastily deleted video. Since the game's release, the game has suffered widespread performance issues for even high-end hardware.</p>

		<p>Straight4 Studios and Giants Software have lifted the lid on Project Motor Racing’s ranked online multiplayer mode, detailing how players will compete against each other in different classes and events throughout their online journey. Additionally, six new car brand partners have been confirmed to be in the game with those being Acura, Chevrolet, Mazda, Mercedes-AMG, Nissan, and Toyota. Plus, there is news of a new track with Sebring International Raceway being added to the track roster as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Project Motor Racing | Multiplayer Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1y2VVIfrccw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Project Motor Racing’s online ranked multiplayer the first thing you are going to need is a license to drive. This license does not carry over across different vehicle classes, since different car classes handle differently. Instead, for each class you will earn your license and that will give an initial score from 0-100, based on race cleanliness and placement. This score will place players with other racers of a similar skill level and the score will fluctuate depending on race. Each week, your two best race scores will contribute to a championship standing which is determined by finishing position and the ratings of the people that were raced. Hitting certain milestones will unlock access to special championships, while endurance races will only be available to racers with a lot of experience.</p>
<p>Project Motor Racing is a new motorsports sim racer – a spiritual successor to the Project CARS series, coming from Straight4 Studios and former Slightly Mad Studios CEO Ian Bell – and is a collaboration between Straight4 Studios and publisher GIANTS Software, who are best known for the Farming Simulator series. The game is incorporating a brand new physics engine, but combining that with the GIANTS game engine… so yes, this is using a farming game engine for motorsports!</p>

<p>Project Motor Racing is due to be released on November 25th for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Developer Oneway Ticket Studio has debuted a new cinematic trailer for its upcoming zombie first-person shooter/melee action game, The Midnight Walkers, and revealed that the game will launch on PC into early access this coming November 21, 2025.</p>



<p>The cinematic trailer does have a few short clips of gameplay, so the whole thing isn't entirely an 'all-sizzle-no-steak' showcase, and if you like what you see in the trailer, you'll be able to try out The Midnight Walkers before its November release, since there will be a demo available during the upcoming October Steam Next Fest which will run from October 13-20.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Midnight Walkers – Official Cinematic Trailer | PC Early Access 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z87ZmJwaZWo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The Midnight Walkers is a PvPvE action game you can play solo or with others in classic zombie-killing fashion. But it's not just about fighting off the zombies; it's also about fighting opposing players. An increasing amount of poison gas infects the various areas of the Liberty Grand Center, which is where you'll be doing your zombie killing, encroaching on you and the other teams, forcing everyone to wind up in close quarters.</p>



<p>You'll have four different classes to choose from when you jump into the LGC, including a slower bruser-style Brick class, a fast-paced and slick Crow class, a long-range sniper Lockdown class, and a support Bartender class. Effective use of each will help you survive whatever comes your way.</p>



<p>The Midnight Walkers isn't the only zombie-infested game that's arrived this year, as we've already seen the likes of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/killing-floor-3-review/">Killing Floor 3</a> and, more recently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-beast/">Dying Light: The Beast</a> come through. There's never really a shortage of zombie games, so hopefully, The Midnight Walkers is able to add something to the genre that can ignite a level of excitement in the players who love these kinds of titles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>News that Spider-Man, and more broadly Marvel, would be coming to <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> made waves a few years ago through their offices, particularly with <em>Magic</em>’s Head Designer Mark Rosewater. With just a few days until the set releases, I had the chance to talk to Rosewater, the set’s Lead Designer Corey Bowen, Principal Designer Jadine Klomparens, and Senior Art Director Sarah Wassell about everything Spider-Man and how they translated it to <em>Magic</em>.</p>

<h2>What Makes Spider-Man Spider-Man?</h2>

<p>Spider-Man is the most popular superhero in the world, so there’s obviously a lot people love about the character and the world he lives in. For Universes Beyond, translating the core pillars of why people love any one franchise is key to the set’s design.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, I asked the team what it was they loved about <em>Spider-Man</em> and what they wanted to make sure showed up in the set. Rosewater hit what I think is what most people are drawn to with <em>Spider-Man</em>:&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Superheroes are kind of larger than life ... They were grander than you and they’re something you could look up to and admire. But Peter Parker was you. He had actual problems that you had... Peter Parker is late on his rent and has trouble getting a date, you know?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For each Universes Beyond set, the team identifies who could serve as Subject Matter Experts for the property they are adapting. These are people very passionate and knowledgeable about whatever they're adapting and could come from anywhere in the company. They then become key resources and sounding boards throughout the design process.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/spider-man-no-more-mtg-card.jpg?itok=T7vL1PUU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/spider-man-no-more-mtg-card.jpg?itok=oRSZaLax 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In <em>Spider-Man</em>'s case, Rosewater served that role with some others, so his keying in on what he loved about Spider-Man, an everyday guy who happens to be a superhero, is something that shines through the set.</p>

<p>Personally for Rosewater, he said that when he heard they were talking to Marvel about making sets with their properties, the concept of Universes Beyond fully clicked with him. He now could feel the same level of excitement others in the offices felt about things they were deeply passionate about making their way into <em>Magic</em>.</p>

<p>Bowen expanded on the key aspects of <em>Spider-Man</em> and how they approached designing cards:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>A lot of times he’s making choices between should I be a hero? Should I cater towards my life? ... We try to really make sure we had a lot of family moments, a lot of those grounded moments in the set.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Specifically, Bowen mentioned that is why there are quite a few Modal choice cards in the set. The choice of what ability you activate mirrors the choices Spider-Man is faced with.</p>

<p>School Daze is a card where Peter is stuck with the choice of suiting up to protect the city or get his homework done. &nbsp;Another one Bowen mentioned was Heroes’ Hangout, where the tension between the dual-life of any of the heroes plays out.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For Bowen specifically, he really loves the relationship <em>Spider-Man</em> has with villains. The balance between the serious and humorous is something that stands out, where Spider-Man is constantly quipping and making jokes, talking with the villains.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Flavor text on the cards did a lot of the heavy lifting here, with little quotes of Spider-Man making fun of the likes of Vulture or Rhino. &nbsp;</p>

<h2>Making the Abstract Into Cards&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Moreso than in other sets of <em>Magic</em>, I noticed that there are a lot of “high concept” cards in <em>Spider-Man</em>. By that I mean, they’re not exactly obvious as ideas for a card. Web a guy? Easy card. Rent is Due? Not something you maybe think of right away.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mtg-rent-is-due-card.jpg?itok=805XiBE1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mtg-rent-is-due-card.jpg?itok=3ERvMILd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I asked for a little bit more on the design process of Rent is Due. In this card’s specific case, Bowen said they wanted a card to show Peter’s bad luck, the troubles he has in life.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rent is Due was one of the more difficult cards for the team to design Klomparens said, but they eventually landed on having it synergize with treasure.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There’s a few ways cards come to be in <em>Magic</em>, and a lot of the time it’s a question of what the set needs. There may be a lack of synergy in one color or maybe they need more cards to fit the identity of one color, like some more card draw in blue for example.</p>

<p>With Universes Beyond more often than your standard sets, they get to start from the point of: how do we get the flavor of the set right? What do we absolutely need to make this set feel like <em>Spider-Man</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/magic-gathering-final-fantasy-precons-review-warkin-good-fun" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy</em></a>, or <em>Lord of the Rings</em>?&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rent is Due was one of those cards that started out as just a concept of a card that would convey <em>Spider-Man</em> in a great way. “Parker Luck” is such a big thing to fans they wanted to make sure it was represented in the set, so the challenge is how they can find a satisfying mechanic that will make sense with the flavor of the card.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mtg-supportive-parents.jpg?itok=YX1X8JaU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mtg-supportive-parents.jpg?itok=ZY2cmTJG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Klomparens said that Rent is Due is an example of a card they probably wouldn’t have come to naturally if they were just designing cards in the normal process. It was something necessitated by the property they were adapting and a concept their subject matter experts like Rosewater identified early on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As a designer, Rosewater said that is one of the beautiful things of making Universes Beyond. They get to start designing in a place they never would have started before, which naturally leads to cards they haven’t made before.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>The Art of Spider-Man in Magic&nbsp;</h2>

<p>It would be impossible not to talk about the art of <em>Spider-Man</em> in this set. There are a ton of iconic moments, covers, and panels from the long history of the comics, meaning that the team had an embarrassment of riches to draw from.</p>

<p>Because comics are already a medium that has strong visual language, which <em>Magic </em>cards necessitate as well, they had a lot of strong material to both be inspired by and to identify as something to use for things like bonus sheet cards or alternate art.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For senior art director Wassell, she said it was very intimidating:&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There’s so much of it and there’s such a legacy. It’s such a popular thing and people know so much about this stuff, you know? Working on Universes Beyond is such a challenge... Once we started on Marvel ... we got to really dig into this to make sure that we’re doing it justice because we didn’t want to leave anything important out.</p>
</blockquote>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/spider-man-counterspell-bonus-sheet-mtg.jpg?itok=PSTYYueF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/spider-man-counterspell-bonus-sheet-mtg.jpg?itok=J2B-KC1c 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Wassell said that the team of art directors all knew they would need to do a ton of research to do this right, to make sure they didn’t miss anything obvious. Part of the difficulty in that is that even just for <em>Spider-Man</em>, there are over 60 years worth of comics to take into consideration.&nbsp;</p>

<p>She mentioned that they luckily had “enough brains around” and the subject matter experts like Rosewater to help narrow down their focus. It was a lot of group conversations and brainstorming to get it right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I asked how the process went a little more and how they approached representing the various runs and eras of<em> Spider-Man</em>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Rosewater said they had this program that was like a giant wall that anyone could put up comics, certain panels, covers, or whatever they like on it to show they thought it was a good candidate to use for a card or as inspiration. That's where a lot of it started.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/spider-man-reanimate-mtg-card.jpg?itok=iSoHArPY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/spider-man-reanimate-mtg-card.jpg?itok=lKmYAI7k 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Certain iconic works were just immediately obvious and didn't need a ton of discussion, like breaking out of the grave for Kraven’s Last Hunt or walking away with his suit in the trash can.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, Wassell said they started with those must-haves like the above. They then moved on to discuss the most exciting moments, broadening their search some more. Once they had so much material, the job then became asking questions about what they had too much of, what they needed more of, and more along those lines to narrow down the focus of what they were looking at.</p>

<p>I asked if they were trying to make sure the whole run of Spider-Man was represented or if they focused on a few particularly popular runs. Rosewater said they made a conscious effort to make sure they were hitting the biggest moments every decade, asking themselves what they could use from the '60s, '70s, etc.</p>

<p>One of the biggest boons to the <em>Spider-Man</em> set is just how many comic and cover artists of <em>Spider-Man</em>&nbsp;are represented, both in classics everyone has seen and new pieces using their talents. They no doubt know how to make <em>Spider-Man</em> look like <em>Spider-Man</em>.</p>

<p>A lot of the biggest names feature art straight from a comic or cover, like art from Steve Ditko, Todd McFarlane, John Romita, Sr., Mark Bagley, and a whole lot more. Then you have new art from current Marvel artists like Jay David Ramos, Roberta Ingranata, Lucas Werneck, and more.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/spider-man-heroic-intervention-mtg-card.jpg?itok=BDZi0OYv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/spider-man-heroic-intervention-mtg-card.jpg?itok=GCEuEtu_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Obviously, they use a lot more artists and their own not from the comics, so the team knows how to draw a Magic card. I asked Wassell if there was any real trepidation or concern handing some reins to the Marvel artists, but she said there wasn’t really much to worry about.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At most, she said that talking to artists has to do with more logistical issues. Things like “the fact that the cards are small and that the frame goes here... a lot of that work tends to just be helping artists wrap their heads around that.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>As we wrapped up our talk, I took the opportunity to ask the team for any advice as I was heading to my pre-release event immediately after. They told me they found Mayhem to be a fun mechanic that has worked well in pre-release. Hopefully I would get the cards to make a deck for it.</p>

<p>Well, I didn't. Thankfully, I had all sorts of green and white spider heroes to build around and ended up winning the event. Still, thanks for the advice team!</p>

<hr><p>Pre-release events may have already happened or are still happening at your local game store, so you can get your hands on some <em>Spider-Man</em> cards now if you wish. Otherwise, the set fully releases on September 26.&nbsp;</p>

              <p>We are but a month away from the start of HBO’s Stephen King series,&nbsp;<em>It: Welcome To Derry</em>, arriving All Hallow’s Eve Eve, October 26, to tell the prequel story of killer clown Pennywise and the people of the town he ravages. So, at long last, we have our first coherent trailer for the show that goes beyond scene setting. And, well, it sure looks like a lot more&nbsp;<em>It</em>.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/it-welcome-to-derry-trailer-pennywise-hbo-max-1851787189">Previous trailers</a> have certainly given us an overview of the town of Derry in 1962, 26 years prior to the events of 2017’s <em>It</em> and 53 years before 2019’s follow-up, <em>It: Chapter Two</em>. But this latest gets a lot more specific, introducing us to Charlotte and Leroy Hanlon and their son Will, a Black family moving to the very white town of Derry, renting a house so the army family no longer needs to live on base. After establishing that the show will not be shying away from issues surrounding race in the early ’60s, the trailer quickly moves on to establishing a very familiar set-up: A group of kids investigating the disappearances of a local child, while relating it to children who went missing 26 or 27 years earlier in mid-1930s, and indeed (from a very quick glimpse of a scrapbook), other kids vanishing in 1908. That’ll be that pesky Pennywise then.</p>  <p>With all that established, and word of 25 recent disappearances, things then devolve into a montage of horror tropes, from white-eyed children to rolling evil fog, spooky old houses to floors crawling with worms. And, of course, Pennywise, once more played by Bill Skarsgård, doing his spooky clown antics.</p>

 <p>It all looks splendid, and I’m really looking forward to the show, but that said, nggghhhh—something’s bugging me.</p> <p>I’ve mentioned before <a href="https://kotaku.com/it-welcome-to-derry-trailer-pennywise-hbo-max-1851787189">my hope that the show wouldn’t just be a full-on&nbsp;<em>It</em> rehash</a>, given the wealth of incredible books that have been set in Derry. Stories like&nbsp;<em>Bag of Bones</em>,&nbsp;<em>Secret Window Secret Garden</em>, and <em>Dreamcatcher</em> all took place there, as well as the mindbending&nbsp;<em>Insomnia</em>, and while the mid-century setting means the TV series will take place before all of those, it really does underline that like Castle Rock, Derry is a place where an awful lot more weird stuff takes place than just one killer clown wreaking havoc every quarter-century. It seems such a waste if we’re just going to watch yet another group of kids <em>obviously fail</em> to stop Pennywise as they’re all put through their own personal hells. We did that already! Twice!</p>

 <p>Given that each season of this show (should HBO break its recent habit of immediately cancelling everything) is intended to be set 26/27 years before the last, there’s a fear of diminishing returns as we simply follow the lives of the kids who were killed in the previous season. Clearly there’s a lot of room for depicting American life back through the ages, and I’m very interested to see a pre-war 1930s, and explore 1908 and the complexities of the Taft presidency. Should it manage all four seasons, we’ll get to see 1880, which will be fascinating, <em>unless</em> it’s just about a bunch of kids investigating the disappearance of local children after a meteor crashed into the town.</p>

 <p>The fog in the trailer is my remaining hope for more. It’s hard to see how Pennywise could do that, unless it turns out just to be one person’s imagined fear, and then I’ll be furious. (<em>The Mist</em> was set in the real town of Bridgton, Maine, in case you were wondering.) Some kids not stopping a clown that makes you scared doesn’t exactly sound like a recipe that can sustain another 32 episodes across four seasons, especially given we’ll know the outcome of each before we see it!</p> <p>We shall see. I’m really hoping that showrunners Jason Fuchs (<em>Wonder Woman</em>) and Brad Caleb Kane (<em>Warrior</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tokyo Vice</em>) have more ambition than that, boosted by the previous movies’ director, Andy Muschietti, helming a bunch of episodes. Just a month until we find out.</p>

While the studio continues to iron out the kinks, it has decided to delay the Switch 2 launch of Borderlands 4 to an unspecified date.</p><p>Since its launch on other platforms, players have reported technical issues with Borderlands 4, including unstable framerates, stuttering, and crashes, even on higher-end PCs. As a result of the latter, the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/">Steam reviews</a> currently stand at "Mixed."</p><p>Borderlands 4 was scheduled to launch on Switch 2 on October 3, but Gearbox has pushed the date to ensure this version doesn't suffer a similar fate. As a result, Gearbox is canceling all digital pre-orders on the Nintendo eShop (though players can do this themselves or wait for it to occur automatically on Friday, September 26). The studio also states it plans to time the eventual release of this version to coincide with the arrival of cross-saves, a feature currently in development.</p><p>Here is Gearbox’s full message, as shared on <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1970609156936868102?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">X</a>:</p><p>Greetings, Vault Hunters.</p><p>We need to share that the release of Borderlands 4 on Nintendo Switch 2 is being delayed. We do not take this decision lightly, but are committed to ensuring we deliver the best possible experience to our fans, and the game needs additional development and polish time to do that. Our hope is to also better align this release with the addition of cross-saves, which we are working on and recognize is very important. We will update you all on the new release timing once we’ve fully adjusted our plans.</p><p>In accordance with Nintendo’s policy, all digital pre-orders to date will be cancelled. Customers can initiate that process themselves now, or it will happen automatically starting on Friday, September 26. For questions about the Nintendo eShop, contact [Nintendo].

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/final_fantasy_tactics_advance">Final Fantasy Tactics</a> is probably, all things considered, my favourite <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/final_fantasy">Final Fantasy</a>. As someone who isn't really a huge video game lore person at the best of times, as in I forget most of it because my brain needs the storage space for memories of food, in my eyes it stands shoulder-to-shoulder with some of the best in the mainline series.</p>
<p>This is a game that gives me the tight, strategic combat fix that I want, you see, whilst delivering a world, characters and story that fit into the overall Final Fantasy vibe incredibly well, without requiring a degree in finalising all known fantasies to understand or fully enjoy. The narrative, which sees you slip into the shoes of Ramza Beoulve as he drops nobility for rebellion, is an epic one, make no mistake. It's got all the twists and turns you'd expect, and a few more besides, making it easier to get into the groove of.</p>
<figure><a title="Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159086/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In serving up its fantastic story in such a direct and effective way — you can relax, I'm not gonna spoil anything — and in delivering the combat goods (and then some) upon its lovely little miniature, rotating battlefields, this game is just a winner in every conceivable way. I thought it was perfect in 1998, and I loved returning for <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psp/final_fantasy_tactics_the_war_of_the_lions#reviews">The War of the Lions</a> PSP version in 2007, an upgrade that added new characters, plot points, and jobs to proceedings. It's just one of those incredibly moreish, flexible and deep turn-based efforts, the sort of thing you can replay many times over just to test new...well, tactics.</p>
<p>Of course, I'm bringing up The War of the Lions awkwardly here, because the stuff that it added, all the good stuff that I've just listed, is cut from this new version. Well, I say "cut"...I mean, yes, it has been cut, but it has also had some of its <em>essence</em> (purely in terms of its story, I should make clear) massaged gently into aspects of the retouched narrative of The Ivalice Chronicles. So you <em>are</em> losing all the stuff you were worried you would, but you are also getting a version of the game that looks and feels as though it's been tightened up and smartened across the board in ways that make it very hard to criticise otherwise.</p>
<p>So let's start with what we do get, rather than what's missing. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a> gives you <em>two</em> versions of Final Fantasy Tactics to play with; The Ivalice Chronicles, or 'enhanced' version, affords you all of the new features that I'll dig into in a moment, whereas the 'classic' version presents the original game with only minor QoL changes. Simple enough. However, there's more to it than that. There always is.</p>
<figure><a title="Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159087/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The classic version here actually uses the War of the Lion's script, you see, whilst the enhanced edition settles on a hybrid affair. You still aren't getting any of the new characters/jobs from War of the Lions back, but playing through the enhanced version, I've been impressed by how much work has been put into what's been done. This is not some lazy, slapdash, cut-content affair. We all know the game has been painstakingly rebuilt due to issues with the source code and whatnot, but with the addition of full voice-acting — easily the biggest and best addition here by the way — there's also been lots of clever tinkering with the dialogue. It now flows better, it's been cleaned up and made more easy to parse, and to <em>perform</em>, I'm sure, for the talent involved.</p>
<p>And they've gone all-out in this regard; they've even got that Ben Starr lad in. It really can't be overstated what a difference it makes to hear the words not just acted out, but acted out so damn well. Even for someone like me who gives over much of their brain storage to thoughts of meat, I'm going to remember everything that happened this time. It's emotional! And it drives home just how great a job they did first time around in giving us a rich and absorbing spin-off.</p>
<p>In terms of The Ivalice Chronicles' other noteworthy changes, you get delicately enhanced looks, now wonderfully crisp and clear, and it's a delight to see little touches such as the sunlight pouring through a window, or dust and other little bits of volumetric fun floating around in the air whilst conversations and battles take place. It's nothing that's going to make your jaw hit the floor — there's no work for Ray Tracing or any of his pals here — but it delivers exactly what it intends to in a way that doesn't mess with the classic vibes. And it performs beautifully in both docked and handheld while it does so.</p>
<figure><a title="Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159088/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>With regards to gameplay, the biggest changes have happened pre-battle. Here you are now free to select characters and drop them into position on the map, a map that you can also now cursor around freely, hovering over enemies for details and so on before the action kicks off. It's therefore much easier to get the lay of the land. You can also change jobs, swap equipment, and learn new abilities in the pre-battle period, which makes a huge difference in how things flow into the meat of the game.</p>
<p>In battle, the meaningful changes continue, with a new tactical top-down view letting you get a read on things at any time without scenery getting in your way (possibly the only thing that ever annoyed me playing the first one). Turn order being highlighted down the left side of the screen is also a huge change-up for the better, as is the ability to reset your turn should you move to the wrong place.</p>
<p>Alongside all of this, the UI also now shows you predicted hit damage, so you're looking at scraps that give you more info more readily and allow for much more experimentation before running moves as a result. The enemy AI has seen improvements, too; there's more range to how they react when you're trying to flank and mess with them.</p>

<p>Little touches such as improved aiming, easier manipulation of the battle arena to view angles, markers to affix to enemies so you can keep track of them, and so on, add up to a game that feels genuinely fresher. It's a notable improvement on something that was already fantastic, and that's saying something.</p>
<p>The frequency of random battles as you travel has been lessened, and you can also freely skip out of these, choosing to flee rather than engage, which is great for players who just want to get on with the main thrust of things, rather than knowing that a play session will force extra encounters on you that hold meaningful progress back.</p>
<div><p>We also get all of the auto-play, fast-forwarding through enemy turns, and skipping dialogue and cutscene options you'd expect in this day and age, so the momentum of the game can be controlled to a greater extent here - which marries very nicely with Switch 1 and 2 bringing all of this to you in portable form. It's just an easier game to play in bursts, especially given you can save at your leisure now. If you're wondering about touchscreen implementation, there isn't any, unfortunately.</p><p>

Oh, I should mention — and again without spoiling anything important, I hope — that one character, who was sort of ruined in how late they showed up to the party in the original, now gets introduced more quickly, alongside their weapon, which was a total pain in the arse to get a hold of the first time out. Good news. And if you know what I'm talking about, even better news!</p></div>

<p>Where there was only one difficulty setting to choose from in Final Fantasy Tactics of old, The Ivalice Chronicles gives us three: Squire, Knight, and Tactician. I've played through the game on Knight, which is a smoothed version of the original difficulty, and it feels slightly less frustrating, a little easier than I remember it being, so if you've played before, you might want to jump to Tactician straight away. Although make no mistake, this game is still hard, even for returning folk. And so it's nice that the easier mode is there to take away some of the gruelling aspects of battles for FF fans who want story over everything else.</p>
<p>Finally, this new version also brings back a bunch of "sound novels" which didn't originally make it to the Western release, giving lots more lore and worldbuilding to dig into. This is great, of course; however, it's the addition of the State of the Realm feature from <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a> that's been impressing me most. It's like they were thinking of me all along. I can jump in here and check out the story, the characters, the timeline, and the terminology at any time. I can get a re-up on my knowledge, thus enabling even the most forgetful amongst us to enter battles with a full awareness of why exactly I'm there. Truly priceless.</p>

<p>And so, what we've got here, in the end, is an excellent port of a truly fantastic tactical RPG — seriously my favourite of all the Final Fantasies I've played — that makes enjoying the thrilling tactical, turn-based combat at its core easier than ever. It tweaks things to make them smarter, it gives you more options to stop and take stock, and I personally love how it's hybridised things (to an extent) with the story.</p>
<p>Returning to the game some eight years since the last time I played it, too, I've been thoroughly impressed all over again by the flexibility, and replayability, that's built-in through the wonderful jobs system. Even without the stuff that got added for War of the Lions, when combined with the on-field strategy, the list of jobs here; from Thief to Samurai, Lancer, Dancer and/or Geomancer, the freedom it gives you to switch out and try new moves, spells and approaches to tough scraps, is as dreamily engrossing in 2025 as it's ever been.</p>
<p>For newcomers, I've got zero reservations in recommending what's here. It sits happily alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/triangle_strategy">Triangle Strategy</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/valkyria_chronicles_4">Valkyria Chronicles</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xcom_2_collection">XCOM</a> — all the tactical titans of this genre — as a must-play, and it's an adventure that's lost none of its impact over the years. Facts.</p>

<p>And yet, I can't ignore that, for returning players especially, the excision of the War of the Lions content (especially the characters and new jobs) will be a negative. Still, what a game though, eh.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Yes, Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles cuts content from the War of the Lions version, and it's a shame. However, put this one issue aside, if you can, and you've got a fantastic — and fantastically thoughtful — revamp otherwise. Meaningful QoL changes meld with delicate gameplay nips and tucks, CPU enemy tune-ups, and a smoother-flowing experience overall to deliver a game that's pretty much impossible to knock.</p>
<p>Fans will be fully absorbed into the story all over again, enjoying the new flow of the narrative and experiencing the whole thing so wonderfully well-acted. Newcomers, who're less likely to be bothered by the missing content, well, they can just get busy lapping up one of the all-time great tactical RPGs looking and playing better than ever.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher 2K and developer Gearbox have announced that the Switch 2 version of recently-released looter shooter&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>is being delayed indefinitely, and that pre-orders on the platform will be canceled.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1970609156936868102" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on social media, the game is being delayed on Switch 2 in order to "deliver the best possible experience to [the two studios'] fans", and also to "better align [the Switch 2 release] with the addition of cross-saves".</p>

<p>2K and Gearbox didn't announce a new release date or window, but they did promise to reveal more once they've "fully adjusted" their plans for&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>on Switch 2.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/borderlands-4-switch-2-port-delayed-psycho.jpg?itok=m_NGB1Wm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/borderlands-4-switch-2-port-delayed-psycho.jpg?itok=9Okcs85w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>is being indefinitely delayed on Switch 2.</figcaption></figure><p>Pre-orders are being canceled "in accordance with Nintendo's policy", according to 2K and Gearbox. You can initiate the cancellation process yourself if you want, but it'll automatically begin on September 26th (that's this Friday). Naturally, if you have a physical pre-order in place, you should contact the retailer.</p>

<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s delay on Switch 2 comes after widespread criticism of the game's performance on PC (and consoles, but criticism seems primarily aimed at the PC version), prompting Gearbox's Randy Pitchford to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/randy-pitchford-borderlands-4-performance-comments" rel="nofollow">passionately leap to the game's defense</a>.</p>

<p>Despite Pitchford's assertions that&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s PC performance is fine, 2K and Gearbox have pledged to continue improving&nbsp;the game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-pc-performance-top-priority" rel="nofollow">calling PC performance their "top priority"</a>.</p>

<p>All of the talk around&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>'s performance also doesn't seem to have hurt the game sales-wise, at least not in the initial surge; reports estimate that the game has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-sales-revenue" rel="nofollow">managed to shift around 2.5 million copies</a>, with the majority of those sales being on PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a-is-bringing-fashion-back-to-the-franchise.1306689/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In the past few <em>Pokémon </em>games for the Nintendo Switch, the character customization options have been so limited that they sometimes felt like an afterthought. Though there were plenty of hair styles and clothes to choose from in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/13/20962722/pokemon-sword-shield-review-nintendo-switch-launch-date"><em>Sword </em>/ <em>Shield</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22898939/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Legends: Arceus</em></a> put more emphasis on standardized outfits that made your trainer look more like an NPC than the hero of their own story. Things got even more drab in <em>Scarlet </em>/ <em>Violet</em> where basically every character wore one of two school uniforms, which made it seem like Game Freak did not think that players would be all that concerned about in-game fashion.</p><p>It was hard to know what to expect from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/759788/pokemon-legends-z-a-battle-real-time-preview"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a>, the franchise’s first title to debut on both the original Switch and the Switch 2. But after spending some time playing around in the new game’s character customization menus, I came away feeling like <em>Legends: Z-A </em>is going to be one for the folks who have always wanted to see versions of themselves in the <em>Pokémon </em>world.</p><p>Unlike previous <em>Pokémon </em>games that have let you explore massive chunks of the fictional world, the entirety of <em>Legends: Z-A </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22898939/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch">takes place in Lumiose</a> — a massive city located in the center of the Kalos region. While the geographical similarities between Kalos and real world France were readily apparent in <em>Pokémon X </em>/ <em>Y</em> (where the region made its debut), <em>Z-A </em>takes things to the next level by putting even more emphasis on the parallels between Lumiose and Paris. The city’s full of massive buildings, cafes, and parks where you can find wild pokémon to battle and catch. What immediately jumps out about <em>Z-A</em>’s take on Lumiose, though, is how <em>well-dressed</em> all of its residents are.</p><p>In <em>Z-A</em>, your character is a tourist who shows up in a flashy default ensemble of their own, but soon after you arrive, the game gives you a multitude of ways to give them a distinct look of their own. Almost every piece of your characters’ outfit is customizable whether it’s your shoes, socks, bottoms, tops, jackets, and various accessories like earrings. There are plenty of shorts and pants, dresses and skirts, and each garment comes in a variety of colors or patterns. And one of the bigger differences in <em>Legends: Z-A</em> compared to older <em>Pokémon </em>games is that you can equip any piece of clothing regardless of the gender option you pick when the story first begins.</p><p>The sheer variety of clothing options that <em>Legends: Z-A</em> gives you to choose from makes this version of Lumiose, like Paris, feel like a city where fashion is appreciated as a form of artistic and personal expression. The game doesn’t <em>immediately </em>let you access to a gigantic wardrobe, but that gives you another reason to participate in the city’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637256/pokemon-legends-z-a-trailer-day-night-cycle">Z-A Royale competition</a>. Beating other trainers in battle is one of the core ways to earn in-game currency.</p><p>Of course, you can spend your winnings on items to cure your pokémon’s ailments or pay for a snack at one of Lumiose multiple cafes — an option that heals all of your pokémon’s wounds and gives you a chance to have a little photoshoot with your favorite monster buddy. But if you want your trainers’ photoshoot looks to be coordinated with your pokémon’s aesthetic, you’ll have to spend your money to buy specific clothes at Lumiose’s various boutiques.</p><p>You can change your outfit and certain details on your face like the shape of your eyelashes pretty much anywhere. But I was not able to see for myself how robust <em>Legends: Z-A</em>’s options for physical character customizations are because the demo I played didn’t give me access to certain parts of the game. Trailers have made clear that there will be quite a few hairstyles and hair colors (with an option to give your trainer highlights), which you can select at one of Lumiose’s salons. Multiple skin tones will also be available, but like your character’s gender presentation, those customizations are selected when you’re first starting the game.</p><p>One of the coolest things about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pokemon/775547/pokemon-legends-za-mega-malamar">Nintendo’s most recent round of ads for <em>Legends: Z-A</em></a> is how they turned the game’s NPCs into real people. It wasn’t just that the characters were portrayed by living actors — they were also clearly dressed like their in-game counterparts. <em>Legends: Z-A</em>’s character customization options feel like they were designed to let you create trainers with their own unique senses of style. And that could be one of the things that makes the game feel fresh when it releases next month.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/784264/pokemon-legends-z-a-hands-on-fashion-nintendo-switch-2#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTE="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Charles Pulliam-Moore</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/784264/pokemon-legends-z-a-hands-on-fashion-nintendo-switch-2]]></content:encoded>
