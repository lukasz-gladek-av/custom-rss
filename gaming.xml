			<p>Brass Rain is an upcoming free-to-play WWII first-person shooter from Yarnhub Studios, a developer made up of veterans from EA, Remedy, Sony, and Jagex. It's also a studio that's known more as an animation studio, making animated videos shared on YouTube, that is now entering the video game industry with Brass Rain as its debut title.</p>



<p>It's able to fund the title thanks to $2.9 million of crowdfunding from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Yarnhub">the community it built with its YouTube channel</a>, which currently has over 2.7 million subscribers. While it's been known as an animation studio, making a game has been a long time coming, and something that the studio's community has been asking the company to try for a long time.</p>



<p>"<em>Our audience has been asking for us to make a game for years,</em>" said David Webb, chief executive officer at Yarnhub, in a press release. "<em>They've told us exactly what they want: a game with heart, historical authenticity, global campaigns, and multiplayer combat that lets them fight as infantry, tank crews, bomber gunners, and naval teams. Brass Rain is our answer to that call, built from the ground up with the community in mind</em>."</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>Brass Rain isn't just a game, it's a living historical experience shaped by the millions who watch our films every month</em>," continued Cyril Barrow, head of games at Yarnhub Studios. "<em>Our community challenged us to go beyond what games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/edenspark-war-thunder-devs-gaijin-entertainment-open-source-ai-assisted-game-making/">War Thunder</a> and World of Tanks offer, by adding the one thing they've always wanted: boots-on-the-ground infantry. We're delivering a fully crew-based combat experience that lets players fight together across land, sea, and air, and experience history as they go</em>."</p>



<p>According to the press release, Yarnhub is moving forward with a free-to-play model because of its success on YouTube and the crowdfunding it has accomplished so far. There will be "<em>some of the lowest-cost cosmetic microtransactions in gaming</em>" included in its free-to-play model, according to the studio. We'll have to get price matches on that claim to see if it holds water, but for now, it's nice to see Yarnhub at least trying to approach free-to-play in a way that won't try to gauge players.</p>



<p>Brass Rain will launch in early access on Steam sometime in 2026.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/macbook-pro-m4-pro-chip-512gb-hits-new-record-low-apple-clears-stock-as-m5-chip-arrives-2000646132</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/macbook-pro-m4-pro-chip-512gb-hits-new-record-low-apple-clears-stock-as-m5-chip-arrives.1360717/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple just announced its M5 chip a few weeks ago but this <strong>MacBook Pro with M4 Pro remains an incredibly powerful machine</strong> that handles almost all professional workflows with ease. This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5787/">record low pricing at $1,749 on Amazon for the 24GB/512GB model, down from $1,999</a>, makes it more compelling than most MacBooks currently available.</p>
<p>The model sits as the <strong>#1 best-seller among MacBook Pros on Amazon</strong> and the reason becomes clear when you consider the specs at this price point. Apple never runs discounts directly on its website or in its retail stores, so hitting up retailers like Amazon during Black Friday is the only way to score legitimate discounts on current-generation MacBooks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5787/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Desktop-Class Performance</h2>
<p>The 12-core CPU splits down into <strong>eight performance cores and four efficiency cores</strong> and makes quick work of everything from video editing to the compilation of software. The architecture executes the resource-intensive tasks much faster compared to the previous M3 Pro, drawing less power in the process, which puts more runtime on your battery when doing intensive work. Real-world performance reveals stutter-free 4K video timeline scrubbing, instant photo filter application across hundreds of images, and code compilation that completes before you finish your coffee.</p>
<p>The <strong>16-core GPU</strong> provides graphics performance that’s competitive with discrete graphics in much pricier Windows laptops. You can edit multi-layer 8K video projects, work with intricate 3D models, or run demanding creative apps like Cinema 4D without thermal throttling. Gaming performance is above expectations for a Mac, with AAA titles running at high settings and maintaining smooth frame rates. A u<strong>nified memory architecture sees the GPU tapping into the same 24GB pool as the CPU</strong>&nbsp;which diminishes bottlenecks normally associated with traditional discrete graphics arrangements.</p>



<p>The 24GB of unified memory handles professional workloads that choke systems with less RAM. You can have dozens of browser tabs open, run multiple creative applications at the same time, and switch between projects without any hint of slowdowns. The unified architecture means this 24GB functions more efficiently than traditional RAM since both CPU and GPU access it directly.</p>
<p>The display on the <strong>14.2-inch Liquid Retina XDR is capable of 1000 nits of sustained brightness and peaks at 1600 nits for HDR content</strong>. Mini-LED backlighting enables true blacks with excellent contrast that makes on-screen content pop. Color accuracy meets professional levels right out of the box, thanks to P3 wide color gamut coverage that will satisfy even photographers and video editors. The <strong>screen refresh rate of 120Hz</strong> courtesy of <em>ProMotion</em> makes scrolling feel butter-smooth and helps alleviate eye strain during extended work sessions.</p>



<p>That’s also <strong>18 hours of video playback or about 12 hours of actual work</strong> mixing web browsing, document editing, and creative applications. You can work through a full day without hunting for outlets, and that transforms the way you approach mobile productivity. The <em>MagSafe</em> charging connection means that accidental cable yanks won’t send your laptop flying, and you still have both Thunderbolt ports free for peripherals.</p>
<p>Apple Intelligence integration brings <strong>AI features right to the operating system</strong>, from advanced text editing suggestions all the way to picture generation tools within native apps. All of these AI-related tasks are processed locally by the M4 Pro’s Neural Engine for data privacy and speed. These features keep evolving through new software updates, adding value during the life of the laptop.</p>
<p>You’re getting here a professional-grade laptop with M4 Pro performance for $250 less than Apple’s direct pricing, at $1,749. Similar Windows laptops are $2,500 or more and lack the efficiency and battery life that Apple Silicon delivers.</p>

<p>Fans of Breaking Bad have spotted a legendary Easter Egg in Battlefield 6. The new Eastwood map has you battling all over a poor neighborhood, but one of the houses has a familiar food item.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-breaks-franchise-sales-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> will be adding lots of new content for the foreseeable future. Across seasons and mini-updates, BF 6 is going to be one stacked game when all is said and done. The new Eastwood map is an example of what EA and DICE are cooking up in the content kitchen, and it offers a lot of destruction and diversity.</p>







<p>Funnily enough, it also has pizza.</p>



<h2 id="h-breaking-bad-amp-battlefield-6-put-their-easter-eggs-in-one-basket">Breaking Bad &amp; Battlefield 6 Put Their Easter Eggs In One Basket</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Tanks for the memories. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>A Reddit user has spotted a loose pizza decorating the roof of one house in Battlefield 6’s Eastwood map.</p>



<p>They’ve pointed out the location on the map—admittedly, you might need a magnifying glass to see it—and if you head there, climb onto the house’s roof, there, you’ll see a full pizza. Breaking Bad fans will instantly know the reference.</p>







<p>In Season 3, Episode 2, “Caballo sin Nombre”, Walter White brings over a giant pizza to the White house. His wife, Skylar, answers the door and refuses Walter’s request to come into the house. Walter leaves in a fury and throws the pizza box at the garage door. In a million-to-one shot, the pizza flies out of the box and lands on the roof.</p>



<p>The famous moment became even more iconic when you realise it was a <em>completely unscripted moment</em>, and really was an act of pure chance that actor Bryan Cranston managed to frisbee a giant pizza onto the roof!</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 isn’t the first game to include the Easter Egg, but it’s hard to imagine anyone will ever get sick of seeing it.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Breaking Bad is heralded as one of the greatest TV shows of all time. Do you agree? Is it overrated? And what are you making of Eastwood?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PUBG’s upcoming extraction shooter, Black Budget, has been officially revealed, with the first opportunity to play the game coming in a closed Alpha test next month.</p>



<p>Described as an “FPP-first experience,” PUBG: Black Budget expands on the popularity of the PUBG Battle Royale game, and it becomes the latest franchise to dip into the extraction shooter scene.</p>







<h2 id="h-pubg-black-budget-closed-alpha-sign-ups-open">PUBG: Black Budget Closed Alpha Sign-Ups Open</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Alongside the reveal of the game, a closed alpha test has been announced for next month, with sign-ups now open, and there are no NDA restrictions with the experience.</p>



<p>The closed alpha is spread across two weekends in December, with the first beginning at 1 AM PT on Friday, December 12, running up to Sunday, December 14 at 23:59 PT, with the second taking place a week later.</p>



<p>There are some limitations to involvement, with participation only open to those in North America, Europe, and Asia, but players involved will not be tied to an NDA and can therefore share images and clips, stream the game, and discuss their experience freely.</p>



<p>The closed alpha test is focused on “early-game systems, combat pacing, extraction balance, and player progression,” with players advised that, due to the game being in ongoing development, technical issues may occur.</p>



<p>Initial sign-ups for the closed alpha test are open on Steam, but players will also be able to earn a key through Twitch and Chzzk Drops once the first weekend of the test opens up.</p>



<p>PUBG becomes the latest title to venture into the extraction shooter space, following on from the success of titles like Arc Raiders, while Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 also features a PvE extraction mode.</p>

"It would be a lie not to say that obviously spring looks really good," he said of 007: First Light's release window.</p><p>The game launches on March 27, which was about two months before GTA 6's May 26 release date before Rockstar pushed the game to November 19, 2026.</p><p>While Abrak may be relieved to know 007: First Light now has much more space between it and GTA 6, he said, "GTA 6 is a welcome thing for the industry." That's because, he said, GTA 6 could help bring lapsed gamers back, which could then help lift the industry overall.</p><p>"I do believe a lot of gamers who maybe haven't played for a while will get into things again, and generally for the industry as a whole, I think that will be amazing," he said.</p><p>GTA 6 is expected to be an enormous success, with one estimate saying it could <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">sell 40 million copies and bring in more than $3 billion during its first year alone</a>. Before this, Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot said something similar in that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-does-not-scare-ubisoft-ceo-says/1100-6520931/" data-ref-id="1100-6520931">he's not afraid of GTA 6</a> because the game will amount to a rising tide lifting all ships. Not everyone is as optimistic, though. Industry expert Joost van Dreunen said it's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-wont-save-the-struggling-games-industry-expert-says/1100-6536219/" data-ref-id="1100-6536219">"naive"</a> to think that one big release like GTA 6 will help solve the industry's issues. "It won't," he said.</p><h2><strong>007: First Light is done</strong></h2><p>Also in the interview, Abrak confirmed that 007: First Light is "done," and is now playable from start to end. The team is spending time now polishing the experience and fixing bugs. "The whole game is done. It's been a long journey--six years almost--but I'm very proud that we are here," he said.</p><p>The executive also confirmed that IO funded 007: First Light totally by itself from the success of the Hitman series as opposed to taking external funding for it. The studio is, however, working with the 007 rights-holders on the project, but apparently not for funding purposes.</p><p>IO is also making a new multiplayer fantasy game, and Abrak teased that IO is "working with some partners" on this game, whatever it turns out to be. "But James Bond is fully funded by us. We are completely independent," he said.</p>

<figure><a title="DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160728/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>When <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-ball-sparking-zero">Dragon Ball Sparking! Zero</a> launched last year on non-Nintendo platforms. I was taken aback at how much time had passed since <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/dragon_ball_z_budokai_tenkaichi_3">the last entry</a> in this series. I was a teenager still in school!</p>
<p>With the launch of Nintendo Switch 2, a flurry of ports are coming to the updated console and handheld system, including Sparking Zero. I’m glad to say that Switch 2 is a great way to play this action-packed 3D brawler filled with content, if you can forgive some of the performance issues.</p>
<p>For starters, Sparking Zero looks crisp on Switch 2, and its charming and faithful art style bursts with colour on screen. The graphics look noticeably better in docked mode. In handheld mode, the aliasing around character models is glaringly obvious and somewhat distracting.</p>
<p>However, the high kinetic gameplay helps hide some of these visual blemishes. When you’re immersed in the moment-to-moment gameplay, you notice the jagged lines less. Furthermore, the Switch 2 version is capped at 30fps, which is disappointing compared to its other console counterparts, but it’s ultimately understandable in order to get it stable on the handheld.</p>
<figure><a title="DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160732/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The camera work makes the gameplay feel even more cinematic. When it comes to firing off special attacks like Trunks’s Burning Attack, the camera zooms in, often mimicking similar angles to those of the anime, making it feel authentic to the source material. Most of the voice acting here is matched from what I remember from the TV show as well, fueling these nostalgic feelings further.</p>
<p>Sparking Zero’s biggest selling point is its absolutely stellar roster. It has more than 180 different characters spanning from every corner of the Dragon Ball universe, even the non-canon movies. Whether you started with the original Dragon Ball or started tuning in with Super, you’re bound to find your favourite here.</p>
<p>Some of them are amusing clones, as there are 19 different versions of Goku, but each one has a distinctive move set that reflects where that particular Goku was at the time during the anime. Despite the repetition, they all require slightly different approaches to play and feel distinguishable from each other.</p>
<figure><a title="DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO Review - Screenshot 3 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160731/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Even still, there are dozens of characters to choose from that prevent fighting and gameplay from ever feeling stale. To accommodate such a huge roster, every character uses the same controls to move, fly, and charge their ki. However, there are a few nuances within the kinds of characters, such as androids like Android 18 not being able to charge ki, but it gradually rises automatically during battle. Giant characters, such as Great Ape Baby, can’t be grabbed. These differences help further differentiate the cast from one another, even though the controls are universal.</p>
<p>Sparking Zero’s main meat comes in its Episode Battles, which go through the story of Dragon Ball. Instead of playing out every single battle ever, there are eight playable characters with different paths telling a more condensed version of the story. Each path focuses on the most important and iconic moments, such as Super Saiyan Goku’s first fight against Full Power Frieza on Planet Namek. While having to go through eight different characters can be tiring, Episode Battles do a good enough job covering the biggest battles in the series.</p>
<p>But what makes Episode Battles interesting is the ability to go off branching narratives. For example, during the Cell arc in the anime, Piccolo fights Cell (1st form) off while Goku and Gohan wait for Trunks and Vegeta. However, Sparking Zero gives you the option to choose the opposite. By having Goku fight Cell instead (and winning), this prevents the Cell Games from ever happening, and now Goku gets to live happily ever after together with the Androids.</p>
<figure><a title="DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160729/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>This doesn’t happen with every single major plot point, so it doesn’t lose its novelty. I was always pleasantly surprised and excited whenever these options popped up on my screen.</p>
<p>Another way of getting branching events is satisfying certain hidden conditions in specific battles. For example, when Vegeta and Trunks spar in the Hyperbolic Time Chamber in Vegeta’s story route, defeating Trunks unlocks an entirely new path where the father and son duo manage to defeat Perfect Cell during the Cell Games, mirroring the canon events of the anime where Goku and Gohan did so instead. These were surprising, yet satisfying ways of unlocking more what-if scenarios.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Sparking Zero doesn’t actually tell you what these conditions are, which is rather annoying. On the bright side, since it took a little over a year for the game to come to Switch and Switch 2, you can easily find this information online, although I wish the game were clearer about it.</p>
<figure><a title="DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160730/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Additionally, this is where Switch 2’s performance takes a bit of a dip. During the comic-book style cutscenes, panels would change and there’d be a noticeable lag, especially transitioning into a battle. Although that’s not a huge issue once you get into the fight itself, as performance is nearly flawless there, where it matters the most.</p>
<p>This is the case for both handheld and docked mode. The performance issues also spill over into the menus. Whenever I would browse the main menus looking at game modes, like Episode Battle or the Shop, it would start to chug.</p>
<p>As you participate in battles, you’ll earn in-game currency Zeni that you can spend to unlock new characters and costumes. Thankfully, I didn’t feel like I was being nickel-and-dimed. I earned Zeni at a steady rate and the progression in acquiring unlockables felt natural. While there are microtransactions, I never felt the need to go out of my way to purchase them, which I appreciated.</p>
<figure><a title="DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO Review - Screenshot 6 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160727/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Sparking Zero also has a custom battle mode, where you can engineer battles like you’re playing out some sort of Dragon Ball fantasy. There’s an option to add dialogue to give your scenarios some narrative flavour, but overall this mode feels more like an afterthought than anything else. It wasn’t compelling enough like the Episode Battles, so I didn’t spend much time with it.</p>
<p>On the flip side, the online battle system is robust. Performance was practically perfect here, and I didn’t experience any connection drops during the matches I played.</p>
<p>Sparking Zero smartly balances online fights, too. You and your opponent have 15 DP, and each character costs a certain amount. While you can have a total of five characters on your team, the more powerful ones like Vegito Blue cost a whopping 10 DP, meaning that you only have 5 DP leftover for weaker characters like Master Roshi, Cell Jr, or even base form Early Goku to put on your team.</p>
<figure><a title="DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO Review - Screenshot 7 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/160733/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>To add an extra layer of strategy, many characters can transform during battle. So you could pick Goku (Z- End) in his base form, who costs 5 DP, but eventually transform him up to Super Saiyan 3, making him more powerful as the battle goes on. Your Goku might be a bit beat up by that time, but that lets you bypass Super Saiyan 3 Goku’s more expensive 7 DP cost to use him right off the bat.</p>
<p>This prevents you and your opponent from strolling into fights with high-powered characters, and you actually have to think about your team composition. If your Vegito Blue falls in battle, the rest of your team might not be able to pick up the slack.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Dragon Ball Sparking! Zero delivers a commendable 3D brawler experience even if some visual and performance issues persist. The immense roster is sure to please any Dragon Ball fan, no matter what age or era they entered the franchise. The branching narratives in Episode Battles and the online play are fun staples to the game, and it feels right at home on Switch 2.</p></section>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/extraction-shooter-pubg-black-budget-closed-alpha-next-month/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/extraction-shooter-pubg-black-budget-will-have-a-closed-alpha-next-month-sign-ups-now-live.1360696/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>PUBG: Black Budget is a new extraction shooter spin-off within the PUBG world from Krafton and PUBG Studios, currently in development for PC. If you've been waiting for a chance to check out this upcoming PvPvE shooter, then your shot is coming, as the studio has announced it will host a closed alpha test in December that players can sign up for now.</p>



<p>As is the case with most closed alphas, signing up doesn't guarantee you a spot; it just puts you in the running for one. Still, it's worth putting your name in if you're looking for a new extraction shooter to spend some time with. The closed alpha will take place over two sessions, the first running from December 12-14, and the second from December 19-21. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4077740/PUBG_Black_Budget/">sign up by requesting access to the closed alpha on the game's Steam page.</a></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>PUBG: Black Budget is set on an island called Coli, an island that's stuck in a time loop and being consumed by a mysterious supernatural phenomenon called the Anomaly. You'll deal with other players and enemy threats while you try to scrounge as much top-secret tech from the island, looking for anything that can lead to the truth behind what's happening on Coli and a secret, black budget initiative codenamed SAPIENS.</p>



<p>It's all together an interesting premise, though no one plays extraction shooters for their storytelling capabilities. It'll be more interesting, of course, to see how it plays next month, and if it's the latest extraction shooter that can carve out a place for itself in this increasingly competitive genre.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the major extraction shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-ceo-claims-we-should-assume-every-game-company-now-using-ai-game-devs-say-no/">in the industry at the moment continues to be ARC Raiders</a>, so Krafton and PUBG Studios will have to try making a comparable splash to get players' attention when a new extraction shooter just entered the space that fans of the genre are still enamoured with. </p>



<p>And while that's going on, Krafton continues to deal with its case against Unknown Worlds co-founders over the development of Subnautica 2, <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-strikes-back-unknown-worlds-founders-sharing-files-racist-views-korea/">a case that just took another major and unexpected turn</a> (though after the third unexpected turn, it was worth it to just expect unexpected turns).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><em>Like clockwork, every time Rob visits a city, he comes out of it telling Patrick "I think I should move there." You will not be surprised to learn that Rob had a similar awakening while spending a few days in Buffalo this past weekend, in theory to simply attend a Buffalo Bills game. </em></p><p><em>But in reality, this trip near Niagara Falls was a meetup with our community, falling for a city that wasn't on our radar, and a commitment to come back.</em></p><p><em>That commitment might be sooner than you think, too, in the grand scheme of things. One Remap supporter told us the Bears are likely destined to play the Bills at their new stadium in 2026 and promised us two tickets to the game.</em></p><p><em>You in, Rob?</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>I have never had a reason to visit Buffalo. I still don’t have a reason to visit Buffalo. We discussed this a few times over the weekend, including the Sports! recording we did in your hotel room, but especially as you get older, finding moments to travel, or escape your daily rhythms, become harder and harder. You might be in a better financial position to travel, but actually lining up the various parts of your life—time off, someone to watch your pets and/or kids, etc.—become a reason to push back that trip you’ve been talking about over and over.</p><p>Thing is, that’s what happens with trips you <em>want</em> to take. Trips you’ve been <em>planning</em> to take. Trips that would be checking a box on “yes, we finally did this.” This is with no offense meant to the great city of Buffalo, a city I can now comfortably say is actually great after having spent even a brief time enjoying it, but Buffalo was not exactly a city that I needed to check off a box! After we successfully pulled off Europe with the kids over the summer, I’m cracking my knuckles and trying to figure out if they could survive 16 hours on a plane towards Tokyo in a few years.</p><p>(Truth be told, 16 hours feels like nearly too much for <em>me</em>.)</p><p>But man, for all that’s fucked up about this country right now, this place is massive and full of cultural secrets hiding just around the corner. Buffalo is a 90-minute flight away from me, you basically go up and down. It does not cost very much to come here. The wallet hit to have a good weekend packed full of adventure is not much. Between my adventures in Pittsburgh a few years ago seeking out a haunted house beyond my own backyard and this trip to Buffalo, I am more convinced than ever that I need to start setting my sights a little lower, so to speak, on what it means to get outside of my house and experience something new. It’s not that far away.</p><p>I sat in a car outside of the General Mills factory and inhaled the cereal particles in the air.</p><p>I ate plates and plates of buffalo wings—one of my favorite foods—in the <em>city</em> of Buffalo.</p><p>I slapped the benches of Highmark Stadium like a ravenous wolf, willing the Buffalo Bills to defend the run on third down.&nbsp;</p><p>I talked shit with a cab driver who was deeply suspicious my Chicago Bears gear for the Bills game was secretly hiding a Buccaneers fandom. (At the end of the ride, I asked her to look me in the eye while I whispered “Go Bucs” while frantically heading towards the Bills tailgate.)</p><p>I watched a community of people come together in sprawling parking lots to share food and drink with one another. A formerly tortured group of fans who have hope and only want you to feel a sliver of it, too.&nbsp;</p><p>It was wonderful. Buffalo was wonderful. There’s no doubt I want to go back next year.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@captainflowers?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Seth Yeanoplos</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>I think next time I'm going to want to spend about 4 days there. Triple the time I spent tailgating, hit a few more food spots, hang with some of the people we met, and maybe see if someone offers architectural tours. You want to come see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Buffalo/comments/oyxbo1/buffalo_city_court_building_a_beautiful_example/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>The Oldest (Court) House</u></a>?</p><p>The truth is, I have never really met a city I didn't at least like and I love most of them. I'd move to Berlin in a heartbeat. I moved to LA fully prepared to hate it and have felt like I'm missing something ever since I left. I came back from your birthday trip asking MK, "So are we <em>sure </em>there's no world where we move to Chicago?"&nbsp;</p><p>There are two things that immediately cause me to withdraw any respect for someone. The first is using the word "illegals". The second is people who sneer at a city where they don't live. It betrays a narrow-mindedness and eagerness to embrace stereotypes that usually correlates with lots of other awful beliefs. Cities are fascinating organisms, shaped by such unique combinations of geography, immigration patterns, economic history, and, yes, sports culture. The fun thing about a city like Buffalo is that it's small enough that you feel like you can kind of get your arms around it in a way that megalopoleis like LA will resist. It has a lot of things in common with Chicago but as a Northwest Indiana kid, Buffalo feels a lot like an overgrown Whiting or a Gary that survived its worst economic distress. I am sure it also has a fair bit of stratification, like any city, but its small scale made the downtown feel less like a corporate retail preserve than larger cities, where downtowns can feel completely divorced from the life of anyone who calls a city home.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-quietly-offloads-millions-of-ps5-slim-with-disc-drive-now-selling-at-all-time-low-on-amazon-2000646168</link>

              <p>The PS5 launched in 2022 and maintained strict pricing for years, with Sony rarely offering any meaningful discounts even during major shopping events. This marks the first year the console sees genuine Black Friday price cuts, and these deals appear exclusively on Amazon. The<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5801/"> PS5 Slim with disc drive drops to $449 from $549</a>, while the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5802/">Digital Edition hits $399 instead of $499</a>. Both represent <strong>all-time low pricing for 2025</strong>&nbsp;and stock moves fast given the pent-up demand from years of limited availability and no discounts.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5801/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See PS5 Slim Standard at Amazon</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5802/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See PS5 Slim Digital Edition at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Disc Drive vs. Digital Edition</h2>
<p>The $449 <strong>disc drive version plays physical game discs and 4K Blu-ray movies and gives you flexibility in how you buy games</strong>: You can purchase used games, borrow from friends, sell titles you’ve finished, or take advantage of retail sales that often beat digital pricing. The physical media option preserves your ability to own games rather than licensing them digitally, which matters when publishers remove titles from digital stores. The 4K Blu-ray player adds value if you collect physical movies or want the best possible video quality without compression artifacts from streaming.</p>
<p>The $399 Digital Edition drops the disc drive altogether and saves <strong>you a cool $50 and making the console slightly lighter and more symmetrical in design</strong>. You download all games and content from the PlayStation Store, which means no disc swapping and instant access to your library. Digital purchases go on sale regularly through PlayStation Store promotions, and you can game share with one other person through console sharing settings. The <strong>trade-off is in losing resale valu</strong>e and being locked into whatever pricing Sony sets digitally.</p>



<p><strong>Both versions pack the same internal hardware for identical gaming performance</strong>. A custom AMD GPU based on the RDNA 2 architecture handles ray tracing, 4K resolution at up to 120fps in supported games, and variable refresh rate for smoother visuals. An 8-core Zen 2 CPU will process game logic and AI calculations with plenty of headroom for demanding titles, while 16GB GDDR6 of unified memory ensures smooth performance without bottlenecks between CPU and GPU operations.</p>
<p>The bespoke 825GB SSD fundamentally changes how games load and operate. Load times often fall from minutes to mere seconds, while some games offer near-instant fast travel. For the first time, developers can stream assets in real time rather than rely on loading corridors or elevator rides to mask transfers of data on high-speed storage. This storage architecture is the single biggest generational leap the PS5 offers over PS4 and transforms how games feel to play.</p>
<p><strong>The DualSense controller included offers haptic feedback</strong> which replaces the rumble feature of old with precise, intricate vibrations that simulate everything from textures to feelings. Adaptive triggers will create resistance that changes depending on what’s happening in-game, from the tension of drawing a bow to the recoil of different weapons. These features add immersion that previous controllers couldn’t achieve.</p>
<p><strong>Backward compatibility with PS4 games</strong> means your existing library carries forward, with many titles receiving performance boosts on PS5 hardware. Games run at higher frame rates, load faster, and sometimes receive resolution upgrades without requiring separate purchases. The PS Plus collection includes access to a curated selection of PS4 classics at no additional cost beyond the subscription.</p>
<p>At $449 for the disc version and $399 for digital, these are the best PS5 pricing we have seen this year. The disc model saves you $100 while keeping physical media flexibility, while the digital edition drops down to impulse-purchase territory for anyone holding out. These Black Friday prices on Amazon finally get the PS5 into a place where it’s accessible without the markup or bundles that dominated availability for years.</p>

              <p>Most drone photography involves FAA registration, learning about Remote ID requirements and other regulatory hurdles before ever taking to the skies. However, the <strong>DJI Mini 4K weighs less than 249 grams</strong> which means it falls beneath the threshold requiring registration for recreational flights here in the United States (this is why it’s also among the most popular ones). You can purchase this drone, charge the battery and be flying in a matter of minutes-no paperwork or waiting periods required. The good news is,Amazon<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4576/"> just dropped this to $239 for Black Friday, down from the usual $299</a>, which marks the lowest price this model has ever hit.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4576/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>4K Quality Without the Registration Hassle</h2>
<p>The <strong>footage from the 4K Ultra HD camera</strong> appears professional straight out of the drone. It features a resolution of 3840 x 2160 that retains sharpness whether you fly over landscape views, shoot action sequences, or close-up captures of subjects. The <strong>3-axis gimbal mechanically stabilizes the camera</strong>, and compensates in real time for movements of the drone and turbulence of wind. This stabilization translates to smooth footage even when the drone shifts position-a quality that lacks in amateur videos taken by drones.</p>
<p>It operates well under a variety of illumination conditions, ranging from <strong>bright midday sun to golden hour sunsets and even low-light evening scenes</strong>. You are able to shoot sunrise footage without the blown-out highlights that cheaper cameras display, and sunset shots retain color saturation without losing shadow detail. Night shooting is also better than expected for a drone in this price range, although you will want to keep the shutter speeds reasonable to avoid excessive noise.</p>



<p>The<strong> 10km video transmission</strong> range gives you serious operational distance without losing signal. You can fly the drone far enough to explore large areas, follow moving subjects over extended distances, or capture sweeping panoramic shots. The impressive thing about the video transmission system is that it maintains quality across this range, so you see what the camera sees in real time without lag or pixelation. This range far exceeds what budget drones offer and matches what you’d find in models costing twice as much.</p>
<p>Wind resistance up to Level 5 conditions means the <strong>drone stays stable in 38kph winds</strong>. The brushless motors provide consistent power that maintains accurate positioning of the drone even when gusts hit. This capability is important if one flies over coastal areas, mountains, or any other place where the wind might suddenly change. It also <strong>enables takeoffs at altitudes of 4,000 meters or higher</strong>&nbsp;which is useful for mountain photography or high-elevation adventures.</p>



<p>The <strong>31-minute flight time</strong> from a single battery gives you enough airtime to set up shots, experiment with angles, and capture the footage you want without constantly landing to swap batteries. You can shoot thoroughly around a location or film an entire sequence uninterrupted.</p>
<p>GPS R<em>eturn to Home</em> automatically activates in cases of a low battery or if the connection drops. It flies back to its takeoff point and lands itself, hence avoiding crashes or lost equipment. It enables beginners who might lose their orientation or misjudge the battery levels to be at ease. <strong>One-touch takeoff and landing</strong> simplify operations, freeing you to work on capturing shots rather than managing controls.</p>
<p>QuickShots modes automatically handle complicated camera movements with pre-programmed flight patterns. Helix circles your subject while ascending, Dronie pulls back and up for reveal shots, <strong>Rocket shoots straight up, Circle orbits around a point, and Boomerang</strong> creates looping paths. These automated modes produce professional-looking results without requiring piloting skills or manual camera control. You choose the mode, select the subject, and the drone performs the shot.</p>
<p>You’re getting here a 4K drone with proper stabilization, extended range, and intelligent features for under $239-what most 1080p budget models cost. Its weight of under 249 grams eliminates requirements to register it, thereby removing barriers that stop people from trying drone photography. <strong>Besides its beginner-friendly controls and automatic safety features,</strong> this very much makes 4K quality accessible to anyone interested in aerial photography.</p>

<p>EA and Activision are locked in a war to have the best military FPS in 2025 and beyond. Battlefield 6 has helped the franchise bounce back meteorically, and Black Ops 7 is another solid CoD game. You need an answer to decide which game is better and which you should buy.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-breaks-franchise-sales-record/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> emphasises destruction and immersion, whereas <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-dark-ops-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a> is more arcadey and silky. Each game is a military shooter, but there are so many nuances that divide them. If you can’t decide which of the two to buy, Insider Gaming’s Battlefield 6 vs. Black Ops 7 showdown is about to begin!</p>







<h2 id="h-is-the-battlefield-6-or-black-ops-7-campaign-better">Is The Battlefield 6 Or Black Ops 7 Campaign Better?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Skibidi. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Oh boy, this is a fun one to start. On one hand, you have Battlefield 6’s campaign, which is a fairly cut-and-dry affair with the odd good mission and a handful of fun moments; on the other hand, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-skibidi-toilet-boss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 has a skibidi toilet boss</a>.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6’s story is clear: A PMC wants to essentially destroy the world, and you have to stop them. Its characters aren’t too memorable outside of Haz Carter. You could argue Battlefield hasn’t had memorable characters since the Bad Company games. But some of the mission locations are gorgeous, and set us up nicely for electric multiplayer maps.</p>



<p>The BF 6 campaign’s runtime is short and mostly sweet; however, it would take another playthrough or two for everything to stick in the mind. The campaign actually gets good toward the end, but just as the narrative perks up, it finishes just as abruptly. It’s a good campaign, but nothing special.</p>







<p>Whereas Treyarch decided to take the gloves off, jump the shark, and build an observatory to see how many flying pigs it could spot. Black Ops 7’s campaign leans far too heavily into the supernatural and just plain weird. Black Ops 6’s Emergence mission was a delight the first time around, and was something that hadn’t really been seen before.</p>



<p>But Black Ops 7 has you bringing down nuke-sized machetes, controlling a friendly army of Zombies, and fighting a literal skibidi toilet boss. Also, the campaign takes a horrible twist by becoming the first-ever online-only CoD campaign, meaning <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/you-cant-pause-the-black-ops-7-campaign-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can’t pause the game</a>. Your game can be interrupted by other people, updates, and other factors. The game’s conclusion also integrates into a new PvP <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-endgame-available-campaign-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Endgame</a> mode. Black Ops 7’s campaign is a different one, but for all the wrong reasons.</p>



<p><strong>Winner: Battlefield 6</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-is-battlefield-6-or-black-ops-7-multiplayer-better">Is Battlefield 6 Or Black Ops 7 Multiplayer Better?</h2>

<p>This decision might ultimately fall on what you’re looking for in an online shooter. Call of Duty is about quickfire dying and respawning gameplay. Frenetic and furious gunfights that arrive quicker than the last. Battlefield resembles Hollywood movies at times with its armada of vehicles, explosions, falling buildings and debris, and ear-piercing sound design.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 wipes away the bad memories of Battlefield 2042 and delivers a proper, modern BF game for the first time in a decade. It’s not perfect, as there are some question marks about the game’s launch maps being too small (for a Battlefield game). Some of BF6’s challenges were horrific at launch and had to be nerfed. The gameplay itself is incredible, and there’s so much variety in the game modes, types of gameplay, and EA is planning to keep the game supported for a long time to come.</p>



<p>Every game of Rush, Conquest, Breakthrough, or Escalation feels like a war. You have to work hard to win every match. One second you’re in an alley or small room having an engaging 1v1, the next you’re running through literal tank fire and enemy offense to revive your teammate so they can support you in claiming the objective that can claim victory. Helicopters fall out of the sky and crash through buildings, destroying them; maps become crumbly messes, and it’s almost <em>like </em>you’re on a battlefield.</p>



<p>As for Black Ops 7, it feels like another good Call of Duty multiplayer title. The gunplay feels crispy and smooth, and the launch maps feel stronger than the beta maps. There is some anti-boots-on-ground action, which can’t be ignored, but at least it isn’t full-blown like Black Ops 3. </p>



<p>The biggest checkmark in the game’s favor is the lack of SBMM (for the most part) and non-disbanding lobbies. These two features have been demanded for years. With Activision knowing the game might be in trouble this time around, the signal was raised, and Black Ops 7 made the two changes. This, too, isn’t perfect, with suggestions that some SBMM lingers when it shouldn’t. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-aim-assist-adjust-strength-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aim Assist</a> has been a debate that’s raged on in Black Ops 7, with adjustments being made.</p>



<p>Both games incorporate game modes that stray from the game’s main gameplay. Battlefield 6 has plenty of bite-sized maps for close-quarters Team Deathmatch and zone-capture game modes, and Call of Duty has some 20v20 maps for large-scale warfare. This is presumably a see-through effort on both parts to capture some of the opposing game’s audience. </p>



<p>Black Ops 7 still feels like a strong multiplayer game, but it doesn’t feel <em>that </em>different from Black Ops 6. Treyarch will be supporting the game with a ton of content in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-season-1-release-maps-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1</a> and beyond. If you’re looking for a traditional Call of Duty experience, that’s what you get with Black Ops 7’s multiplayer, though, if you want full first-person war-based theater, there’s a slight winner.</p>



<p><strong>Winner: Battlefield 6</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-vs-black-ops-7-which-has-better-extra-content">Battlefield 6 vs. Black Ops 7—Which has Better Extra Content?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Undead delight. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>By extension, Warzone falls into Black Ops 7’s content pool, as does RedSec for Battlefield 6. They’re both free downloads, so you don’t technically need the full games to play them, but challenges, weapons, and progression intermingle between them all.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Warzone has faded in recent months since Verdansk’s relaunch. It’s still one of the best battle royale modes in the world, and has many more modes and smaller maps for classic CoD-style action. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-black-ops-7-warzone-coming-out-black-ops-7-warzone-integration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 and Warzone’s integration</a> will add a new Resurgence map, and welcome new changes and POIs for Verdansk. Warzone is an established brand and is a very accessible and fun add-on.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 debuted RedSec shortly after the game’s release. Fort&nbsp;Lyndon is the name of the BR map, and it’s only the beginning. BF 6 BR features an innovative circle that kills anyone who touches it AND damages you if it gets close. It also adds some nice BF touches, including map destruction and Tanks.</p>



<p>Gauntlet Mode is the only other real offering outside of BR. A series of rounds where teams are eliminated if an objective quota is not fulfilled. It’s definitely fun, inventive, and creative in its own right. Right now, RedSec is showing potential, but if you’re looking for a fleshed-out and established battle royale option, there’s only one victor.</p>



<p>Don’t think that another big factor has been forgotten in all of this: Zombies. As part of Black Ops 7, you get CoD Zombies. Since being launched with 2008’s World at War, Zombies have gotten bigger and bolder. BLOPS 7 has lots of launch content, and more maps and content are coming. Let’s also not forget about Dead Ops 4 Arcade as well!</p>



<p><strong>Winner: Black Ops 7</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-should-you-buy-battlefield-6-or-black-ops-7">Should You Buy Battlefield 6 Or Black Ops 7?</h2>



<p><strong>A conclusive answer is that Battlefield 6 is the FPS game you need to buy out of Black Ops 7 and BF 6.</strong></p>



<p>It rules 2-1 in this mini-content breakdown. Battlefield 6 edges out the campaign by virtue of Black Ops 7’s overt outlandishness, and Black Ops 7 offers a better overall package. The main area where everyone is going to invest hundreds of hours, though, is online multiplayer. You pretty much know what you’re going to get with CoD at this point, especially if you buy it each year. </p>



<p>Battlefield isn’t an annual release. You know you’re getting a good couple of years (at least) of free content out of BF 6. Whereas <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2026-campaign-reportedly-set-in-north-south-korea/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty is getting a new game in 2026</a>. Battlefield 6 offers more and still delivers punchy gunplay, along with an incredibly immersive military shooter that toes the line between the arcade nature of Call of Duty and the harrowing realism of Hell Let Loose.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 is the game you should buy if you’re deciding between it and Black Ops 7.</p>



<p><strong>Overall winner: Battlefield 6</strong></p>



<p>If you’re thinking of buying <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/battlefield-6-loaded-pc/">Battlefield 6, here’s the cheapest way for you to buy it</a>. Or if you’re favoring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/black-ops-7-loaded-xbox-pc/">Black Ops 7, this is also the cheapest way to buy the game</a>.</p>

            <p>Renowned British indie studio Inkle - the creator of Heaven's Vault, the Steve Jackson's Sorcery! series, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/a-highland-song">A Highland Song</a>, and many other glistening treasures - has just announced a new game. It's called TR-49 and it's part audio-book, part narrative deduction, based around a found-footage idea of cracking codes from a series of previously undiscovered and secret World War 2-era books.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-of-the-obra-dinn-review-prepare-to-be-transported">superb historical detective game The Return of the Obra Dinn</a> is name-dropped as an inspiration.</p>
<p>The story for TR-49 goes that Inkle co-founder Jon Ingold had a great-uncle who worked at Bletchley Park, that historic home of codebreaking in Britain where pioneering computer scientist and mathematician Alan Turing worked, and where the legendary Enigma Machine was developed to crack German codes.</p>
<p>Ingold was clearing out his uncle's attic and while doing so stumbled on strange electronics and a pile of books, which he'd never heard of and that he could find no trace of online. And it's these books - these 50 books - that will form the meat of the game, as we decipher their garbled text to work out what they're about.</p>

<p>Actors Rebekah McLoughlin (The SCP Archives, Eternal Threads), Paul Warren (A Highland Song, The Séance of Blake Manor) and Phillipe Bosher (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, Doctor Who) will bring the story to life. TR-49 will be released in January.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-highland-song-review">Inkle's latest game was A Highland Song</a> a side-on Scottish hiking game infused with poetry and music and folklore, and the magic of the setting it's based in. "A Highland Song is about what it feels like to be lost in the mountains. Not even lost, in fact. Just to be in the mountains, to have the privilege to exist there just for a bit, to experience them directly and extensively and know them as a process of living," wrote Chris in our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-highland-song-review">A Highland Song review</a>.</p>

			<p>The Nioh 3 PC system requirements have been confirmed today, detailing the system configurations that can run the game at 1080p resolution, 30 and 60 frames per second.</p>



<p>The requirements, which can be found in full below, aren't particularly demanding for 1080p gameplay, although upscaling will be required to reach the listed targets. The system requirements listed on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3681010/Nioh_3/">Steam</a> also confirm the game will support Frame Generation without providing additional information.</p>

<p>Although the Nioh 3 system requirements aren't particularly demanding, previous Team NINJA games released on PC, such as <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-shadows-dont-die-twice/">Wo-Long Fallen Dynasty</a> and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/rise-of-the-ronin-is-yet-another-disappointing-pc-port-from-koei-tecmo/">Rise of the Ronin</a>, essentially required much better system configurations than suggested to deal with their significant launch performance issues. Hopefully, this won't be the case in the game.</p>



<p>While I can't say how Nioh 3 will run on PC when it launches on February 6 worldwide, I can safely say the third entry in the series is setting out to be a great action RPG, and the culmination of all the most recent games released by Team NINJA.

            <p>If Ubisoft's rumoured <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</a> remake were an actual ghost ship, we'd be long past the point of snatching glimpses of the vessel through unnaturally dense fog at two bells during the morning watch. We'd be long past the point of spotting a spectral Jolly Roger between stormy crests, its deathshead wreathed in St. Elmo's Fire. The damn ghost ship is square abreast of us now, the hollow-cheeked revenant of Edward Kenway dangling from the rigging.
</p>
<p>People keep pointing at the ghost ship and screaming, but Captain Ubisoft has his eyes firmly on the horizon. "Steady as she goes, lads!" he trills, as hordes of translucent pirates pour over the rail. "Steady as she goes till some hypothetical future time when we might announce a thing, maybe!"
</p><!--more-->
<p>All of which is to say that the Black Flag remake has been subject to so much insider reporting that it surely has no choice but to be real. The project has more leaks than the Cutty Sark after a voyage through the legendary Sea of Cheesegraters. It was first teased back in July 2023, when Kotaku alleged <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-might-be-remaking-their-swashbuckling-pirateventure-assassins-creed-iv-black-flag">that it was being made with help from Ubisoft Singapore</a>, creators of Skull &amp; Bones. Makes sense. Then a voice actor made <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-seemingly-teased-by-actor-whos-pretty-chill-about-loose-lips-sinking-ships">fleeting mention of it at an expo</a>, only for Ubisoft's lawyers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-voice-actor-claims-ubisoft-threatened-to-sue-him-over-remake-tease">to rap his knuckles</a>.</p>
<p>This September, a French publication <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-will-release-early-2026-and-swaps-modern-day-sections-for-more-piracy-claims-report">claimed</a> that Ubisoft Bordeaux and Ubisoft Belgrade are also involved with the project. They alleged that the remake will launch next year, and that it will dispense with the original's modern-day Abstergo segments in favour of cut content featuring Mary Read, while bringing the inventory and combat systems in line with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> and Valhalla. Again, makes sense.
</p><p>Now, we hear from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/">Insider Gaming</a> that the Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag remake will launch in the week of March 23rd 2026. They're claiming that the "unannounced" project mentioned in Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-says-assassins-creed-franchise-exceeded-expectations-driving-positive-financial-results-but-while-mirage-gets-a-sales-update-shadows-does-not">latest, slightly delayed financials</a> is Black Flag's second coming.</p>
<p>In the same earnings report, Ubisoft noted that the Assassin's Creed series had "exceeded expectations", with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> hitting 10 million sales, though they didn't disclose figures for the more recent Assassin's Creed Shadows. The publishers continue to bet big on the series, having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">restructured around a new Tencent-funded subsidiary</a> dedicated to AC, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a> and Rainbow Six. There's a second major Assassin's Creed Shadows expansion in the offing; beyond that, Ubisoft are working on another multiplayer Assassin's Creed and a purportedly Blair Witchy instalment, code-named <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-is-finally-heading-to-feudal-japan-plus-one-with-blair-witch-vibes">Assassin's Creed Hexe</a>, with development led by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry-2">Far Cry 2</a> dude Clint Hocking.</p>
<p>I feel that ghost ships and witches complement each other well. All eyes on the good Captain, who is now whistling a jovial shanty while Ghost Kenway stabs him repeatedly in the leg with a phantom cutlass.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-shows-hidden-price-on-ps-vr2-bundle-sony-blocks-public-display-of-black-friday-deal-2000646100</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-shows-%E2%80%9Chidden-price%E2%80%9D-on-ps-vr2-bundle-sony-blocks-public-display-of-black-friday-deal.1360654/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Amazon shows a <em>“hidden price”</em> on the PS VR2 bundle, rather than the standard retail price because Sony’s contracts with retailers limit how certain deals can be advertised. But the real <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5779/">list price is $299, down from the usual $399, which makes this Black Friday deal an all-time low</a> for the <strong>headset bundled with Horizon Call of the Mountain</strong>. This pricing has propelled the bundle to <strong>#1 best-seller</strong> status in its category, and if you already own a PS5, this is the perfect entry point into serious VR gaming.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5779/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Eye Tracking and Sense Technology Redefine VR Immersion</h2>
<p>Because the eye-tracking system monitors where you look in real time, it allows games to <strong>render details precisely where your gaze focuses</strong>. That advantage brought about foveated rendering, a technique whereby PS VR2 delivers sharper visuals in the direct line of sight while doing less processing on peripheral areas. Characters in games can respond to eye contact. This enables <strong>a lot more natural interaction</strong> that simply wasn’t possible with previous systems.</p>
<p><strong>Headset feedback</strong> adds another sensory layer through subtle vibrations that sync with in-game actions. You feel the rush of air as something flies by your head or the impact when objects collide near you. The 3D audio creates a complete sound environment where you can pinpoint exactly where sounds originate, whether that’s footsteps behind you or wind coming from a specific direction.</p>



<p>The <strong>4K HDR visuals boast 2000 x 2040 pixels per eye</strong>, and drastically reduces the screen door effect that plagued earlier VR headsets. Text comes out crisp and readable, distant objects retain detail, and overall image quality approaches what you would get from a high-end monitor. The HDR capability means brighter highlights and deeper blacks give scenes more depth and realism.</p>
<p>The <strong>110-degree FOV offers wide peripheral vision</strong> that aids in keeping the feeling of immersion intact since more of your visual space is filled. You don’t feel like you’re looking through binoculars, which was one of the complaints of headsets with narrower FOV. These lenses also reduce distortion at the edges to keep the image clear across the full field of view.</p>



<p>The Sense controllers introduce haptic feedback similar to the DualSense gamepad, allowing you to feel textures and impacts through your hands. Adaptive triggers create resistance that changes based on what you’re doing, whether that’s drawing a bow or squeezing a trigger. Finger touch detection tracks where your fingers rest on the controller without requiring you to press buttons, enabling more natural hand gestures and interactions. These controllers are a significant upgrade from previous VR input methods that have relied on simple button presses.</p>
<p>It comes with <strong>Horizon Call of the Mountain</strong>, a game that shows what PS VR2 can do: it was built for this hardware, taking advantage of eye tracking, haptic feedback, and visuals. You climb mountains with natural hand movements, manipulate the environment with gesture controls, and experience the Horizon universe in a completely new way. The bundle gives you immediate access to premium VR content without needing to buy games separately.</p>
<p>At $299, you’re getting Sony’s latest VR technology bundled with a full game for $100 less than the standard price. Eye tracking, haptic feedback, and 4K HDR visuals put this headset above most competitors that cost significantly more. This is the most accessible pricing the PS VR2 has received, and including Horizon Call of the Mountain adds immediate value.</p>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem’s producer has recently stated that we will see “some characters from the past series come in.”</p>



<p>Capcom’s next big title is Resident Evil Requiem, and they are going all in with the title. Recently, the developers revealed that they expect the upcoming title to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-is-expected-to-sell-better-than-re-village/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sell better</a> than Resident Evil Village, and that its development began ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-says-resident-evil-requiem-development-started-way-before-village/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">way before</a>‘ Village. Now, we have been informed that Requiem’s returning characters and some additional details about the stalker enemy were revealed. </p>







<h2 id="h-resident-evil-requiem-will-have-returning-characters-but-don-t-over-expect-or-hype-it">Resident Evil Requiem Will Have Returning Characters, But “Don’t Over-Expect or Hype It”</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://www.well-played.com.au/chatting-the-return-to-raccoon-city-and-designing-resident-evil-requiem-with-the-games-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Well Played</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-over-expect-or-hype-it-resident-evil-requiem-will-feature-characters-from-previous-games-producer-teases-but-wont-say-who" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>), Resident Evil Requiem’s producer, Masato Kumazawa, was asked whether the title will have returning characters from Outbreak, as Grace is the daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft. Kumazawa replied, stating that yes, “there are going to be some characters from the past series to come in, but don’t over-expect or hype it.” They can’t promise anything right now, and the only thing that can be said is that “there will be characters that have been involved in the Raccoon City incident involved in the game.”</p>



<p>Regarding the stalker enemy, Masato Kumazawa revealed that it will be just a small part of the game, and that they have learned from the past how to balance the system. The producer added that the game is new, and the focus is more on how they can scare the player in many different ways. The developers are “trying to cover a whole lot of scenarios to make sure the players can get scared and experience the horror.</p>







<p>In other news, a new Resident Evil Requiem claim states that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-definitely-has-one-dlc-in-the-works-right-now-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at least one DLC</a> is ‘definitely’ in development. Additionally, here’s why the developers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-reveals-why-multiplayer-was-ditched/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ditched the multiplayer aspect</a> of the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve gone hands-on with Nioh 3 on three separate occasions at this point: The first was with the limited-time demo which was all about me just getting my bearings back and remembering how to play Nioh after five or so years away. The second was a preview event that was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nioh-3-looks-set-to-level-up-from-nioh-1-and-2-ign-first">part of our IGN First coverage</a>, where I was able to dig deeper into the new Ninja Mode and talk about some of the evolutions made in the Nioh formula. For this third, and presumably final time ahead of release, I told myself, “I’m just gonna have fun with it.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And so, when my time began, I adjusted my build to my liking, asked the Team Ninja Community Lead – who appropriately goes by “Master,” – to teach me all of the sick tech that he knew, and I was off to the races to go up against the biggest challenge I’d faced thus far pre-release: A Crucible. It’s a new type of level that features extra tough enemies that chunk bits of your max life every time they hit you until you hit them back. Suffice it to say, if my goal was to have fun, well then, mission accomplished.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">My demo didn’t begin in the Crucible, so I was able to work my way up to meet its challenge by first making my way through a warped Red Light District that had seemingly been transformed and twisted with evil Yokai power. Team Ninja was very generous with our builds, giving me a healthy collection of high-level gear with any weapon type of my choosing. Wanting to try something new, I decided on going with the Caestus as my main Samurai weapon and the single katana for my Ninja loadout.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s just something so incredibly cathartic about draining an enemy’s stamina, and then when you go in for the execution it's just aggressive blunt force trauma on a demon’s face with a level of bloodsplatter that could rival a Mortal Kombat brutality.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I immediately fell in love with the caestus. There’s just something so incredibly cathartic about draining an enemy’s stamina, and then when you go in for the execution it's just aggressive blunt force trauma on a demon’s face with a level of bloodsplatter that could rival a Mortal Kombat brutality. Not only that, but I also had a skill that allowed me to sit there and channel all of my stamina into a single Falcon Punch-like strike that would just obliterate whatever enemy happened to be standing in front of me. The bone-crunching sound effects and the usual Team Ninja animation smoothness only enhanced the satisfaction.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other side of the coin was the single katana in Ninja Mode, and if you’re a Ninja Gaiden fan, this is probably going to be the one you’re going to want to check out. The big star of the weapon in my eyes was a move called the Swallow Slash, and if you <em>are</em> a big Ninja Gaiden fan, you probably already know what that’s going to look like. It’s a super fast dashing attack that goes through enemies, and can even be upgraded to allow you to quickly move back and forth multiple times through the same enemy, just like Ryu’s Flying Swallow. It’s a bit riskier in a game with limited stamina and treacherous terrain that could lead to instant death if one were to Swallow Slash themselves off a cliff, but it is nonetheless an incredibly satisfying technique and a great way to start off a fight. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Red Light District itself was classic Nioh level design: Lots of barred-off paths that funnel you through largely linear design, with a handful of optional forks that lead to some extra loot, with a healthy dose of traps and enemy ambushes lying around every corner. Side note: Team Ninja President Fumihiko Yasuda sat down to watch me play for a bit and got a kick out of how slowly and carefully I entered each room, and even more so when even despite all of my caution, I’d still fall for one of the many traps laid throughout the level. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The boss of the level was Takasugi Shinsaku, a Samurai armed with a Guardian Spirit, a gun, and a sword – and he made liberal use of all three. Like most human-sized Nioh 3 boss fights, it was a tense and fast-paced battle that finds that sweet spot of being just predictable enough to be able to identify patterns, with enough variation in those patterns to make the act of identifying them satisfyingly challenging. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Entering the Crucible takes you to a hellish landscape where Yokai are all buffed to deal increased damage.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">After defeating Shinsaku, the next area was one of the new open-field levels that I talked about in my last preview. This time, though, we were allowed to challenge the Crucible, which is basically the ultimate challenge of each open field in Nioh 3. Entering the Crucible takes you to a hellish landscape where Yokai are all buffed to deal increased damage. In addition to that, if damage is taken while inside a Crucible, the player will be inflicted with Life Corrosion, which will temporarily reduce their max health until they’re able to deal damage or defeat enemies. Dying is another way to remove the effects of Life Corrosion, but obviously, not ideal. On the plus side, while inside a Crucible, you’ll be able to use your Living Artifact transformation more frequently, since the Amrita Gauge fills faster. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The main impression of the Crucible that I got to play through was basically that it was like another standard linear Nioh level, only meaner. Hugely damaging spike traps were everywhere, lightning fast spinning blade demons made running across certain paths feel like trying to weave through traffic on a busy street, and powerful foes waited in ambush in precarious areas where one errant dodge could lead to you falling to your death. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just like every other time I’ve gotten to play Nioh 3, after my time was up, I was left wanting more. Nioh 3 is shaping up to be my favorite of the series to date, not only through its substantial improvements to combat thanks to the split of Samurai and Ninja Modes, but also with the massive addition of the open-field levels – each of which will include its own separate Crucible. It’s a challenge I eagerly anticipate taking on with my own personal build and progression, and one that I won’t have to wait terribly long for, as Nioh 3 releases on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on February 6, 2026.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/nioh-3-the-final-preview]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo is rushing to remove user-made designs shared within <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> that feature fan-favorite character Chef Kawasaki dressed in a micro bikini.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kirby Air Riders allows players to create and customize their own in-game rides using basic shapes and stickers, something that has quickly led to all manner of user creativity — and several designs that feature the beloved chef in beach attire.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Chef Kawasaki has been a fan-favorite among the Kirby community for years, and there's a running joke that, underneath his apron, Chef Kawasaki is otherwise naked. Alternatively, fans have suggested, the character could just about be hiding a micro bikini underneath the straps of his cooking attire — something now depicted in mounds of fanart that we will not embed on this website.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">エアライダーのオレマシン市場にあるコックカワサキのマイクロビキニ柄、すぐ消されるだろうって皆思ってるからか値上がりも早くておもろい 初日の朝にしては高いだろ <a href="https://t.co/DjMbKGcO91" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/DjMbKGcO91</a></p>— モリソバ (@Sobatake397) <a href="https://twitter.com/Sobatake397/status/1991283379707556153?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 19, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Is Nintendo a fan of all this? Seemingly not. As if to make its position clear, Nintendo has now removed several Chef Kawasaki micro bikini designs from Kirby Air Riders, as they began topping the game's list of most popular fan-made rides. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/chef-kawasaki-micro-bikini-ride-deleted-from-kirby-air-riders-machine-market-immediately-replaced-by-succubus-chef-kawasaki/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a> reports that two widely-downloaded Chef Kawasaki micro bikini riders have already been made unavailable by Nintendo, while a third — with a slightly larger bikini and succubus wings — rises in popularity and looks set to test Nintendo's limits for what it will allow.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't the first time that Nintendo has acted to shut down the spread of Chef Kawasaki bikini artwork. In 2022, it swiftly stopped the proliferation of a fanmade card game, Chef Kawasaki’s Microbikini Karuta, which featured numerous fan-drawn images of an eyebrow-raising nature. (The game's creators had also begun selling the game for profit — another big Nintendo no-no.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest game from Super Smash Bros. series boss Masahiro Sakurai, Kirby Air Riders launched this week exclusively for Switch 2. A spin-off of the Kirby series where players race around circuit-based tracks on glider-like machines, it is a long-awaited sequel to 2003's Kirby Air Ride on GameCube. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Kirby Air Riders' unconventional controls can get in its own way sometimes, but they don't stop it from being a fun, frantic action racing game with an almost unreal amount of stuff to do," IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-review">Kirby Air Riders review</a>, awarding the game 8/10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

    <p><span>Durin joins the fray and the story of Nod-Krai continues.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The Version <a title="Platforms > Luna [68 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/cloud/luna">Luna</a> III update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [129 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “Song of the Welkin Moon: Interlude – A <a title="Games > Nocturne [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/nocturne">Nocturne</a> of the Far North,” will launch on December 3, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [213 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-1008674"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>The story of Nod-Krai continues as the region prepares for “Moon-Prayer Night,” a grand festival that also marks the Dameselette’s final night before her journey to the moon. Besides the celebration, Durin, the newborn dragon, makes his debut as a playable character, displaying his dual forms in battle. Players can also unlock new abilities for Durin and other “Hexerei characters” by completing special quests related to the Hexenzirkel.</p><p>After the defeat of Rächer of Solnari, Nasha Town comes back alive with the lively atmosphere of Moon-Prayer Night. Players are invited to enjoy the celebration, explore various game stalls, and record their memories in a souvenir stamp book, savoring precious moments before the Dameselette returns to the moon. During the celebration, unexpected guests show up—the Hexenzirkel has arrived. Alice, Klee’s mother, and Nicole Reeyn, who previously guided the player in understanding Fontaine’s prophecy, finally reveal themselves with alarming news: Teyvat’s borders are becoming unstable, and strange “phantoms” are appearing across Nod-Krai. Players will join Albedo, Durin, and the Wanderer in uncovering the mystery behind them. Completing this latest Archon Quest will also grant Primogems ×500 for a limited time.</p><p>Another highlight is Durin, a 5-star Pyro Sword wielder who possesses two distinctly different combat forms, and can be served either as a team support or a strong damage dealer. Once a dragon from the fairytale world of Simulanka, Durin was later granted a human body through Albedo’s alchemy and the transfer of the dragon Durin’s heart energy. This unique origin grants Durin dual powers: One reflects the pure soul of Simulanka, supporting the team by reducing enemies’ Elemental Resistance and dealing AoE Pyro DMG. The other is imbued with Abyssal energy, excelling at unleashing devastating attacks on single targets and boosting his own Vaporize and Melt reaction DMG. Completing Durin’s Story Quest will reveal more secrets about the dragon and Hexenzirkel, and gain a special reward for Durin.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1008675"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p>Version Luna III also introduces a major update featuring “Hexerei characters,” enhancing certain characters closely connected to the Hexenzirkel. By completing Alice’s “Witch’s Homework,” Durin, Venti, Klee, Albedo, Mona, Razor, Fischl, and Sucrose can become Hexerei characters. Each quest unfolds a unique story for the respective character, granting them special abilities and changing their Constellation effects. Additionally, if the party has at least two Hexerei characters, “Hexerei: Secret Rite” effect will be unlocked, significantly boosting the party’s combat capabilities. For example, Venti, the Anemo Archon with a deep connection to the Hexenzirkel, will regain his once-hidden power after completing the quest. When his Stormeye is active, his Normal Attack will be transformed into powerful “Windsunder Arrows” that can pierce enemies and have a chance to further extend the Duration of his Stormeye. Players can view the full enhancement details in the new gadget “The Little Witch’s Dictionary.” After completing the prerequisite quest, players can freely invite Razor, Fischl, or Sucrose to their party.</p><p>Jahoda, the new 4-star Anemo Bow wielder, joins the adventure as well, showcasing her exceptional talents in team-healing and absorbing Elements to deal corresponding DMG. For Event Wishes in Version Luna III, the first phase will feature the debut of Durin and Jahoda and Venti’s return, and the second phase will bring back Varesa and Xilonen.</p><p>More activities and events will be available in Version Luna III. The event “Soulblazers’ Snowbound Journey” will bring players back to Dragonspine, where they can experience with winter-themed minigames and earn rewards, including an exclusive 4-star weapon “Rainbow Serpent’s Rain Bow,” Primogems, and more. Back in Nod-Krai, more stories and interactions with the Dameselette await players in Silvermoon Hall. Additionally, the Envisage Echoes challenges will be updated, adding Klee’s and Albedo’s echoes as rewards.</p><p>The UGC gameplay module Miliastra Wonderland will also receive brand-new updates in Version Luna III. The new “Wonderland Resource Center” allows Craftspeople to freely share and obtain resources and creative content via the editing tool. More rewards can be unlocked in this version, including fun actions, expressions, and free pulls. In addition, a winter-themed Main Hall will also be available to players during this version.</p></blockquote><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,899 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,326 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [28,540 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,845 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://ys-api-os.mihoyo.com/event/download_porter/link/ys_global/genshinimpactpc/default" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">client</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/genshin-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genshin-impact/id1517783697" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers below.

            <p>
It's hard to believe it's been over five years since Ubisoft unveiled its troubled - and much-delayed - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a> remake, but we're now one step closer to an actual release date, with Ubisoft's latest financial results narrowing its launch down to "Q4" of its current financial year.
</p>
<p>
For those that haven't been following the whole Sands of Time remake saga, it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-details-whats-new-in-its-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">initially unveiled in September 2020</a>, when it was expected to arrive in January 2021. However, the less-than-positive response to its announcement trailer led Ubisoft to make the first of what would be many delays. Three years later, the embattled project was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-price-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-has-switched-developer">shifted from Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai to Ubisoft Montreal,</a> where it was seemingly rebooted from scratch, and last year brought some promising updates. We learned the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-five-tumultuous-years-ubisoft-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-now-deep-in-development">remake was "deep" in development</a>, and that it was definitely still targeting a 2026 release.

<p>
Which brings us to Ubisoft's latest (and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-issues-a-rare-last-minute-delay-to-its-earnings-release-15-minutes-before-scheduled-call-with-investors">briefly delayed</a>) <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/52w2Cas6xfQjegpCgP1SZC/b38c338a1bf6f365849a50d2f182d061/Ubisoft_FY26_H1_Earnings_PR_EN_vF.pdf">earnings report</a>, featuring a couple of updates for the company's release slate. Beyond <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a>'s imminent From the Ashes expansion (due 19th December), the publisher has four titles scheduled to release in the fourth quarter of its current 2025-2026 financial year. Those games are Rainbow Six Mobile, The Division Resurgence, an unnamed title (widely believed to be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-rumoured-assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-could-set-sail-before-april">heavily rumoured Assassin's Creed: Black Flag remake</a>), and, yes, the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake.
</p><p>
All of which is to say that, five years after its original announcement, the Sands of Time remake has the closest thing to a release date yet. Barring any further delays, it'll be launching sometime between the 1st January and 31st March next year. That, then, isn't too far off, but we've yet to see a single second of footage since development switched to Ubisoft Montreal. Could the publisher be holding back for a big end-of-year reveal during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-makes-game-awards-history-as-most-nominated-game-ever">December's Game Awards</a>? Time will tell, no pun intended, but hopefully the big unveiling will be more exciting than the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-now-targeting-2026-gets-briefest-of-trailers">30 seconds of candle we got last year</a>.
</p>
<p>
In other Ubisoft news, CEO Yves Guillemot has announced the company is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-believes-generative-ai-is-as-big-a-revolution-for-games-as-the-shift-to-3d-as-tech-is-embraced-company-wide">going all-in on its use of controversial generative AI technology</a>, calling it as big a "revolution" for games as the shift from 2D to 3D. The company was, of course, recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-admits-ai-generated-loading-screen-slipped-through-into-final-build-of-anno-117-pax-romana">caught slipping AI-generated artwork into Anno 117: Pax Romana</a>. The results were a mess, featuring characters with disfigured or out-of-scale facial features, missing limbs, and strange set-dressing - leading the publisher to insist the artwork was only intended to be used as a placeholder, before replacing it with touched-up alternatives.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The relationship between siblings can be fraught enough when it’s your younger brother always trying to copy your dinner choices at a restaurant, and you can imagine how Tokugawa Takechiyo feels when his brother (who just so happens to be his parents’ favourite anyway) decides to usurp his rule and transform the country into a yokai-infested hellscape? And now, in Nioh 3, he’s got to travel through time and fix it all? Ugh. Little brothers are so annoying!</p>
<p><iframe title="Nioh 3 Preview" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YvpJk-mcR5E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s been a great deal of evolution throughout the Nioh series, this PlayStation console exclusive being one of the first to embrace Asian and specifically Japanese culture and mythology within the Soulsbourne style. Nioh 3 brings two significant new changes to the table, first with the addition of a Ninja playstyle alongside the traditional Samurai style, and second with a more open world structure –&nbsp;Team Ninja and Koei Tecmo refer to this more as Open Field, a term borrowed from their musou games.</p>


<p>I absolutely love the switch to Ninja style combat. Samurai style remains and it is as structured and technical as ever, encouraging you to use fighting stances for low, medium and high weapon positioning, to always time your Ki burst to trigger stamina regen, and to block and counter, whittling away at your opponent’s Ki to leave them in a weakened state. A new addition is the Arts Gauge, giving you a powered up Arts Proficiency state to dish out much greater damage and Martial Arts consecutively.</p>


<p>Ninja, though, plays to my generally preferred approach of excessive dodging. There’s still plenty of technical play here, but it’s much more intentionally hit and run. You strike, and then dodge away or try to time a Mist in order to evade an enemy attack, leaving a shadowy figure as your Ninjutsu and Arts Gauges are quickly replenished. Instead of stances, you have Ninjutsu techniques, such as a throwable shuriken, while there’s also a Footstool Jump that you can perform to leap over an enemy, stagger them and strike from behind.</p>
<p>I’ve no doubt that people will prefer one style of play or the other, but here’s the thing: you can use both! Style shifting lets you effortlessly swap back and forth between Samurai and Ninja forms, loadouts and even visuals in a flash, and do so in the middle of battle. This can be great for using the Samurai to drain an enemy’s Ki and then the Ninja to deal a rapid flurry of follow up attacks. You’re actively encouraged and forced to do so by the otherwise unblockable Burst Attacks that some enemies will unleash. As they glow red to signal the attack, you can shift style with the right timing to perform a Burst Break and cancel their attack, dish out retaliatory damage and switch your form to the other.</p>
<p>Once you layer the Guardian Spirit skills from returning and new spirits to this series, there’s a ton of depths to the combat system to master in the moment. There’s common controls throughout, of course, but you’ll need to be switching approaches from moment-to-moment as you switch, and the need to use the style shift to counter Burst Attacks required manual thought during my hands on time. I’m sure it will become more natural and instinctive over time.</p>

<p>These shifting sands also apply to the layered approach to how this world is now constructed and the challenges that you’ll face off against. The open field approach gives broader levels to explore, taking you to multiple time periods and different regions. The ruined, transformed realm of Kyoto in the Bakumatsu period was less of a “go anywhere, do anything” world, and more a wide maze of paths to follow and routes to unlock. That still compares favourable to the more rigid structure of the previous games, and means that there’s more secrets to uncover here and things to do, and you do get a sense of freedom from traversing rooftops and seeking out the various collectable and cute Yokai, or zipping along the Spirit Veins that are magical streams to leap from one area to the next.</p>
<p>I rather enjoyed finding enemy bases here to capture, tackling the seven or eight idling enemies with a stealthy approach –&nbsp;in one instance reaching a cannon that let me blast a few chumps hanging around by a fire –&nbsp;and there’s also tougher enemies at key Crucible Spikes that are blocking paths and want clearing.</p>

<p>The goal in each open field is really to reach the Crucible at its centre, whisking you away to an even more twisted realm to battle through to the final boss and purify the region. The challenge here is ramped up, the yokai that you face having been buffed to deal increased damage, and you’re afflicted by Life Corrosion that you need to dispel by defeating enemies. Oh, and during battle (and especially within the Crucible), some yokai can be temporarily empowered by the Dark Realm, surrounded by red flowers and made even more dangerous for a period of time. The one real positive is that your Guardian Spirits are also buffed, letting you activate Living Artifacts more often to combine your powers with theirs.</p>
<p>There’s a ton of customisation options that we didn’t really get to dig into a great deal. The character creator returns, now with both Samurai and Ninja looks for you to define, but delving into the skill trees, you now have separate trees for the two styles. Creating your loadouts and having that fast switching means you effectively have four weapon sets to swap back and forth between, and that makes picking where to apply your points when levelling up a bit more crucial. Thankfully, this screen clearly indicates which traits affect which weapons. Beyond that, you’re able to swap moves in and out of the Samurai stances’ different attack weights and the Ninja more generally, and truly create a blended fighting style of your own. Oh, and the Onmyo box now has a Yin and Yang position, where you can create summoning seals in addition to Onmyo magic items from Soul Cores.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I really enjoyed my time with Nioh 3 –&nbsp;OK, so we were definitely overpowered for this preview event, and that helped when it was a morning gaming session, but even so! I think that fans will need to understand what Team Ninja means by open field, as opposed to this being open world, but I could happily have explored in different directions and found more corners of the map, if I weren’t pushing to reach the finish line in good time. I also think that there’s a risk of overcomplicating the layered concepts and controls to the point that they might lose a little meaning, but it’s undeniably fun to switch back and forth between Samurai and Ninja, or just stick with the faster, nippier Ninja in general. No doubt, this is one for fans of the series and the wider genre to pay attention to when it launches in February 2026.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-the-culmination-of-every-team-ninja-action-rpg-hands-on-preview/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nioh-3-is-the-culmination-of-every-team-ninja-action-rpg-%E2%80%93-hands-on-preview.1360606/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Nioh series has long been considered as one of the best Soulslike around, but the franchise created by Team NINJA couldn't be much different from the vast majority of games inspired by FromSoftware's Souls series. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-review-a-samurai-epic-with-souls/">With a bigger focus on mechanical complexity and action gameplay features</a>, the two entries in the series played more like pure action games, with a loot system reminiscent of the Diablo series sprinkled on top to deliver a very engaging experience for those willing to put in the time and effort to understand the franchise's many interwoven mechanics.</p>



<p>Although the second entry in the series improved on pretty much every element of its predecessor, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-2-the-complete-edition-grave-no-bar/">Nioh 2 felt more like an expansion of the original</a>, rather than a proper sequel. At a glance, the differences between the two games were minimal, and overall, the experiences they offered were somewhat similar. Only the most advanced players would notice, and appreciate, the many mechanical improvements made to the original's framework.</p>



<p>This is definitely not what will happen with Nioh 3 when it launches in a few months on PC and PlayStation 5. Though the third entry in the series retains many of the franchise's familiar features, it spices them up considerably with some significant tweaks that have the potential of making it not only the best entry in the series, but also one of the best "masocore" action role-playing games developed by Team NINJA.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Nioh 3 open-field map design sets the game apart the most from its predecessors</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The most significant change Nioh 3 will feature over its predecessors is a different level design philosophy, which is evident right from the get-go. Instead of featuring self-contained missions which can be selected from a main map, the new entry in the series introduces the concept of open fields - much bigger maps which offer plenty of rewards for those willing to explore them fully. As highlighted during a presentation I attended last week in Paris, Nioh 3 isn't an open-world game: although the maps are bigger than ever before, their size is small, compared to the maps of modern open-world games, and don't offer the same amount of side activities such games may offer.</p>



<p>To be honest, I wasn't too thrilled to learn that Nioh 3 would be moving away from its predecessors' progression system. I always felt the older setup of picking missions from a map, though dated,  was more immediate and worked great in the context of the game, allowing the player to focus more on understanding and utilizing the combat, skills, and loot mechanics to their full potential to take down the most powerful of enemies. However, after spending around 4 hours exploring a never-before-seen map set in the Bakumatsu era (1853-1867), I couldn't help but appreciate how the open-field design of the new maps presents the main and sub-missions in a more immersive way, which remain the core of the experience.</p>



<p>While the general design felt standard fare for a game developed by Team NINJA, many of the new mechanics related to the open-field maps make exploration feel fun and rewarding. As players explore every corner of the map, collecting items, completing the Myths sidequests given by various NPCs, conquering Enemy Bases, and defeating the powerful Crucible Wraiths, the region's Exploration Level will increase, providing a variety of permanent buffs, including base stats increases and an enhanced map showing the entire area and markers for exploration spots and collectibles. </p>



<p>As the rewards for engaging with these new exploration mechanics also include items and gear, of which there's a lot in true Nioh tradition, skill points required to unlock weapon-specific and general skills via the game's different skill trees, and buffs offered by friendly Yokai and the new Jizo Statues which can provide a variety of blessings exploring maps in Nioh 3 is set to be as much as a big part of the experience as combat is.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Bakumatsu map offers plenty of exploration opportunities in Nioh 3</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The presence of open-field maps, however, doesn't mean that Nioh 3 lacks the closed-off areas featured in past entries in the series. Each of the maps will also feature a Crucible level where players must defeat a powerful boss to purify the area, a task made more difficult by the Life Corrosion mechanics, which temporarily reduce maximum life while inside a Crucible. To offset this, the Amrita Gauge fills up faster, giving players faster access to the powerful Living Artifact form, which makes a return from past entries in the series. </p>



<p>The design of these Crucible levels is reminiscent of the design of the main missions in the past entries in the series, featuring somewhat intricate layouts which are made more dynamic by some new mechanics, such as the ability to jump, reminiscent of <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-shadows-dont-die-twice/">Wo-Long: Fallen Dynasty</a>, which give locations better verticality and the Spirit Veins, which can be used with a corresponding Guardian Spirit to explore locations further.</p>



<p>Although exploration and traversal are seeing the biggest improvement in Nioh 3 over its predecessors, combat has also undergone some rather significant changes, which players were already able to appreciate a few months back with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-visual-performance-improvements/">a PlayStation 5-exclusive timed demo</a>. </p>



<p>The addition of the Ninja fighting style, on paper, may have felt like a needless complication, but in reality, it adds up a lot of effective combat options, the ability to use Ninjustsu more freely than in past entries in the series, and use a total of four weapons, two per fighting style. With a major focus on agility and "trickier" weapons like the Tonfa and Kusarigama, the Ninja fighting stance essentially works as another Stance that can be as effective as the Samurai fighting style.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Nioh 3 new combat mechanics up the game's complexity and fun-factor considerably</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>With its three stances and focus on hard-hitting weapons like hammers and the Odachi, the Samurai fighting style will instantly feel familiar to anyone who played the previous entries in the series. However, significant changes have been implemented in this fighting style as well. For starters, the High Stance attacks are slightly slower than in Nioh 2, and generally riskier to use. </p>



<p>Although I didn't have the time for thorough testing, I replayed Nioh 2 extensively again before this hands-on opportunity, and the difference was immediately noticeable. Deflection mechanics, which essentially involve a well-timed block, are also a significant focus of this fighting style. With the visual better highlighting when one has been performed, a reactive playstyle definitely seems viable.</p>



<p>Besides the two fighting styles, the biggest change Nioh 3 brings to the combat experience is the introduction of Martial Arts mechanics. These special techniques performed with different button combinations or at the end of combo strings which were already present in the previous entries in the series, can be chained one after the other once the new Arts Gauge has been filled and the Arts Proficiency mode enabled by using a Strong Attack or Martial Arts to create devastating combos that can keep even bosses stunlocked for their duration. </p>



<p>Don't expect this to be a free-win mechanic, however, as Martial Arts still use Ki, and players need to manage it to keep their combo going. This system is heavily reminiscent of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stranger-of-paradise-final-fantasy-origin/">Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin</a>'s combat mechanics, and are a welcome addition that will make it easier for players of all skill levels to unleash the complex combos advanced players have discovered in Nioh 2.</p>



<p>As I wasn't used to these new mechanics, it took me a few minutes to move beyond what the muscle memory developed in Nioh 2 was making me do, but once I started getting used to them, they made combat more engaging, and taking on both returning and new Yokai was exhilarating. Particularly interesting was the final boss battle of the build against Takasugi Shinsaku, a real samurai who contributed heavily to the Meiji Restoration. Armed with a not exactly historically accurate gun, the samurai's fighting style is rather peculiar, which forced me to put the new mechanics to good use quickly. In true series tradition, the battle was challenging, but after a few tries, and a little bit of luck, I was able to take him down.</p>

<p>Weaving together the core Nioh series mechanics with features inspired by Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin, Wo-Long: Fallen Dynasty and even <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/rise-of-the-ronin-neo-edo-open-world/">Rise of the Ronin</a>, Nioh 3 feels like the culmination of all the masocore action RPGs developed by Team NINJA. How the exploration mechanics will hold up for dozen hours remains to be seen, but the first proper taste of the experience has undoubtedly made me even more excited about the game, and I cannot wait for <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-new-trailer-provides-new-quick-look-at-story-and-gameplay-confirms-release-date/">February 6, 2026 when Nioh 3 launches on PC and PlayStation 5</a> to appreciate better the depth of the combat mechanics, which promise to outdo anything Team NINJA has done to date.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/new-pixel-10-pro-goes-cheaper-than-last-years-9-pro-amazon-crushes-google-on-black-friday-deals-2000646123</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-pixel-10-pro-goes-cheaper-than-last-year%E2%80%99s-9-pro-amazon-crushes-google-on-black-friday-deals.1360600/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Google announced the Pixel 10 and Pixel 10 Pro only weeks ago, but Amazon has already chopped prices significantly for Black Friday. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5783/">Pixel 10 Pro 128GB slides to $749 from its debut price of $999</a>, while the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5784/">more affordable Pixel 10 (128BG) reaches $599 from $799</a>. Those are record-low prices and puts some serious pressure on competitors, particularly Apple’s suddenly less competitive iPhone 17 lineup. The Pixel 10 Pro brings true flagship specs with Google’s <strong>computational photography advantages and Gemini AI integration</strong> at a price that beats its premium competitors by hundreds of dollars.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5783/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Gemini AI Assistant Changes Daily Smartphone Use</h2>
<p>The<strong> integrated Gemini AI assistant</strong> can do a lot more than simple voice-based requests to perform complex tasks across apps and contexts. You can ask it to summarize long email threads, write messages in your personal style, or provide information in depth by looking at pictures through the camera. For sensitive tasks, the AI processes requests locally on the <strong>Tensor G5 chip</strong> to maintain your data private while delivering fast responses. It feels far more organic than bolt-on AI features since it’s integrated into the core Android experience.</p>
<p>It learns your patterns and proactively provides information relevant to you without explicit commands. It suggests responses to messages based on context, reminds you about tasks mentioned in emails, and provides traffic updates for your regular routes at the right times. The AI automatically handles photo organization, creating event- and people-centric albums while making search phenomenally accurate with natural language queries.</p>



<p>The <strong>triple rear camera array features a combination of a 50MP main sensor, 48MP ultra-wide, and 48MP telephoto with 5x optical zoom</strong>. In typical Google style, computational photography processes several frames for each single shot, combining them to suppress noise, increase dynamic range, and capture finer detail than is visible in a single exposure. <strong>Night Sight mode delivers great photos</strong> in near darkness without flash, while retaining natural colors and revealing detail that’s completely invisible to the naked eye.</p>
<p>The <em>Super Res Zoom</em> extends beyond the 5x optical range through computational techniques that <strong>maintain image quality up to 30x digital zoom</strong>. Real-world results show surprisingly sharp details at 10-15x zoom levels that typically look pixelated on competing phones. Video recording reaches 4K at 60fps with advanced stabilization that smooths out walking motion and sudden movements. The <strong>Magic Eraser feature removes unwanted objects from photos</strong> convincingly and uses AI to fill in backgrounds naturally.</p>



<p>The <strong>6.3-inch Super Actua display leverages excellent brightness of as high as 2000 nits</strong>&nbsp;and it’s even readable in direct sunlight where other phones wash out. An adaptive 120Hz refresh rate dynamically changes based on the content: high refresh for scrolling and gaming, lower for static content, to save battery. Color accuracy and contrast are as good as standalone monitors, deep blacks thanks to the <strong>OLED panel</strong>&nbsp;and vibrant colors that do not look oversaturated.</p>
<p>The Tensor G5 chip handles everyday tasks smoothly while excelling at AI workloads that other processors struggle with. Apps launch quickly, multitasking stays responsive, and gaming performance matches what you’d expect from a flagship device. Efficiency from this chip combines with the <strong>5,060mAh battery to deliver genuine all-day usage</strong>&nbsp;with screen-on time exceeding 7 hours for most users. <strong>Fast charging reaches 50% in about 30 minutes</strong> and wireless charging offers convenient overnight top-ups.</p>
<p>For $749, you’re getting a flagship for $250 less than its launch price, hundreds below what Apple and Samsung charge for comparable specs. The Pixel 10 Pro matches or slightly outperforms the camera capabilities of an iPhone 17 Pro for thousands of dollars less, and the Gemini AI integration offers capabilities the competition can’t.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/playstation-drops-major-black-friday-deal-on-dualsense-now-selling-it-cheaper-than-no-name-controllers-2000646090</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When it launched, the Playstation <em>DualSense</em> changed the way controllers felt in your hand and it remains the <strong>best way to experience PS5 games with its haptic feedback and adaptive triggers</strong>. Generic controllers will get the job done but they miss out on the immersive details that make modern games feel alive. The great news is that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5777/">Amazon just dropped the DualSense to $54 for Black Friday down from its usual $74 price</a>, with every color option seeing the same discount. That’s an all-time low, since these controllers never see any discount throughout the year.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5777/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Haptic Feedback Changes Everything</h2>
<p>The haptic feedback system replaces traditional rumble with <strong>precise vibrations that simulate different textures and actions</strong>. You feel the difference between walking on metal, grass, or sand through subtle vibrations that match the surface. When you pull a bowstring in a game, the adaptive triggers create actual resistance that increases as you draw back. This L2 and R2 trigger tension changes dynamically based on what you’re doing, whether that’s pressing a gas pedal, pulling a trigger, or drawing a weapon.</p>
<p>These <strong>features work across hundreds of PS5 titles now</strong>, and developers continue to find innovative ways to utilize them. Racing games can make you feel the road surface and brake pressure. Shooters give each weapon a distinct trigger feel. Even menu navigation gets enhanced with subtle haptic clicks that confirm your selections. The technology doesn’t just add novelty; it provides actual feedback that improves your control and connection to the game.</p>



<p>The <strong>onboard microphone lets you chat without needing a headset</strong>&nbsp;which is great for quick online sessions. The mic quality handles voice chat clearly enough for team coordination, though serious streamers will want a dedicated microphone. You can plug any headset directly into the 3.5mm jack when you need better audio or more privacy. The <em>Create</em> button replaces the old <em>Share</em> button and gives you quick access to screenshots, video clips, and broadcast features without interrupting gameplay.</p>
<p>The speaker built into the controller adds another audio layer in supported games: You hear environmental sounds, character voices, and sound effects emanating from the controller itself, which creates a much more three-dimensional audio experience. Some games use it for subtle details like radio chatter or reloading sounds. Others make it central to the experience, with sounds moving between your TV and controller based on where they originate in the game world.</p>



<p>The design retains the classic Playstation layout while <strong>refining the ergonomics and improving the analog sticks</strong>. The grips fit comfortably into medium to large hands, and the textured surface prevents slipping during intense gaming sessions. The analog sticks offer better precision compared to the previous generation, with improved resistance and dead zones that make aiming feel way more responsive. <strong>Battery life runs about 12 hours on a full charge</strong>&nbsp;which gets you through multiple gaming sessions before needing to plug in.</p>
<p>The <strong>addition of USB Type-C charging</strong> means faster power delivery along with a reversible cable that plugs in either way. Placing the port at the top of the controller gives easy access while playing. <strong>Bluetooth</strong> connectivity extends functionality to play with PS5 consoles, Windows PCs, and Mac computers, all from one controller. PC gaming support has significantly expanded, as more titles now have haptic feedback and adaptive triggers support on Windows. This cross-platform compatibility makes the DualSense useful beyond just your Playstation console.</p>
<p>The midnight black color option provides you with a stealthy alternative to the standard white and shows less wear over time. <strong>Other colors like cosmic red, starlight blue, and galactic purple all hit the same $54 price point</strong> during this sale – you can pick up multiple controllers in different colors and still manage to spend less than buying two at their regular price.</p>
<p>You’re getting here Sony’s flagship controller, complete with its advanced features, for less than the price of many third-party options at $54. The haptic feedback and adaptive triggers alone are worth this price, but you also get multi-device support, built-in audio options, and refined ergonomics. That’s genuine value since these controllers almost never drop below $60, and the Black Friday pricing makes it the right time to buy a backup or upgrade from older controllers.</p>

            <p>It looks like we could be seeing Ubisoft's long-rumoured Assassin's Creed: Black Flag Remake set sail really rather soon.</p>
<p>Earlier today, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-confirms-116bn-tencent-investment-into-assassins-creed-maker-is-on-track-following-last-weeks-surprise-delay-to-financial-report">Ubisoft released its delayed financials</a>. Here, the company laid out its slate of upcoming games, all of which are set to arrive before the end of its current financial year. That means, by 31st March, 2026.</p>
<p>The company mentions an "unannounced title", which is planned for a release in the fourth quarter of its 2025-2026 fiscal year. Many now suspect this is indeed the remake of Assassin's Creed: Black Flag. </p>

<p> "Anno 117: Pax Romana launched on November 13 with a Metacritic rating of 85.  <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> Valley of Memory update launched on November 18. Avatar Frontiers of  Pandora From the Ashes expansion will release on December 19, coinciding with the new movie. Prince  of Persia: The Sands of Time remake, Rainbow Six Mobile, The Division Resurgence and an unannounced title are planned for Q4," the financials read.</p>
<p>This unannounced title also cropped up in <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/33qBiRpCj1Z9Ib5bbfbg5r/d4ab539ca9edd1fa28ebc0aec5b1af27/Ubisoft_H1_FY26_Slideshow_vFinal.pdf">Ubisoft's investor's presentation</a>, with the mysterious game replaced with a blank box (see below).</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Black Flag actor Matt Ryan again suggested Ubisoft was set to release a remake of its piratical Assassin's Creed entry. Ryan - who played Edward Kenway in Black Flag - hinted not very subtly to one fan they should perhaps get ready to replay the game, implying with a bit of a 'wink, wink, nudge, nudge' that the remake was indeed real. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-actor-threatened-with-legal-action-following-remake-slip-up">Ubisoft then threatened the actor with legal action</a> following his remake slip-up.</p>
<p>More recently in September, French outlet <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qngrBQnukFc">Jeuxvideo</a> reported Black Flag's modern day sections have been removed from Ubisoft's upcoming remake.</p>
<p>So, should all this lead to a potentially imminent release of Assassin's Creed: Black Flag's remake, will you be jumping back aboard with Edward and co?</p>

<p>Elsewhere in franchise news, earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-franchise-lead-leaves-ubisoft-following-formation-of-tencent-subsidiary">Assassin's Creed's then-boss Marc-Alexis Côté left Ubisoft</a>, following the formation of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a>-funded subsidiary. Soon after his departure from Ubisoft, Côté clarified that while he was offered another role within the company, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-assassins-creed-boss-clarifies-he-did-not-walk-away-from-series-but-was-asked-to-step-aside-by-ubisoft">did not "carry the same scope, mandate, or continuity with the work [he] had been entrusted with"</a>.</p>

            <p>Resident Evil Requiem will feature characters from previous games in the series, the game's producer has confirmed, but he won't confirm who.</p>
<p>Capcom's forthcoming ninth mainline game in the series stars Grace Ashcroft as the protagonist, daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft who features in spin-off <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-outbreak">Resident Evil Outbreak</a>.</p>
<p>As such, <a href="https://www.well-played.com.au/chatting-the-return-to-raccoon-city-and-designing-resident-evil-requiem-with-the-games-producer/">Well Played</a> asked producer Masato Kumazawa if other characters from Outbreak will make an appearance.</p>

<p>"I would say that yes, there are going to be some characters from the past series to come in, but don’t over-expect or hype it," said Kumazawa.</p>
<p>"We can't promise you anything about that, but the only thing I can say is that there will be characters that have been involved in the Raccoon City incident involved in the game."</p>
<p>Of course, the subtext of this line of questioning was probably to uncover further if fan-favourite Leon Kennedy will feature in the game. Rumours have been swirling that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-2">Resident Evil 2</a> and 4 protagonist will be included somewhere in Requiem.</p>
<p>Yet back in June, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leon-kennedy-actually-quite-a-bad-match-for-horror-says-resident-evil-9s-director">Requiem's director Koshi Nakanishi stated Leon</a> isn't the sort of person to "jump at something like a bucket falling", which is why he's "actually quite a bad match for horror".</p>
<p>Instead, Grace was chosen as a "relatable" protagonist more suited to the genre.</p>
<p>Still, no doubt Kumazawa's comment will get tongues waggling. Leon, as well as Claire Redfield, would certainly fit the bill as being "involved in the Raccoon City incident", but they would certainly warrant more hype than Kumazawa is teasing.</p>
<p>Perhaps more likely will be one of the other playable characters from Outbreak besides Alyssa, such as Kevin Ryman or Yoko Suzuki.</p>
<p>In another interview recently, Kumazawa confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sorry-fans-resident-evil-requiem-wont-be-getting-a-public-demo-as-capcom-focuses-on-creating-the-best-quality-game">Resident Evil Requiem won't be getting a public demo</a>, unlike other recent series entries.</p>
<p>Further, prior knowledge of Resident Evil Outbreak won't be required - so even if previous characters do reappear, they should be well-integrated into the story.</p>
