                <p>Ubisoft first announced that it was remaking the beloved action-adventure game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake/" data-ref-id="5000-518598">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</a>, back in September 2020, but five years on, the game has yet to even get a release date. This week, Ubisoft assured fans that development is still ongoing--but provided little detail on the game's current state.</p><p>In tweets posted from the Prince of Persia account, the company shared that "development continues behind the scenes," and it thanked fans "for sticking with us" throughout the protracted process. Ubisoft also provided an (admittedly beautiful) piece of art ostensibly from the remake, which you can see in the embed below.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1934642136500060166/" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>Yep, we‚Äôre still deep in the game ‚Äî exploring, building, and ensuring the sands move with purpose. üó°Ô∏è‚è≥</p><p> This game is being crafted by a team that truly cares, and they're pouring their hearts (and a lot of coffee) into every step.</p><p> Thank you for sticking with us. üíñ <a href="https://t.co/9bKjZHjmur" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/9bKjZHjmur</a></p></div>  ‚Äî Prince of Persia‚Ñ¢ (@princeofpersia) <a href="https://twitter.com/princeofpersia/status/1934642136500060166?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 16, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>In its most recent earnings call, Ubisoft shared that it plans for the remake to launch by the end of its current fiscal year; this means that the game would be released by March 31, 2026, at the latest. This was a refinement on its previous announcement of a 2026 release window, which itself followed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-might-be-going-through-a-remake-of-its-own-report/1100-6522543/" data-ref-id="1100-6522543">multiple reports of development woes</a>.</p><p>While Sands of Time fans will still need to wait a considerable amount of time before getting their hands on the remake, it isn't the only Prince of Persia title in the works. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-rogue-prince-of-persia/" data-ref-id="5000-625410">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a>, a roguelike with a cel-shaded and cartoony art style, is currently in Early Access on Steam; its 1.0 version releases in August. The excellent Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown likely won't be getting a sequel anytime soon, though, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/most-of-prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-team-shifted-to-other-projects/1100-6527334/" data-ref-id="1100-6527334">Ubisoft disbanded its developer last fall</a>.</p><p>Following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-closes-studio-eliminating-185-jobs-in-latest-round-of-cuts/1100-6529036/" data-ref-id="1100-6529036">a very bad year for the company</a>, Ubisoft has largely remained quiet about its development pipeline. It had a limited presence at Summer Game Fest earlier this month, and it did not hold its normal summertime Ubisoft Forward event. This is likely due to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-delays-multiple-upcoming-games/1100-6531542/" data-ref-id="1100-6531542">its decision to delay many of its major upcoming titles</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-confirms-fairly-tame-pc-requirements.1219860/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-confirms-fairly-tame-pc-requirements/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier today, Gearbox Software <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-wont-cost-80/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened</a> up the official pre-orders for Borderlands 4. Fans of the looter shooter franchise certainly held their breath for a while when Gearbox president Randy Pitchford wouldn't confirm the pricing, and now they can rest a bit easier knowing that the game won't be priced at $80 as some had feared.</p>
<p>Alongside the opening of pre-orders, though, the Texas-based development studio also revealed the minimum and recommended PC requirements for Borderlands 4. They can be read on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/borderlands-4" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a> pages, although we've posted them below too for your convenience.</p>
<p><em><strong>Minimum:</strong></em><br>
<em>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</em><br>
<em>OS: Windows 10 / Windows 11</em><br>
<em>Processor: Intel Core i7-9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 2700X</em><br>
<em>Memory: 16 GB RAM</em><br>
<em>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2070 / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT</em><br>
<em>Storage: 100 GB available space</em><br>
<em>Additional Notes: Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system. Requires 8 CPU Cores for processor. Requires 8 GB VRAM for graphics. SSD storage required</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Recommended</strong>:</em><br>
<em>Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system</em><br>
<em>OS: Windows 10 / Windows 11</em><br>
<em>Processor: Intel Core i7-12700 / AMD Ryzen 7 5800X</em><br>
<em>Memory: 32 GB RAM</em><br>
<em>Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 / AMD Radeon RX 6800 XT</em><br>
<em>Storage: 100 GB available space</em><br>
<em>Additional Notes: Requires a 64-bit processor and operating system. Requires 8+ CPU Cores for processor. Requires 12+ GB VRAM for graphics. SSD storage required</em></p>
<p>Considering that Borderlands 4 is powered by Unreal Engine 5, these system requirements are fairly tame compared to others we've seen. The game is also said to offer the largest and most seamless map in the franchise, with anything you see in the distance reachable by the players.</p>
<p>Traversal has been improved, too, with moves such as double jumping, gliding, dodging, and grappling available. As with the previous entries, drop-in, drop-out cooperative gameplay is said to be the centerpiece of the game, and cross-play is also supported (although you'll need to sign up for a SHiFT Account to join fellow teammates from other platforms).</p>
<p>Borderlands 4 is set to debut on September 12 for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/critical-role-welcomes-chris-perkins-and-jeremy-crawford-to-darrington-press<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Chris Perkins and Jeremy Crawford have found a new home at Darrington Press. The <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/christopher-perkins-retires-from-wizards-of-coast-after-28-years-working-on-dungeons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">two</a> <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/jeremy-crawford-game-director-of-dungeons-dragons-is-leaving-wizards-of-ghost" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">former</a> creative leads behind the most popular edition of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>will now collaborate with Critical Role's tabletop studio to produce new TTRPG experiences.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://darringtonpress.com/welcoming-chris-perkins-and-jeremy-crawford-to-our-team/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Darrington Press announced that Chris Perkins and Jeremy Crawford will be joining their design team. Perkins will be joining as the Creative Director, and Crawford's new role will be Game Director. They will be both developing novel game concepts and expanding upon games previously released by Darrington Press.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/darrington-press-daggerheart-promo-photo.jpg?itok=XMh1zPSA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/darrington-press-daggerheart-promo-photo.jpg?itok=Xp3hdetL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Both of these roles are strongly aligned with Perkins' and Crawford's skills. Perkins was the Senior Story Designer for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Fifth Edition, playing a key role in shaping the official campaign modules and settings of the fantasy TTRPG. Crawford was the lead system designer for Fifth Edition, introducing the highly influential Advantage/Disadvantage mechanic.</p>

<p>Perkins and Crawford recently left Wizards of the Coast after working on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/dungeons-dragons-5e-2024-dungeon-masters-guide-review-true-dms-best-friend" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024</em></a> Core Rulebooks.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>‚ÄúStorytelling has always been at the heart of everything I do, and joining Darrington Press feels a bit like coming home,‚Äù said Perkins, Creative Director of Darrington Press. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve loved being a part of the extended Critical Role family as a regular guest over the years and I‚Äôm beyond excited to help create new worlds full of adventure.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The addition of Chris Perkins and Jeremy Crawford to the core design team has continued to expand Darrington Press' clout. There is a strong possibility they can bring their substantive experience to guide and build upon the company's <a href="https://darringtonpress.com/success-with-fear-daggerheart-sold-out/" rel="nofollow">best-selling</a> hit, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/daggerheart-review-narrative-forward-yes-and-ttrpg-that-is-force-to-be-reckoned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a>. Alternatively, their new position offers new creative freedom to try different things away from Wizards of the Coast.</p>

<p>Either way, this shift of talent is huge for the tabletop industry as a whole, one that will lead to ongoing competition and innovation.</p>

                <p>Roger Clark, who voiced Arthur Morgan in Red Dead Redemption II, has revealed his newest project--and it's out soon. It's not another western, but instead a game about cats.</p><p>Clark is lending his voice to Ultra Mega Cats, a PvE co-op shooter "where badass cats battle waves of enemies in explosive arenas." Clark is voicing the feline Clint, and he described his work on the game as <a href="https://x.com/rclark98/status/1934660290420822433" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"another wild ride in the gaming world."</a> Clint is a cowboy cat who dual-wields pistols, so while this role is unexpected and very different, it does harken back to Clark's most famous role in Rockstar's Western.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCut0thGMIY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oCut0thGMIY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Ultra Mega Cats has players controlling so-called Mega Cats, which are basically cats with super-abilities and incredible power.</p><p>"Imagine living in a world flipped upside down, where rodents and feathered forces rule and cats are shunned. You're one of the last cats standing--disgraced, brainwashed, and trained to serve your former prey as their personal killing machine," reads a line from the game's description. "But that is not enough, as the cat's soul knows no master! Awaken your inner predator and restore balance to this world!"</p><p>There are five different cats in Ultra Mega Cats, including two who will be available when the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1882130/Ultra_Mega_Cats/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">launches into Steam Early Access on June 17</a>. Each cat has 50 different modifications that can be unlocked over time. Take a look at the trailer above to get a closer look at Ultra Mega Cats.</p><p>After Red Dead Redemption II, Clark also had voice roles in Back 4 Blood and Tactics Ogre: Reborn, among other projects.</p><p>As for the Red Dead series, John Marston actor <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemptions-john-marston-actor-teases-exciting-news-coming-soon/1100-6532444/" data-ref-id="1100-6532444">Rob Wiethoff has teased big news for this week</a> amid reports of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/red-dead-redemption-2-may-be-heading-to-switch-2-report/1100-6532372/" data-ref-id="1100-6532372">Red Dead Redemption II heading to Switch 2, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. </a></p>

                <p>Fortnite has lost its crown. Grow a Garden, the breakout game on Roblox, has broken the concurrent-player-count record. It broke over 16 million CCUs (concurrent users) over the weekend, beating out Fortnite by nearly two million. The battle royale held the previous record of 14.3 million.</p><p>Grow a Garden is an idle video game where a garden changes between sessions. Released in March, it has players plant crops and flowers and design their own garden. The plants will grow when they are offline, making for a nice surprise when they log back on.</p><p>"Grow a Garden has more players than New Zealand and Norway combined," wrote Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roblox/comments/1lb966s/comment/mxqxrim/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">agentsunnyside7_4</a> in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/roblox/comments/1lb966s/grow_a_garden_has_now_broken_the_record_for_the/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">thread</a> that covered the huge player-count news. "If it [were] a country, it would be the 78th-most-populated country, behind Rwanda and above Burundi."</p><p>A recent promotion gave players a free pet if they were online when an update was released.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shadow-launches-next-generation-cloud-gaming-tier-%E2%80%98neo%E2%80%99.1219821/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/shadow-launches-next-generation-cloud-gaming-tier-neo/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, French cloud platform <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadow-impressions-cloud-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SHADOW</a> announced '<a href="https://shadow.tech/shadowpc/offers/#pricing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Neo</a>', a new tier of its cloud gaming offering. Neo replaces the previous 'Boost' tier with much-improved specifications, delivering greatly accelerated performance in gaming (up to 150%) and software (up to 200%). All current subscribers at the Boost tier have been upgraded to Neo, which is still priced at $37.99 monthly, taxes excluded. These are the updated specs:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>CPU:</strong> AMD EPYC ‚Äì 8 vCores @ 3.25-3.8GHz</li>
<li><strong>GPU:</strong> Equivalent to NVIDIA RTX 4060 16GB (Server-grade NVIDIA RTX 2000 ADA 16GB)</li>
<li><strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB DDR5</li>
<li><strong>Network:</strong> 1Gb/s fiber connection</li>
<li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10/11</li>
</ul>
<p>Olivier Abecassis, CEO at Shadow, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>Neo is our newest and most versatile cloud PC yet. Whether you‚Äôre gaming in 2K with RTX and DLSS, editing complex 3D models, or working on the go, Shadow Neo gives you the power of a high-end PC ‚Äî instantly and from anywhere.</em></p>
<p>The new configuration supports DirectX 12, Vulkan 1.3, RTX, DLSS, FSR, and Frame Generation. This, however, raises the question of whether the Power tier makes any sense anymore. Currently, Power provides access to a similar CPU and an older GPU, the RTX 3070 Ti. When factoring in the fact that the RTX 4060 has access to DLSS Frame Generation while the RTX 3070 Ti does not, paying $50 for the Power tier does not make much sense, as the performance is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdmAG4PL7Nk" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nearly the same</a> in some games. SHADOW will have to upgrade this tier too shortly to make it viable again.</p>
<p>Overall, you might be baffled to hear about such high prices compared to, for example, NVIDIA's GeForce NOW platform, which lets you rent an RTX 4080-class GPU for $20 monthly. The big difference is that SHADOW gives you access to a whole PC, so you can use it however you see fit. That means installing any kind of software, or, staying within the gaming subject, being able to install mods for your PC games, which isn't really possible on GeForce NOW (or similar competitors like Boosteroid).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-says-it-is-still-deep-in-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-development/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft has finally provided an update on how things are going with the highly anticipated Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake, and the update is that they're still working on it.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1934642136500060166">post on the studio's official Prince of Persia X account</a>, Ubisoft simply says, "<em>Yep, we're still deep in the game - exploring, building, and ensuring the sands move with purpose. This game is being created by a team that truly cares, and they're pouring their hearts (and a lot of coffee) into every step. Thank you for sticking with us</em>."</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/1934642139247321113">follow-up post</a>, Ubisoft reminds players that there's another Prince of Persia game they could go play right now, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-early-access-review-the-year-of-the-prince/">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>While development continues behind the scenes, there's another adventure waiting for you right now: The Rogue Prince of Persia</em>."</p>
<p>The post also includes a new piece of art from the game, displaying the exterior of one of the buildings those who played the original game will remember.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Last month, the company's annual earnings report confirmed that the remake will be out by<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-2026-no-word-on-splinter-cell-remake/"> March 2026</a>, which is only a small update from the game's previous release window of '<a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-releases-in-2026/">sometime in 2026</a>'.</p>
<p>Ubisoft has <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-will-expand-farahs-character-long-development-time-is-due-to-high-remake-bar/">previously spoken</a> about having a high bar for this remake, which is evident from the fact that the company <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-fully-rebooted/">entirely rebooted the game's development once before</a>, after its initial reveal <a href="https://wccftech.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-ubisoft-montreal/">failed to impress</a>.</p>
<p>It may be upsetting for fans of the series who are looking forward to this remake that there's still basically no update on how things are going, but it's also not surprising given <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-reveals-release-date-for-anno-117-pax-romana-a-1-0-release-window-for-the-rogue-prince-of-persia-and-showcases-a-new-game-morbid-metal-at-sgf-2025/">Ubisoft's muted appearance during this year's Summer Game Fest festivities</a>. And with the lack of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-will-not-host-its-annual-ubisoft-forward-event-this-year/">Ubisoft Forward</a> event for 2025, it's not worth holding your breath on any major updates from Ubisoft this year.</p>

That same rep claimed it would be added shortly after launch via an update if the team couldn‚Äôt get the feature working in time. </p><p>It is a bit funny how, in 2025, the idea of an online video game launching without crossplay is news. A few years ago, crossplay was still a relatively new concept, and it wasn‚Äôt a guarantee that a multiplayer game would support letting Xbox and PlayStation people play together. Now, if your game doesn‚Äôt ship with crossplay, it‚Äôs weird, and people get mad. We all really got used to crossplay being a given in a short amount of time, huh? </p><p><em>Rematch </em>is out now on PC, Xbox, PlayStation, and PC if you paid extra for the fancier editions of the game. It launches for everyone on June 19, when it will also become available via Game Pass on Xbox. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The cloud-gaming service Shadow, which provides cloud computational resources for gamers as well as professionals, has launched a new high-end machine. Called Neo, this new machine runs the equivalent of an Nvidia 4060 GPU and is a free upgrade for users who already subscribe to Shadow's high-end service.</p><p>The company states that this new cloud PC will facilitate "up to 150%" more performance in gaming-related tasks, alongside a 200% boost in "pro software" performance. Its new components enable more options for gamers, such as improved DLSS and ray tracing. In addition to the new GPU, the Neo PC has a CPU with eight vCores ranging between 3.25-3.8 GHz, 16GB of DDR5 RAM, and is connected to a 1Gb/s network connection.</p><p>Neo will be rolled out for free to existing users of Shadow's previous Boost tier, while new users can subscribe for $38/month. This upgrade brings Shadow's offerings closer to its main competitor in the PC cloud-gaming space, Nvidia GeForce Now, which offers 4080-equivalent performance at its highest tier. While GeForce Now is considerably cheaper (at about $17/month), Shadow's main advantage is that it provides a full Windows experience. This means that users can directly access and download their full PC games libraries without restriction, as well as use any software that works on Windows.</p><p>Shadow has been around for a while, and it seems to have found a niche with gamers who also want to have access to computational resources for other tasks. While the company once experimented with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shadow-game-streaming-offers-a-powerful-cloud-pc-b/1100-6465346/" data-ref-id="1100-6465346">offering its own set-top box</a>, it now emphasizes the accessibility of its app across many mobile and desktop operating systems.</p>

                <p>Two years ago, BattleBit Remastered caught on after its early-access release and it was briefly one of the most popular shooters online. BattleBit's player count had dramatically dropped since 2023 and the game was seemingly abandoned. Now, however, it appears the game could find a new lease on life with a forthcoming update.</p><p>A very short teaser for BattleBit Remastered's Operation Overhaul has been shared by the game's publisher and co-developer, SgtOkiDoki. There's not much to go in the clips, but it's the first sign of life that BattleBit has had in 18 months.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> BattleBit Remastered - Operation Overhaul | Gameplay Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>SgtOkiDoki and fellow indie developers Vilaskis and TheLiquidHorse released BattleBit Remastered in June 2023, and players embraced its easy-to-play mechanics. What the game lacked in visual splendor, it made up for with destructible environments, relatively realistic depictions of weapons, 254-player lobbies, and large maps to explore. At its peak, BattleBit Remastered had 87,323 concurrent players.</p><p>BattleBit's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/671860/BattleBit_Remastered/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam page</a> hasn't been updated with any details about the update yet and it still has the notice from Valve that the game hasn't had any developer activity for a long time. The most recent peak for BattleBit's concurrent players was just over 1,000, which suggests most of the game's audience has moved on. It remains to be seen if the new update can revive interest in the title.</p><p>In 2023, GameSpot's Firearms Expert Reacts featured <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/firearms-expert-reacts-to-battlebit-remastereds-guns-part-2/2300-6461878/" data-ref-id="2300-6461878">an extended look at BattleBit's depiction of weapons</a> and determined that they were largely true-to-life and realistic, despite the game's low-poly aesthetic.</p>

            <p>
With Borderlands 4's September release inching closer, publisher Take-Two has announced pricing and a variety of special editions for the shooter. And there's good news for anyone worried an $80 price tag might be on the cards following all that recent hoo-ha; the standard edition does not, it turns out, cross Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford's "real fan" threshold.
</p>
<p>
Pitchford, of course, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/80-for-borderlands-4-too-costly-randy-pitchford-says-if-youre-a-real-fan-youll-find-a-way-to-make-it-happen">raised more than a few eyebrows last month</a>, when he implied potential customers not willing to spend $80 on Borderlands 4 (amid a hypothetical discussion of its price tag) weren't 'real fans'. His statement - that "real fans" would find a way to get their hands on a copy of the game, even if it came with a $80 price tag - did not go down well, and Pitchford <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4s-randy-pitchford-seeks-to-justify-80-real-fans-comment">later attempted to justify his comments in a longer video</a>. Unfortunately, he then followed that up with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-slam-gearbox-ceo-randy-pitchfords-message-to-cost-sensitive-fans">another ill-conceived social media post</a> irritated fans quickly branded "tone-deaf".
</p>
<p>
But it turns out Pitchford could probably have avoided needlessly annoying the Borderlands community if he'd just held fire a little longer. Take-Two has now confirmed Borderlands 4 will, in fact, cost $70 for the standard edition of the game - but the full story is a little more complicated given regional pricing, variations in platform pricing, and the usual scrum of special editions offering various strands of Borderlands <em>stuff</em>.
</p>
<p>
PC is where you'll pick up Borderlands 4 cheapest; the standard edition costs ¬£59.99 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/borderlands-4">Epic</a>, and you'll be paying ¬£69.99 for the same version on Xbox Series X/S and PS5. That then climbs to ¬£89.99 for the Deluxe Edition (which I suppose is now technically the Real Fan Edition given the price) and ¬£119.99 for the Super (Fan?) Deluxe Edition.
</p>
<p>
And in case you're wondering what the difference is, the Deluxe Edition features the game, the Bounty Pack Bundle (which includes four post-launch DLC packs promising new areas, missions, and bosses), plus Vault Cards containing more challenges and rewards, new gear and weapons, four new vehicles, Vault Hunter cosmetics, and the Firehawk's Fury Weapon Skin.
</p>
<p>
The Super Deluxe Edition, meanwhile, includes all the above, plus the Ornate Order Pack (featuring Vault Hunter Skins, four Vault Hunter Heads and four Vault Hunter Bodies), and the Vault Hunter Pack. This latter includes two post-launch Story Packs, each bringing a new Vault Hunter, new story and side missions, new map regions, new gear and weapons, plus additional Vault Hunter and ECHO-4 cosmetics.
</p>
<p>
So to recap, Borderlands 4 - now with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-will-dial-down-the-toilet-humour-says-narrative-director">less toilet humour</a>! - launches for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC on 12th September.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-how-are-you-finding-mario-karts-open-world<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d9088ee9f8b68/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Many of us have just wrapped up our second weekend with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, and by this point you've probably seen most of the Grand Prix mode and had your rear end handed to you various times in Knockout Tour (I swear, there's no middle ground with that one - I either do really well or go out in the first two laps!), and are starting to explore Free Roam mode a little more.</p>
<p>'Open-world Mario Kart' sounded like a tasty drive-thru feast and while all of us here at Nintendo Life are love with the world itself and the way the tracks are seamlessly integrated across the regions, we're up and down like a suspension bridge on whether the open-world experience is as fun as it could be.</p>
<p>We're interested to get your thoughts, but first, let's see where Team NL are after spending a definitely-not-unhealthy number of hours with the game in the 11 days since launch...</p>
<h2>Hopping for more (Gavin Lane, editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9fb1e750ae6f4/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I love the world itself, the tracks, and ‚Äî despite popular opinion ‚Äî the transitions between circuits that finish up with a lap or two on the course proper. There's variety there, and I'm seriously impressed by how the devs mark out routes in such a way that I never, ever take a wrong turn. The terrain and track design is peerless.</p>
<p>Exploring the island, though, is a bit less engaging than I'd hoped from the company that gave us <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a>. There's definitely an element of, 'Oof, there's another coin I need to screenshot for a guide' that isn't the typical play experience, but I'm struggling to enjoy exploring as much as racing.</p>
<p>I do think that this game is crying out for a MK64-style on-the-spot spin - so often I want to just 180 degrees, but no, it's a slow arc...and then I accidentally hit a boost plate or something. Zeroing in on a specific spot on the map feels like trying to land a plane sometimes.</p>
<p>Same deal with the jump - right now, I'm just dying for a double jump because lining up a straight-line boost-hop thing, again, means I've got one approach and if I botch it (which I often do), I'll need to go around for another pass. Yes, rewind is a lifesaver but at the moment, I feel like open-world exploration would be much more enjoyable if the controls were 20% more platformer.</p>
<h2>Open to secrets (Alana Hagues, deputy editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c4c8cddcf05be/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>It seems like I'm enjoying the open world more than most. Admittedly, a big part of that is because I'm going around finding all of the collectibles ‚Äî I'm being forced to see just how the courses are interlinked, and how seasons and environments shift. It's honestly a little bit staggering.</p>
<p>All those collectible items encourage you to interact with the world in ways you've never had to in Mario Kart before. Deviously-placed Peach Medallions on top of a building, and there's no reasonable way up top? Time to find a pipe or a rail or something!</p>
<p>But I realise a lot of my enjoyment comes from either doing tricky challenges or simply taking a load off. I absolutely think that Free Roam needs something else to make it excellent and enjoyable for all. I'm sure others share this sentiment, but stickers being the only reward is bonkers. Why do I not get a themed kart for getting all the panels on one course? What is this highway other than a connecting road between Mario Circuit and Moo Moo Meadows? Why can't I collect music tracks or something else?</p>
<p>Anyway, Free Roam is fun to me, but it's not deep. I wish it were deeper.Though those miniature tributes to the SNES courses like Vanilla Lake and Choco Island are adorable.</p>
<h2>Racing to find the point (Ollie Reynolds, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4edc6317ec289/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Right now, exploring Mario Kart World via Free Roam is like being handed a giant bowl of delicious Lamb Jalfrezi with all the trimmings and being told I can't eat it. It's a truly stunning world; one that manages to outdo <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> in almost every conceivable way, yet I find it utterly boring.</p>
<p>There are P Switch missions, yes, and Peach Medallions, all that good stuff, but the game is simply lacking any compelling reason or incentive to actually seek them out. I'm sorry, but I don't care in the slightest about bloomin' stickers.</p>
<p>Truth be told, if Nintendo had tied character unlocks to the open world, this would have gone a long way toward making Free Roam a compelling mode. Perhaps you spot Pianta cruising along in the distance and driving up to it triggers a spontaneous head-to-head race. Beat it and you unlock it. Simple!</p>
<p>Just little things like this could potentially transform the open world into an environment worth exploring. At the moment, despite being full of cool little references and easter eggs, it feels weirdly barren.</p>
<h2>A pleasant pit-stop (Jim Norman, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8999c35c6b7fd/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Perhaps I am something of an outlier here because I have been knee-deep in P Switch guides for the last week and a half, but I'm finding the open-world driving to be a nice bit of harmless fun ‚Äî if a little intimidating with there being so much to do.</p>
<p>I totally agree with Ollie that every challenge feels a little aimless at the moment, and some kind of Metal Mario-style reward might motivate me to hit the big 100% sooner, but I'm enjoying hopping in for a spot of open-world cruisin' when the stresses of Knockout Tour get too much.</p>
<p>You can barely drive for 10 seconds without spotting a handful of switchs, a coin, or a naughty Nabbit in need of pursuing, and it has been nice to drop in for five minutes here and there to cross a few of them off my list before hitting the track properly again. I'm enjoying the level of challenge most of the time, too (though anything too focused on Wall Riding can take a hike).</p>
<p>Do I wish there was a point to it all? Yeah, I do. Do I wish I could do more proper exploring with a partner in split screen? Absolutely. But as a first attempt for the series, it feels like a nice introduction to something different.</p>
<h2>Good, but the map can do one (PJ O'Reilly, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/39cb4a7b06450/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I've been finding the open world aspect a whole lot of fun, overall. It's not reinventing anything, and it does feel primarily aimed at younger gamers ‚Äî I mean, the whole game is, but you can really feel it here. But it's easy-breezy and packed full of light puzzling fun with the underlying carrot of collectibles and outfits keeping you engaged.</p>
<p>However, and it is a big however for me, the map is absolutely awful. Why can't I just pull it up and see where I am quickly? Why make it so hard? Yes, the mini-map <em>is</em> very detailed, but it's too zoomed in for me, personally.</p>
<p>Aside from this gripe, though, yeah, it's a good time that feels like it warrants its place in the package as a whole. Do I wish you could drive to a stadium and start a race directly that way? Yes, and I feel like they could do more with how free roam is utilised for multiple players, but this is still a nice diversion when racing for all those three-star golds gets a bit tiring.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>So, that's where we are - but what about you? Are you taken with the open-world ambition? Are you merrily picking up Peach coins and P-Switches, or are you jonesing for something more? Let us know in the poll below.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sloclap-rematch-wont-support-cross-play-at-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Rematch, the upcoming soccer game from Sifu developer Sloclap, is due to arrive for everyone this <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/sifu-developer-sloclap-has-announced-a-release-date-for-its-new-soccer-game-rematch/">Thursday, June 19, 2025</a>.&nbsp;</strong>It should be an exciting launch for the studio, as Rematch had an extremely popular beta test with more than 1.9 million players jumping in on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>
<p>But that excitement has been significantly quelled, with today's reveal by Sloclap that the game will not support cross-play between players on other platforms.</p>
<p>"<em>Crossplay between Steam, PlayStation &amp; Xbox won't be available at launch,</em>" <a href="https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1934529603244028143">Sloclap announced in a post on the game's official X account</a>. "<em>But it's one of our top priorities for upcoming updates! We'll share an ETA as soon as possible, stay tuned!</em>"</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1934628094624567591">separate post</a>, Sloclap said it "<em>aimed for launch but couldn't quite get it ready in time. We're actively working on it.</em>"</p>
<p>Rematch is already available for those who paid for early access, and it was only about an hour before that early access launch that Sloclap delivered the disappointing news about cross-play functionality. It's clear the team was trying to have it ready in time, but delivering the news so close to the game's early access release, the one reserved for those who paid extra for the privilege of playing three days early, is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Rematch/comments/1lcua7w/the_game_still_feels_like_a_beta/">upsetting players online</a>.</p>
<p>The mood around Rematch isn't helped by the fact that players are reporting major server issues impacting their experience.</p>
<p><iframe title="REMATCH | Golden Rules Trailer | Release Date Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EFMw23F-KbA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hopefully, by the time the game is available for everyone on Thursday, Sloclap has resolved the biggest of its server issues, and players are able to have a smoother time than they are now. And hopefully it doesn't all break again once cross-play support is added.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nexus Mods</a>, PC gaming's premier destination for mods, is changing hands after almost 24 years. Site founder Robin Scott, aka DarkOne, announced the change in ownership but didn't make clear who the new owners are.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a> on Nexus Mods, Scott doesn't explicitly state who the site's new owners are, only that it took many months of meetings and face-to-face talks to find a new owner that would "respect the myriad intricacies of both Nexus Mods as a business and the wider modding community." The new owners are focused on "long-term stability, not changing the values or direction of the platform," Scott said, and that the site will continue to be "community-first and mod-author focused."</p><p>"So yes, the ownership of Nexus Mods has changed hands, but I want to be clear, this isn't some corporate 'exit' or a backroom deal," Scott said. "This is me doing something I probably should've done years ago: taking care of myself. Reclaiming some headspace. And finally letting go of the idea that I have to do everything and be responsible for everything myself."</p><p dir="ltr">Scott cited burnout and health reasons for stepping away from running the site he founded. Scott said running the website since 2001 and always being "on call" has been an ongoing source of anxiety and "stress-related health issues." While the site was born out of personal excitement for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind/" data-ref-id="5000-2508">The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</a>, it later transformed into a business that consumed his life.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's been rewarding, sometimes chaotic, often exhausting, and always personal," Scott said. "Somewhere along the way, I forgot to step back and breathe, or sleep properly. The dilemma of running a major social network that does not rest!"</p><p dir="ltr">Scott said that his burnout and exhaustion began to have a negative effect on the site and the Nexus Mods team, making him come to the realization that the "best thing" for the future of Nexus Mods was to step aside and bring in new leadership.</p><p dir="ltr">Though Scott is no longer the owner, he will still be involved in helping guide the overall direction of the site, just "without needing to be the person who signs off on every little thing." In terms of what will change, it doesn't seem like it will be much, at least according to Scott. He said he had already started stepping back in recent years and that the structural updates to the company's ownership are more of a formality to make sure the right people are in control to guide the site into the future.</p><p dir="ltr">Modding, and Nexus Mods, has only continued to grow in the last two decades. Massive RPGs like Skyrim, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-fallout-4-mods/2900-5217/" data-ref-id="2900-5217">Fallout 4</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-cyberpunk-2077-mods/2900-6512/" data-ref-id="2900-6512">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-baldurs-gate-3-mods/2900-5661/" data-ref-id="2900-5661">Baldur's Gate 3</a> all having extensive modding communities that are made easily accessible thanks to sites like Nexus Mods, where mod creators can easily upload their creations and those looking to augment their games on PC can easily browse for new additions.</p><p dir="ltr">For those looking to make the jump into the wild world of user-made mods, be sure to check out our round-up of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-skyrim-mods/2900-6392/" data-ref-id="2900-6392">best Skyrim mods to play in 2025</a>, as well as similar lists for popular mod-friendly games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-elden-ring-mods/2900-5480/" data-ref-id="2900-5480">Elden Ring</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-stardew-valley-mods/2900-5735/" data-ref-id="2900-5735">Stardew Valley</a>.</p>

The original games from developer Neversoft deftly captured the joy of building your skate style and exploring a popular destination transformed into a skatepark. Vicarious Visions' 2020 remake, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, was a firm reminder that iconic THPS gameplay still hits‚Äîand we're getting the next bundle soon with the revamped </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During Summer Game Fest 2025, we had the opportunity to play Iron Galaxy‚Äôs take on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>3 + 4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. While checking out the renewed titles, we spoke with game director Kurt Tillmanns about stepping in for the previous remake developer and what makes the classic THPS gameplay so timeless.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We're huge fans of the franchise; most of the team have been playing the games their whole lives," said Tillmanns. "It's a great honor to be working with Tony Hawk to carry on with what Vicarious Visions had done on an amazing project [with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>1 + 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">], and then just carry it forward and make improvements and additions in every possible place we can."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developer Iron Galaxy has an extensive history of assisting developers and even taking over development from other teams, particularly Killer Instinct's final seasons. Much like the 2020 remake, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>THPS 3 + 4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> focuses on revitalizing the original 2000s-era games with refined gameplay and more fleshed-out mechanics that incorporate features from later games in the series, such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tony Hawk's Underground</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and its suite of wall planting and spine transferring.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/after-years-of-preparation-ioi-is-ready-to-apply-its-lethal-learnings-to-007-first-light" target="_self" data-discover="true">Lethal learnings from Hitman prepared IOI for making 007: First Light</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Iron Galaxy chose a novel approach in adapting the career mode from the fourth game of the series, which offered free-roam maps and other skaters hawking missions. It was a well-loved feature and even formed the basis of the skater story mode in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tony Hawk's Underground</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but, as is, it couldn‚Äôt work with both </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">‚Äîso the developers opted for a more seamless blend between them. The compromise allows players to skate in parks for up to an hour, giving them the freedom to skate as they like.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The experience of exploring a sandbox skatepark filled with half-pipes and bizarre activities that lean into the rebellious nature of skate culture is at the heart of what makes the THPS games so enjoyable. When it came to delivering a remake of the third and forth games, the developers still wanted to deliver on the heightened reality of the "skater fantasy."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Humor and rule-breaking are part of the Tony Hawk formula">Humor and rule-breaking are part of the Tony Hawk formula</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Part of the legacy of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater is that it has a sense of humor about itself, and it can break a bunch of rules," said the game director. "Some of that even starts with the level, like the way that we designate levels in Tony Hawk or think about the forbidden, fantastic places in them. You have forbidden places in real-world locations that you just want to skate in and feel like a real skater, and then we also have places like Area 51 or this Pinball Machine level."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/what-i-learned-during-a-marvellous-meeting-with-to-a-t-creator-keita-takahashi" target="_self" data-discover="true">What I learned during a marvelous meeting with To a T creator Keita Takahashi</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We can kind of break reality, and then the skaters are also an extension of that.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-out-now-after-a-strong-head-start-weekend/">Dune: Awakening</a> is a wonderfully immersive game that allows players to insert themselves in the world of Arrakis and play among the sandworms and political intrigue the series is known for, but before you get to any of that, you need to live long enough to see it.</p>
<p>Surviving on Arrakis in Dune: Awakening is, whether you like it or not, painfully accurate to what it would be like if you were to try living on the desert planet for longer than a day. And it doesn't exactly help your case that the game begins with your player character crash-landing on the planet, with barely anything but the clothes on your back.</p>
<p>While you are guided through some concrete survival steps in the game's opening hours, this guide will take you through the minutiae of what it takes to survive on Arrakis, and the new way of thinking you'll need to adjust to in order to make sure you'll be able to see the sun rise on a new day on Dune.</p>
<h2>Dune: Awakening - Tips for Surviving Arrakis</h2>
<h4>ABP - Always Be Prepared</h4>

<figure></figure>

<p>On one level, always being prepared means having the tools and resources you'll need to survive at the ready. But more accurately, it means developing habits that ensure you never get caught off guard.</p>
<p>For example, having enough dart ammo in your backpack or making sure your literjon of water is filled before heading out is easy enough to remember, but you also want to make sure you're not without survey probes. Surveying new areas is an absolute must because it'll clear away the fog from the new parts of the map you're exploring and give you a clear picture of how to travel safely.</p>
<p>If you don't know where the actual closest rock formation is to your current location, it's easy to get caught out in open sand for too long. And you do&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> want to be caught in open sand for too long. That's a fast track to losing everything in the gullet of a sandworm.</p>
<p>This is also why your map is arguably your biggest support for everything you'll do in Dune: Awakening. Knowing where to go next so you're safely travelling across the planet is one thing, but another is the fact that your map will also show you where to gather resources you need to stay alive and craft the vehicles and devices you need to aid your survival. ABP means keeping your map up to date, your inventory stocked with essentials, and ensuring that you can handle whatever situations come your way.</p>
<h3>Store your vehicle(s)</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>Take it from someone who has already gone through this experience. Store your vehicle, do not simply leave it next to your base in a shaded area, thinking that'll be enough to keep it safe from the elements on Arrakis. It isn't, and you'll return to your time away from the game with a bike that's wrecked beyond repair.</p>
<p>When you reach the point where you're crafting your first bike to drive across the sands, you'll also be able to craft a device that'll let you store your bike and redeploy it when you need to make those longer treks across Dune. You should consider this device now part of your permanent inventory, as it is a key piece of kit to have if you plan to do any kind of quick travelling between various points of interest on the planet.</p>
<h3>Build for mobility, not for settlements (at first)</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>When you first start building your own base, it's tempting to begin to design your dream home on Arrakis. There's already excellent <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lcuvbl/first_base_ive_ever_been_proud_of_spent_so_long/">examples</a> on the<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lalsnm/people_here_are_posting_some_awesome_futuristic/"> Dune: Awakening Reddit page</a> of really impressive bases, in terms of design, and<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lcl2z7/who_needs_thopters_i_have_a_ramp/"> functionality</a>. These are not the kinds of bases you should look to grind out and build off the top.</p>
<p>In the same way you can store a vehicle, you can store a bases design - but not the base itself. That, you'll have to rebuild, using your construction tool as you move deeper into Arrakis and away from Hagga Basin.</p>
<p>You will reach a point where it is worth building a more <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-shows-off-its-extensive-base-building-feature/">permanent settlement</a> that you'll return to time and again, but there's no point in trying to make your first base that permanent home. Not only will it make your attempts at keeping it with you as you move into Arrakis more difficult, since you'll almost certainly not be able to hold enough materials to build it all at once wherever you decide to put down your sub-fief, but abandoning your first base is in fact a mission objective in the early hours of the game.</p>
<p>So until it makes sense, don't get attached to your base. Oh, and as a side note for when you do build your permanent base, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1l7tan4/example_immersive_build_without_ruining_pathing/">make sure you're not blocking anyone's path</a>. It's annoying enough to have to plan your travel across the sands around not being out in the open for too long. You don't want to add to that by being the person who build their base between two rock formations causing a route blockage for everyone else in your server.</p>
<h3>Keep the lights on in your base, or risk losing it</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>Speaking of your base, you absolutely need to ensure it always has power. The generator you build for your base does more than just keep your fabricator or blood purifier working, it also generates a shield for your base to protect it from the elements on Arrakis. If you don't keep it powered up, you risk your base being picked apart by the elements - or worse, picked clean by other players raiding your stuff.</p>
<p>You'll be able to see how long your base can maintain power for, and if you don't have every machine in it crafting large-scale devices then the drain on its fuel won't be too dire at all. It's not a difficult thing to keep it powered, but it can be an easy thing to forget. And survival always seems to come down to not forgetting the little things.</p>
<h3>You won't win against a sandworm, a sandstorm, or the sun, so don't chance it</h3>

<figure></figure>

<p>There are three elements of Arrakis that you simply won't win against and should not take your chances on. Sandworms, sandstorms, and the sun.</p>
<p>The sandworms are a pretty obvious one. They're huge, will swallow you and everything you have on you whole, and are to be avoided at all times. Shai-Hulud is respected and worshipped for a reason, and as far as we know, Funcom has no plans to add a skill-tree where the end goal is gaining the powers of Atreides descendant <a href="https://dune.fandom.com/wiki/Sheeana_Brugh">Sheeana</a>. Make sure you have an escape plan, whether that's heading to the nearest rock formation, or flying out of there with an orinthopter, when sandworms are close by.</p>
<p>Sandstorms on Arrakis are to be feared just as much, and you'll need to ensure you have a way of taking shelter should you hear the warning that one is headed towards your area. Once the warnings begin, every moment spent out in the open to gather more resources or make it to your next destination is done at your own peril.</p>
<p>Lastly, the sun is the third part of this trifecta of terror that you need to always be aware of when travelling the sands of Arrakis. It will boil you faster than you think, dehydrate you faster, and slowly tick down your health if you're caught out in it for too long. This is why you should always travel at night, especially in the early hours of the game when you're working your way up to building your first bike. You travel, build, basically do anything, at your own peril in the heat of the Arrakis sun.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nexus-mods-has-been-sold-to-an-undisclosed-buyer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/">Nexus Mods</a>, likely the biggest and most popular repository for game mods that PC players have relied on for more than two decades, has been sold, the previous owner and creator, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301?mtm_kwd=newsfeed">Dark0ne, announced</a>.</p>
<p>Dark0ne ran the site for 24 years and made the decision to sell and step back from the day-to-day operations of the website after it took too much of a personal toll on them.</p>
<p>"<em>The strain of being responsible for the behemoth I created has taken its toll,</em>"&nbsp;Dark0ne wrote in their blog post announcing the sale.</p>
<p>"<em>The stress of the job has been a regular source of anxiety and stress-related health issues. I realised that I have been burning out and this started to have an impact on my staff and Nexus Mods as a whole</em>."</p>
<p>While Dark0ne doesn't disclose who the new owner of the website is, they do make it clear that they are confident that the site is being passed into good hands.</p>
<p>"<em>One of the biggest reasons I've been doing this for so long is that I've never felt that I truly found someone who really "gets" the modding community the way I do. Finding a new owner who would be able to understand and respect the myriad intricacies of both Nexus Mods as a business and the wider modding community was essential.</em></p>
<p><em>After months of meetings, face-to-face talks, and a whole lot of soul searching, I am thrilled to say that I truly believe I have found the exact right people for the task.</em></p>
<p><em>So yes, the ownership of Nexus Mods has changed hands, but I want to be clear, this isn‚Äôt some corporate ‚Äúexit‚Äù or a backroom deal. This is me doing something I probably should‚Äôve done years ago: taking care of myself. Reclaiming some headspace. And finally letting go of the idea that I have to do everything and be responsible for everything myself.</em>"</p>
<p>Dark0ne continues to say that on the player and modder side of things, there won't really be any changes, and that the biggest change is simply the ownership, and the fact that Dark0ne won't be the person who has to sign-off on everything happening with the website.</p>
<p>Last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexus-mods-has-crossed-the-10-billion-downloads-milestone/">Nexus Mods crossed 10 billion mod downloads</a> in its lifetime. An impressive feat, and a solid one for Dark0ne to leave on at the end of their tenure. It'll be interesting to see who is taking over the site, if/when the new ownership is disclosed. So many players around the world rely on Nexus Mods. For their sake, and the sake of the PC modding community, hopefully this new era for the site is even better than the last.</p>

It's not too surprising how many of them are references to previous Souls games, but some of the deeper cuts are certainly interesting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ERbnwDLgao" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Souls YouTuber BonfireVN put together</a> a side-by-side comparison of Elden Ring Nightreign's Dark Souls skins with their origins in their respective Souls games. These skins unlock once you've cleared the final boss of Elden Ring Nightreign, and offer some big visual shake-ups for the various Nightfarers of the realm.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These "throwback" skins are callbacks to various pieces of Dark Souls history, mostly through NPCs and armor sets seen throughout the games. It's a nice bit of nostalgia, and also a way to commemorate how Elden Ring carries the Souls torch forward. Some of the choices and details are fairly interesting to dig into, though, as BonfireVN shows.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Guardian's Solaire outfit, dubbed the Sunlight Knight Outfit, is a fairly obvious reference to everyone's favorite Dark Souls 1 NPC. The Catarina Outfit for the Raider is a similarly clear reference, to Siegmeyer of Catarina.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in sets like the Duchess' Wraith Outfit, you can see the evolution of the Darkwraith design over the course of Souls, and how the set evolved from its first appearance to Nightreign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others, like the Ironeyes' Sellsword duds, are surprising references to characters like Chancellor Wellager in Dark Souls 2. While it's not surprising to see firekeeper outfits, or characters like Solaire or Artorias, it's nice to see some deeper cuts. The Recluse's Heretic Sorcerer Outfit calling back to Dark Witch Karla may not even be obvious at first glance, but it's fun to see.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Plus, the detail FromSoftware has put on these armor sets is impressive, especially side-by-side with previous Souls games.

Other fans responding to the post have reported similar issues, and an IGN staff member has had the same experience happen to them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reddit post, by user ThatOtaku26, claims their save file had more than 1,000 hours of gameplay and over two decades of beloved Pok√©mon, brought over from generations of previous Pok√©mon titles stretching back to Pok√©mon Leaf Green and Pok√©mon Diamond, on the Nintendo DS and Game Boy Advance. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For Pok√©mon fans, this is why their save files are so precious ‚Äî as some players bring over creatures they have already been playing with in multiple previous games, some released years ago. At the same time, Pok√©mon games on Nintendo Switch are some of just a handful of titles not compatible with the console's in-built cloud save functionality (available if you subscribe to Nintendo Switch Online). Indeed, Switch games Pok√©mon: Let's Go Eevee and Pikachu, Pok√©mon Legends: Arceus, Pok√©mon Sword and Shield, plus Pok√©mon Scarlet and Violet are all unsupported.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the Pok√©mon franchise does have its own cloud save offering, the Pok√©mon Home app, which comes with its own subscription plan that kicks in if you want to store more than 30 creatures. And it's this app that fans are now recommending to anyone wanting to continue their Pok√©mon save files on Switch 2, just to make sure their virtual creatures survive the move to Nintendo's new console.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I just got a switch 2, did the startup and initial data transfer with no issues," ThatOtaku26 wrote. "My Scarlet save file is gone. It loads straight into the language selection and create a character screens. No data on my OLED. Just all gone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"THERE WAS NO ERROR IN DATA TRANSFER AT ALL," they continued. "IT WENT FINE. ALL MY OTHER POKEMON DATA IS STILL THERE, BUT NOT SCARLET. I had mons from my original GBA up to current on there. Literally 20 years worth of data. There's nothing I can do. I don't even know if i wanna play anymore."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Pokemon Scarlet and Violet DLC Nintendo Direct Trailer</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some fans comiserated with the player, and said they had experienced similar issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This same exact thing happened to me when I was transferring from my original Switch to the OLED," wrote Grouchy-Cress-215. "Tears were shed."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The same thing happed to me but literally all my saved data isn't there anymore like BOTW, TOTK, MK8, Pok√©mon Sword and Shield, Scarlet and Violet, and so on," added Existing-Possible550. "I literally have to play everything from the start."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many fans said the situation, however rare, meant that backing up beloved creatures to Pok√©mon Home was a necessity, just to be on the safe side.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I'm afraid of this happening to me so everything I have is going in Home before I do the switch," wrote Mexican_Chef4307.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"If I get Switch 2 in the future, I will first transfer all my Pok√©mon to Home before data transferring," added TheJannikku. "I can't imagine how I would if that happened to me."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not all fans were as compassionate, however. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Ngl the fact that you didn't transfer all of your important Pok√©mon to Home first is on you," wrote IAmTheWire. "We've known that this is the only way to preserve your Pok√©mon for sure in this kind of circumstance or if your old Switch broke, otherwise they‚Äôd be gone forever. I'd have done it just to be safe if nothing else since it's so obvious and easy to transfer them back if something was to go wrong."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo Switch 2 released earlier this month and shifted 3.5 million consoles over its first four days on sale. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-outselling-the-og-switch-2-to-1-across-the-globe">Switch 2's launch sales have outsold the launch of the original Switch by two to one</a> ‚Äî though Nintendo's previous console suffered at launch from hardware shortages.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Amazon stopped selling Nintendo Switch games in early 2024. Before long, all of Nintendo's most popular games, official accessories, and even Switch Online subscriptions were removed from sale.

            <p>Massive modding site Nexus Mods have announced a change in ownership, with founder Robin 'Dark0ne' Scott set to step back. As to who the new owners are, a couple of first names and modding profiles have been provided, as well as an assertion that these new overlords understand what makes Nexus Mods tick.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nexus-mods-on-paid-mods">Scott</a> - who founded the site as the Elder Scrolls-focused TES Nexus in 2001, and has owned it via his company Black Tree Gaming since 2007 - announced the news via <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15301">a post</a> on Nexus Mods.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The strain of being responsible for the behemoth I created has taken its toll," Scott wrote, "The stress of the job has been a regular source of anxiety and stress-related health issues. I realised that I have been burning out and this started to have an impact on my staff and Nexus Mods as a whole. </p>
<p>"So, I firmly believe that the best thing for the future of Nexus Mods is for me to step aside and bring in new leadership to steer the business forward with renewed energy to make Nexus Mods the modding community we all truly deserve."</p>
<p>Following "months of meetings, face-to-face talks, and a whole lot of soul searching", he believes he's found new ownership that will "understand and respect the myriad intricacies of both Nexus Mods as a business and the wider modding community".</p>
<p>Scott added: "I want to be clear, this isn‚Äôt some corporate ‚Äúexit‚Äù or a backroom deal. This is me doing something I probably should‚Äôve done years ago: taking care of myself."</p>
<p>So, who's taking over Nexus Mods? Well, further on in the post, Scott introduces folks called Victor and Marinus, linking to their Nexus Mods profiles under the handles <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/Foledinho">Foledinho</a> and <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/rapsak">Rapsak</a>, and revealing that they've "come on board to lead this next chapter".</p>
<p>"They‚Äôve got deep roots in gaming, tech, and most importantly, they give a damn; about the site, the community, and the future we‚Äôre trying to build here," he wrote, later adding "they‚Äôre about long-term stability, not changing the values or direction of the platform."</p>
<p>Taking a look at the profiles of these two, whose full names haven't been provided, you can see that they've been given the same 'site owner' tag Scott's account currently boasts. "For the past decade, I‚Äôve been building platforms in gaming and UGC," Foledinho's profile bio says, citing his goal with Nexus Mods as being to "help make modding easier, where games evolve through the hands of players."</p>
<p>Rapsak, meanwhile, "started producing music on a PlayStation at eight years old and eventually became a DJ, touring internationally and playing shows with music I‚Äôd made myself. 

"At the same time, I was diving deeper into tech, building PCs at 13, launching my first business at 15 (a DJ booking system), and writing code every chance I got," he goes on. Rapsak also notes that he only ever wears black T-shirts, which is "not a fashion thing, just one less decision to make in the morning." Ok then.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Nexus Mods for comment.</p>
<p>According to Scott, the ownership change shouldn't result in much of a change in terms of the day-to-day user experience on Nexus Mods in the near future, with its "team of 40 incredibly dedicated people, some of whom have been here for over nine years" still in place.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Sigh. My wife and I always joked about my rambunctious younger daughter being the one who would inevitably break a bone, and sure enough, after falling off a backyard water slide thing at a weird angle, she busted her arm in a few places. It wasn't even a clean break, either; she's got pins and the whole nine yards. <em>Sigh</em>. She has been a trooper, but c'mon, it's the worst possible time for that to happen‚Äîthe start of summer? Here's hoping the miraculous healing powers of being young kick in as soon as possible. Otherwise, we might all lose our minds.</p><p>-pk, who's only broken his collarbone but that definitely sucked</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Summer Game Fest Interviews [Part 1] </em>‚Äì There was a hot minute where I wasn't going to attend Summer Game Fest at all. An important family wedding overlapped with the event, the kind of wedding where you cannot send your partner in your place, you gotta show the fuck up. It was a blast, but could I really justify spending two days in Los Angeles? Fortunately, I made it work, and in addition to playing tons of games, I also spoke with eight different developers. You're hearing the first wave of those interviews now, and you'll hear the next wave of those next week, too. But...</li><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Sports!</em> ‚Äì We haven't been able to check in on the NBA because of schedule stuff, and fortunately, the NBA Finals won't be over before Rob and I hop on a microphone with one another on Tuesday afternoon. We'll react to everything that's happened so far, and you'll hear it ahead of game six. We will probably try to sneak in some small house updates into this one, too, for those of you following along at home and wondering if Rob's house plan fell apart.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Steam Next Fest</em> ‚Äì I'm so bummed to have missed out on last week's stream, but hey, I get to be around for this week's stream, so that's great. Those demos are disappearing off Steam as I'm typing this, though, so go download them now if you want to grab some for yourself! (Most stay up.)</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Remap Recommends</em> ‚Äì We've gotten off our regular rotation on these, but I want to bring them back, so look forward to this later this week.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>Wheel of GeForce Now</em> ‚Äì What do I have to do convince Rob to play two more hours of <em>MindsEye</em>? (I'm not going to do that. But I'm tempted.)</li><li><strong>ARTICLE:</strong> <em>Letter Series</em> ‚Äì I wonder if Rob has broken any bones?</li></ul><p><em>If you have any support issues, send details to </em><a href="https://remapradio.com/r/53613e2c?m=c2a53baa-518b-4385-90e8-62545232c3f6"><em><u>support@remapradio.com</u></em></a><em>.</em></p>
