It looks like an impressive evolution of the series coming off of the mixed reaction to <em>Doom Eternal</em>. </p><p><em>Wolfenstein I</em> and <em>II</em> are also very decent. I think the first has a better overall shooter campaign but the second features much bigger, better, and more interesting cinematic moments. The bundle will be on sale through early May and proceeds go to the nonprofit humanitarian organization Direct Relief. While you can pay as little as $28 to snag everything, the recommended contribution is $33. And don’t forget, you can toggle the split to give over 80 percent of your payment directly to the charity. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The <a href="https://zdcs.link/aoXBgv?object_uuid=b9cc7bee-1d27-44d0-9704-f24c20c00e6a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Elite Trainer Box is currently out of stock at Amazon</a>, which isn’t surprising considering the price hit a new high of $99.49 before it vanished.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This isn't third-party gouging either. That listing was sold and shipped by Amazon, which makes it even more frustrating. Normally, Amazon adds its listing alongside the third-party offers, but this time, the Booster Bundle is quietly tucked away under a separate product page. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You have to dig to find the ETBs sold by Amazon ($81.79), but in my opinion, if you're buying Journey Together packs right now, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/QKOLR3?object_uuid=b9cc7bee-1d27-44d0-9704-f24c20c00e6a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">booster bundle</a> is the right move. Better yet, grab two and get more booster packs than the ETB offers for less than it was priced at just days ago.</p></div><p id="cheap-journey-together-cards"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Cheap Journey Together Cards">Journey Together Single Card Price Crash</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Journey Together single card prices are settling down from their pre-restock panic, making this set very affordable to collect. Don't fancy spending money on packs for your chase cards? I've gathered them all right here so trainers can cherry pick what they need.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I opened 49 packs across all our preview products for my <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-preview">IGN Journey Together preview</a>, and pulled 18 rare cards. Compared to sets like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-review">Prismatic Evolutions</a>, feels downright generous. But it’s not just about quantity. The art and theme choices in Journey Together are incredible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ve got illustration rares with full-scene designs that feel like storybook pages, Secret Rares with actual competitive value, and Supporters that do more than just draw cards and pass the turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of my favorites include the Spiky Energy Hyper Rare, which adds reactive damage every time your Pokémon gets hit, and Iono’s Bellibolt ex, a Lightning-type engine that fuels itself with unlimited Energy. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also pulled N’s Reshiram and Articuno in gorgeous Illustration Rare formats — two cards that not only look great but bring real utility. Salamence ex is a heavy hitter with 300-damage potential, and Lillie’s Clefairy ex quietly punishes Dragon decks by giving them a surprise Psychic weakness. It’s not every day a booster pack feels like a mini narrative, but this set pulls it off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

<p>US preorders for the Nintendo Switch 2 console went live at Best Buy, Target, and Walmart at midnight Eastern time last night (though the rush of orders caused problems and delays across all three retailers' websites). The console listings came with a wave of other retail listings for games and accessories, and those listings either fill small gaps in our knowledge about Switch 2 game packaging and pricing or confirm facts that were previously implied.</p>
<p>First, $80 Switch 2 games like <em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>will not cost $90 as physical releases. This is worth repeating over and over again because of <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/no-switch-2-games-arent-90-the-internet-is-just-broken-beyond-belief/">how pernicious the rumors about $90 physical releases have been</a>; as recently as this morning, typing "Switch 2 $90" into Google would show you videos, Reddit threads, news posts, and even <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/googles-ai-overview-can-give-false-misleading-and-dangerous-answers/">Google's own AI summaries</a> all confidently and incorrectly proclaiming that physical Switch 2 releases will cost $90 when they actually won't.</p>

<p>While physical game releases in the EU <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1jpqsd6/the_physical_version_of_mario_kart_world_will_be/">sometimes cost more than their digital counterparts</a>, there was actually no indication that US releases of physical games would cost $90. The <em>Mario Kart World</em> website listed an $80 MSRP from the start, as did early retail listings that were published before preorders actually began, and this price didn't change when Nintendo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-raises-planned-switch-2-accessory-prices-amid-tariff-uncertainty/">increased accessory pricing</a> in response to import tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.</p>
<p>But now that actual order confirmation emails are going out, we can (even more) confidently say that Switch 2 physical releases cost the same amount as digital releases, just like original Switch games and most physical releases for other consoles. For example, the physical release for the upcoming <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is $70, also the same as the digital version.</p>
<p>Third-party releases run a wider pricing gamut, from as little as $40 (Square Enix's&nbsp;<em>Bravely Default</em> remaster) to as much as $100 (a special edition release of&nbsp;<em>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion</em>, also available at $70 for the standard release).</p>

<p>When preorders opened in Japan yesterday, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gematsu.com/post/3lniuq7ix4k25">all physical releases of third-party games</a> had Nintendo's Game-Key card disclaimer printed on them. And it looks like a whole lot of physical third-party Switch 2 game releases in the US will also be Game-Key cards, based on the box art accompanying the listings.</p>
<p>These have been controversial among physical media holdouts because they're not physical game releases in the traditional sense—they don't have any actual game data stored on them. When you insert them into a Switch 2, they allow you to download the game content from Nintendo's online store, but unlike a pure digital release, you'll still need to have the Game-Key card inserted every time you want to play the game.</p>

"If you're a fan of RoboCop, then you'll find a lot to love in Rogue City. It's chock full of Easter eggs and manages to capture the look and feel of the first two RoboCop movies with excellent attention to detail, even getting Peter Weller to reprise his role as the eponymous hero."</p>

                <p>A Minecraft Movie is doing big business in theaters, and now you can drink Minecraft milk, if that's something that sounds appealing to you.

The next set of cards coming to hit smartphone app <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> will be based around the Nintendo 3DS games Pokémon Sun and Moon. 
</p>
<p>
Celestial Guardians digital booster packs will launch in-game next week, on Wednesday 30th April, and feature the Hawaiian-inspired Alolan region's main Legendary Pokémon: Solgaleo and Lunala. 
</p>
<p>
Other cards in the set will include the region's trio of starter Pokémon: grass owl Rowlet, fire kitty Litten and goofy water seal Popplio. No one likes Popplio.

<p>
As ever, the new set will also launch with a digital binder cover and display board, should you wish to splash some further cash. 
</p>
<p>
Finally, fresh promo cards will also arrive next week, in  the shape of a couple of Rayquaza ex cards obtainable via missions.

It's been a month since Pokémon TCG Pocket's previous themed booster pack launched: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-next-booster-pack-adds-shiny-pokemon">Shining Revelry, which introduced Shiny Pokémon to the game</a>. Have you collected 'em all yet?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-removing-20-games-from-ps-plus-including-some-first-party-titles-just-after-the-latest-ps-plus-price-hike/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Over 20 games are being removed from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps-plus-extra-lost-48-of-player-count-in-july-2024/">PlayStation Plus Extra</a> and Premium games catalog, including some first-party PlayStation games that can only be played on PS5 through the PS Plus Classic's catalog.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/several-playstation-exclusives-are-leaving-ps-plus-on-playstation-5-soon/">VGC</a>, games like Resistance: Fall of Man and Resistance 2, which are only playable on PS5 through the PS Plus Premium Classic catalog, will be exiting the service. Infamous Second Son is the other first-party title that will also be exiting the service.</p>
<p>The rest of the list includes big titles like Grand Theft Auto V and Batman: Arkham Knight, along with indie hits like Ghostrunner and Enter the Gungeon. The full list is below.</p>
<ul>
<li>Grand Theft Auto V</li>
<li>MotoGP 24</li>
<li>The Sims 4 Island Living</li>
<li>Resistance Fall of Man</li>
<li>Resistance 2</li>
<li>Walkabout Mini Golf</li>
<li>Synth Riders</li>
<li>Ghostbusters: Rise of the Ghost Lord - Frozen Empire</li>
<li>Before Your Eyes</li>
<li>The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners</li>
<li>The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners - Retribution</li>
<li>LEGO Marvel Super Heroes 2</li>
<li>Stranded: Alien Dawn</li>
<li>The LEGO Movie 2 Video Game</li>
<li>Ghostrunner</li>
<li>Payday 2: Crimewave Edition</li>
<li>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night</li>
<li>Journey to the Savage Planet</li>
<li>Portal Knights</li>
<li>Enter the Gungeon</li>
<li>Batman Arkham Knight</li>
<li>Infamous Second Son</li>
</ul>
<p>Games are added and removed from subscription services like PS Plus all the time, but these removals especially sting as they recently follow the news of a price hike for all three tiers of PlayStation Plus in <a href="https://kotaku.com/sony-price-increase-ps-plus-canada-mexico-ps5-tariffs-1851776655">over 20 countries</a> around the world, including Canada, Australia, Mexico, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, South Korea, Colombia, and Chile, to name a few.</p>
<p>Removing games like the Resistance titles also feels especially egregious. The Resistance series is beloved by veteran PlayStation fans, many of whom feel like we should have had remasters of the whole series long ago. Short of having a working PS3 with copies of the games, once those games are removed from the service, there will be no legal way to play two games from a series that was once as important to PlayStation as Horizon or God of War is to them today.</p>
<p>If players can't access a full lineup of first-party games in these services, it won't be surprising when more players start to consider what they're actually paying for. Especially regarding the top level of PlayStation Plus's tiered service, since the classics library is what really separates PlayStation Plus Premium from the rest.</p>

In 2024, the most watched streamer list was dominated by the usual suspects: xQc, Kai Cenat, Pokimane, and HasanAbi to name a few.

After passing away without naming a successor between his twin sons, a civil war raged between the North, Logos and the South, Mythos – fighting for who would take control of the throne. The townsfolk lived in fear from the atrocities being carried out in the conflict.

Given that both Oblivion Remastered and Expedition 33 were day-one launch titles on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Game Pass</a>, some wondered if Expedition 33 might be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-couldnt-come-at-a-worse-time-for-some-games/1100-6531025/" data-ref-id="1100-6531025">overshadowed by Oblivion Remastered. </a></p><p>It remains to be seen what impact, if any, both games releasing on Game Pass so closely to each other might have. The Expedition 33 developers have also <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1915377120332677134" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reacted positively to Oblivion Remastered</a> and have noted how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/2025s-best-reviewed-game-can-exist-alongside-oblivion-remastered-clair-obscur-star-says/1100-6531070/" data-ref-id="1100-6531070">both games can successfully co-exist (of course)</a>.</p><p>Oblivion Remastered (Virtuos) and Expedition 33 (Sandfall Interactive) were developed by French studios, so the teams have that in common as well. </p><p>Expedition 33 is a turn-based RPG featuring characters played by people like The Lord of the Rings actor Andy Serkis, Daredevil's Charlie Cox, and Final Fantasy actor Ben Starr.

                <p dir="ltr">Blurry eyes and copious amounts of coffee are defining this Thursday morning for many Nintendo fans, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">preorders for the highly anticipated Nintendo Switch 2 console</a> went live last night at 12 AM ET at three major big box retailers--Best Buy*, Target, and Walmart. Almost instantly, social media feeds buzzed with jubilant success and bitter defeat, as Switch 2 listings changed from "coming soon" to "sold out."</p><p dir="ltr">Target and Walmart both opened their digital doors right at the announced 12 AM start time, and within seconds Target showed "sold out" warnings on listings for both the Switch 2 console itself and the Mario Kart World bundle. However, this turned out to be a false alarm, and while a few customers reported payment issues at the Target cart page, the big red retail chain emerged as the place most people were having early success--with the Target smartphone app proving particularly effective for some.</p><p dir="ltr">Some users had to effectively mash the "place order" button over and over again for Target's system to finally put the sale through, while others saw their payment methods and addresses disappear at the purchase screen. In a few extreme case, the attempt to purchase a preorder resulted in a fraud alert to their account, and a cancellation of the preorder.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4469805-street-fighter-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469805" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4469805-street-fighter-6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469805"></a><figcaption>Street Fighter 6</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4469805-street-fighter-6.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, Walmart's plan was to create a virtual queue for hopeful customers to file into, which at first seemed like the most efficient route. However, the virtual queue didn't assign anyone a number--at least not one they could <em>see</em>--and the experience turned into a "hurry up and wait" situation. The lines did eventually clear, with many saying that holding the line was bearing fruit, but the uncertainty proved stressful for most whether they succeeded or not.</p><p dir="ltr">Others, meanwhile, were unsuccessful in getting through the queue, and they had to open another tab to start the 10-minute purchase window. At that point, some found they were staring at the timer counting down as the system repeatedly failed to load to their cart. Some were left in the queue even after if had seemingly been disabled, while others were able to purchase a preorder while "skipping" the line. The Walmart listing still has a "preorder" button showing, but it does not indicate that it's sold out yet.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally there was Best Buy, which you may have noticed was marked with an asterisk above. This is because preorders here didn't begin at 12 AM as advertised; instead, they ended up going live nearly a half-hour later. Best Buy also used a virtual queue system, and it also did not designate a number to each customer's spot in line, so there was no way of knowing how close you were to checking out.</p><p dir="ltr">Best Buy is where I locked in for my preorder, and after the half-hour delay, I found myself in two different virtual queues; one on my browser, and one on my phone via the Best Buy app. After a full 50 minutes of waiting, the browser queue booted me back to an empty cart. Needless to say, I was not happy, but I still had the phone queue going… and going… and going.</p><p dir="ltr">I'd finally given up and was set to leave the line, when I noticed something: In the app, the Switch 2 listing I'd queued for said that "stock was unavailable for shipping" and "stock was unavailable for pickup," but I knew this wasn't true. So, at great risk of missing out on a preorder, I left the original queue, refreshed the page to ensure I could select my home store, and then reentered the queue.</p><p dir="ltr">Two minutes later--and that's not hyperbole, two literal minutes after reentry--I was verifying my account, and a preorder for the Switch 2 bundled with Mario Kart World was mine. One hour and 40 minutes from the advertised start time, victory was mine. Others who took the same approach weren't as fortunate, however.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4469767-mario-kart-world.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469767" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4469767-mario-kart-world.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4469767"></a><figcaption>Mario Kart World</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/3/37852/4469767-mario-kart-world.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you weren't so lucky in last night's preorder chaos, more Switch 2 preorders will be available at GameStop beginning at 8 AM PT or whenever you local store opens for business. Those interested can also sign up at the official Nintendo website for a chance to preorder the console directly from Nintendo, with invitations scheduled to begin on May 8. If you were able to land a preorder and are looking for some accessories, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-first-party-accessories-will-be-more-expensive-than-originally-announced/1100-6530965/" data-ref-id="1100-6530965">those can still be preordered</a> without much trouble.</p><p dir="ltr">The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5. Launch titles for Nintendo's latest console include Mario Kart World, enhanced versions of The Legend Of Zelda: Breath Of The Wild and Tears Of The Kingdom, Street Fighter 6, and Cyberpunk 2077.</p>

Now, a return-to-office policy is threatening to drive employees away from the company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns of 2020-2021, video game developers began adapting to the needs of a workforce that had spent a year learning how to make games in a remote environment. Some, like Swedish company Paradox Interactive, implemented "hybrid" schedules that offered developers flexibility in exchange for spending up to 3 days a week in the studio.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many developers at Paradox found this framework ideal. It allowed them to balance the costs of childcare and commuting while still seeing peers in-person for necessary work. But in late 2024, Paradox leadership informed employees they would wind down the hybrid work schedule, mandating they be in the office four days a week starting in February 2025, and a full five days a week by September 2025.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To get a sense of the overall reception following the policy’s rollout earlier this year, Game Developer spoke with five current and former developers from Paradox Interactive, who all requested anonymity for fear of retaliation. Those conversations, which took place over the last several months, suggest that the policy has proven to be unpopular within the company and has endured a "chaotic" rollout.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/discord-names-former-activision-blizzard-and-king-exec-as-its-new-ceo" target="_self" data-discover="true">Discord names former Activision Blizzard and King exec as its new CEO</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Deputy CEO Mattias Lilja confirmed the RTO plans in a response to a request for comment from Game Developer. He said the goal of the policy is to establish that working from the office "is now the expected default" and not "a matter of preference." Employees are expected to follow the in-office requirement "as a general rule," but flexibility will be offered to some workers due to "individual circumstances." Employees hired remotely from beyond Stockholm will not be required to move close to the office.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lilja stated that Paradox is prepared to alter the arrangement if Paradox sees "a clearly negative impact."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sources told Game Developer that "negative impact" is already here. According to a survey conducted by the worker's unions Unionen and SACO conducted after the call, over 50 percent of employees said they're considering looking for other jobs. And the sources we spoke with expressed say the talent-bleeding has already begun.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Paradox leadership initially said there was no RTO policy in the works">Paradox leadership initially said there was no RTO policy in the works</h2><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/nintendo-tells-customers-in-japan-to-expect-switch-2-hardware-shortage" target="_self" data-discover="true">Nintendo tells customers in Japan to expect Switch 2 hardware shortage at launch</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rumors of a return-to-office policy began circulating Paradox in November 2024.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As these rumors churned, representatives from worker's unions Unionen and SACO asked management if any return-to-office policy was being planned. According to info shared by those unions with Paradox employees via an open Slack channel, company management reportedly denied a return-to-office policy was in the works.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All that changed in December, when Paradox leadership internally announced that staff would be required to spend four days a week in the office starting in February 2025. Only then did the company enter consultation with the unions and the employee </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.av.se/en/work-environment-work-and-inspections/safety-representatives/">safety representatives</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> required under its collective bargaining agreement and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.government.se/government-policy/labour-law-and-work-environment/19771160-work-environment-act-arbetsmiljolagen/">Swedish law</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After the internal announcement, Paradox convened a town hall to address questions from Paradox staff, including those physically in the room and those who were attending the meeting remotely. In a recording of the call reviewed by Game Developer, he told employees that the decision "is not a vote," and that "we as a company need to find ways to work more productively."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Remote viewers in the call used emojis to signal their views on the policy, submitting positive "thumbs up" reactions in response to questions criticizing it, and "angry" reactions when Lilja defended the policy.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/devolver-cuts-40-percent-of-workforce-at-reigns-developer-nerial" target="_self" data-discover="true">Devolver cuts 40 percent of workforce at Reigns developer Nerial</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">During the Q&amp;A, employees challenged the policy, pressuring leadership to explain its motivation for the decision.

Lilja deflected the question, saying what worked for other companies doesn't automatically work for Paradox.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lilja and Paradox vice president of culture and engagement Paula Thelin attempted to solicit questions on other topics, but employees continued submitting questions challenging the RTO policy. The company offered to host a second town hall to further discuss the end of hybrid working. That second town hall never took place.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We quickly realized there would be a high volume of questions around specific cases and personal circumstances," Lilja said in response to our query about the canceled second town hall. "Despite our original intention of having a second meeting with the full company, we elected to answer the broadest questions and share further information through managers instead. This follow-up has already been completed as of early this year."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="54 percent of surveyed Paradox employees said they are considering leaving the company">54 percent of surveyed Paradox employees said they are considering leaving the company</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Paradox leadership seemed just as unconvinced by data on hybrid working from inside the company as it was from outside researchers. Unionen and SACO submitted a presentation of their survey results to the company (which gathered about 300 responses across multiple sub-studios), but this didn't seem to change the mind of management.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer obtained a copy of this presentation, which showed that a combined 54 percent of responding employees reported a return-to-office policy would make them consider leaving the company.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">34 percent of respondents said the policy would "likely" make them look for a new job, and 20 percent of responding employees stated they are "actively" looking for a new job. About 38 percent of respondents said the policy did not impact their commitment to the company, and only 2.5 percent said it "increased" their commitment to Paradox (the slides did not indicate what response the remaining 5.5 percent selected).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But for all the statistics the union provided, sources said the company offered little hard data in return, instead referring back to profits margins not just for the overall company, but for individual games and downloadable expansions. In the town hall, Lilja said there was not a "simple checklist" of variables the company was using to measure productivity, but did state that the cost/product curve of the company was a key metric.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to Game Developer, Lilja downplayed the emphasis on "productivity," first saying that "Direct interaction with one’s team leads to the best collaboration, which is absolutely essential to creating the complex, systems-driven games that Paradox is known for."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When asked if employees were specifically told that the policy was meant to improve productivity at the studio, Lilja said he "believes" that message was "communicated to employees." "Working in the office is intended to promote collaboration, which will in turn lead to more productivity, and downstream from that we will continue to see a sustainable and profitable company."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He said the company is not changing the policy due to any recent downturns or short-term profit results, saying claims that the policy is being implemented due concerns over profit margins "seem reductive."</span></p><p>Image via Paradox Interactive.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company was terse in its exchanges with the unions. According to a memo obtained by Game Developer containing the minutes of a required consultation meeting with Unionen and SACO, the unions presented the survey results as well as concerns from the safety representative about the physical work environment at Paradox headquarters. These concerns covered topics like ventilation, fire safety, temperature control, and noise level in the office.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The groups also expressed concern that the safety assessment only began after the policy was announced, potentially indicating risks from the assessment weren't taken into account in the decision to implement an RTO policy. They ultimately recommended that Paradox reverse this policy and return to the 3-day hybrid policy that had been the norm since the COVID-19 pandemic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company's official point of view, as expressed in the memo, boiled down to one sentence: "The company aims to implement this change to enhance team collaboration and culture, ultimately increasing overall performance." Under Swedish law, Paradox is not required to implement any recommendations made by the union.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Will RTO bolster Paradox’s 'collaboration', 'culture', and 'performance'?">Will RTO bolster Paradox’s 'collaboration', 'culture', and 'performance'?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lilja told Game Developer that feedback to the policy "has been mixed," but that the company still believes it will "lead to positive changes for Paradox in the long run." He added that Paradox is "moving forward with planning," and has used "vital feedback from employees, Unionen, and SACO to ensure the policy is flexible where needed."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's difficult to find evidence implying productivity at Paradox suffered due to the hybrid work policy. Paradox's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/investors/financial-reports?numItems=72">public financial results</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> don't draw a direct line between hybrid working and change in operating profit. During the 6-year period from 2018-2024, its year-end reports stated that annual operating profit spiked 34 percent in 2020 and 189 percent in 2022 (at the time CEO Fredrik Wester </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/investors/financial-reports/year-end-report-january-december-2022">attributed the gain partly due to the "weakness" of the Swedish krona</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">), and grew a modest 10 percent in 2024.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over the course of those 6 years, the company saw big wins with the release of games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crusader Kings III,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Victoria 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but also the underperformance of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/the-rushed-attempt-to-rehabilitate-cities-skylines-ii-is-becoming-a-cautionary-tale">Cities Skylines II</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/paradox-writes-off-i-the-lamplighters-league-i-as-commercial-failure">the write-down-grade losses</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on Harebrained Schemes' </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Lamplighters League,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/paradox-scraps-unannounced-projects-to-sharpen-production-pipeline">the development reset on </a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/paradox-scraps-unannounced-projects-to-sharpen-production-pipeline">Vampire The Masquerade II: Bloodlines</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.

The company reported that the latter closure </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/life-by-you-cancellation-tanks-paradox-operating-profit">deeply harmed its operating profit</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in its June 2024 interim financial report.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All the employees we spoke with expressed frustration over the emphasis on productivity. Direct costs did steadily increase during this time period—but the canceled projects, underperforming games, and studio closures had a greater impact on the company's profits. Each year it saw declines in profits was accompanied either by public backlash to the quality of its releases (like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cities Skylines 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">) or a studio closure. These events represent massive amounts of revenue the company had projected not being realized.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With such dramatic events impacting Paradox's balance sheet, it's easy to see why employees might feel like individual productivity boosts won't do much to move the needle. "What incentive do we actually have to be more performant now?," one current employee said to Game Developer. "If we were to be more performant, that would only prove this naive and unfounded theory right."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"If we're less performant...best case [we] would prove this theory wrong and in worst case might lose our job, in this economy. Great."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Game developers grow frustrated with return-to-office mandates">Game developers grow frustrated with return-to-office mandates</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We do things we think is best, we won't do otherwise," Lilja said during the back-and-forth with employees in the December 2024 town hall. "If you feel strongly against that, you need to look in the mirror and decide if this is the right place [for you]."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These words echo those of other game industry employers like Activision Blizzard, Rockstar Games, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ubisoft-is-calling-devs-back-into-the-office-for-three-days-a-week">Ubisoft</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which have also taken tough lines on mandating a return to in-person game development. But with companies laying off employees over the last three years at unprecedented rates, those who simply quit may struggle to find new employment.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One source told Game Developer that departures may increase after the summer of 2025, when employees receive their profit-sharing payout and everyone comes back from their summer vacation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile smaller studios like Bloober Team </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/cronos-the-new-dawn-devs-say-remote-work-made-its-unique-combat-possible">have continued to accommodate remote and hybrid work</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, demonstrating the viability of flexible employment even on years-long development projects.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Multiple sources told us rumors are still swirling of key employees being offered exemptions to the return-to-office policy in order to prevent their departures. Liljas denied that this is taking place, saying "we don't view this in terms of 'key employees' so much as what lengths are required to fill certain positions." He added that this has "always been the case for Paradox."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's worry that if enough senior employees decide to leave anyway, the quality of Paradox releases could decline, impacting the productivity that Paradox leadership hoped to improve. Liljas said that it will take about 12-18 months to evaluate the effectiveness of the RTO policy. "It is easy to point to short term changes to one’s individual schedule as obviously negative, and I understand it requires a show of faith to trust that this will be seen as a positive change in the future—but steering Paradox in the long term is my job, and I want to earn our team’s trust to do just that."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For now, the game development community can only watch as Paradox puts its theory to the test. If profit margins on upcoming games and expansions do increase—even if a number of key employees exit the company—than it bolsters the argument that forcing workers back into the office boosted productivity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But if its profit margins stagnate or decline and key senior employees and leaders decide to leave, Paradox—and the video game industry—may have to face the fact that forcing people into a building does not automatically improve the process of game development.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>RoboCop: Rogue City's standalone expansion - known as Unfinished Business - has landed itself a release date.</p>
<p>It'll launch across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3527760/RoboCop_Rogue_City__Unfinished_Business/">Steam</a> on 17th July, the team announced today.</p>
<p>The expansion begins where Rogue City left off, although developer Teyon promises you won't need to have played Rogue City to still enjoy Unfinished Business.</p>

</figure>
<p>"While RoboCop continues policing the streets, OCP are working on a new project, the OmniTower, a housing complex designed for the residents evicted from their homes as the corporation proceeds to make way for Delta City," reads Unfinished Business' official blurb.</p>
<p>"A group of mercenaries tears into the Metro West precinct, leaving after stealing components from RoboCop's medical chair. Their next target, the OmniTower. The tower can serve as a potential power source, which, combined with those stolen components, would give the mercenaries access to all OCP's technology, including RoboCop.Pulling off this plan will take time, so they've seized control of the tower, turning each floor into a dangerous maze of enemies, traps, and bullets that you'll have to contend with if you want to retain control of yourself."</p>
<p>The team warns that as players ascend the tower, though, "ghosts" from Alex Murphy's past will come back to haunt him. You see, one of those mercenaries - in fact, their leader - used to be a colleague of Murphy's, so there is a personal connection here. And, while their goal of protecting Old Detroit may be the same, "their motives differ". Ooh!</p>
<p>As <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/24/robocop-rogue-city-unfinished-business-coming-to-ps5-july-17/">per a PlayStation Blog post</a>, there will be a flashback sequence for players to work through on the expansion's release. Meanwhile, along with RoboCop and Alex Murphy, there will also be the chance to play as former OCP scientist Miranda Hale. </p>

			<p>Exo is just a simple courier at the start of TRON: Catalyst, running through the city and delivering packages as quickly and efficiently as possible. But then one of them explodes, and she wakes up in an interrogation cell being accused of not only terrorism, but something much more troubling for the very fabric of the Arq Grid’s digital reality.</p>
<p><iframe title="TRON: Catalyst Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AQQEnuaNhdw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Tron Catalyst sees Mike Bithell and his studio returning to this world and continuing their offshoot narrative branch that was started in Tron: Identity. If you’ve played that game, a detective-style visual novel, there are characters and story beats that will be familiar to you, though it doesn’t feel necessary to quickly grasp what’s happening in the world.</p>


<p>The focus early on is on Exo’s plight. With her interrogator Conn unable to get the answer he wants out of her, he sends her down to the arena to fight for her survival… but here’s where the main hook of Tron: Catalyst comes into play. Exo is thoroughly unprepared to fight, but luckily has the ability to trigger a glitch that rewinds time back to the start of a loop. Right back to that interrogation with Conn.</p>
<p>Now she knows what’s coming, she can instead head off to train before fighting, learning the basics of hitting things with melee and thrown Disc attacks, dodging and countering. On the standard difficulty, you can initially just mash your way through enemies in this tutorial prologue, but there’s later enemies, more hulking figures with sweeping hammers and thrown explosives, that start to need more care and skill to overcome.</p>

<p>Looping around in this prison arena, the story guides you through breaking out of the prisoner zone, tweaking the loop in a Dark Souls-y way both by Exo having gained knowledge, and through unlocked permissions, doors and ladders persisting between loops.</p>

<p>But the game as a whole does not play out within a single loop that you need to manipulate. This prologue concludes as you break out of jail by crashing a Light Cycle through the wall and make it back out into the city, starting a new loop which you can, once again, use to your advantage. Obviously, the Grid’s forces are on high alert for you, checking Identity Discs for past misdeeds at various checkpoints, forcing you to fight your way through to meet a contact that won’t remember your interactions from previous loops. It’s only by getting this wiped or cleaned up that you’ll have full access to the city and start to piece together how tentatively balanced this world is.</p>
<p>There’s already been talk of the glitches occurring in the Outlands, while the Automata are establishing an embassy, bringing flowing, curved architecture and a more individualistic philosophy that will clash with the structure and order that the Arq Grid demands. You can sense that it could all go a bit wrong in a heartbeat –&nbsp;which is probably a really, really long time for these Programs –&nbsp;though how much freedom you have within this narrative wasn’t there to see within the opening two chapters of the game.</p>

<p>Tron: Catalyst plays out entirely from a fixed isometric view point. It really pops from the screen with the neon lights running throughout the world, around everyone’s bodies in blue, orange and more individualistic colours. There’s a gloss and sheen to the streets of the city, doused by digital rain, in a way that absolutely feels becoming of the revitalised Tron film franchise, and it’s accompanied by another soundtrack from Dan Le Sac, who composed for Tron: Identity.</p>
<p>One minor disappointment is that, for conversations that switch to full screen character portraits with voice acting, these are static (outside of some shifting lights) and often unchanging. Hopefully there’s more variety through the game as you meet more people.</p>

<p>Tron: Catalyst is shaping up rather nicely, expanding this classic sci-fi world once more, and with an intriguing glitched time loop at its core. We look forward to decoding it in just under two months, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/25/tron-catalyst-gets-a-june-release-date-and-a-new-trailer/">the full release of Tron: Catalyst set for 17th June</a>.</p>

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month?&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been playing, reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h3 id="patrick-recommends-the-rehersal">Patrick Recommends: <em>The Rehersal</em>*</h3><figure><figcaption><span>Well.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Should you recommend people watch something that you found, at times, morally reprehensible? I was as huge fan of comedian Nathan Fielder's Showtime show, <em>The Curse</em>, but somehow dodged <em>Nathan For You</em>. Fielder's absurdist, reality-bending company seems right up my alley, and yet, I'd somehow gone large unexposed. But in preparing for the second season of <em>The Rehearsal</em>, I ended up watching the first season of <em>The Rehearsal</em>, almost by accident. I'd intended to catch an episode or two to capture the tone, not shotgun the whole thing. But in short order, I was utterly captivated by Fielder's straight faced ridiculousness, mixed with the show's earnest tone. Plus, it was funny to watch someone blow millions of dollars now what often amounted to very silly bits. That's good TV.</p><p><strong>Mild spoilers for <em>The Rehearsal</em> to follow, but I'll avoid specifics. </strong></p><p>The show presents itself as a journey in helping people work through a problem by staging how it <em>might </em>happen before it <em>does</em> happen, aka the "rehearsal." That's a compelling pitch, and the first episode is straight up a masterclass in walking the show's weird tone. It's probably a masterpiece. But as it goes on, the spotlight shits from Fielder's subjects to Fielder himself, but part of Fielder's trick is you cannot tell if he's playing a character. He's an unreliable narrator. OK, fine. But when this combines with an ongoing, elongated storyline about preparing to become a parent ends up involving putting a number of young children in situations where they could—and do—become emotionally confused, I was out on the show. I nearly threw my remote at the TV at one point in disgust over an arc related to this topic.</p><p>Like I said, morally reprehensible. Lotta blame to go around, not just Fielder. And it's obvious true my role as a parent played a big, potentially irrational, part of my reaction. Nonetheless. I cannot say it wasn't captivating television, though, which leaves me in a mixed place as a recommendation. It got me to ask a lot of questions, I'm just not sure if they were the questions the show wanted me to ask.</p><hr><h3 id="rob-recommends-the-studio">Rob Recommends: <em>The Studio</em></h3><figure><figcaption><span>Rogen doesn't always work, but he works here.</span></figcaption></figure><p>I'm a sucker for insider-y Hollywood satires. <em>The Player </em>hit me like a lightning bolt when I first saw it as a kid, and I've loved the genre ever since, for all its self-indulgence and self-congratulation masked as critique. With that background, I knew I'd at least check out Seth Rogen's AppleTV series. I did <em>not </em>expect it to have some of the best filmmaking I've seen all year.</p><p>The pitch on <em>The Studio </em>is pretty conventional: Seth Rogen is a Hollywood exec named Matt whose boss and mentor is fired as the head of the studio and he takes her place with dreams of making the kinds of great, commercial art he grew up on. The chalice is poisoned, however, because to get the job he has to sign on to produce the kind of vapid, brand-driven garbage that he thinks has ruined the movie business. Our hero is proven to be no hero at all, a bit too gutless to stand up for his beliefs when it matters, and a bit too clueless to actually navigate the job he's been elevated to. There is a lot of <em>Curb Your Enthusiasm </em>in <em>The Studio</em>, though mercifully it's less excruciating if you find the awkward secondhand embarrassment of that series tough to endure. <em>The Studio </em>keeps things moving, within and between episodes.</p><p>One way it does that is by using long takes. I am not sure it ever shoots a scene as anything other than a single continuous shot, a "oner" in film parlance and the name of <em>The Studio's </em>instantly classic second episode. Matt's love of the movie business and fanboyish awe at oners leads him to crash the set of a movie where Sarah Polley is shooting a critical single-shot scene at magic hour in the hills above LA. Across twenty-five minutes with no evident cuts (the episode even has Polley spit at the idea of using <em>1917</em>-style whip-pans to disguise cuts instead of doing a true oner), Matt wreaks well-meaning havoc on the production. </p><p>The shooting style makes ever scene jangle with nervous, frantic energy, but also calls attention to the absolutely gorgeous locations and lighting that <em>The Studio </em>uses throughout. With a warm, sepia-tint to the colors emphasized by costumes and the mid-century furniture and architecture that the series showcases, it feels like a movie about the present day glimpsed through the lens of the 1970s. It's funny and awkward and stupid but it's beautiful, too.</p><hr><h3 id="chia-recommends-netrunner">Chia Recommends: <em>Netrunner</em></h3><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of Null Signal Games.</span></figcaption></figure><p>I know, I know. “But Chia,” you say, “you’re always recommending <em>Netrunner</em>! What makes this week any different?” Well, it turns out I have a very good reason to make <em>Netrunner</em> my recommendation this week: Null Signal Games are releasing new cards! <a href="https://nullsignal.games/blog/welcome-to-elevation/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>Elevation</em></a> is the newest set and will make up the second half of the “core sets” for <em>Netrunner</em>, and at the same time all of the old Fantasy Flight Games cards are rotating out of Standard play.</p><p>This marks a huge change in the card pool for Standard, since 2018 this is the first time that <a href="https://nullsignal.games/blog/everything-you-need-to-know-about-elevation/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">all the sets in Standard are actively purchasable from NSG</a>. I’m biased as a person who started playing well after the last FFG cards were printed, but it really feels like Null Signal Games has done a phenomenal job of making interesting new cards while avoiding a bit of the power creep that plagued some of the later sets during the FFG run.&nbsp; And from what we’ve seen of <em>Elevation</em> so far, they’re showing no signs of slowing down.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image courtesy of Null Signal Games.</span></figcaption></figure><p>For the uninitiated: <em>Netrunner</em> is an asymmetric 1v1 card game that has one player taking the role of the Corp, building servers and trying your best to advance your nefarious agendas, and the Runner, who is hacking into those servers and trying their best to find and expose those agendas. The corporation plays all of their cards face down so hidden information plays a huge role in the game. The game has an action based structure, each player has an allotted amount of clicks (4 for the runner, 3 for the corp) that you use to do basic actions (like draw, gain money, or play cards). This system means that you’ve got more ways to mitigate the inherent randomness of card games and feels like Richard Garfield’s response to mana-flood (yes, the original 1996 release was made by the same guy that made Magic!)</p><p>The new set showcases so many reasons I have loved this game, and even more importantly, why I love the broader netrunner community. Not only is the game mechanically spectacular, but NSG really goes the extra mile when considering inclusivity and representation. There are many queer members of NSG and their input shows in so many ways. <em>Elevation</em> is set in a futuristic version of Borneo, in Kalimantan, and includes many new Identities, the cards that you essentially play as and build your deck around, and in them you see a breadth of people. <a href="https://nullsignal.games/blog/introducing-the-new-card-frames-in-elevation/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">These identity cards include pronouns for the different runners</a>, and on the back you get a story blurb for each.</p><figure></figure><p>This seems like a small, perhaps forgettable inclusion, but I think the fact that it’s 2025 and <em>Netrunner</em> is one of the only card games out there with queer people front and center that also forefronts that queerness on the card itself and not just in side stories feels like a damn shame. And the fact that the response from the community to this inclusion was resoundingly positive in a world where those identities are being put more and more under threat every day makes me feel welcome in a way that I can’t say of other gaming communities.&nbsp;</p><p>If you haven’t checked it out, I wholeheartedly suggest you take a peek at <em>Netrunner</em>. Start with <em>System Gateway,</em> and then the newest set <em>Elevation</em>. Join this growing community of people playing one of the best god damn card games I’ve ever played!</p>

                <p>In 2023, IO Interactive co-founder Janos Flösser started a new studio, Wombo Games, alongside veteran developers who previously worked on Tomb Raider, Hitman, Deus Ex, and Just Cause. Now, Wombo Games is sharing an early look at the company's first game, Raiders of Blackveil, a roguelite action-RPG.</p><p>Raiders of Blackveil has single-player and co-op options for up to three players. The main characters in the game are humanoid animals who live on "a dystopian industrial fantasy world" where the human-controlled Blackveil corporation has forced them into servitude. That's why the animals are launching an armed rebellion against Blackveil to reclaim their freedom and their world.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481923-raidersofblackveil2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481923" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481923-raidersofblackveil2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481923"></a><figcaption>An early screenshot from Raiders of Blackveil.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481923-raidersofblackveil2.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481924-raidersofblackveil3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481925-raidersofblackveil4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481926-raidersofblackveil5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481927-raidersofblackveil6.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481924,1300-4481925,1300-4481926,1300-4481927" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4481924-raidersofblackveil3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4481925-raidersofblackveil4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4481926-raidersofblackveil5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1837/18375603/4481927-raidersofblackveil6.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481924-raidersofblackveil3.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481925-raidersofblackveil4.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481926-raidersofblackveil5.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4481927-raidersofblackveil6.jpg"></figure><p>According to Wombo Games, Raiders of Blackveil will be a deeply strategic game that blends "MOBA-inspired champions, RPG-style loot, and PVE extraction gameplay." The game is currently available to wishlist on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3352240/Raiders_of_Blackveil/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>.</p><p>"Wombo Games has been developing Raiders of Blackveil for nearly two years so it's surreal to finally be able to announce it, and Wombo Games, to the world," said Flösser in a statement. "Raiders of Blackveil is our first title so it's very special to us. It is a blueprint of our studio because every person at Wombo has contributed directly to its development. At Wombo, we make decisions by consensus, and plan to continue that with feedback from our players once we launch in early access later this year."</p><p>Early access for Raiders of Blackveil is expected to launch this summer.</p>

The events of the story focused heavily on what the player chose to do, and how they reacted to the consequences of those choices. It was a novel--pardon the pun--approach to Tron, and one that, while not perfect, was effective in expanding the lore of the world.</p><p dir="ltr">This year, Bithell Games will bring us back into its version of the Tron universe in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/disney-tron-catalyst/" data-ref-id="5000-647165">Tron: Catalyst</a>, a follow-up to Identity's story with a new set of characters and an entirely new approach. The visual novel format is gone, replaced with an isometric action-oriented format that gives the player more direct engagement with the world. The shift is a gamble, but based on my experience with the first 90 minutes of the game, it's one that has enough promise that it might pay off in the end.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Disney TRON Catalyst Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr">A new identity</h2><p dir="ltr">Those who played Tron: Identity may have a set of expectations with Catalyst, but as mentioned above, those expectations need to be derezzed. Catalyst is a vastly different experience, one that encourages exploration and direct combat over heavy dialogue and puzzle-solving. Where Identity felt more like an Ace Attorney style of game, Catalyst gives the same vibes as Supergiant's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades/" data-ref-id="5000-490217">Hades</a> or, perhaps more accurately given the similar setting, Neon Giant's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-ascent/" data-ref-id="5000-511894">The Ascent</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Catalyst's heroine, Exo, must explore parts of the city either on foot or riding the series' iconic Light Cycle--the latter of which she can summon at will. Her travels will match her against members of The Core, the neon-orange-tinged aggressors trying to maintain control of the Arq Grid. Fighting them, on the surface, seems simplistic: Exo can swing her disc for a three-hit combo by tapping the attack button, she can charge up a powerful melee attack by holding the attack button down, and she can defend herself through dodges and timed parry abilities.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4481609-ss_041e01d73a92dddefccd6205dc17dee3728d89e5.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481609" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4481609-ss_041e01d73a92dddefccd6205dc17dee3728d89e5.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481609"></a><figcaption>Why walk when you can Light Cycle?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4481609-ss_041e01d73a92dddefccd6205dc17dee3728d89e5.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">By aiming with the right stick and pressing the throw button, Exo will throw her disc in an enemy's direction, where it will damage them before returning to her. She can ricochet the disc off of walls to try and hit an enemy from behind--which deals more damage--and eventually, she can immediately kick the disc back at a group of enemies when it returns to her for a quick disc throw combo.</p><p dir="ltr">Mastering the disc throw mechanic is going to be the key to success in Catalyst's combat, but it's worth it; landing a hit after choosing the right angle with a disc throw is incredibly satisfying, especially if the enemy is at low health and the hit takes them out. Normal melee attacks are fine, if uninteresting, but coupling them with disc throws makes fighting the Core enemies much more unique.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Thrown through a loop</h2><p dir="ltr">The new focus on action does not mean dialogue has been completely removed, however. Catalyst will still feature back-and-forth dialogue with key characters throughout the game, and choices will still need to be made. However, this time, the branching dialogue is an element in Tron: Catalyst's most intriguing element: Restart.</p><p dir="ltr">If Exo hits a dead end, Catalyst gives her the ability to "restart" the mission she's currently in, while retaining all of the information she's received thus far. While this does technically negate any progress made, it does allow you to approach the mission with a fresh perspective. Maybe the first time through a level, you turned left down a hallway, so this time you know that you should go right. Or, the first time you spoke to a character, you chose one dialogue option and didn't like the outcome, and now you can choose the other.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4481610-ss_7a8ad0230d13a3549b5779f4118eed43a02bc0ca.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481610" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4481610-ss_7a8ad0230d13a3549b5779f4118eed43a02bc0ca.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481610"></a><figcaption>Catalyst adopts an isometric view.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4481610-ss_7a8ad0230d13a3549b5779f4118eed43a02bc0ca.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Both chapters that were available in the preview build made heavy use of the Restart mechanic, showing off its full potential rather quickly. In one mission, I alerted the Core to my presence in the first conversation I had, so I had to continuously fight them off as I made progress in the story. However, just before I hit a dead end, a character gave me the ability to shield important data on Exo's disc from scans, meaning that when I restarted the loop and approached the NPC again, I was able to move freely and no one was alerted.</p><p dir="ltr">This looping mechanic is very neat, as it allows you to fully explore a level with fresh eyes as it seamlessly transitions back to the beginning of the area. What's more, if your main mission requires you to restart the loop, the game does not hesitate to tell you--this is important, as it removes the possibility of you aimlessly wandering around the city wondering what to do before realizing you have to restart. It's easy to get lost in this neon-soaked urban paradise, so the friendly reminder is appreciated.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4481611-ss_495fd7bff55fdb939d2ac55f22eeb965b99dfe92.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481611" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4481611-ss_495fd7bff55fdb939d2ac55f22eeb965b99dfe92.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4481611"></a><figcaption>Aspects of Identity's visual novel format are maintained in this sequel.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4481611-ss_495fd7bff55fdb939d2ac55f22eeb965b99dfe92.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Tron: Catalyst preview build only lasted about 90 minutes, but that's all the time it needed to make a powerful first impression. Some may have been dismayed by Bithell Games's choice to move away from the interactive novel approach of Tron: Identity in favor of an action-based format, but in the short time I spent with Catalyst, that shift seems to be paying off greatly. The looping mechanic is unique and interesting, and combat does just enough to be fun thanks to the strategic element of disc throwing. The dialogue elements aren't as robust, but they serve as an imaginative way to inform future loops in a given level.</p><p dir="ltr">Bithell Games' previous Tron game seems like the studio finding its Identity in this universe; this new entry is shaping up to be the Catalyst for a new flagship franchise for the studio.</p><p dir="ltr">Tron: Catalyst is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, Switch, and PC on June 17.</p>

			<p>The co-founder of <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-wants-to-create-a-007-gaming-franchise-will-publish-mindseye-from-rocket-boy/">IO Interactive</a> and former chief creative officer at Square Enix,&nbsp; <strong><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">Janos Flösser, </span></strong>has started a new studio based in Copenhagen called <a href="https://www.wombogames.com/">Wombo Games</a>. Alongside the new studio announcement, Flösser has also announced the studio's debut project, a new roguge-lite called <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3352240/Raiders_of_Blackveil/">Raiders of Blackveil</a>.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Raiders of Blackveil is currently set to arrive on Steam in Early Access sometime this summer, and is described as an "<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">action-packed</span></em> <em>rogue-lite</em>" that looks to "<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">blend MOBA-inspired champions, RPG-style loot and PVE extraction gameplay to create a deeply strategic game filled with challenging, fun encounters that can be experienced alone or with friends</span></em>," according to a press release.</p>
<p>The setting is a dystopian fantasy world where you'll fight against an evil corporation run by humans named Blackveil. The human part is important because you're part of an animal rebellion against Blackveil, and either on your own or alongside two other animal friends in groups of three, you'll raid and plunder Blackveil in the fight to end the corporation's evil dominance.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Flösser describes Wombo Games as a mixture of industry veterans who have worked on games like Hitman, Tomb Raider, and Deus Ex, paired with young, talented developers looking to make their mark on the video game industry.</p>
<p><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">"<em>Wombo Games has been developing Raiders of Blackveil for nearly two years so it's surreal to finally be able to announce it, and Wombo Games, to the world,</em></span>" said Flösser. "<span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody"><em>Raiders of Blackveil is our first title so it's very special to us. It is a blueprint of our studio because every person at Wombo has contributed directly to its development. At Wombo, we make decisions by consensus, and plan to continue that with feedback from our players once we launch in early access later this year...</em>"</span></p>

<figure></figure>


<p>With summer just around the corner, hopefully we'll hear more about Raiders of Blackveil soon.</p>
