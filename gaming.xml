            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/abiotic-factor-update-dynamic-difficulty-more<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>update has been released, and this one's focused on bringing improvements and features the community has been requesting.</p>

<p>Community Update #1, as it's snappily being referred to, brings a number of features the&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>player base has been asking for, including some difficulty tweaks, a new save backup system, and more.</p>

<p>First up, some behind-the-scenes dynamic difficulty tweaks have been made to&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>for solo and co-op scientists, and though the changes are small, developer Deep Field Games says they should "have a large effect on combat pacing in general".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/abiotic-factor-update-community-difficulty.jpg?itok=Topv7J2V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/abiotic-factor-update-community-difficulty.jpg?itok=mzM_pCy8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Combat difficulty should have been tweaked for the better in the latest&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>update.</figcaption></figure><p>A new save backup system has also been introduced, and it should help if you've found your&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>world being corrupted (beyond the aliens-trying-to-murder-you corruption, which is totally normal).</p>

<p>The game will now keep up to five backups just in case something terrible happens to your world, and if a problem is detected,&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>will ask if you'd like to use a backup instead. This system works for dedicated servers, too.</p>

<p>Improvements have been made to Repair Benches, too; they'll now pull ingredients from nearby storage if a bench has the Item Transporter function, and a number of other, smaller improvements have been made as well.</p>

<p>You can now paint your Cement Bag Walls, so you can make them look like a giant game of&nbsp;<em>Breakout&nbsp;</em>if you like, and small storage crates can also be painted.</p>

Well, now you can!</figcaption></figure><p>This&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>Community Update has a ton of other small changes and tweaks that should all go together to make your gameplay experience smoother. You can check out <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/427410/discussions/7/4331978422249478585/?snr=1_2108_9__2107" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the full patch notes here</a>.</p>

<p><em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>is a survival-crafter set in an underground research facility where something has gone very awry. You - and, optionally, your friends - must carve out a life for yourself by scavenging for resources, navigating the facility, and avoiding being killed.</p>

<p>The game has managed to pick up an audience for itself; within its first couple of weeks on sale, it managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/abiotic-factor-sales-250k">rack up around 250,000 sales</a>, no mean feat for a game that's entering a pretty crowded market.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427410/Abiotic_Factor/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/23780463/bread-and-fred-where-to-play-tiktok-multiplayer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="SguPqV"><em>Bread and Fred is </em><a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/bread-and-fred-switch/"><em>now available on Nintendo Switch</em></a><em> — a great platform for its special brand of co-op play. We’re re-publishing this story for the added console release.</em></p>
<p id="gctezw">In <em>Bread &amp; Fred</em>, you’re tied to another penguin by a very short rope, and you’ll need some serious teamwork to make the climb. So, Ana and I (Nicole) are taking on our impressions together, as a team. Think of this story as the rope tying us together to bring you our thoughts on the game’s chaotic platforming. We’re each writing a paragraph and then letting the other take over; Ana’s paragraphs will be in italics. </p>
<hr id="aDv6D4">
<p id="HxmXfD"><em>Bread &amp; Fred</em> was released in May by a three-person indie team called SandCastles Studio, and it has been hugely popular on TikTok since. It’s a game that’s perfect for the internet in the same ways <em>Fall Guys</em> or <em>Overcooked</em> are: It requires skill, but even the worst players are rewarded with slapstick animations of squished penguins and hilarious falls.</p>
<p id="8xGdXD"><em>I can only take a step or two until the rope goes taught, and I’m stuck in place until my partner makes progress on their end. Actions like basic jumps to a nearby platform require a level of coordination sometimes hindered by stream latency and potential lag in voice chat. My partner and I stay in constant communication. All of this just so that we can climb a few measly meters. </em></p>

<p id="xjbQOb">It’s hard. The platforming looks relatively simple, but deceptively so. What looks to be simply jumping over gaps is made complicated by the short rope. Thankfully, <em>Bread &amp; Fred</em> does have several options to make the game more approachable — one crucial example is a checkpoint system that you can turn on in the options menu. It allows you to put a flag in the ground, which acts as a spawn point if you make one disastrous fall. (We made plenty of those as we started our journey up the mountain.) <em>Bread &amp; Fred</em> also has a handy in-game countdown timer, too, which became essential for precise, coordinated leaps, but we developed our own system for areas that required one of us to anchor on a platform while the other swung wildly to get enough force to fling both penguins to the next step.</p>
<p id="DHPuBq"><em>We don’t ascend the mountain very quickly, but the game slowly begins to click. We move in sync, and eventually, each of our penguins looks like a veritable shadow of the other. After dozens of tries, we make an extra-long jump that requires precise timing both on the part of the anchor penguin and the swinging penguin. (No one gets to slack off on this climb!) We use these swinging physics to fling us both to a cave wall. I hold on to the wall while my penguin partner swings to the other side. After completing an extensive series of difficult jumps, our penguins give each other a thumbs-up, and we proudly put a flag in the ground to mark our progress. </em></p>

<p id="tKb5uz">It’s super satisfying to get to those points and to celebrate, but <em>Bread &amp; Fred</em> is almost even more fun to watch someone else play — you get to luxuriate in someone else’s mistakes. This is where its popularity on TikTok and other social media platforms comes in; you get <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8e3ggwf/">all of the goofs</a> and none of the face-first falling. People like to joke about the game ruining friendships, something akin to Mario Party. That sort of engagement is a big part of the fun of it all, watching or playing, creating moments where you can poke fun at your friends and celebrate your big wins.</p>
<p id="jAA1Jf"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1607680/Bread__Fred/"><em>Bread &amp; Fred</em></a> is available to play on Windows PC via Steam. It’s got online multiplayer and remote play, as well as a single-player mode.</p>

  <p id="LqBb5N"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23777236/dave-the-diver-review-management-sim-steam-pc"><em>Dave the Diver</em></a>, the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23648669/best-video-games-2023">weird and wonderful</a> fishing and restaurant management game from 2023, has new <em>Godzilla</em> downloadable content out today: Godzilla is invading the Blue Hole. Yes, the kaiju Godzilla, all teeth and fire. It’s a free DLC pack for people that already own <em>Dave the Diver</em> on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dave-the-diver-godzilla-content-pack-70050000049100-switch/">Nintendo Switch</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP8236-PPSA19115_00-0215443120330132">PlayStation 5</a>, or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2841140/DAVE_THE_DIVER__Godzilla_Content_Pack/#app_reviews_hash">Windows PC via Steam</a>. The only catch is that you’re only able to download it until Nov. 23 — a six month period.</p>
<p id="CtXAR5">Why? That’s not entirely clear, but my best guess is that it’s due to the licensing of the big monster. (We’ve reached out to developer Mintrocket for clarification.) But as long as you download it before then, you’re good.</p>
<p id="CLeFx1">The Godzilla DLC brings both Godzilla and an original Kaiju — a big lobster — to <em>Dave the Diver</em>. You’ll at least fight the lobster kaiju, Ebirah, in a submarine-based battle. And yes, Godzilla and Ebirah will fight. It looks to be a short, but engaged addition much like the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-awards-tga/23992943/dredge-dave-the-diver-crossover-2023"><em>Dredge</em> crossover</a> content that was released in December last year. (<em>Dredge</em>, like <em>Dave the Diver</em>, is a fishing game from 2023, but <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23669611/dredge-review-fishing-game-horror">with a grotesque, spooky spin</a>. The <em>Dredge</em> DLC in <em>Dave the Diver</em> added a bunch of <em>Dredge</em>’s weird fish.) Beyond the lobster battle, you’ll also be able to find monster figures hidden throughout the Blue Hole.</p>
<p id="MsJVJ4">If you haven’t already tried <em>Dave the Diver</em>, you should. It’s so much more than just a fishing game and restaurant management sim: The deeper you go, the larger the secrets. Last year, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23648669/best-video-games-2023">it earned the 12th spot on our games of the year list</a>.</p>

  <p id="goJFhR">Netflix’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22352984/netflix-new-anime-release-date-yasuke-way-househusband-ragnarok">continued investment in anime</a> has yielded fruit over the past couple of years. The streaming service has amassed a selection of some of not only the most popular and iconic anime series in recent memory, but also a host of impressive original anime titles. It has secured the platform’s position as of the go-to streaming services for the medium. With over 100 titles to choose from across a smorgasbord of subgenres including sci-fi, fantasy, slice-of-life comedy, mecha, action, and more, the right anime for the right mood has never been more available and simultaneously harder to find.</p>
<p id="21sKyX">Don’t sweat it; we’ve got you covered. Poring over Netflix’s rich catalog of anime titles, we’ve assembled a list of the best anime to stream on Netflix right now. From classic series like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/interviews/22772957/cowboy-bebop-voice-cast-actors-best-episodes"><em>Cowboy Bebop</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/11/29/18115299/how-to-watch-neon-genesis-evangelion-anime-rebuild-netflix"><em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em></a> to Netflix Originals like <em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</em> and <em>Devilman Crybaby</em>, here are the very best anime series the platform has to offer.</p>
<p id="hK6Que">Our latest update added <em>The Disastrous Life of Saiki K.</em>, <em>Kimi ni Todoke: From Me to You</em>, and <em>Pokémon Concierge</em>.</p>

<p id="c59wOa">Based on mascot company Sanrio’s original character, Netflix’s original animated comedy <em>Aggretsuko</em> follows Retsuko, a 25-year-old anthropomorphic red panda working in the accounting department of a Japanese trading company. Frustrated with her thankless job, domineering boss, and boring love life, Retsuko vents her millennial rage in the only way she knows how: through death metal karaoke. Eventually, Retsuko’s misery and the knowledge of her after-work activity catch up with her professional life, forcing the young red panda to experience a series of meaningful revelations and changes while struggling to figure out what just exactly she wants out of life and who she wants to build that life with. Eccentric, funny, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/8/17321016/aggretsuko-netflix-sanrio-anime">deeply relatable</a>, <em>Aggretsuko</em> is anime’s answer to <em>Bojack Horseman</em>. With four seasons of 15-minute episodes, now is the perfect time to catch up and see what all the hubbub is about. <em>—Toussaint Egan</em></p>

<p id="sVznYO"><em>Beastars</em> tells the story of a wolf who wants to have sex with a rabbit but worries he will devour said rabbit. I think it’s a metaphor for puberty. Maybe it’s holding a magnifying glass to sexual violence on campus. Or perhaps it’s a coming-of-age story about a generation of young people disconnected from their parents by rapidly changing norms. Frankly, I’ve stopped caring about what it’s <em>about.</em></p>
<p id="O0juyC"><em>Beastars</em> works when I quit trying to make a one-to-one connection between our world and its city of horny teenage carnivores and herbivores. I enjoy the show best when I take its internal logic on its own terms. In that way, <em>Beastars</em> is like <em>Romeo and Juliet</em>. A sexy, violent, and often frustrating tale of star-crossed lovers kept apart by society. And like the works of Shakespeare, <em>Beastars</em> can be contorted into whatever else you want it to be. <em>—Chris Plante</em></p>

<p id="Ha6UPQ">Directed by Shinichirō Watanabe (<em>Cowboy Bebop</em>) and produced by anime studio Bones (<em>My Hero Academia</em>), <em>Carole &amp; Tuesday</em> is a spirited drama that hones in on one of the most persistent passion topics of Watanabe’s career: music. Set on a terraformed Mars in the distant future, the anime follows the story of Tuesday Simmons and Carole Stanley, two teenage girls from starkly different backgrounds who bond over their shared dream of becoming musicians. </p>
<p id="kLVAw7">Teaming up as a singer-songwriter duo, the pair navigate the thorny challenges and euphoric highs of their nascent musical career as they grow and bring out the best in both each other and those around them. Featuring the return of <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> screenwriter Keiko Nobumoto and original music and vocal performances courtesy of Thundercat, Flying Lotus, Denzel Curry, and more, <em>Carole &amp; Tuesday</em> is a bubbly and beautiful musical anime bursting with heart where it matters most. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="c5mLto">Speaking of Shinichirō Watanabe, <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>, his 1998 sci-fi Western noir anime produced by Sunrise, is considered by many to be <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22723178/cowboy-bebop-anime-best-episodes-to-watch">one of most exemplary anime series ever made</a>. Set in the year 2071, the series follows the stories of four people: Spike Spiegel, Jet Black, Faye Valentine, and “Radical” Edward as they traipse across the solar system hunting  criminals and chasing bounties. </p>
<p id="ySzWfr">A work of retro-futuristic pastiche that pulls from several dozen influences in the creation of its own universe, <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> is an enduring classic of the medium for its rich storytelling, heady themes, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22783964/cowboy-bebop-music-yoko-kanno-soundtrack-behind-the-scenes">a spectacular and eclectic score by composer Yoko Kanno</a>. If you’ve somehow never seen <em>Cowboy Bebop</em> before, (1) now’s the perfect time to and (2) I am both jealous of and excited for you. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="prXCxm">Studio Trigger’s 2022 anime spinoff set in the universe of CD Projekt Red’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23014759/cyberpunk-2077-patch-1-5-review-ps5-xbox-series-x"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/8/6/17656920/cyberpunk-2077-fps-story-themes-political">Mike Pondsmith</a>’s original TTRPG not only earned a spot on our list of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22919571/best-anime-2022">best anime of 2022</a>, but took home the prize for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23624896/anime-awards-2023-winners-list-cyberpunk-attack-on-titan-spy-family">Anime of the Year</a> at the 2023 Crunchyroll Anime Awards. It’s not hard to see why. As critic Kambole Campbell wrote in his <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23349865/cyberpunk-edgerunners-netflix-review-2077">review for Polygon</a>, “[<em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</em>] is easily the most exciting thing to come out of the game’s redemption arc.” </p>
<p id="q2uApQ">The series centers on David Martinez, a streetwise teenager growing up in the dystopian metropolis of Night City who, after losing his mother in a horrific accident and crossing paths with a beautiful and mysterious netrunner named Lucy, chooses to become a high-tech mercenary (or “Edgerunner”) in order to make a living and achieve his dream of one day becoming a “legend.” With Hiroyuki Imaishi (<em>Promare</em>) at the helm and Yoh Yoshinari (<em>Little Witch Academia</em>) serving as the series’ chief animation director and character designer, <em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners </em>quickly asserted itself as not only one of the most impressive video game anime adaptations in recent memory, but as one of Studio Trigger’s most memorable creative efforts to date. </p>
<p id="gRy5aA">Stepping sideways from its source material, the series leaned into <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23351457/cyberpunk-edgerunners-netflix-anime-2077-citizen-sleeper">thematic and emotional territory</a> heretofore unexplored by CD Projekt Red’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23014759/cyberpunk-2077-patch-1-5-review-ps5-xbox-series-x">open-world action RPG</a>, and in doing so created a cast of characters whose respective arcs, motivations, and personalities shaped by a desperate grasp for stability and community in a predatory world left an impression on audiences that lasted far beyond its comparatively short 10-episode run. <em>Edgerunners</em> is the closest a contemporary anime series has come in years to emulating the hyper-violent, risque, and kinetic vitality of a late-’90s anime OVA. To paraphrase <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>’s protagonist, V: You’re either gonna love <em>Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</em> or want to burn it, no middle ground. But if you wanna know for sure, you just need to try it for yourself. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="2u1ieW">Based on Koyoharu Gotouge’s acclaimed manga series, <em>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</em> has quickly become an shōnen anime powerhouse on par with <em>My Hero Academia</em> and <em>Naruto</em> since the series premiered in 2019. Set in Taishō-era Japan, the anime follows the story of Tanjiro Kamado, a kind-hearted young boy who trains to become a demon slayer in order to find a cure for his sister, Nezuko, who was transformed into half-demon hybrid in the wake of the attack that claimed the lives of the rest of his family. </p>
<p id="mv3tLN">With jaw-dropping action sequences, brilliant hybrid animation blending traditional and 3D-modeled backgrounds, and a genuinely stirring story centered on the power of family and finding strength in the harshest of circumstances, <em>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</em> is one of the most popular anime series today for good reason. With a highly anticipated <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23032963/demon-slayer-season-3-everything-we-know">third season coming up</a>, you absolutely must find the time to watch <em>Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba</em> now if you haven’t already. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="FihhPQ">Mitsuo Iso’s sci-fi slice-of-life anime <em>Den-noh Coil</em> is one of the most highly acclaimed yet underseen anime of the late aughts. Set in a future where augmented reality and internet-connected visors have become the norm, the anime follows Yūko Okonogi and her younger sister Kyōko, who move to the small town of Daikoku to live with their grandmother, Sanae. There, the two join the Coil Cyber Detective Agency, a small group of local kids who perform odd jobs and investigate mysteries that skew the line between the technological and the supernatural. </p>
<p id="IeETDi">Drawing inspiration from Japanese folklore and then-cutting-edge technology to tell a story filled with rich characters, subtle themes, outrageous humor, and novel creativity, <em>Den-noh Coil</em> is the definition of an anime cult classic and an absolute gem worth watching. —<em>TE</em></p>

<p id="35t5Ek">Based on Go Nagai’s massively influential manga and directed by Masaaki Yuasa (<em>Keep Your Hands Off Eizouken!</em>), <em>Devilman Crybaby</em> was Netflix’s first original anime series and one of the breakout anime premieres of 2018. The series follows high school student Akira who, after reuniting with his childhood friend Ryo, is made aware of the existence of demons. Convinced that the only way to drive the demons back and save humanity is to create a human-demon hybrid — a so-called devilman — Ryo asks for Akira’s help by volunteering to fuse with one himself. Known for its unsparingly graphic action, ecstatic visual style, and emotionally gripping story, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/1/8/16862868/devilman-crybaby-season-1-review-netflix"><em>Devilman Crybaby</em> is a phenomenal adaptation</a> that breathes stunning new life into a bona-fide anime classic. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="S41aTn">I will never tire of the quick-witted and sharp-tongued humor of <em>The Disastrous Life of Saiki K. </em>This anime follows a high school boy named Kusuo Saiki who has a secret: he possesses world-altering psychic powers. All he wants to do is live his day-to-day life, go unnoticed, and indulge in a coffee jelly now and then. Unfortunately for Saiki, everybody in his life — from jock himbos to the hottest popular girl in school — decides they want to be his friend.</p>
<p id="ctIrsu">The dialog in this anime runs a mile a minute; I once had a friend say they struggled to keep up with the pace of the subtitles, but I love it. Saiki’s quick and deadpan narration contrasts with all the lovable idiots around him. Whether it’s microwaving a metal bowl or drowning in water that’s an inch deep, these characters really push the limits of bone-headedness. All and all, it makes for a comedy that combines fantastic observational humor with brainless antics.<em> —Ana Diaz</em></p>

<p id="vzMWq9">Based on Q Hayashida’s dark fantasy sci-fi manga, <em>Dorohedoro</em> follows the story of Caiman, a reptilian-headed amnesiac living in a dystopian metropolis known as the Hole where humans are preyed upon by malevolent sorcerers from another dimension. With the help of his friend Nikaido, Caiman hunts down these sorcerers in his search of the one who transformed him, devouring their heads into his mouth where a mysterious face at the back of his throat passes judgment on their fate. Yeah, and that’s not even the series at its weirdest. Comical, hyperviolent, and oddly endearing, <em>Dorohedoro</em> is one of the most bizarre, unique, and impressive anime to grace Netflix since it first premiered in 2020. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="ZXNIfi">Directed by Hiro Kaburagi (<em>Speed Grapher</em>) and produced by Wit Studio (<em>Vinland Saga</em>, <em>Attack on Titan</em>), the Netflix original anime <em>Great Pretender</em> is a rollicking comedy-drama with equal parts style, brains, and explosive action. Centering on the story of Makoto Edamura, a small-time Japanese conman who is taken under the wing of the dashing heist maestro Laurent Theirry, the series follows the intrepid band of thieves as they swagger from one beautiful locale to the next in their campaign to swindle the most notorious criminals out of their ill-gotten gains. Aside from the elaborate antics of the core cast, <em>Great Pretender</em> is absolutely stunning in its visual design, with exotic cities and countries rendered in picturesque layouts and backgrounds inspired by the British artist Brian Cook. Not only that, but with character designs courtesy of Yoshiyuki Sadamoto (<em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>) and an infectiously jazzy score by composer Yutaka Yamada, <em>Great Pretender</em> is a feast for the senses and absolute blast to watch unfold. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="npISMN"><em>Haikyu!! </em>is very often regarded as a favorite first sports anime — and for good reason. Even if you think you don’t care too much about volleyball, the vast cast of characters and their fun personalities are compelling. Sure, protagonist Hinata is the archetypal sports anime hero: He wants to be the very best ever. But the rest of the Karasuno boys’ volleyball team rounds him out, and the relationships they have with one another really shape the show.</p>
<p id="rqIVNK">And that’s how it gets you to care about volleyball. After all, the friendships and otherwise complex relationships between teammates all center around that one activity. Slowly but surely, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/9/22152623/haikyuu-volleyball-anime-real-sports">even if you’re not sports-inclined</a>, you’ll begin to understand the magnetic allure of not just volleyball, but the broader world of sports. <em>—Petrana Radulovic</em></p>

<p id="tiO4BD"><em>Hunter x Hunter</em> is a 165-episode gift. Yes, there’s a cannibal furry arc. Yes, the clown man (OK, magician) is naked all the time. But look beyond the fact that I can’t describe this series in a way that will convince my friends to watch it. <em>Hunter x Hunter</em> is the pinnacle of shōnen anime. There’s not a shred of filler in it. A particular arc that involves Gon and pals fighting in the 251-floor Heavens Arena is the perfect example of <em>Hunter x Hunter</em>’s economy of storytelling: it only spends 10 episodes there, and the narrative payoff is so good.</p>
<p id="PGLK6p">By the time I reached the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22619955/hunter-x-hunter-chimera-ant-fans-netflix">61-episode-long Chimera Ant arc</a> (shut up), I would have died for these characters, and <em>Hunter x Hunter</em> is at times so emotionally wrenching that I nearly did. —<em>Simone de Rochefort</em></p>

<p id="fCZyu8">You know that thing you did as a kid when your friend would shoot their finger guns at you, but you’d say you were made out of metal, and then they’d say that their bullets are made out of metal-melting acid, but then you’d say that last night you snuck into their base and ate all their bullets? <em>JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure</em> is exactly like that, except instead of imaginative kids, everyone is an extremely beautiful fully grown adult man with a name like “Robert E.O. Speedwagon” or “Kars.”</p>
<p id="glrGYj"><em>JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure</em> is pure spectacle. It’s a series built around absurd confrontations where the stakes aren’t always clear and the rules might as well not exist, but it’s a joy to look at. Characters strut around in avant-garde, impractical outfits and strike dramatic poses. They’re all named (seemingly arbitrarily) after classic rock musicians. It’s the kind of series that encourages you to keep watching, not with a compelling plot or great mystery, but just with the promise of seeing beautiful and weird men do things. I think that’s OK. —<em>Patrick Gill</em></p>

<p id="wLEgoL">Sawako Kuronuma is a misunderstood highschooler. Her peers think that she has supernatural powers and call her Sadako — because of her physical resemblance to the possessed girl from <em>The Ring</em> – and live in fear of her until one day a popular jock named Shota Kazehaya befriends Kuronuma. Thus begins her personal journey to make friends and connect with others in a meaningful way.</p>
<p id="9CskVg"><em>Kimi ni Todoke: From Me to You</em> is the epitome of a slow-moving romance that takes dozens of episodes to have the slightest bit of romantic development. However, it doesn’t get lost in all the lovey-dovey feelings. At its heart, it’s about young people grappling with decisions they make when faced with miscommunication. Sometimes what we say and mean might seem obvious to one person, but isn’t actually that obvious at all! Its themes of communication and personal development, paired with a lovable cast of good kids, makes it an easy recommendation for me.<em> — AD</em></p>

<p id="BWtxHw">Kenji Nakamura’s 2007 series <em>Mononoke</em> is a cult favorite among anime enthusiasts who prefer a more eccentric and esoteric take on your average supernatural horror fiction. A spinoff of the 2006 anthology anime <em>Ayakashi: Samurai Horror Tales</em>, <em>Mononoke</em> follows the adventures of the “Medicine Seller,” a mysterious, wandering exorcist of sorts who travels across Edo-period Japan in search of wayward spirits whose unresolved emotional attachments have caused them to transform into malicious entities that feed and prey on negative human emotions. Divided into roughly five different storylines, the 12-episode anime sees the Medicine Seller using his various supernatural abilities to deduce the cause behind a spirit’s inability to part from the physical plane and successfully exorcise them using a sword that can only be unsheathed when the identity and motivations of the spirit are made known.</p>
<p id="DPyloS">The real strength of <em>Mononoke </em>is through its animation and avant-garde art style, drawing inspiration from classical Japanese illustration and painting techniques to create a world of bright palettes, flamboyant characters, and beautiful textures that feel like a ukiyo-e painting brought to life. If you’re a fan of <em>Gankutsuou: The Count of Monte Cristo</em>, you should make the time to watch this series, and even if you’re not, you should take the opportunity to catch up on the series <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2023/8/4/23819984/mononoke-movie-trailer-summer-2024-announcement">before the feature-length anime film premieres next year</a>. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="apuiEM">Whenever I’m asked how to get into anime, I always respond with a question in turn. I never ask “What anime have you seen already?” or even “What kind of animation do you like?” but always “What kinds of stories do you like? What’s the last book, movie, or scripted television show that really caught your attention?” Anime is a diverse and multifaceted medium, one with a breadth of stories and experiences beyond the typical shonen action fare that many come to erroneously equate with the sum total of anime as a whole. My personal, prime example of this is <em>Monster</em>, the 2004 anime adaptation of Naoki Urasawa’s 1994 manga series, and I can’t tell you how excited I am to finally be able to recommend it to folks new to anime.</p>
<p id="b2Z9Ev">An outlier when compared to most other popular anime, <em>Monster</em> is a psychological crime thriller set in postwar Germany. The series centers on Kenzo Tenma, an esteemed Japanese brain surgeon living and working in Düsseldorf, who is faced with a spur-of-the-moment choice of saving the life of a child with a gunshot wound to their head or the city’s mayor — and donor to Tenma’s hospital. Tenma chooses to operate on the child, and in doing so irrevocably alters the course of both of their lives forever.</p>
<p id="fO0a8T">With his career reputation tarnished in the wake of the mayor’s passing, Tenma is further haunted by the subsequent disappearance of the child, who vanished shortly after the operation to save his life. Several years later, Tenma is implicated in the murder of several of his hospital’s senior staff, and the culprit is none other than the child he saved — now a prolific and elusive serial killer. With no other choice, Tenma embarks on a quest in search of proof of his former patient’s identity and transgressions in order to clear his name, all while hounded by German police.</p>
<p id="X3GrNv">If you enjoy slow-burn procedural crime thrillers like <em>True Detective</em>, <em>Zodiac</em>, or <em>The Fugitive</em>, <em>Monster </em>is absolutely the anime for you. At 74 episodes, Masayuki Kojima and Madhouse’s series is a faithful adaptation of Urasawa’s manga and a riveting drama, patiently and meticulously unspooling a cast of unique characters whose respective storylines interweave into a complicated tapestry of murder, sex, lies, and conspiracy. After being difficult procure in the states for over a decade, Netflix finally added <em>Monster</em> to its library earlier this year. If for no other reason than its rarity, you should make time to watch this excellent and well-crafted piece of Japanese animated storytelling. I promise you won’t regret it. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="tWIt5p"><em>My Hero Academia</em>’s legacy is a complicated one: It’s classic shonen to a T, replicating the early beats of a lot of ’90s/2000s shonen (particularly <em>Naruto</em>) as it follows underdog Izuku Midoriya as he tries to make it at an elite high school for those with superpowers (known in-universe as “quirks”). It rocketed to massive popularity and had some foibles — slower or even straight-up misguided arcs that fans felt weighed it down.</p>
<p id="RdOSUB">Still, it left an indelible mark on the anime scene, and will be something that completionists in particular will want to check out. It was a gateway anime and one that will no doubt be a touchstone for years to come (and hopefully it sticks the landing). <em>—Zosha Millman</em></p>

<p id="plAgs7">Director Hideaki Anno’s apocalyptic mecha drama <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em> is one of the undisputed titans of contemporary anime, commanding a passionate legion of fans since it first premiered in 1995 and amassing such a reverential reputation that it spawned <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22633960/rebuild-evangelion-movies-ending">a tetralogy of films</a> dedicated to reimagining its vast universe. Set 15 years after a worldwide cataclysm, the original series centers on Shinji Ikari, a 14-year-old boy who is enlisted by his estranged father to pilot an enormous bio-weapon known as an Evangelion in order to combat a mysterious legion of creatures codenamed “Angels.” </p>
<p id="zSGOLJ">Together with his fellow pilots Asuka Langley Soryu and Rei Ayanami, as well as his legal guardian/commanding officer Misato Katsuragi, Shinji must struggle with the pangs of growing up while defeating the Angels to save humanity. Of course, there’s way <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/7/21043182/neon-genesis-evangelion-netflix-anime-meaning-bible-depression-sexuality">more to this premise than meets the eye</a>. By equal turns psychological and eschatological, <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em> subverts audience expectations at every turn to deliver one of the most memorable anime stories of all time, culminating in one of the most divisive, inspired finales ever produced for television. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="y7NSsI">Mitsuo Iso, the legendary animator known for his work on such classic films as <em>End of Evangelion</em> and <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>, made his return to directing with the 2022 original anime <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22916144/the-orbital-children-anime-review-netflix"><em>The Orbital Children</em></a>. Produced 15 years after his first original work, the cult favorite sci-fi coming-of-age anime <em>Den-noh Coil</em>, Iso’s 2022 series saw the director revisit his fascination with speculative augmented reality technology and adolescence. </p>
<p id="dM0eIj">Centered on five children who find themselves stranded aboard a commercial space station in the wake of an unforeseen disaster and subsequent terrorist attack, <em>The Orbital Children</em> is easily one of the most visually fascinating and conceptually forward-thinking anime in recent memory. While the story may admittedly grow a tad unwieldy in the series’ latter half, Iso’s series as a whole proves itself to be a remarkable experience to behold all the same. Here’s hoping it doesn’t take him another 15 years to grace us with yet another stunning vision of the future. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="T1FdnY">With all the toys, shows, and games, there’s so much Pokémon in the world right now and it can be hard to know what’s good anymore. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24009728/pokemon-concierge-netflix-animation-review-new-show"><em>Pokémon Concierge</em></a><em> </em>is one of my favorite pieces of Pokémon media in the past decade or so. The show follows Haru, a young and anxious office worker who quits her job to become a concierge at a tropical Pokémon resort. Once there, it’s up to her to reconnect with her joy for life and share that with the Pokémon around her.</p>
<p id="mGfKQS">Dwarf Studio, the animation studio behind <em>Rilakkuma and Kaoru</em>, render beloved creatures like Pikachu in a gorgeous stop-motion claymation style. Every Pokémon, no matter how small, pops with the textiles and clays that really sets the show apart from all other Pokémon series. Pair that with an emotionally touching story that’s sure to speak to every 20 and 30-something overwhelmed office worker, and <em>Pokémon Concierge </em>makes for an easy-to-watch and endlessly relatable viewing. <em>—AD</em></p>

<p id="N4o5Uj">Similar to fellow Netflix original <em>Aggretsuko</em>, <em>Rilakkuma and Kaoru </em>is another anime based on cutesy mascot character designs created by a stationery company. While the latter is beautifully realized in impressive stop-motion animation, the two share a common focus in centering on disgruntled office workers yearning for a change of pace. The series follows a year in the life of Kaoru, a young human woman living with her three roommates: a large brown anthropomorphic bear named Rilakkuma, a small white bear named Korilakkuma, and a baby chick named Kiirotori. Heartwarming, whimsical, and powerfully cathartic, <em>Rilakkuma and Kaoru</em> is a wonderful anime with adorable characters and a stunning art style. With a follow-up series titled <em>Rilakkuma’s Theme Park Adventure </em>slated for release later this year, now is the perfect time to catch up on the series. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="JgDMaH">You know the story of Scott Pilgrim — dating a teenager! Falls in love with another girl! Fights her exes! <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23952977/scott-pilgrim-vs-world-movie-comic-changes">Kinda a schmuck</a>! — but <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> <em>Takes Off</em> is a beast of a different nature. This is a story that has been <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23943353/netflix-scott-pilgrim-takes-off-anime-same-different-movie-comics">digested and reworked for 20 years</a>, and the anime <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23965502/scott-pilgrim-takes-off-review-anime-netflix-tv-show">comes out with a more mature, open-ended consideration</a> of pretty much every aspect of it. Plus: It’s an anime! So <em>Scott Pilgrim</em> is no longer held back by either the page or the production of its comic and film medium. Now, Scott Pilgrim finally has the space to do what we always wanted for him — and <em>Scott Pilgrim </em>reaps the rewards. <em>—ZM</em></p>

<p id="GYcnSY">Set in a futuristic city where superpowered heroes compete on live television to capture criminals and promote sponsors, <em>Tiger &amp; Bunny</em> follows veteran hero Kotetsu T. Kaburagi (aka Wild Tiger), who is forced to team up with a new partner, Barnaby Brooks Jr. Despite sharing the same abilities, the two clash over their conflicting goals and ideas of what it means to be a hero. However, when a dangerous new adversary threatens to plunge the city into turmoil, the pair will have to put aside their differences and work together if they’re to have any chance of saving the day.</p>
<p id="hBmVSE">The brainchild of producer Masayuki Ozaki (<em>Tales of the Abyss</em>) and director Keiichi Sato (<em>The Big O</em>), <em>Tiger &amp; Bunny</em> failed to muster a strong reception when it first aired in 2011, but a cult following of fans amassed via enough word-of-mouth praise over the next decade that Netflix commissioned a second season of the series, albeit now directed by Mitsuko Kase (<em>Ristorante Paradiso</em>) and produced by Bandai Namco Pictures. </p>

<p id="aLiylK">Set in England around A.D. 1013, the historical action adventure anime <em>Vinland Saga</em> follows Thorfinn, the son of a former Viking commander, who embarks on a journey for vengeance against the band of mercenaries hired to kill his father. Inspired by the life of Thorfinn Karlsefni, an Icelandic explorer who followed Leif Eriksson on his short-lived journey to establish a colony in North America, <em>Vinland Saga</em> is one of the most unconventional and rewarding anime series in years. It is a visceral tale of a young man’s attempt to resolve his grief through violence, only to subsequently embrace the ideology of nonviolence his father tried to impart on him earlier in life. </p>
<p id="TtG2B6">The first season is an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23032698/vinland-saga-anime-the-northman-viking-revenge-story">exciting and action-oriented story</a> focusing on Thorfinn’s strained relationship with his nemesis (and begrudging father figure) Askeladd, parallel to the ascendency of King Canute the Great. The second season is an altogether more deliberate and somber story that finds Thorfinn attempting to seek a new purpose in life beyond vengeance. <em>Vinland Saga</em> is a tremendous anime with a life-affirming story of finding peace in spite of hardship, and an absolute must-watch for anime enthusiasts. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="UDKG8W">The highly acclaimed Kyoto Animation brings the Netflix exclusive <em>Violet Evergarden </em>to life with the beautiful scenes you’d expect from the studio. The main character, who shares her name with the series, is a young girl previously used as a killing machine by the military during a war. After losing both of her arms and having them replaced with metal prosthetics, she has to learn how to integrate back into society as an Auto-Memory Doll, which is essentially a trained ghostwriter for books and letters. It’s sweet and satisfying to watch Violet grow and learn about the complexity of human emotions, a journey complemented by gorgeous animation. The 13-episode series is available in its entirety in English and Japanese with English subtitles in addition to dubbed voices and subtitles in several other languages. <em>—Julia Lee</em></p>

<p id="khBrZj">Before Yoshihiro Togashi created <em>Hunter x Hunter</em> — one of the most <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22619955/hunter-x-hunter-chimera-ant-fans-netflix">highly acclaimed</a>, bestselling manga series of all time — he created yet <em>another</em> highly acclaimed, bestselling manga in the form of<em> Yu Yu Hakusho</em>.</p>
<p id="u76ABD">Adapted into a long-running anime by studio Pierrot in 1992, the series follows the story of Yusuke Urameshi, a 14-year-old delinquent who dies from being hit by a car in his attempt to save a child’s life. Surprised by his dying act of altruism, the Spirit World sends Botan, the ferrywoman of the afterlife, to recruit Yusuke as a Spirit Detective. After being resurrected on Earth, Yusuke is tasked with investigating several cases involving malevolent supernatural activity in the human world, gaining new allies along the way as he fights to save the mortal realm from disaster.</p>
<p id="47wEfN">A predecessor to anime like <em>Bleach</em> and <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em>, <em>Yu Yu Hakusho</em> was one of several shows that introduced a generation of anime fans to the medium when it first aired in the United States on Adult Swim during the early 2000s. The Dark Tournament arc is easily one of the best of any anime of its era, and the show’s supporting cast of characters are all unique and inspiring personalities with their own iconic and exhilarating powers. Don’t let the show’s age put you off — <em>Yu Yu Hakusho</em> is a superb supernatural martial arts anime that’s worth seeing through all the way to the end. <em>—TE</em></p>

This helps us work on the requests from our community on an ongoing basis.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/beyond-the-battle-why-do-we-need-to-create-a-safe-game-environment" target="_self">Beyond the battle: Why do we need to create a safe game environment</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Community Council is a group of several dozen of the most dedicated, trusted players, community members and influencers with whom we meet once per quarter to talk about our plans for the evolution of the game and get their feedback. Those are the same people we invite to participate in the closed beta tests of the new in-game initiatives. Some of the features that benefited from this treatment—such as the addition of a physical parkour setting or the newly released Nightmare Difficulty—were broadly appreciated by the community.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Today, however, I’d like to focus on what is, in our opinion, the most interesting endeavor we’ve attempted yet: the Community Ideas program. It’s a special means of getting feedback, where our players can submit requested features and elements they’d like to see added to our game. The ideas that are feasible to implement, based on the existing gameplay mechanics, can be found on the dedicated page of our community hub,</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/goodies/community-ideas?state=1&amp;category=&amp;order=&amp;page=1&amp;limit=20&amp;query="> Pilgrim Outpost</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Then, the players vote for their favorites to be included in the game. But don’t let this cursory outline fool you! The entire matter is quite complex, with a pretty extensive process that involves us checking each submitted idea.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/every-game-has-the-community-it-deserves" target="_self">Every Game Has the Community It Deserves</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The voting happens in stages and it’s important to note here that this timing is aligned with our release cycle, as we aim to update the game once every few months. Thanks to this scheduling, the ideas can be implemented fairly soon.</span></p><p>Image via Techland.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Next, several of the most popular ideas end up with the development team, where they’re further assessed. While evaluating them, we pay attention to their originality, feasibility, added value, whether a given feature would clash with other gameplay elements from a technical perspective, and so on. The ideas are divided into three categories:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The accepted ones land in our task lists, where we calculate what is needed to implement them and what’s the rough timeline for that. The rejected ideas are deemed unsuitable or ultimately too costly. It’s also worth mentioning that we not only notify the authors of the rejected ideas that we’re not moving forward with them, but we also try to give them the reason for the refusal whenever we can. It’s additional work, of course, but we don’t want to discourage our players by the lack of feedback from us. The third option is Backlog—it’s for the ideas that we like and want to take a closer look at, but their implementation is not immediately possible. It might come down to the insufficient amount of time and resources at a particular moment, or the fact that they would involve altering the game in a significant way—but we still like them and want them to happen at a later date. They’re benched for now.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We launched the second round of Community Ideas in mid-April, which means that the players can again submit their ideas and vote for the best ones. We received over 1500 new entries in a couple of days, so the interest has not waned. We also keep getting feedback concerning the process itself. At the community’s request, we implemented features such as a keyword search bar, extended categories filter, multiple language support, and entry translation powered by Google API. And we will keep upgrading the tool.</span></p><p>Image via Techland.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We consider this collaborative, community-driven approach to supporting our games to be a good strategy—as every developer cares about favorable reception as well as high community engagement. I think I can confidently claim that our method works. Since the introduction of the Community Ideas program, the player sentiment, expressed as positive comments and reviews, has risen. And </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dying Light 2 Stay Human</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—despite the fact that it’s an open-world AAA game—can still boast a sizable player base two years after it premiered.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Undoubtedly, this type of approach comes with a multitude of challenges. The most substantial one is finding balance between applying the suggestions from the community and maintaining your own authorial vision of the game. The other obstacle is finding time and appropriate resources to be able to focus on implementing the community's ideas, yes, but first and foremost, on realizing our development plans.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The technical side alone—Pilgrim Outpost website maintenance, accumulating and cleaning up of the ideas themselves, not to mention managing the duplicates—is incredibly time-consuming and labor-intensive. Regardless of whether you decide to launch a dedicated program, like our Community Ideas, or to follow a general strategy of community-driven development, you need to:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ol data-testid="basic-list-ordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Prepare a production pipeline that will be able to take on the incoming community requests;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Make sure that you have appropriate resources at your disposal: people, time, money—all according to the model you’re working with;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Interact with the players—launching such a program or a development strategy is a huge commitment on the part of the developer, so you need to be transparent in your actions and communicate the respective stages, decisions, etc.;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Be consistent in your actions—nowadays, it’s extremely easy to lose the players’ trust and end up with a result that is entirely opposite to what you had in mind, so if you show your community that they are important, stick to it;</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Brace yourself for tough feedback.</span></p></div></li></ol></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This all may seem a bit daunting—and that’s a reasonable reaction. The entire process is a lot, but with good planning, cleverly allocated resources, and some flexibility, it’s entirely feasible. And the benefits are really worth it. On the one hand, you get a structured and regulated source of player feedback, and on the other, you give the community the means to influence the game’s development. Both sides benefit, and the game itself ends up getting better and better!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The overriding vision was that users can have a bigger stake in the content creation process within gaming, and creativity can flow from the bottom up. In the last ten years, we’ve seen a tremendous shift play out in precisely that fashion, where major game studios and publishers are actively welcoming and collaborating with creators to improve the longevity and quality of their products. From the advent of Fortnite UEFN to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://rockstarintel.com/follow-rockstars-acquisition-fivem-release-statement-on-its-future/#:~:text=Rockstar%20Games%20purchased%20the%20group,now%20they're%20purchasing%20them.">Rockstar acquiring FiveM</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, publishers have embraced creators and recognized the untapped benefits UGC brings towards the entire gaming ecosystem. Gamers get more content, in-game creators can earn a living with their mods, and publishers can crowdsource content creation in a safe and financially viable way, particularly as content production costs increase.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The definition of an in-game creator has also evolved. There are stand out solo creators like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://porofessor.gg/">Porofessor</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/corporation-buys-a-popular-league-of-legends-app-for-dollar55-millionits-made-by-one-guy/">who sold his business for over $54M</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">); teams of mod authors like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.feed-the-beast.com/">FeedtheBeast</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, dedicated to making Minecraft Modpacks; and even former AAA developers that have turned to build games specifically on creator platforms to optimize their odds of success while reducing development time. The rise of UEFN, Roblox, and platforms like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.curseforge.com/">CurseForge</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have made it easier than ever for indie developers to create games and playable prototypes, reach giant audiences, and provide a pathway to diversify revenue streams and bring their original content to life.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The future of gaming is in the hands of in-game creators&nbsp; —&nbsp; this core belief has driven my professional career. These passionate modders, app developers, and game server owners provide an untethered lifecycle for major game studios; keeping gamers consistently coming back for more experiences. As an example, the modding community has enthusiastically embraced titles like Palworld and indie hit game Lethal Company. Since its early access release in mid-October 2023, Lethal Company has sold over 10 million copies. Its top five mods on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://thunderstore.io/">Thunderstore</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (a mod manager built on the Overwolf platform) have collectively amassed over 31M downloads. These mods range from simple tools enhancing audio settings and multiplayer lobbies to transformative additions that revolutionize the gameplay experience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We believe that these in-game creators, whether individuals or studios, deserve to be compensated for their time, which is why CurseForge has introduced </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>DLC-level Premium Mods</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Premium mods have the potential to be a significant revenue source for IP owners and in-game creators alike, attracting even talented studios to bring their IP and stories into titles like ARK: Survival Ascended and create engaging content for players to enjoy.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Understandably, the gaming community has concerns about this shift. Attempts and missteps have been made before, including Valve and Bethesda's attempt to introduce paid mods for Skyrim in 2015. The modding community, built on principles of collaboration and open sharing, strongly opposed this commercial shift. Gamers expressed concerns about the quality of paid mods, mods attribution rights, and perceived potential exploitation of mod authors by developers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, the industry’s shift towards UGC has essential differences today. Platforms that emphasize player-made content, like CurseForge and Fortnite Creative/UEFN, are offering tools for these in-game creators and allowing them to safely publish their mods. Further, they offer an attractive business model for both IP owners and in-game creators. Quality assurance of paid mods is something that needs to be taken seriously, and handled by CurseForge as a service.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">CurseForge has recently announced cross-platform premium mods for Studio Wildcard’s ARK: Survival Ascended. We’ve gone as far as to partner with several game studios, including Blue Isle, Sky Map, and Look North World, to guarantee quality content. CurseForge’s premium mod system gives in-game creators a 50% revenue split with Studio Wildcard. Mods can cost anywhere from $2 to $15 and the split gives the studio and CurseForge the ability to support the creators, moderate the platform, and provide the best experience to the player. The price will be set by the creators, but approved by CurseForge to make sure the price is good for the value players are getting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While gaming UGC started four decades ago, it is the present and the future of gaming. It is becoming one of the industry’s largest growth engines, with the world’s most popular games turning to creators to provide gamers with endless quality content that is increasing the shelf lives of games. It is difficult to understate the significance of premium mods within this wider landscape as it signals a titanic shift for studios and creators alike. From the publisher perspective, it provides a catalyst to further break down the stigma of relinquishing creative control to passionate creators in exchange for longevity, retention and a new revenue stream. From the creator’s side, the allure and realistic possibility of earning a stable income welcomes in an entirely new and expansive generation of developer-creators who will feel confident in committing their entire working lives to this newly emerging career path. Together, the entire gaming industry will see an exponential shift in the years to come; from an entirely new and untapped revenue stream to the quality of the gaming experience enjoyed by everyone.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Immediately following the presentation, there will be a second livestream to highlight an upcoming game in a "beloved" series. Today, the subject of that showcase has been revealed, and surprising no one, it's a new Call of Duty game.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is a title that might confuse some, seeing as there technically isn't a game titled Black Ops 5. This is because the fifth entry of the sub-series, which launched in 2021, was Black Ops Cold War, temporarily removing the numbered naming convention. The news was <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1793639436766605429">announced on social media</a>, but was accompanied by a teaser on YouTube that seems to hint at the events of the game's campaign.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RxIHyfwUrTg" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>The 40-second clip follows a group of people sneaking onto the top of Mount Rushmore, where they place blindfolds over the eyes of the presidents carved into the mountainside. The first three blindfolds read, "The truth lies," while the fourth features a three-headed wolf logo that was used in the initial redacted teaser of the game.</p>

<p>The game will be revealed in full during a presentation on Saturday, June 9, immediately following the Xbox showcase that will start at 10 AM PT/ 1 PM ET. <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/09/xbox-reportedly-debating-putting-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-alongside-price-hike">Microsoft is reportedly debating on whether or not the launch the game on Game Pass</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="275" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I love <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-paradise-killer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">detective games</a> because for a brief fleeting moment, they make me feel intelligent. It doesn’t matter how long it takes me or how many things I rub on other things to try and make progress. I eventually solve the case and outsmart a game designed for me to outsmart.</p> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="251" data-injectable="false"><em>Duck Detective: The Secret Salami</em> promised this in a healthy, low-calorie bite. Of its bullet points, it proudly states that it’s 2-3 hours long. I can handle that. I’m often conscious for at least 2-3 hours a day. That, like, half a <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/359510/Tangle_Tower/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tangle Tower</a></em>!</p> <figure data-current-count="551" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="194" data-current-count="194" data-injectable="false"><strong><strong><strong>Duck Detective: The Secret Salami (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2637990/Duck_Detective_The_Secret_Salami/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a> [Reviewed], <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/duck-detective-the-secret-salami-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch</a>, Xbox One)<br>Developer: Happy Broccoli Games<br>Publisher: Happy Broccoli Games<br>Released: May 23, 2024 (PC, Switch) TBA (Xbox)<br>MSRP: $9.99</strong></strong></strong></p> <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="491" data-injectable="true">The story opens with our recently divorced hero waking up from a night of bread-addiction relapse. There’s maybe some former glory there. He might have written a book. A lot of this is mentioned kind of off-hand. Which you’d maybe expect from a game that’s trying to be as brief as possible.</p>
 <p data-characters="43" data-current-count="43" data-injectable="false">Weirdly, though, it still has a slow start.</p> <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="409" data-injectable="true">As the Duck Detective, you need to gather the clues. All of them. You waddle around the office of Bearbus, using every action on every well-marked interactive object. Once you have enough clues, you can then crack open the “Deducktions” menu and start putting together the pieces. It’s kind of like Mad Libs, but you’re slotting evidence into all the blanks.</p>
 <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="369" data-injectable="false">This process is so mechanical that it’s extremely jarring when <em>The Secret Salami</em> asks you to actually make a real deduction or eke out meaning from a small change in the environment. I’ve played much more complex investigation games, but I had to stop myself a couple of times and remind myself that it’s not <em>just</em> picking up words and putting them in a scrapbook.</p> <figure data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Duck Detective: The Secret Salami – Release Date Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BLhqdpOi7VE?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="496" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true">It’s really tempting to play it that way, however. Your progress is based entirely on these deductions. It tells you how many clues you have in a particular subject, and once it’s full, it feels like you must know everything. But then you switch over and realize it’s asking you to deduce something that hasn’t really been directly pointed out as important. It gives you subjects that you might not have even registered as important. Sometimes it’s things that <em>aren’t</em> important. Ever.</p>
 <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="266" data-injectable="false">So, sometimes, you’re faced with something that seems poorly defined or completely irrelevant. There’s no penalty to start slotting in the wrong words into the deducktions, so you can just keep trying different combinations until the game lets you proceed.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="418" data-current-count="684" data-injectable="true">You don’t <em>need</em> to do this, as you can always ask for a hint, which takes the form of the Duck Detective musing to himself. <em>Duck Detective</em> at least lives up to its philosophy. It really wants you to make it all the way to the end. There’s even an easier mode if you want to get more specific hints. It’s just unfortunate that all these safety nets were set up, rather than creating consistently intuitive puzzles.</p>
 <p data-characters="846" data-current-count="846" data-injectable="true">A good example is an early deducktion where it asks you what is going on in the kitchen. It isn’t that there are no hints, it’s just that there’s a lot of misdirection. You’re supposed to deduce that it’s a surprise birthday party, but it’s earlier established that the character is sad everyone forgot. It was a puzzle on its own. Okay, that’s fair. It’s a surprise. However, in the kitchen is a poster that says the Halloween party has been canceled, and it’s suggested that it’s because of funding, with the Duck Detective remarking that office parties are a bad idea anyway. So, why set that up in my mind and then expect me to immediately figure out that the person standing in the kitchen with a whisk in hand is making a cake for a surprise birthday party? As I said, there are clues, but it’s not set up intuitively.</p>
 <p data-characters="176" data-current-count="176" data-injectable="false">It doesn’t matter though, because the deducktion is only there for progression. It’s completely irrelevant to the case. It’s just not the only instance that this happens.</p> <figure data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="297" data-injectable="false">And for that matter, the story has no teeth. I’m tempted to say it isn’t very good, but I don’t think that’s accurate. The narrative itself is fine, even if it’s slow to get to any interesting wrinkles. However, the dialogue, the characters, and the worldbuilding are all extremely limp.</p> <p data-characters="189" data-current-count="486" data-injectable="true">The office of Bearbus is at least well-realized. Having worked several years in an office environment, the relationships and frustrations between all the characters feel extremely familiar.</p>
 <p data-characters="522" data-current-count="522" data-injectable="true">In terms of the character, it’s again not that there’s a complete lack of development. Tidbits of backstory are given and does some service in making the characters feel believable. However, very little of it gets tied into the case in a satisfying way. Motivation is poorly defined to the point where it’s hard to care about anyone. At the end of it all, it feels really inconsequential. With the thieved lunch being the focal point, that’s maybe the intention, but it doesn’t really lead to anything memorable.</p>
 <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="282" data-injectable="false">The dialogue is sometimes amusing but rarely funny. What got the biggest chuckle out of me was the duck “facts” that get flashed on the loading screens. The dialogue is never ever that clever. Possibly because the characters aren’t set up to be that interesting or insightful.</p> <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="461" data-injectable="true">In terms of worldbuilding, there’s an attempt at creating a sense of place. However, not enough effort goes into it to make it really believable outside the walls of the office.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="424" data-current-count="724" data-injectable="true">The art holds up a lot better. While the overall paper-craft look is mostly serviceable, the still-frame art is excellent. This is best shown off during moments where you take a closer look at a character or object in the environment. As you pass your cursor over the image, the magnifying glass depicts the same object in higher detail. You notice fine lines, subtle facial expressions, and fabric stains. It’s well done.</p>
 <p data-characters="504" data-current-count="504" data-injectable="true">But aside from that, <em>Duck Detective: The Secret Salami</em> delivers on its philosophy too well. It’s an easygoing detective game, sure, but its design feels similarly laid-back. It doesn’t feel like it reaches to excel very often. It doesn’t excite, it doesn’t provoke thought, and it doesn’t linger on the tongue. And there’s something to be said about a game like that. Not everything needs to be a revelation. Sometimes, you just need something that you can file away after you quack the case.</p>

<p data-characters="243" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you fancy getting up close and personal with your opponents in <em>XDefiant</em>, then the P90 SMG could be the weapon for you. That’s why we’ve put together the best loadout and attachments to give you an advantage over your opponents. </p> <p data-characters="312" data-current-count="312" data-injectable="false">Of course, no loadout we can give you will automatically make you a good player, but it can help you hit your shots and deal the most damage possible. With <em>XDefiant</em>‘s faction system, there’s no need to worry about Lethals or Tacticals like there are in <em>Call of Duty</em>, making the process a lot easier. </p> <figure data-current-count="612" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>The P90 is best for close-quarters combat.

 <h2 id="h-best-xdefiant-p90-attachments" data-injectable="false">Best <em>XDefiant </em>P90 attachments</h2> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Muzzle: </strong>Barrel Extender</li> <li><strong>Barrel: </strong>Lightweight</li> <li><strong>Front Rail: </strong>Tactical</li> <li><strong>Rear Grip: </strong>Fabric</li> <li><strong>Stock: </strong>Padded</li> </ul> <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="514" data-injectable="true">The P90 is designed for players who like to run at enemies and get into close-quarters combat, which is why we’ve chosen the <strong>Barrel Extender Muzzle </strong>specifically, which decreases your sprint-to-fire time. The <strong>Lightweight Barrel</strong> is also perfect for this playstyle, as it increases your ADS and movement speed. </p>
 <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="250" data-injectable="false">The <strong>Tactical Front Rail</strong> has a huge impact on recoil recovery, which helps make the gun easier to control, while the <strong>Padded Stock</strong> also helps in that regard. Finally, the <strong>Fabric Rear Grip</strong> boosts your ADS speed and stability, which is nice to have too. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Best <em>XDefiant</em> faction to use with the P90</h2> <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="543" data-injectable="true">Generally, this will come down to your personal preference, but I would suggest the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-xdefiant-factions-to-use-for-each-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Echelon faction</a>, as the Low Profile and Digital Ghillie Suit can help you close distance to enemies by becoming difficult to see. The Sonar Goggles are also very useful to find the locations of enemy players. </p>
 <p data-characters="209" data-current-count="209" data-injectable="false">Another option is running Libertad with the BioVida Boost, which boosts your health when used. This can be useful as SMG players are often in a lot of gunfights, and a little bit of healing is always helpful. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">How to unlock the P90 in <em>XDefiant</em></h2> <p data-characters="119" data-current-count="328" data-injectable="false">To unlock the P90 in <em>XDefiant</em>, you’ll need to get 10 hip-fire kills with SMGs to complete the required challenge.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false"><em>XDefiant </em>P90 alternatives</h2> <p data-characters="222" data-current-count="550" data-injectable="false">If you’re not enjoying the P90 and want to try something else, I would suggest trying out the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-mp7-loadout-and-faction-in-xdefiant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MP7</a>, which is another solid SMG. If you fancy taking on gunfights at a longer distance, then the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-m4a1-loadout-and-faction-in-xdefiant/">M</a><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-m4a1-loadout-and-faction-in-xdefiant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">4</a><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-m4a1-loadout-and-faction-in-xdefiant/">A1</a> is the gun for you. </p>

<p data-characters="231" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">One of your partners in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a></em> is a newborn Yoshi that you name yourself. The marketing material invariably shows this Yoshi as being green, but that’s actually only one of a variety of possibilities.</p> <p data-characters="242" data-current-count="242" data-injectable="false"><strong>What color of Yoshi you get depends on the amount of time that it stays in its egg.</strong> There are seven color possibilities. But let’s first look at how to get the baby Yoshi. Just scroll down to the chart if that’s what you’re looking for.</p> <figure data-current-count="542" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-get-baby-yoshi-in-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door" data-injectable="false">How to get Baby Yoshi in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</h2> <p data-characters="183" data-current-count="183" data-injectable="false">You’ll come across baby (or kid or mini, whatever) Yoshi in the regular course of the game. It occurs during chapter 3, when you’re battling your way up the ranks in the Glitzpit.</p> <p data-characters="302" data-current-count="485" data-injectable="true">As you proceed, you’ll eventually be told that you should go try a hot dog from the stand in front of the stadium. Do as you’re told and you’ll see a cutscene of an egg bouncing around with the stand owner chasing after it. It will eventually go up to the top of the hot dog stand and stay there.</p>
 <p data-characters="223" data-current-count="223" data-injectable="false">To reach the egg, go to the roof of the Juice Bar and <strong>use the paper airplane pad to glide over to the hot dog stand.</strong> This might take a few attempts, as it’s pretty precise. Once you reach the egg, it will join your party.</p> <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="615" data-injectable="true">Continue to fight up the ranks of the Glitzpit until you reach the fight with the Iron Adonis Brothers. You won’t be able to beat them, initially, no matter what you do. Run away (or get defeated). You’ll be sent back to the locker room, where you’ll find the egg has hatched. Name baby Yoshi, and he’ll become a party member. His battle ability is how you defeat the Adonis Brothers.</p>
 <h2 id="h-how-to-choose-your-baby-yoshi-color" data-injectable="false">How to choose your baby Yoshi color</h2> <p data-characters="262" data-current-count="262" data-injectable="false">Baby Yoshi’s color depends on how long he stays in the egg. If you beat the Iron Adonis Brothers in less than six minutes, you’ll get the default green. However,<strong> the color changes every few minutes after that until it hits the 20-minute mark and starts over.</strong></p> <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="539" data-injectable="true">This means that if you start a timer and push your way up to the Iron Adonis fight, you can choose what color you want. Just wait in the fight until your time comes up, then run. <strong>I would recommend that you save first</strong> and be careful not to save again if you get the wrong color.</p>
 <p data-characters="63" data-current-count="63" data-injectable="false">With that in mind, here are the colors and the timing you need.</p> <figure data-found-rows="8" data-current-count="683" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td>Color</td><td>Time</td></tr><tr><td>Green</td><td>0-6 Minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Red</td><td>6-9 Minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Blue</td><td>9-12 Minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Orange</td><td>12-15 Minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Pink</td><td>15-18 Minutes</td></tr><tr><td>Black</td><td>18-19 Minutes</td></tr><tr><td>White</td><td>19-20 Minutes</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>
 <p data-characters="149" data-current-count="149" data-injectable="false">After 20 minutes have passed, the cycle starts again. So between 20-26 minutes, you’ll get green Yoshi. 38-39 minutes and you’ll get black Yoshi.</p> <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="392" data-injectable="false">It can be a little tricky to get the timing right, so make sure that you save first. If you do, you can always just try again for another color. You cannot change the color after the fact, so you’ll need to get it right before moving on.</p> <p data-characters="93" data-current-count="485" data-injectable="false">Lastly, the color does not affect the stats or abilities of the Yoshi. It is purely cosmetic.</p>

            <p>
Atari has purchased the Intellivision brand, ending what Atari claims to be the "longest running console war in history".
</p>
<p>
Atari's home consoles went head-to-head with Mattel's Intellivision in the late 1970s and 1980s, long before Nintendo and Sega competed in the 1990s. Intellivision even enlisted actor <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYLly625cXE">George Plimpton for an infamous series of adverts</a> comparing the two consoles.

</p>
<p>
Now Atari owns the rights to over 200 games from the Intellivision portfolio and its trademarks. However, Intellivision Entertainment will continue developing and distributing the <a href="https://intellivision.com/">Amico console</a> under a new brand and with a licence from Atari to distribute new versions of Intellivision games on that console.

<p>
"This was a very rare opportunity to unite former competitors and bring together fans of Atari, Intellivision and the golden age of gaming," said Atari chairman and CEO Wade Rosen.
</p>
<p>
"Atari has been a valuable partner and we have every confidence they will be a responsible steward of the storied Intellivision brand," said Phil Adam, CEO of Intellivision Entertainment. "We look forward to our expanded collaboration and the prospect of bringing a broad array of new titles to the Amico family gaming platform."
</p>
<p>
Atari will now expand the digital and physical distribution of Intellivision games, explore brand and licensing opportunities, and potentially create new games.
</p>
<p>
So, perhaps a <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/atari-2600-10306">Lego Intellivision to match the Atari</a>? Until then, there's a new t-shirt.

Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atari-has-bought-rollercoaster-tycoon-3-for-7m">Atari bought the rights to Rollercoaster Tycoon 3</a> from developer Frontier, meaning it's now the sole publisher of all games in the theme park sim series.

</p>
<p>
Before that, last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/atari-has-acquired-the-rights-to-a-load-of-old-retro-ip-including-busby-and-hardball">Atari bought the rights to over 100 retro games</a> from the 80s and 90s, including Bubsy, Demolition Racer, and more.

According to the announcement, Atari will take over the Intellivision brand and over 200 games from its library.</p><p>“Atari will seek to expand digital and physical distribution of legacy Intellivision games, potentially create new games, and explore brand and licensing opportunities,” Atari wrote in the press release.</p><p>Interestingly, though, this deal doesn’t include the <a href="https://kotaku.com/intellivision-amico-android-console-1851045271">Intellivision Amico</a>. Atari stated that Intellivision would rebrand itself and continue to work on developing the console project that was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/10/22/18008970/intellivision-amico-console-announcement-release-date-price">originally scheduled to launch in 2020</a> and was once headed up by “prolific” video game composer <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/16/24074902/tommy-tallarico-oof-hbomberguy-mtv-cribs-house-listing">Tommy Tallarico</a>. Atari said that the company formerly known as Intellivision would rebrand itself and that it would grant licensing rights to the new company permitting it to feature Intellivision games on the console.</p><p>“We look forward to our expanded collaboration and the prospect of bringing a broad array of new titles to the Amico family gaming platform,” said Intellivision CEO Phil Adam in the press release.</p><p>Atari and Intellivision competed against each other with their dueling Atari 2600 and Intellivision home consoles. Developed by Mattel Electronics and introduced in 1979, the Intellivision sold roughly 5 million units by 1990. Atari has established itself as a retro gaming-focused company, relaunching <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24113699/atari-400-mini-hands-on">mini</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/22/23841336/atari-2600-plus-compatible-with-7800-cartridges">versions</a> of its consoles, supporting the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23451349/atari-50-review-xbox-playstation-switch-steam">rerelease of its games on modern consoles</a>, acquiring retro gaming developers like Digital Eclipse, and now buying its retro gaming peer.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="zDFE9y">If imitation really is the sincerest form of flattery, Alex Roberts’ <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/23632869/dnd-dungeons-dragons-alternatives-role-play-storytelling"><em>For the Queen</em></a> might be the most lavishly complimented game in indie role-playing game history. First published in 2019 by <a href="https://evilhat.com/roleplaying-games">Evil Hat Productions</a>, the company behind <em>Fate</em>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22446171/blades-in-the-dark-rpg-review-evil-hat"><em>Blades in the Dark</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23342844/queer-tabletop-games-thirsty-sword-lesbians"><em>Thirsty Sword Lesbians</em></a>, <em>Monster of the Week</em>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23759900/apocalypse-keys-rpg-preview-impressions-release-date-price"><em>Apocalypse Keys</em></a>, among many other games, <em>For the Queen </em>was an immediate sensation among indie tabletop fans. It’s a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/23997106/best-rpgs-zero-no-prep-dnd-alternative-indie-tabletop">no-prep, no-GM storytelling game</a> that’s designed to build high drama and deep emotion quickly: Players create their characters through play by drawing from a deck of narrative prompt cards that let them build a fraught, conflicted relationship with the enigmatic queen they love and serve. The best proof that Roberts’ design is appealing and inviting? It’s inspired a <a href="https://itch.io/c/534770/descended-from-the-queen">huge wave</a> of <a href="https://www.forthedrama.com/listejeux">independent, self-published</a> <a href="https://itch.io/c/1481461/descended-from-the-queen">copycat games</a>. </p>
<p id="hlMftl">Roberts, also the creator of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/5/7/17328112/star-crossed-shipper-tabletop-game-kickstarter"><em>Star Crossed</em></a> and <a href="https://helloalexroberts.itch.io/">many other indie RPGs</a>, published <em>For the Queen</em> under a Creative Commons license, giving other creators the right to make their own structurally similar RPGs under the label <a href="https://forthequeengame.com/">Descended From the Queen</a>. Those games vary immensely in tone, content, and intent, but they all credit Roberts’ work as their inspiration, which has just bolstered <em>For the Queen</em>’s reputation further.</p>
<p id="f2mZaf"><em>For the Queen</em> now has an <a href="https://darringtonpress.com/announcing-for-the-queen/">expanded, updated second edition</a> that was released by Critical Role’s publishing house, Darrington Press. Polygon caught up with Roberts via Zoom to talk about what the new edition of <em>For the Queen</em> adds and changes, why she wants to do an explicit adults-only version of the game, how she feels about the dozens of RPGs she’s inspired (and which ones she recommends), and why the highlight of her career was designing a LARP about kinky balloon fetishists.</p>

<p id="TA7cLO"><strong>Polygon: Why did you move </strong><em><strong>For the Queen</strong></em><strong> from Evil Hat to Darrington Press?</strong></p>
<p id="LeGqkw"><strong>Alex Roberts:</strong> <em>For the Queen</em> was the last boxed game Evil Hat put out. Since then, they have been doing exclusively books. When they made that change, <em>For the Queen</em> was 80% done, so they finished it, which was nice — but it was almost on the chopping block, actually. Some people within the company advocated for it, so I was very happy that they put it out at all. It has been a little indie success, or critical success, or something, so that’s been really nice, but obviously, over the years — I think they were not displeased when I was like, “I’ve been chatting with other publishers about the possibility of someone else putting it out.”</p>
<p id="yV6gjA">There was a lot of love for the game internally, but — I don’t want to say they didn’t know what to do with it, but it was just not really in-line with where they put their efforts. You could get it in specialty game shops, but you couldn’t get it more broadly. And it’s kind of a role-playing game, but it’s also kind of not. So it was in a weird section of their website. Basically, I had been wanting to do a second edition or an expansion, and I kind of thought Evil Hat wasn’t going to be down for that.</p>
<p id="xG27yi">A friend of mine at Darrington said “Hey, we’re looking to publish more games, do you maybe want to do something with us?” In the summer of 2022, they had tagged me into work on <a href="https://shop.critrole.com/products/till-the-last-gasp"><em>Till the Last Gasp</em></a>, a two-player game I did some design work on. So I’d had a good experience working with them. When Darcy Ross, their marketing manager, reached out to me and said “You want to do something else? Maybe we could publish an Alex Roberts game?” I was like, “I’ve actually been looking for maybe a new publisher for a second edition of <em>For the Queen</em>.” And [Darrington head] Ivan Van Norman emails me right away. Basically, the response was, “Yes. We are huge fans.” I know a couple of the Critical Role folks are big fans of <em>For the Queen</em>, and they jumped on it. There was just so much enthusiasm for the game on their side that it was very easy to be like, “Okay, great, let’s go!”</p>

<p id="fFrc6d"><strong>What did you want to address with a second edition? What needed changing or expanding?</strong></p>
<p id="PEUoWG">For the most part, it was about expanding. I wanted to write more cards. I wanted to write new prompts. People tell me the game has a lot of replayability — there’s enough randomization and enough ambiguity in the questions that nobody ever answers a question the same way twice. But I have been playing that game a lot since it was a pile of notecards in a little purse. I would write new cards and take some out — I played it so much in playtesting and promoting it, playing it with different people. I knew I wanted new things in it. My personal copy had new, handwritten cards in it. So I mostly wanted to add to it.</p>
<p id="f05a8t">But there were also certain things in the rules — the way the “pass” mechanic is phrased always seems to cause stumbles, often enough that I don’t like it. There were one or two cards — they’re supposed to be ambiguous and interpretive, but one or two sometimes made players scratch their heads, or stop play for a second. And I know it’s perfectly normal for people playing a board game to be reading through the rules and have to stop and go, “Wait, what does that mean?” and maybe Google it or something. I know that’s totally fine. But I hate it! Not in my game. I wanted it to be smooth as silk; I just want it to flow.</p>
<p id="fscfzg">So there were a few little things I wanted to change, and there was so much to add. And then on top of that, Darrington was like, “We want twice as many queen illustrations in the second edition.”<em> </em>There are like 25 queens in the new edition. The first one, I think, had 12 or 15. And that’s so exciting to me, especially because everyone who has the first edition will still have all of their original queens that they love, and they get to add more.</p>

<p id="hxIE24"><strong>Does the new edition have more prompt cards, or just tweaked, different prompts?</strong></p>
<p id="kGJ0lU">More. I think there were only two questions I took out, and then there are 10 new ones that I added. And some of them have been rephrased. </p>
<p id="u4ljPC"><strong>You’ve mentioned wanting to do expansions of the game as well. What did you have in mind?</strong></p>
<p id="h6Rx0X">That’s definitely something I still want to do. <em>For the Queen</em> fans should buy this game a lot, so that there’s every economic reason to let me simply write prompt cards for the rest of my life. There are a couple of expansions I would really like to do. In my mind, I just want to do more prompts, but if I really thought about it, I’m sure I could also introduce new mechanics to the game. Theoretically, you could make a different setup — imagine the same questions about the queen, but instead of being on a journey to a distant power to broker an alliance in a time of peril, you’d be doing something else. </p>
<p id="aeN3gD">I’d love to do an adults-only expansion that really emphasizes your more intimate relationship with the queen, where cards could be quite explicit. Obviously, there’s always an intense power dynamic between player characters and the queen, and people, for lack of a better term, get horny about that! So people bring that to the game. But I also know people play with their kids. Kids understand profound power dynamics in a different way — they understand it, and they can play with it, let me tell you — but I would love to be able to write cards that are not for kids. [<em>Laughs</em>] And that explore that more explicitly.</p>
<p id="aur1Fz">I also think it would be interesting to write questions that were specifically about rebellion — say, that assume some of you are planning to betray the queen, and maybe you can have ambiguous feelings about that. Or ones specifically suited to a particular setting — like ones that assume you’re in space, and she’s a spaceship queen.</p>
<p id="Tkfp4V">I would love to make more Descended from the Queen games, and do sequels to <em>For the Queen</em>. I already have some sequels in progress. But part of me just wants to release booster packs, like Pokémon cards. </p>

<p id="FEHofg"><strong>Both editions of </strong><em><strong>For the Queen</strong></em><strong> are so built around aesthetics, particularly the sleek custom game boxes. If you started releasing booster packs, wouldn’t you have to rethink how the game is boxed and packaged?</strong></p>
<p id="zSbeJa">In the alternate universe where <em>For the Queen</em> is as popular as <em>Magic: the Gathering</em> or something, [I imagine] people are deck-building, and they have their custom decks, and their own boxes for them. Whenever I’m working on a prompt-based game, I like to put [the working copy] in a cute little purse or makeup bag. So everyone could have their own little pet deck. But that’s really pie-in-the-sky thinking. I would just love to be able to write more for this game, and give people the option to expand on the experience and take it in new directions.</p>
<p id="DE7B0b"><strong>The Descended from the Queen phenomenon is such a unique aspect of this game, with so many other people using this engine to create their own games. What was the original conversation like in terms of putting the game out under a Creative Commons license?</strong></p>
<p id="YlbBem">To me, there was no reason to not do it, or not support it. The thing is, nobody needs my permission to make a game that is functionally Descended from the Queen. It’s just a bunch of cards. And it’s not like <em>For the Queen</em> is the first game to use that format. For a lot of people, it’s the first one they’ve encountered. But there’s quite a tradition to have a game in a deck of cards. There’s <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/144510/183-Days" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">a game called <em>183 Days</em></a>; my gosh, it’s a fantastic game. It’s beautiful. It’s a little more complex than <em>For the Queen</em>, because eventually, the deck gets split into two, and it’s all very procedural.</p>
<p id="SGrVF4">And one of my favorite live-action role-playing games of all time, the one I recommend to first-time LARPers, is <a href="https://bullypulpitgames.com/products/juggernaut">Jason Morningstar’s <em>Juggernaut</em></a>. You just pull the first card and it tells you what to do, but then some of those cards end up belonging to a machine that tells the future. It’s a great piece of tech.</p>
<p id="WA02bd">The most obvious antecedent of <em>For the Queen</em> is <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/169890/The-Beast" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Aleksandra Sontowska’s <em>The Beast</em></a>, a one-player RPG where basically, you find a monster and bring it home, and slowly, over the course of the game, you develop a sexual relationship with it. It’s very different content than <em>For the Queen</em>, and it’s about journal prompts rather than questions and follow-up questions and <em>For the Queen</em>’s group dynamic. But I played it and loved it, and it was a big influence on me. </p>
<p id="wn19bM">So encouraging people to make games inspired by <em>For the Queen</em> — people are gonna do it. I love that they do it. Why not support it? If there’s some kind of commercial or business aspect to that decision, I’m sure it exists. I just know I’m stoked when people approach me and say, “I made a game because of your game<em>.</em>” So I really just genuinely want to encourage that.</p>

<p id="tevt0P"><strong>I’ve seen authors similarly say they love fanfic inspired by their work — but they also often say they can’t read it, whether for legal reasons, or because they can’t have someone else’s version of their characters taking up space in their heads. Have you played many Descended from the Queen games?</strong></p>
<p id="7bvuBG">I embrace it in theory. The first Descended from the Queen game — which was a bit like <a href="https://buriedwithoutceremony.com/monsterhearts"><em>Monsterhearts</em></a> was to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/22787981/powered-by-the-apocalypse-tabletop-rpg-explainer"><em>Apocalypse World</em></a> — I think that started before <em>For the Queen</em> was even out. It’s called <a href="https://jennmartin.itch.io/reunion%20is%20it%20called%20reunion?"><em>Reunion</em>, by Jenn Martin, Andy Munich, and Yoshi Creelman</a>. All three of them are <em>For the Queen</em> fans, and I think <em>Reunion</em> was originally conceived as “the retinue of <em>For the Queen </em>is coming back, years later.” The prompts are all in the sense of “Do you remember that time? Remember how this used to happen?” I’ve gotten to play that, and I really love it. Partially because it innovates on the format in interesting ways —  you actually pull questions and ask them of someone else, rather than answering them yourself. It has a very distinct relationship with time, where <em>For the Queen</em> has an ambiguous relationship with time. So that one’s great.</p>
<p id="8xvN5I">So is <a href="https://temporalhiccup.itch.io/keepers-of-the-cards"><em>Keepers of the Cards</em></a>. That one’s kind of a <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crunchyroll.com%2Fseries%2FGRNQP873R%2Fcardcaptor-sakura&amp;referrer=polygon.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2Ftabletop-games%2F24161224%2Ffor-the-queen-second-edition-changes-darrington-press-descended-games" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___pl__p_23925265__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516586\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GRNQP873R/cardcaptor-sakura\u0026referrer=polygon.com\u0026sref=https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24161224/for-the-queen-second-edition-changes-darrington-press-descended-games&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:50,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;xcust&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;xcust&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23925265__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;66960X1516586&quot;,&quot;xs&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GRNQP873R/cardcaptor-sakura&quot;,&quot;referrer&quot;:&quot;polygon.com&quot;,&quot;sref&quot;:&quot;https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/24161224/for-the-queen-second-edition-changes-darrington-press-descended-games&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}"><em>Cardcaptor Sakura</em></a> fan game, which makes sense, [given the importance of] <a href="https://ccsakura.fandom.com/wiki/Clow_Cards">the clow cards</a>, right? And there’s one called <a href="https://nycavri.itch.io/descending-the-stairs"><em>Descending the Stairs</em></a> about a venue that’s closing, and you’re there on its last night, so you’re having this very specific relationship with time. So in theory, I’m all about it. In practice… I have a once-a-month RPG meetup, and when I’m there, I want to play something very new. I play a little bit outside of that. Someday I’ll go to a gaming convention again. So I’d love to play more Descended from the Queen games, but my priority is to play something that feels really new to me. All of us have our white-whale games. Someday I’d love to play <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Roleplaying_Game">West End’s Star Wars game</a>, just once. </p>
<p id="MWMZ2J"><strong>What’s the status of your spinoff game </strong><em><strong>For the Cube</strong></em><strong>?</strong></p>
<p id="0Sb2xt">[<em>Laughs</em>] <em>For the Cube</em> is a game that 75% of the time, works like magic and people love it, and then the rest of the time, it doesn’t quite hit right. So it’s still in playtesting. Again, if <em>For the Queen</em> does really, really well, maybe Darrington will put it out there and kick me to finish it. But it is in progress. It is happening. I would not be surprised if it exists as a viable product in the next year or two. It’s coming down the pipe, but it’s taking its time.</p>

<p id="XxsEvQ"><strong>You’re known most for </strong><em><strong>For the Queen</strong></em><strong> and </strong><em><strong>Star Crossed</strong></em><strong>, but you have so many smaller games out there, many of them independently published. What are you proudest of? Or what would you point a </strong><em><strong>For the Queen</strong></em><strong> fan to if they want something very different that still has your sensibility?</strong></p>
<p id="zJeWu5">Okay, so I have two answers. The game people probably want to play is <a href="https://helloalexroberts.itch.io/our-time-on-earth"><em>Our Time on Earth</em></a>, a two-player game that you play asynchronously, in six days or six weeks or six months. You message each other, or write letters, whatever, that kind of epistolary format. And you pretend that the two of you are aliens visiting Earth for a limited time, for six days or six weeks or six months. And you send each other messages about what you’re experiencing in the world.</p>
<p id="13iOR6">It’s a very sweet game that takes place in these very small moments. If you want to hear an actual play, I was on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/4SHXpDJXucWVdWdpRqYp4n"><em>Party of One</em> with Jeff Stormer</a>, and we played it over audio messages to each other. It’s very soft. It’s an understated game, and it takes place in these tiny little experiences with one person. It’s very easy to play, because all you need is a friend who lives far away, and I think we all have a friend who lives far away, who we don’t see as often as we would like. </p>

<p id="oVLjBF">So that’s my palatable answer that is probably accurate to what people want. But here’s the thing: The best game I’ve ever made is <em>Pop!</em> It’s a live-action game about a community of balloon fetishists. It’s in the <a href="https://pelgranepress.com/product/honey-hot-wax/"><em>Honey and Hot Wax</em> anthology</a> of live-action games, although I don’t think this game is erotic. I think it’s just about sex, kind of. It came out in March 2020, when <em>nobody</em> was playing games that involved intimate contact.</p>
<p id="3XBELn"><em>Pop!</em> is the best game I’ve ever made. I’m so proud of it. Everyone who’s played it has had a beautiful experience. It’s played in person — you put up a bunch of paper on the walls and you write on it with markers, because you’re playing an online community. So you’re in the room with other people, but you’re not actually interacting face-to-face with them until the last act of the game, which is a little half-hour in-person meetup, where you meet all your friends and enemies from online in person. And people always act differently online than they do in person, and that carries over to role-play as well. </p>
<p id="LtPAqq">Some people love to pop balloons, and that’s fun and hot. Some people have a phobic response to popping. And all those people are trying to get along in a community together. I thought about that game for years. I never thought I would actually make it, because I thought <em>Nobody wants to play my game about balloon kinksters</em>. But I went to an artist residency in Corvallis, Oregon, and I was like, <em>Okay, this is my one chance</em>, so we did it and ran it, and it was so fun and so great. I wish more people would play it. </p>
<p id="WAaCG9">If you can get 10 to 12 people into a room with a lot of paper and pens, and everyone’s willing to play about the things we didn’t think we would ever have in common with other people — it’s a game about desire and finding belonging, and then having that belonging challenged, and how we get along with people. How our insecurities and peculiarities can get in the way of that. And feeling like a freak, and then feeling like a member of a group. That’s my real answer. I wish everyone would play <em>Pop!</em></p>

<p id="IeJUGt"><strong>Looping back to </strong><em><strong>For the Queen</strong></em><strong> — it’s such a flexible game. I’ve seen it played almost comedically, or for high drama. It can be a game about loyalty, or longing, or about vengeance against someone who dares to make you feel desire you can’t act on. Do you have a favorite playthrough experience?</strong></p>
<p id="2N6Q26">I’ve had a few. I played it with a friend of mine on a road trip. They were driving, and I was in the passenger seat. Something about that format gave us so much opportunity to answer questions, and then really sit and reflect on them, and stare out the window and talk about relationships.</p>
<p id="qaBZML">But honestly, something that is really memorable, that really stays with me, was playtesting the game with my dad and sister. My dad had never played a role-playing game before. In that game — I won’t go into too much detail, but I learned a lot about how my father feels about his military service. For whatever reason, there was a way to learn that through this game, and through his fictional character, who was a soldier in service of the queen. For whatever reason, I hadn’t learned about that before, and I don’t know if there would have been another way to understand that side of him. So that one definitely sticks out for me.  </p>

Disappointingly enough, Druckmann spends chunks of the interview hyping up AI technology as a cost-cutting measure. As a person who is a fan of <em>The Last of Us</em>’ writing when it’s written by people like <em>Part II</em>’s narrative lead Halley Gross, it’s a huge fucking bummer to see him even entertaining that AI could be used to write dialogue, even as he passively mentions “ethical issues” with zero follow up. He says that as long as one can “precisely direct” AI tools, they could be used to create “nuanced dialogues and characters.” Were the beloved ones you and your team created with their hearts, minds, and skills not enough?</p><p>“AI is really going to revolutionize how content is being created, although it does bring up some ethical issues we need to address,” Druckmann said. “With technologies like AI and the ability to do motion capture right from home, we’re reducing both costs and technical hurdles, opening the door for us to take on more adventurous projects and push the boundaries of storytelling in games. This evolution is truly empowering creators to bring their visions to life without the traditional obstacles.”</p><p>Whatever your feelings on <em>The Last of Us</em>, the series has been considered one of the most important narrative franchises in AAA video games of the past decade (and if you forget, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-tv-hbo-greatest-story-ever-craig-mazin-1849912030&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-tv-hbo-greatest-story-ever-craig-mazin-1849912030">someone working on the franchise will remind you</a></span>, don’t worry). To hear the man behind that advocate for AI as a means to write characters and dialogue, rather than standing up for the human element that brought your studio so much prestige under <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/as-naughty-dog-crunches-on-the-last-of-us-ii-developer-1842289962&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/as-naughty-dog-crunches-on-the-last-of-us-ii-developer-1842289962">brutal working conditions</a></span>, is clown shit. Irresponsible, even.</p><p>Beyond that, Druckmann does talk about Naughty Dog’s next project. He says it’s “perhaps the most thrilling” game the studio has ever put out and that he’s “eager” to see how the game resonates with fans following the success of <em>TLOU</em>. He also signs off by saying this mystery game “could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming.” I guess that at least confirms Naughty Dog’s hyperbolic hubris is still intact.</p><p>While we don’t know when Naughty Dog’s next game will come out, Druckmann is also working on <em>The Last of Us</em>’ live-action show, which is currently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-joel-ellie-hbo-max-pedro-pascal-1851478803&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-joel-ellie-hbo-max-pedro-pascal-1851478803">shooting its second season</a></span>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2419240/Sushi_Ben/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">SteamVR</a> release is also planned.</p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><div><p>Fancy a cozy adventure in a stunning locale? Inspired by real-life experiences, Sushi Ben drops you into an idyllic seaside town rich with addictive mini-games and curious characters across an anime-inspired slice-of-life sim.</p><p>I’m excited for the chance to give players insight into what to expect in Sushi Ben and announce that the game launches May 28 for PlayStation VR2. I’ll also include some additional insights on the creation of this game from Big Brane co-founder Kane Tyler, who first conceived the idea of <em>Sushi Ben</em> as part of his college thesis.</p><p><strong>Mini Slices of Life</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In <em>Sushi Ben</em>, players are tasked with saving a sushi bar from going out of business as a group of land developers try to buy up all the property in town. You will assist the townsfolk with various activities and tasks to cultivate business.</p><p>As one would expect, <em>Sushi Ben</em> has a wonderful fishing game at its core. As you develop relationships with the locals and complete quests, you’ll fish for the particular type each customer wants so that you can bring their business into the restaurant. That’s only the tip of the iceberg, though.</p><p>The townsfolk have unique motivations and desires and, thus, have a wide range of mini-games for players to engage with. There’s table tennis, stone carving, bug catching, dog walking, archery, and more. Each one takes advantage of the dynamic movements that make virtual reality gaming immersive and exciting, challenging players to get moving and use their hand-eye coordination in fun ways.</p><p><strong>Storytelling in <a title="Genres > Virtual Reality [139 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/virtual-reality">Virtual Reality</a></strong></p><p>We at Big Brane hope players are captivated by how the story is told. The freedom of VR, where players have a perpetually unlocked ability to look anywhere at any time, creates some challenges when directing focus. To attract the player’s eye, you must make things stand out, and that’s where our dynamic manga panels come into play.</p><p>The thesis specifically focused on filmmaking techniques in virtual reality, which is a significant challenge given that the player is the camera. It’s our job then to provide visual clues and guidance, and Kane, while watching JoJo’s Bizarre <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,475 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">Adventure</a>, was suddenly inspired by the idea of manga panels. Using manga panels as a dynamic focal point for VR users became the driving force behind the thesis. </p><p><strong>The Pursuit of Authenticity</strong></p><p><em>Sushi Ben</em>‘s seaside village is inspired by thousands of hours of research and by Kane’s time working at a sushi bar with a Chef named Takayuki “Ben” Okuda. When the pandemic prevented many from traveling globally, Kane invested tons and tons of hours into using Google Maps to explore the world and find particular elements that could feed into this authentic representation of a seaside town in Japan, but inspired by the home-town feel of Kane’s neighborhood in Savannah, Georgia. </p><p><em>Sushi Ben</em> is written by Hato Moa, writer of the indie hit Hatoful Boyfriend. Kane dreamed of bringing in voice actors he was a fan of from different anime. Still, he put control of this effort in Hato Moa’s hands because she was in Japan and had the experience and familiarity to get the right people for the gig. It just so happened that Moa shared the same goals, agreeing to their ideal cast in unison. The game’s script blew away the voice actors. Moa, Kane, and the crew ran with their enthusiasm. </p><p><strong>Features and Accessibility</strong></p><p>From the start, the game was designed to be approachable for any VR player – new or experienced. In addition to featuring a gameplay experience with a serene and interesting setting and cozy mini-games, <em>Sushi Ben</em> also has features for VR players that address player comfort and ability. There are options for sitting and standing players, and for those who choose to sit or are differently abled, there’s a height adjustment that allows you to remain seated but have the perspective come from a taller point of view.</p><p>For those desiring different degrees of comfort with VR, there are various settings like full locomotion and teleportation options for movement and snap turning or smooth rotations. In addition, dialogue can be set to autoplay, or players can enjoy the Story Mode, which skips the game portions entirely, allowing them to focus on the narrative. This and many other settings can be changed anytime to accommodate every player’s desired experience.  </p><p><em>Sushi Ben</em> takes advantage of a few features as it comes over to PS VR2, enhancing the visual quality, and giving players a more immersive experience with detailed haptics.</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The PS5 library has grown considerably over the past few years, and if you've been gaming since 2020, there's a good chance you're running out of storage space. It's not uncommon to see titles take up 100GB or more--meaning your drive can fill up from just a handful of games. If you're juggling games on and off your PS5, consider picking up the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JHKSNNG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung 980 Pro SSD with Heatsink (2TB)</a>, as it's on sale for just $140 (down from $230) until tonight at 10 PM PT / 1 AM ET (May 23).</p><p>This is one of Best Buy's deals of the day, and Amazon is matching the price. Amazon's deal will likely disappear not long after Best Buy's offer expires.</p><div title="6523669 - Samsung SSD Deal" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2399" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6523669 - Samsung SSD Deal" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JHKSNNG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B09JHKSNNG?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JHKSNNG?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Samsung 980 Pro SSD with Heatsink (2TB)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JHKSNNG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B09JHKSNNG?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JHKSNNG?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$140 (was $230)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The SSD has been priced around $180 throughout most of the year--deals such as this one have become increasingly uncommon in 2024. That makes this current offer of $140 for 2TB mighty enticing. This model includes a built-in heatsink, so getting it installed in your PS5 requires little more than popping off the faceplate and undoing a few screws. The Samsung 980 Pro has been one of the most popular storage expansion solutions for years. We tested the 980 Pro, and it's still working perfectly years later. It' virtually indistinguishable from the PS5's internal SSD. </p>                      </div><p>Of course, you can also use this with your PC. This high-end NVMe SSD boasts read speeds up to 7,000MB/s and write speeds up to 5,100MB/s. If you do use it on PC, you can check out the Samsung Magician software to get updates on the drive's health, overall performance, and check for firmware updates.</p><p>While the sale isn't as generous, you'll find the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JHL33X7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung 980 Pro SSD with Heatsink (1TB)</a> on sale for $120 (down from $165). </p><p>Keep in mind that Best Buy is offering this sale as its Deal of the Day, and Amazon is simply price matching. That means there's a strong possibility the SSD will jump in price tomorrow.

        <p>Platform holder emphasises 'Creative Entertainment Vision' is not directly related to in-development products</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Sony has shared a video that shows the results of a prototyping exercise in which its teams imagined what future products from the company might look like, including PlayStation.</p>
<p>In the video below, you'll see a mix of transparent smartphones, augmented reality headsets, and a games controller with a ring light in the middle.</p>
<p>The footage was first shown at Sony's annual corporate strategy meeting, where it shared its 'Creative Entertainment Vision' for where it aims to be in ten years.</p>
<p>There are also appearances from Aloy, the protagonist from Horizon Zero Dawn and Horizon Forbidden West, as well as Sony positioning Horizon as a key IP along Ghostbusters and others.</p>
<p>The video description emphasizes that anything shown "is not directy related to any existing Sony products of services."</p>

Druckmann is expectedly vague about Naughty Dog's next big project but offers an enticing tease, saying, "I'm eager to see how this new game resonates, especially following the success of The Last of Us, as it could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming."</p>

<p>The interview, however, primarily focuses on technology and how it improves and makes it easier for creators to tell unique stories. Regarding AI, Druckmann says, "AI is really going to revolutionize how content is being created, although it does bring up some ethical issues we need to address. With technologies like AI and the ability to do motion capture right from home, we're reducing both costs and technical hurdles, opening the door for us to take on more adventurous projects and push the boundaries of storytelling in games."</p>

<p>He also briefly touches on the future of <em>The Last of Us</em> TV show, citing that modern technology has allowed him to oversee the TV show's second season remotely from Los Angeles while it shoots in Canada.</p>

<p data-characters="300" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Most live service games end up going through a rough period of development every so often. Just <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-month-ahead-of-the-final-shape-destiny-2s-community-is-at-ease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">look at <em>Destiny 2</em></a>, for example! <em>Helldivers 2</em>, however, is practically speedrunning in this respect. Thankfully, things are slowly settling down now that the former CEO, Johan Pilestedt, is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-ceo-steps-down-so-he-can-focus-more-on-actually-making-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">back in action</a>.</p> <p data-characters="524" data-current-count="524" data-injectable="true">More specifically, after <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-review-bomb-cape-design-may-be-real/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the review bombing of <em>Helldivers 2</em></a> and the game’s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/arrowhead-ceo-admits-helldivers-2s-balancing-isnt-what-it-should-be/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">questionable balancing updates</a>, the former CEO decided it was time for him to give up the business side of things and refocus on the game itself. Thus, Pilestedt stepped down from his position of CEO to step into the shoes of <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s chief creative officer and chairman. Unsurprisingly, Pilestedt already has some promising ideas on where to take <em>Helldivers 2</em> next, and many of them stem from the game’s time-to-kill or TTK.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Very good question. First thing we got to do is ensure we get more devs time playing the game. It's hard to make the right decisions if the eyes aren't on the road.</p><p>Secondly, I want to ensure we actively look at the sentiment and create a holistic view of WHY feedback is given.…</p></div>— Pilestedt (@Pilestedt) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pilestedt/status/1793271764245463503?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 22, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <h2 id="h-moving-forward-johan-pilestedt-has-big-plans-for-helldivers-2-balance" data-injectable="false">Moving forward, Johan Pilestedt has big plans for Helldivers 2 balance</h2> <p data-characters="598" data-current-count="898" data-injectable="true">According to Pilestedt, who’s been responding to various community questions on Twitter, he intends to get more developers to spend hands-on time with the game’s current sandbox. He also wants to take the players’ own sentiments into account while handling balancing questions in order to create a “holistic view of WHY feedback is given.” Hard to complain about that! The TTK bit is particularly interesting, however, as Pilestedt feels that many of the players’ issues with <em>Helldivers 2</em> stem from the fact that the game’s time-to-kill is simply too high.</p>
 <p data-characters="171" data-current-count="171" data-injectable="false">Thankfully, this doesn’t appear to mean that Arrowhead will simply carve a chunk out of each enemy’s health and call it. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-discord-key-player-questions-responds-to-growing-balancing-concerns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Weapon balancing</a>, too, is on the menu.</p>  <figure data-current-count="471" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="315" data-current-count="315" data-injectable="false">Overall, then, this could be the big turning point that the community has been waiting for. If Pilestedt can rally Arrowhead and begin enacting positive, meaningful changes to <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s current sandbox, the game might yet correct its course and reinvigorate the players to jump back into the thick of it.</p> <p data-characters="390" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true">That’s not to say that <em>Helldivers 2</em> is in any real trouble, of course, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1b9k51r/rant_and_vent_megathread/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game’s biggest subreddit has grown increasingly negative </a>as time goes on, with most players eagerly anticipating Arrowhead’s next move. As one would expect, some players have already been hard at work deconstructing Pilestedt’s tweets with hard statistics to back their arguments with:<br></p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="314" data-current-count="614" data-injectable="true">And, really, Arrowhead would do well to take into account this particularly passionate section of the community. So far, it seems that this is <em>precisely</em> what’s going on behind the scenes, but we won’t know what’s really up with the game’s sandbox until a few more balancing updates drop in.</p>
 <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">For one, I’m thrilled with the fact that Arrowhead Games is <em>at least</em> reverting the massively bolstered enemy patrol spawns sometime down the line. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-discord-key-player-questions-responds-to-growing-balancing-concerns/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Playing <em>Helldivers 2</em> solo</a> has never been quite as problematic as it’s been as of late, but with a balance patch or two and some engaging new content, a solution is already on the horizon. Let’s see how it pans out!</p>

            <p>The Last of Us and Uncharted 4 creative director Neil Druckmann has said Naughty Dog's next game could "redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming".</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/2.html">interview</a> shared today to coincide with Sony's corporate strategy meeting, the studio head was asked about what dream project he would like to see realised. In response, Druckmann said he has been "lucky to work on several dream projects" already, before adding he is "currently excited about a new one".</p>
<p>This undisclosed project, Druckmann said, could be Naughty Dog's "most thrilling yet".</p>

<p>"There's a growing appreciation for gaming that transcends all age groups, unlike when I was growing up," he elaborated. "This shift is highlighted by our venture into television with The Last of Us, which I hoped would bridge the gap between gamers and non-gamers. The show's success has spotlighted gaming, illustrating the rich, immersive experiences it offers.</p>
<p>"This visibility excites me not only for our current project but for the broader potential of gaming to captivate a global audience. I'm eager to see how this new game resonates, especially following the success of The Last of Us, as it could redefine mainstream perceptions of gaming."</p>
<p>While Druckmann's words are vague, it does not seem likely this upcoming project is The Last of Us Part 3. "You have to take risks to find new ideas that connect with audiences, and even though Uncharted was a chart-topping success, it was important for our studio to innovate again with a new franchise like The Last of Us," Druckmann said during the interview. "Many companies would insist on sticking to profitable franchises, but [Sony's] culture and philosophy empower us to pursue new ideas.</p>
<p>"Art requires risk; You can't engineer perfectly and predict how successful it will be. I'm incredibly thankful that [Sony] trusts us to leverage our past successes to explore brand new creative avenues."</p>
<p>There have long been rumours that a third instalment in The Last of Us series will come one day, and Druckmann previously stated the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-3-has-a-story-outline-neil-druckmann-hopes-will-one-day-see-the-light-of-day">studio had a story outline for Part 3 penned</a> which he hoped "one day can see the light of day". However, nothing has been confirmed to be in development.</p>
<p>Last year Druckmann additionally stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-moving-on-from-uncharted-open-to-the-last-of-us-part-3-if-it-has-a-compelling-story">Naughty Dog is open to developing Part 3</a>, but only if "[the team] can come up with a compelling story that has this universal message and statement about love", as it did with Parts 1 and 2.</p>
<p>"With The Last of Us, it's up to us whether we want to continue it or not... If we can't come up with something, we have a very strong ending with Part 2 and that will be the end," Druckmann said at the time.</p>
<p>As for what Naughty Dog could be working on next, previously, there was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-think-naughty-dog-left-a-clue-about-its-next-project-in-the-last-of-us-part-1">speculation the studio had its eyes on a fantasy-themed release</a>.</p>

<p>Elsewhere during today's conference, head of PlayStation Productions and head of product at PlayStation Studios <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/3.html">Asad Qizilbash</a> stated he believes games will shift their focus towards more immersive narratives and personalised player experiences in the next decade.</p>
<p>"Technological advancements will enhance emotional depth in games by allowing characters to be much more emotive and expressive, fostering more evocative storytelling," the PlayStation exec said. "That's going to help a whole generation of creators be able to just create so much more emotion in the stories. The focus is going to shift from graphics or visuals to immersive narratives that resonate long after the controller is set down.</p>
<p>"Regarding PlayStation's role in this evolution, I see it as a destination defined by community and a commitment to quality, unexpected and memorable experiences."</p>
<p>When asked what significant advancements he anticipates will have an impact on storytelling across the different forms of media over the coming decade, Qizilbash stated technology will "democratise" it and make it more accessible for creators as a result.</p>
<p>"With the level of fidelity in video games now, there's an opportunity to repurpose assets from games for animation and live-action films, leveraging Sony's volumetric and virtual production capabilities," he said. "Gaming engines like Unreal are expanding beyond games and being used for virtual production, enabling creators to focus on storytelling rather than logistical constraints. This freedom fosters creativity and allows creators to focus on delivering compelling stories.</p>
<p>"Advancements in AI will create more personalised experiences and meaningful stories for consumers. For instance, NPCs (Non Player Characters) in games could interact with players based on their actions, making it feel more personal."</p>
<p>This is something Qizilbash believes is important for younger audiences who "are the first generations that grew up digitally and are looking for personalisation across everything, as well as looking for experiences to have more meaning".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/strange-horticulture-sequel-strange-antiquities<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bad Viking and Iceberg Entertainment have announced a followup to&nbsp;<em>Strange Horticulture</em>&nbsp;titled&nbsp;<em>Strange Antiquities</em>, and if you loved the first game's blend of cozy atmosphere and spooky horror, you're in for a treat, it seems.</p>

<p><em>Strange Horticulture&nbsp;</em>put you in charge of a shop selling all kinds of curious plants, and if you cared to uncover it, there was a spooky mystery lurking underneath the light puzzling as well.</p>

<p>It looks like&nbsp;<em>Strange Antiquities&nbsp;</em>will continue that theme, only this time, your shop deals in curiosities of all stripes, not just botanical ones. It'll be set in the same town as&nbsp;<em>Horticulture</em>, though, so shop real estate must be insanely valuable there.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/strange-antiquities-strange-horticulture-sequel-eli-white.jpg?itok=LvmiA-JC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/strange-antiquities-strange-horticulture-sequel-eli-white.jpg?itok=1KNjAbmG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Are you ready to inherit your very own antiquities shop in&nbsp;<em>Strange Antiquities</em>?</figcaption></figure><p>Like its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>Antiquities&nbsp;</em>will marry that peculiar kind of atmosphere you encounter in Ye Olde Curiosity Shoppe-style places with an undercurrent of intrigue and macabre horror.</p>

<p>Residents of Undermere will come to you for help with various problems, and you'll need to help them unravel the mysteries of the objects they bring in, as well as objects you discover through other means.</p>

<p>The story begins when a flock of ravens begin circling Undermere, upon which occult expert Verona Green journeys to Undermere to talk things over with thaumaturge Eli White.</p>

<p>Things go awry, though, and Undermere soon finds itself drawn into yet another mystery that only you can solve. You can watch the (admittedly brief)&nbsp;<em>Strange Antiquities&nbsp;</em>reveal trailer right here.</p>




<p>If you haven't played&nbsp;<em>Strange Horticulture</em>, you should still be able to understand&nbsp;<em>Antiquities</em>, but it'll likely contain some references that might go over your head.</p>

<p>Besides which,<em>&nbsp;Strange Horticulture&nbsp;</em>is pretty great, so if you're interested in what you see here and you haven't played the first game yet, I'd strongly recommend you do so.</p>

<p><em>Strange Antiquities&nbsp;</em>will arrive on PC when it launches, although no release window has been revealed yet.

			<p>Hints have been dropping for a while, but today Activision officially announced this year’s entry in the mega-blockbuster CoD franchise – Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. No subtitle like 2020’s Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War, they’re keeping it simple. You can check out the announcement tweet, below.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">A dark new chapter of the Black Ops franchise begins. Call of Duty: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps6</a> <a href="https://t.co/db3lPR0ibI">pic.twitter.com/db3lPR0ibI</a></p>

<p>In addition to that, while many suspected it as Microsoft wasn’t being particularly sneaky, but the “Direct” being broadcast after <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-2024-call-of-duty-direct-dated-june/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">June’s big Xbox Games Showcase</a> will indeed be a Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Direct.</p>
<blockquote>

<p><em>“Full Reveal Date Confirmed: Xbox Games Showcase, Sunday June 9th at 10 AM PT. Black Ops 6 Direct immediately following. Stay on this channel for further updates.”</em></p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-teaser-leaked-image-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As we reported yesterday</a>, a teaser site and some “leaks” (most likely strategically placed by Activision) hinted that the reveal of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 was imminent. In particular, the teaser website <a href="https://thetruthlies.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thetruthlies.com</a> features a couple brief video clips that hint at the tone of the upcoming game. One of the videos shows some group making a statement by putting blindfolds reading “The Truth Lies” on the Presidential noggins of Mount Rushmore. Another teaser on the site shows the same group putting up posters featuring an image of the blindfolded Mt. Rushmore.</p>
<p>While we’ll have to wait for the full reveal of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 in June, rumors have stated it will be your typical shadowy Treyarch tale <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-gulf-war-rumor-early-access-period-unusually-long/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set in and around the first Gulf War</a>. Whether it focuses specifically on the Gulf War of just that general early 90s period, remains to be seen. The Black Ops 6 Direct will also likely reveal how Microsoft plans to sell the game, as there are <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-coming-to-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">strong rumors they plan to put it on Game Pass on Day 1</a>, which would obviously be a big shakeup for the series.</p>
<p>So, what do you think? Excited to get your first look at Call of Duty: Black Ops 6? What’s your favorite Call of Duty sub-series?</p>

That game—which was a direct sequel to 2010's original <em>Black Ops—</em>ended with (spoiler!) a choice over whether to tell the truth or lie about the location of Soviet spy Perseus. The marketing for <em>Blops 6</em> seems centered around this moment, with a website called <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://thetruthlies.com/1/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://thetruthlies.com/1/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Truth Lies</a></span> appearing this week.</p><p>This leaves the setting for the new game somewhat less ambiguous. <em>Cold War</em> was set in the 1980s, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-2024-black-ops-6-gulf-war-treyarch-1851043516&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-2024-black-ops-6-gulf-war-treyarch-1851043516">rumors swirled</a></span> at the end of last year that accurately predicted a Treyarch-developed <em>Black Ops</em> sequel, and suggested it would be set during the Gulf War. No, not that one, the one President Bush started. No, the <em>first</em> President Bush. Gulf War 1.</p><p>That makes a lot of chronological sense, as it’s the next big U.S.-involved conflict in which our intrepid team of shark-jumping, MKUltra-addled heroes could meddle within.</p><p>The mysterious The Truth Lies website sees Mount Rushmore’s stone presidents wearing giant blindfolds, bearing the same legend—the same image that appears in the mock newspaper story wrapped around <em>USA Today</em> today, and on the back page of <em>The New York Post</em>. The site loops a short video of some people fussing about on a road, getting into a car, and then seemingly climbing up Mount Rushmore to place the blindfolds, before admiring their work.</p><p> You can change TV channels on the site to see other equally badly shot short films, of people putting up The Truth Lies posters, a bunch of static fuzz, and then images of worldwide monuments similarly defaced. People on Reddit are also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarCallofDuty/comments/1cyrt27/black_ops_6_the_truth_lies_posters_in_new_york/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarCallofDuty/comments/1cyrt27/black_ops_6_the_truth_lies_posters_in_new_york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posting images</a></span> they claim to be <em>Black Ops 6</em> posters pasted up in New York.</p><p>There you have it. You’re now expected to enthusiastically speculate about what it could all mean! I suggest just entirely dismissing the entire thing from your mind, until Activision inevitably offers something more coherent during the Xbox Games Showcase on June 9.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Studio has secured funding to remain independent</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Relic Entertainment has partnered with UK-based investment firm Emona Capital to become fully independent <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/sega-sells-relic-and-will-cut-240-jobs-across-uk-studios">after being sold by Sega in March</a>.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/relic-partners-with-investment-firm-to-go-fully-indie-again">Game Developer</a>, the studio has secured funding to stay independent through Emona Capital.</p>
<p>The investment firm will support the developer's current portfolio and will assist in creating partnerships with other publishers.</p>
<p>"We see a huge opportunity to unleash Relic's creative potential as an independent studio," said Relic CEO Justin Dowdeswell. "The talent, technology, and track record we have built over the years are an amazing starting point for us on this next chapter."</p>
<p>A week after its sale from Sega, the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/relic-hit-with-layoffs-following-sale-from-sega">studio was hit with a wave of redundancies</a> in which 41 people were laid off.</p>
<p>Relic formed in 1997, and <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/thq-split-up-at-auction">was acquired by Sega in 2013</a> following the bankruptcy of its previous owner THQ.</p>
