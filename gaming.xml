            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong> and <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> versions of <strong>Dispatch</strong>, the popular narrative-driven superhero adventure game from former <strong>Telltale</strong> developers at <strong>AdHoc Studio</strong>, are out, but they don't provide the exact same experience you get on other platforms with Dispatch, as the select moments of nudity included in the story and curse words said by the characters are <strong>censored</strong> on the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 versions.</p>



<p>Before it was officially confirmed, we knew Dispatch would be arriving on Nintendo's hybrid consoles <a href="https://wccftech.com/adhoc-studios-dispatch-will-arrive-on-nintendo-switch-and-nintendo-switch-2-next-month-according-to-au-store-listing/">from an Australian Nintendo eShop listing</a>, but it was not clear then, or when it was officially announced, that the game would be arriving with some changes. We only learned about the censorship when the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dispatch-out-nintendo-switch-2-but-nintendo-censored-it/">game arrived on the consoles yesterday</a>, at which point AdHoc Studio was the only party to comment on the changes.</p>



<p>"<em></em><em>Different platforms have different content criteria, and submissions are evaluated individually</em>," AdHoc Studio began in a press release. "<em>We worked with Nintendo to ensure the content within the title met the criteria to release on their platforms, but the core narrative and gameplay experience remains identical to the original release.</em>"</p>



<p>Today, Nintendo issued its own statement, shared first with <a href="https://www.gonintendo.com/contents/57182-nintendo-shares-statement-on-dispatch-censorship-debacle-and-it-doesn-t-explain-much">GoNintendo</a>, in which the company doesn't really explain the what or why this happened, but does claim that it "<em><strong>does not make changes to partner content</strong></em>." You can read the full statement below.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>"<em>Nintendo requires all games on its platforms to receive ratings from independent organizations and to meet our established content and platform guidelines. While we inform partners when their titles don’t meet our guidelines, Nintendo does not make changes to partner content. We also do not discuss specific content or the criteria used in making these determinations</em>."</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Part of Dispatch's whole pitch is that it is a more mature superhero story, with AdHoc renewing and revitalizing the narrative and gameplay formulas that worked so well with the initial run of popular Telltale titles. Censoring the nudity doesn't really impact the experience, but it's easy to imagine that the curse words getting censored would impact a player's experience, since more than half of the lines in some scenes would be loud bleep tones.</p>



<p>Players have also taken umbrage with Dispatch seemingly being singled out. It's not the first game to appear on Nintendo's platform to include swearing and nudity. If you can play <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-pc-settings-excellent-port/"><strong>Cyberpunk 2077</strong> on <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong></a> without these issues, why not Dispatch?</p>



<p>Dispatch was one of 2025's standout titles, with <strong>Breaking Bad</strong> actor <strong>Aaron Paul</strong> voicing the game's <strong>Iron Man-like</strong> lead, <strong>Robert Robertson</strong>. It's been <a href="https://wccftech.com/29th-annual-dice-awards-nominees-full-list-clair-obscur-ghost-of-yotei-arc-raiders-dispatch/">nominated for several industry awards</a> and was also voted <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-25-winners-clair-obscur-gta-6/">Wccftech's Best Adventure Game in 2025</a></strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-25-winners-clair-obscur-gta-6/"> by both the Wccftech Gaming team and our community.</a> It also closed out 2025 with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/adhoc-studio-dispatch-over-3-million-copies-sold/">over 3 million copies sold</a></strong>.</p>



<p>At this point, it's unclear if we'll ever know the actual reason, but looking at Nintendo's statement, the reason could likely lie with the individual ratings boards that Dispatch would have to be submitted to across the globe to release the Switch and Switch 2 versions. As noted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-comments-on-dispatchs-nintendo-switch-2-censorship/">VGC</a>, the version of Cyberpunk 2077 you can buy in Japan includes no nudity or extreme gore, including decapitations.</p>



<p>If AdHoc were to release a completely separate version of Dispatch for sale in regions like Japan, then we may see the current censorship removed for other versions of the game. The issue with that, however, is that AdHoc Studio is a smaller indie team that doesn't have the resources of a studio like CD Projekt RED. The version we have now may just be the compromise AdHoc was forced to go with, because it lacked the financial wiggle room to work on and submit a completely separate version for select regions.</p>



<p>Again, it's not likely we'll ever learn the real reason, but Nintendo has at least tried to say that players upset with the censorship should not point their finger at them.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The <strong>PlayStation Portal</strong> is among the <strong>most interesting gaming systems</strong> Sony has released in a long time. After abandoning the handheld market following the unlucky <strong>PlayStation Vita</strong>, Sony somewhat made its return to the space with the system, which originally launched as a <strong>Remote Play-focused device.</strong> </p>



<p>Since its release in 2023, the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-portal-new-update-performance-connectivity/">console's functionality</a></strong> has been expanded <span>to include&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://www.playstation.com/it-it/support/subscriptions/psportal-cloud-game-streaming/">cloud gaming</a></strong>, effectively turning it into a sort of portable PlayStation 5 that</span> can run games well under the right conditions.</p>



<p>Despite not running games natively, the PlayStation Portal has proven <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">quite popular</strong> among gamers. The system is considered so <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">successful</strong> that Sony is reportedly working on <span>an<strong>&nbsp;updated</strong></span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> model</strong>.</p>



<p>Speaking on the <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/intels-panther-lake-igpu-is-really-worth-considering-for-a-handheld-amd-fell-asleep-at-the-wheel.1692741/post-271210464"><strong>NeoGAF forums</strong></a>, known insider Kepler L2, who correctly revealed plenty of information about both Sony and Microsoft gaming systems in the past, said the system has been so successful that "<em>they're even doing another version this year."</em></p>



<p>When asked what the new version of the PlayStation Portal system will feature over the current model, the insider replied, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"OLED.</em>" Given the system's current functionality, <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">a new display is the most obvious upgrade</strong> and could make the system more enticing to those who didn't buy the current model.</p>



<p>Regardless of the specific improvements the rumored upgraded PlayStation Portal will offer, the community seems <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">enthusiastic about the possibility</strong>. "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">It's definitely a low-key success and a good idea for this moment when component prices are so high</strong>," said <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1qqxlml/comment/o2k3ngg/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Reddit user NotTakenGreatName</strong></a>. Amidst the current<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> price increases</strong> and their negative outlook for the immediate future, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a low-cost system</strong> capable of running <strong>a sizeable portion of the current PlayStation library in some capacity</strong> would definitely be quite enticing.</p>



<p>However, a simple upgrade to an OLED display may not be enough for some. While some, like user <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Sakaixx</strong>, would love to see <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">a 120Hz OLED display</strong> to take advantage of the 40 FPS modes in many PlayStation 5 games, others would like to see <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">other upgrades</strong>, such as better Wi-Fi and a longer-lasting battery, so the success of a new model with limited upgrades is far from being guaranteed.</p>



<p>Although not comparable to proper gaming systems like the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation Portable </strong>and <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation Vita</strong> due to <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-portal-issues-bitrate-limitations/"><strong>its limitations</strong></a>, the low-key success of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation Portal could bode well for the rumored <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-playstation-handheld-specs-leaked-rasterization-performance/">PlayStation handheld</a>, </strong>which is<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">s</strong>aid will launch alongside the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation 6</strong>.</p>



<p>As the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-likely-to-be-delayed-longer-than-many-expected-leaving-prices-the-only-things-that-will-keep-evolving-and-not-for-the-better/"><strong>next-generation home console could be delayed beyond the 2027- 2028 release window</strong></a>, it remains to be seen if plans won't change regarding the handheld's release, and if the unexpected PlayStation Portal success could push Sony to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">launch the handheld system ahead of the home console</strong> to offer another gateway into the PlayStation ecosystem at a more reasonable price.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hitman-mission-mindseye-build-rocket-io-interactive-2000664566</link>
            <guid>1421053</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>MindsEye</span></i><span> was one of last year’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-10-worst-games-of-2025-according-to-metacritic-mindseye-fire-emblem-glover-2000653114"><span>worst-reviewed games</span></a><span>. It was published by IO Interactive and was supposed to get a special </span><i><span>Hitman</span></i><span> crossover mission. According to a new report from </span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/build-a-rocket-boy-io-interactive/"><i><span>Insider Gaming</span></i></a><span>, that’s no longer happening and developer Build a Rocket Boy and IO Interactive have decided to bail on the failed joint venture.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>What this means for the future of </span><i><span>MindsEye</span></i><span>, once pitched as the first building block in an ambitious open-world metaverse </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/everywhere-mindseye-ex-gta-devs-fortnite-dreams-roblox-1850258651"><span>called </span><i><span>Everywhere</span></i></a><span>, is currently unclear. But apparently the </span><i><span>Hitman</span></i><span> mission, the shooter’s highest-profile bit of upcoming content, is canceled.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Build a Rocket Boy and IO Interactive didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.</span><span><br> </span></p> <p><span>The most surprising part of </span><i><span>Insider Gaming</span></i><span>’s</span><span> report is that Build a Rocket Boy was apparently the one pushing to end the ill-fated partnership, a decision influenced by the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-development-leslie-benzies-gta-bugs-union-layoffs-2000633983"><span>ex-</span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto</span></i><span> producer-led studio</span></a><span>’s&nbsp; “desire to bring its publishing in-house and gain more control over its future.”</span></p> <p><span>IOI Interactive and Build A Rocket Boy announced the deal that would see the&nbsp;<em>Hitman&nbsp;</em>maker publish <em>MindsEye</em>,</span><span>&nbsp;the first third-party game distributed through IOI Interactive’s IO Partners program, back in October 2024. The </span><i><span>Hitman </span></i><span>mission was announced onstage at Geoff Keighley’s Summer Game Fest 2025, but </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-worst-game-2025-update-hitman-crossover-delay-1851787011"><span>later delayed</span></a><span> amid layoffs and Build a Rocket Boy’s rush to clean up</span><i><span> MindsEye</span></i><span>’s messy launch.</span></p>

 <p><span>IOI Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak commented on the debacle during an interview with </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/that-was-definitely-tough-right-ceo-of-mindseye-publisher-ioi-responds-to-disastrous-launch"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span> last September. “Well, that was definitely tough, right?” he said at the time. “It was a tough reception. It wasn’t what they hoped for, and also what we didn’t hope for at IOI Partners. They’re working hard on turning that around to regain the trust of the gamers out there, and they have tons of potential and content they’re working on. So hopefully they’ll succeed with that in the future.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Perhaps the only people who will truly be distraught at this news are the streamers and content creators who are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-update-twitch-sponsored-streamer-2000661013"><span>still being paid to promote </span><i><span>MindsEye</span></i></a><span>. At least we’ll know for sure IOI Interactive had been the one bankrolling the sponsored content should the “#MindsEyePartner”-tagged streams suddenly come to an end in the near future.</span></p>

<h2 id="block-96ac6df0-5b63-4788-9eff-98ceece739ee">What Is Wordle?</h2>



<p id="block-cde2c274-bfd9-4d27-a0d9-3ebe6f1ff7f2">Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <guid>1421023</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="9eb7087658715"><a title="Haunted Chocolatier" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9eb7087658715/haunted-chocolatier.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: ConcernedApe</em></figcaption></figure><p>We're all excited to see what Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone is cooking up with <strong>Haunted Chocolatier</strong>, the upcoming life sim where you run a chocolate shop with the help of ghosts, and ConcernedApe's second game after the mammoth hit of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a>.</p>
<p>But things are taking a little while, which is causing some fans to get a little concerned. But Barone has assured fans that he's "still working like always" in a new <a href="https://www.hauntedchocolatier.net/2026/01/28/update-im-still-working-like-always/">blog post</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-shuts-down-rumors-haunted-chocolatier-will-be-abandoned-insisting-it-will-come-out-when-its-ready">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>Addressing those concerns directly, Barone says, "Yep, it’s taking a while to finish the game. That’s okay", but acknowledges that he may have gotten ahead of himself revealing the game when he did: "I know, I know, I shouldn’t have announced the game so early. But I had my reasons."</p>
<p>The rest of the blog post looks at some of the general chatter and "false assumptions" that have been going around fan communities over the years, all of which Barone dismisses.</p>
<p>One assumption that has been going around is that Haunted Chocolatier will be abandoned and instead will just be added onto Stardew Valley — a game that has been getting regular updates since its release in 2017, as recently as December 2025 with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>.</p>
<p>"No. First, I am not going to abandon Haunted Chocolatier. But even if I did, I am not going to add it to Stardew Valley" Barone writes, saying that wouldn't even make sense "from a technical perspective. "Haunted Chocolatier is written from scratch, it’s not the same “engine” as Stardew Valley. You can’t just copy and paste Haunted Chocolatier into Stardew Valley."</p>

<p>Then, sticking with the Stardew angle, some have wondered whether the Stardew Valley updates are actually tests for Haunted Chocolatier. "Nope", says Barone. "When working on Stardew Valley, I’m not thinking about Haunted Chocolatier, and vice versa."</p>
<p>Again, he reiterates that Stardew Valley "is a different game" and that the content isn't compatible between the two. Not only that, Barone doesn't want to spoil many of his ideas in the upcoming game. Understandable!</p>
<p>So, why does Stardew keep getting updates? Is it because "he's burnt out on Haunted Chocolatier"? You can probably imagine the answer already; "No, I’m working on a new Stardew update because it’s a very popular game with a large, ever-growing playerbase, and I still have additional ideas for how to improve it."</p>
<p>The game doesn't have a release date yet, and Barone is sticking to that — while some have interpreted from comments that it's coming in 2030, Barone dismisses that. " I was asked in 2025 if it would come out within the next five years, and I said “I hope so”.</p>

<p>As he's stressed throughout the process, and this blog post, "The game will come out when it's done". So we'll just have to be patient.</p>
<p>And, honestly? We're happy to wait. Barone does share occasional updates on social media, and we're still amazed we're getting constant free content for Stardew Valley all these years later.</p>
<p>Of course, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/psa-stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition-update-and-european-release-on-the-way">some regions are still waiting for the Switch 2 version</a> after it initially launched with some pretty big bugs, but most of these are fixed at this point, with a handful of stragglers still to iron out. if you have a North American eShop account, you can still download the Switch 2 Edition for free (if you own the game on Switch 1). It's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/stardew-valley-nintendo-switch-2-edition">still fantastic</a>.</p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/i-donrt-want-to-see-it-fizzle-outr-stardew-valley-creator-on-why-he-cant-give-it-up">we spoke to Barone in late 2024</a>, he spoke about what he wanted to do differently compared to Stardew: "Designing bosses is a whole new ball game from anything that's Stardew. And I think I wanted something different. I wanted a challenge because I want to keep growing as a game developer. I didn't want to just do exactly the same thing again."</p>

            <p>Ubisoft recently unleashed a raft of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">cancellations, delays and studio closures</a> as part of a brutal bout of corporate restructuring. We've still yet to see how all of the repercussions of it will go, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-propose-cutting-up-to-200-jobs-at-paris-headquarters-as-unions-reportedly-agree-three-day-strike">proposed voluntary redundancies</a> at the company's Paris headquarters having seen unions put plans in place for a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/unionised-french-ubisoft-workers-put-out-call-for-an-international-strike-held-by-all-current-employees">three day strike in February</a>.</p>
<p>One of the games which wasn't among the cancellations was long-in-development sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beyond-good-and-evil-2">Beyond Good and Evil 2</a>, and its director has now confirmed as much, offering a brief message to reassure fans and encourage folks to support devs affected by Ubisoft's bloodletting.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Thank you for everyone who has reached out to me over the past few days in regards to recent news at Ubisoft," Fawzi Mesmar wrote on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/activity-7421227406130335744-io3s">LinkedIn</a>. "Myself, my team and our project Beyond Good and Evil 2 are unaffected by the recent changes.</p>
<p>"Needless to say, I am saddened by the cancellations that has affected my colleagues in other parts of Ubisoft and the industry. I urge everyone - myself included - to offer support whenever and however they can during these times. We remain committed and focused on delivering a remarkable game for our players to enjoy."</p><p>He also directed folks to consult the <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf">official docs</a> for more info on Ubisoft's restructure, which has seen the Beyond Good and Evil series slotted into the fourth of five "creative houses". House number four is all about "immersive fantasy worlds and narrative-driven universes", with Anno, Might &amp; Magic, Rayman, and Prince of Persia filling it out.</p>
<p>It's great to hear Mesmar's team haven't been hit by layoffs as a result of changes, at least as of yet, though it is worth noting that we don't know the exact number of folks who're working on Beyond Good and Evil 2 at the moment. As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-didnt-cancel-beyond-good-evil-2-because-open-world-games-are-a-priority-but-i-suspect-the-real-reason-is-more-boring">Edwin wrote the other week</a>, the official reason that's been given for BG&amp;E2 keeping on keeping on while the likes of the Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake were condemned to history is Ubisoft's desire to keep doing open world things.</p>
<p>My non-money expert also speculated that there might be boring accounting reasons why the company might want to keep this specific game in the works for now, essentially boiling down to it being more useful to them alive and with potential to make some money in the eyes of investors, rather than written off as a cash black hole.</p>
<p>The truth, as it's been for a while, is that none of the above will become truly crystal clear until finally we get more details about/a chance to play Beyond Good and Evil 2, or Ubisoft announce they're pulling the plug. For now, it remains Schrödinger's anthropomorphic animal action-adventure.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gdc-2026-survey-ai-union-layoff-xbox-ps5-trump-2000664245</link>
            <guid>1421011</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The 2026 Game Developers Conference (GDC), which has been renamed the GDC Festival of Gaming, takes place in early March. Ahead of the San Francisco-based industry event, GDC has released <a href="https://kotaku.com/gdc-2025-developer-survey-generative-ai-pc-switch-2-1851744292/2">its annual survey of game industry developer sentiment</a>. Over 2,300 industry professionals responded on topics ranging from genAI to layoffs, providing a small snapshot of what’s going on across video game companies big and small. It’s not a pretty picture.</p> <h2>A majority of game developers now think genAI will hurt the game industry</h2> <p>Back in 2024, game makers were relatively split on the advantages and downsides of the emerging LLM craze. Now they are increasingly horrified by it. Last year, 13 percent of respondents <a href="https://kotaku.com/google-ai-genai-nintendo-zelda-breath-wild-mario-64-project-genie-2000664227">thought genAI</a> would have a positive impact on the game industry. In 2026 it’s just 7 percent. Instead, 52 percent think the technology will have a negative impact, up double digits from just 12 months ago. Artists, storytellers, programmers–they’re all down on it. Still, actual adoption of the technology for things as simple as writing emails is growing.</p>

 <h2>Developers are bailing on making games for Xbox</h2> <p>According to the new survey, roughly 40 percent of respondents said they were interested in making their next game for PlayStation 5 or Switch 2. Only 20 percent were planning to bring it to Xbox Series X/S. That’s still above Android, iOS, and the original Switch, but <a href="https://kotaku.com/games-skipping-xbox-microsoft-asks-devs-studio-why-ps5-1851663611">it’s a steep drop-off</a> from last year when the Xbox number was 34 percent. PC is still far and away the most popular platform. Maybe that’s why Microsoft is pivoting to it.</p> <h2>Union support is surging</h2> <p>Over 80 percent of U.S.-based developers told the survey they support unionization, with 62 percent saying they were interested in joining one. Those numbers show there’s likely room for <a href="https://kotaku.com/bethesda-devs-win-first-ever-union-contact-at-a-major-g-1851783142">many more game studios to organize</a>, as only 13 percent of respondents said they’re actually currently in a union. Union drives have been sweeping through Microsoft-owned subsidiaries thanks to a neutrality clause the company previously agreed to, but unions have struggled to take hold at many other big publishers like Electronic Arts and 2K Games.</p>

 <h2>A third of U.S. developers said they were laid off in the last two years</h2> <p>That’s a devastating number which shows that the full impact of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492">recent downsizing spree</a> will still be with the industry for years to come. Meanwhile, 17 percent of respondents said they were laid off within the last 12 months, a steady annual increase over the previous two years. Even worse, nearly 50 percent of people laid off weren’t able to find another job in the video game industry during that time.</p>

 <h2>Trump take game</h2> <p>The administration’s trade war and anti-immigrant crackdown appears to be taking <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881">a real toll on the game industry</a>. According to the survey, 31 percent of respondents canceled travel plans to the U.S. while another third are currently reconsidering future travel. A whopping 60 percent of non-U.S. industry leaders said the policies had negatively impacted their desire to conduct business based in the country. On the trade side, 38 percent of respondents said tariffs had impacted their financial decisions.</p>

<p>The Soulslike genre is a beautiful and bullishly difficult genre of games. FromSoftware created a monster when it unleashed Demon’s Souls onto the world, and everyone is trying their hand at Soulslike games in 2026.</p>



<p>Trying to explain the joys of playing a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/soulslike/" id="989" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Soulslike</a> game must sound like sadism to the uninformed and uninitiated. Souls games offer an unprecedented level of triumph seldom seen in any other type of game, and it’s why they continue to keep coming out. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/elden-ring/" id="135" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring</a> brought the Soulslike genre into the mainstream, and many more are lined up for 2026. </p>







<h2 id="h-hardest-soulslikes-releasing-that-you-must-play-in-2026">Hardest Soulslikes Releasing That You Must Play In 2026</h2>



<p>As with all lists, make room for the possibility of a delay or two. Everything on this list is expected to come out in 2026, and Insider Gaming will have news on any delays or further announcements, like always. Without further ado, these are the 7 games identified as must-play and must-own Souls games in 2026—also known as must-have-spare-controllers-on-standby titles.</p>

<p>Who’d have ever guessed that the primary driving force behind Pokémon games would venture off into a completely different, Soulslike direction? <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beast-of-reincarnation-release-window-announced-at-xbox-developer-direct/" id="171386" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beast of Reincarnation</a> was fully revealed during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/beast-of-reincarnation-release-window-announced-at-xbox-developer-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Developer Direct</a>, and one thing that immediately became apparent was its Soulsy nature. Its beautiful environments could be ripped from Pokémon Sword and Shield or Scarlet and Violet, but its combat veers violently away from tiny elemental creatures to awe-inspiring bosses with a high level of difficulty. Beast of Reincarnation holds a lot of promise and is easily one of 2026’s most intriguing games, let alone Soulslikes.</p>







<h3 id="h-the-duskbloods">The Duskbloods</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to FromSoftware</figcaption></figure>



<p>You have Hidetaka Miyazaki to thank for the hours you’ve spent curled up on the couch, unable to beat a Soulslike boss, or dying for the 137th time to a poisonous swamp. Now, FromSoftware’s company president, Miyazaki, and his team have spawned a new potential franchise—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/the-duskbloods/" id="108378" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Duskbloods</a>. It’s launching as a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive, but there’s nothing family-friendly about its action. It changes up the formula slightly with PvPvE action; however, based on what we’ve seen, the gameplay looks as unforgiving as ever.</p>



<h3 id="h-nioh-3">Nioh 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Team Ninja</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s so good to have Nioh back. There was nothing wrong with Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty or Rise of the Ronin, but Nioh has an unrivalled vibe that hits harder than a One-Eyed Oni who’s just lost his favorite monocle. Patience is certainly KI in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nioh-3-review-embargo-date/" id="172692" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nioh 3</a>, and the third mainline game brings back all the devilishly difficult action that Team Ninja specializes in. Expect a quality product that can go toe-to-toe with any competitor that dares to step up.</p>



<h3 id="h-lords-of-the-fallen-2">Lords of the Fallen 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to HEXWORKS</figcaption></figure>



<p>If there’s one Soulslike franchise that is still trying to find its breakout moment, it’s probably Lords of the Fallen. It took nine years for Lords of the Fallen to get a sequel, and 2023’s bizarrely also self-titled game was hit and miss with many. Lords of the Fallen 2 looks big, it looks badder (in a good way), and fingers crossed that HEXWORKS has finally found the missing piece of the puzzle in Lords of the Fallen 2.</p>



<h3 id="h-mortal-shell-2">Mortal Shell 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Cold Symmetry</figcaption></figure>



<p>Your mileage may vary, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/mortal-shell-2/" id="3537" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Shell</a> is seen as a more accessible Souls game. It’s still not easy by any means, and it may have played things a bit safe. Cold Symmetry heard this, took the feedback on board, and came back all guns (more swords in this case) blazing with Mortal Shell 2’s heavy-metal-thumping announcement trailer in June 2025. Gruesome kill animations and a mean attitude could be symptomatic of a game that wants to brush off the Dark Souls comparisons to feel like something fresh and fun.</p>



<h3 id="h-valor-mortis">Valor Mortis</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to One More Level</figcaption></figure>



<p>A first-person Soulslike should be a winner on paper. It’s a mystery why no one’s thought to go down this avenue, but developer One More Level is looking to ascend to that next step of greatness, following the energy-charged Ghostrunner games. Insider Gaming sat down for an exclusive hour-long playtest, and as the person who did it, I raved about it and went as far as calling it: “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valor-mortis-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Most Promising Soulslike in Years</a>.” Its seamless blend of Bioshock-like action and esoteric Soulslike mechanics and principles makes it accessible and equally satisfying and punishing. One of 2026’s hottest prospects lurks beneath the Napoleonic nuances.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-relic-first-guardian">The Relic: First Guardian</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Project Cloud Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Speediness and swiftness have been at the heart of a lot of what’s been shown from The Relic: First Guardian. It’s probably gotten the least hype of anything in this list, but that doesn’t mean it won’t deliver. It looks wonderfully atmospheric, and this is your first call to pay attention to it. Who knows, it could be your next Soulslie darling without you ever knowing it.</p>



<p>There are other Soulslike-adjacent games like Phatnom Blade Zero coming out in 2026, but are there any distinct Souls games missing from this list?

After being shut out of the Noteworthy Song Contest, Cadence realizes that her solo act might not be enough for the judges! As she sets off to form her band, she quickly gets caught up in events far grander, and more dangerous, than she could have possibly imagined.</li><li><strong>Fret</strong> (voiced by Jason Charles Miller) – Fret is the old guy who’s seen it all, and a prototypical classic rocker. He misses his old band, and lives a solo act kind of life in Durandis, the Kingdom of Rock and Roll.</li><li><strong>Synthia</strong> (voiced by Erika Ishii / vocals by Amanda Angeles) – Synthia is the introverted extrovert. Normally quiet and reclusive around even their closest friends, this DJ sheds that persona when they get in front of the one’s and two’s; though they harbor doubts about whether or not they really deserve their renown.</li><li><strong>Vox</strong> (voiced by Mansa “Wakil” Wakili) – Vox is living in his mother’s shadow. The son of Caliq, the regent of Pyre, he’s calm, logical, and thinks rap music should be about more than battling…but he’ll learn that sometimes, you need to fight to protect what you love.</li><li><strong>Cerrin</strong> (voiced by Marwan Salama) – Cerrin’s a bit of a dork, polite and respectful, but there’s a buried part of him that doesn’t mind bending the rules for a good cause.</li><li><strong>Arc</strong> (voiced by Alex Boniello) – On the outside, Arc is smart, flirtatious at times, and resentful of any sort of injustice. On the inside, he bears the emotional scars of his upbringing as an unorthodox prodigy in an oppressive environment. Always with just a hint of a smirk, Arc always knows a little more than he’s letting on.</li><li><strong>Sharp ♯</strong> (voiced by Joe Zieja) – Fantastically egotistical and snobby, Sharp believes that 80s music, and his music in particular, is what all music should be. He’s transparently fake, a “man of the people” who can’t stand the people. And as the manager of Smolder, Chordia’s hottest boy band, he seems to have some ulterior motives…</li><li><strong>Anthony</strong> (voiced by <a title="Games > Griffin [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/griffin">Griffin</a> Burns) – The front man of Smolder, Chordia’s top charting boy band. He’s the most recognizable figure in pop;. handsome, self-assured, and weirdly oblivious, he also happens to be holder of the Chordian Key of Note, a very interesting artifact but for him, it’s just an accessory to his outfit really.</li><li><strong>Lasso</strong> (voiced by Sean Kenin Elias-Reyes / vocals by Drew Rider Smith) – Lasso is the rough-and-tumble leader of the Homestead, nation of country music. A convincing leader with a commanding presence, Lasso doesn’t necessarily enjoy violence, but he understands that sometimes you just don’t have a choice.</li><li><strong>Martell</strong> (voiced by Debra Wilson) – Martell is the Homestead’s second in command, and a fearsome foe in her own right. A mature woman, Martell takes her country roots seriously. Beautiful and dangerous, she wields Homestead politeness like a sharpened scalpel–her family motto is “Bless Your Heart.”</li><li><strong>Annette</strong> (voiced by Erica Lindbeck / vocals by Elizabeth Zharoff) – The diva of all divas, Annette is the lead performer in the Archaia Grand Opera, an institution older than most nations’ full histories. While one of the most musically talented singers in all of Note, she’d never dream of taking the stage without her lucky pearls in hand!</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><!-- AD: content -->

            <p>A tease has been made by Blizzard for something special for Classic World of Warcraft players. Meanwhile, the Classic World of Warcraft community is polling itself to find out what they'd want from some sort of 'Classic+'.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pkFMkdZWxdk">In the 2026 State of Azeroth presentation</a>, hosted by executive producer Holly Longdale, went over everything in the pipeline across both retail (modern) and Classic World of Warcraft.</p>
<p>On the topic of Classic WoW, Longdale stated the following before being playfully cut off. She stated: "I can say with confidence that all Classic players across the globe have a lot to look forward to. I'm excited to announce…" before being cut off with "Holly No!".</p>

<p>This continues <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-gb/article/24247148/2025-blizzard-yearbook">a trend of recent hints</a> at something substantial coming to Classic World of Warcraft, which has been presumed by swathes of the audience to be some sort of expansion of content to Classic World of Warcraft. Dubbed 'Classic+' by the community, this would be a sort of Old School <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/runescape">RuneScape</a> style strand of WoW in which new updates can be produced in the Classic style.</p><p>This tease comes at an interesting time, as a community-run initiative called 'The Classic+ Project' recently was released. This project has manifested initially as a survey website and Discord server, prompting players to vote on what they'd like to see added and changed to Classic WoW.</p>
<p>Announced in a video by creator Joardee titled '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HWq2SFSI3zY">What Exactly is Classic+</a>', this project was created to pull together sentiment by players directly at a time when Blizzard is keeping its cards to its chest.</p>
<p>So discussion around Classic + is really reaching somewhat of a crescendo. Will Blizzard finally announce some form of Classic +, and will this community project refine the wants of the masses into a solid list of wants? If there's any time to announce something official, it's Blizzcon later this year.</p>

			<p><strong>MindsEye </strong>developer <strong>Build a Rocket Boy</strong> has <strong>ended its publishing deal</strong> with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/hitman-devleoper-confirms-new-game-is-coming-007-only-external-ip-studio-would-work-on/">Hitman</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/no-need-to-empty-your-wallet-for-more-ram-007-first-light-updated-system-requirements-lower-ram-and-vram-recomendations/">007: First Light</a></strong> developer <strong>IO Interactive</strong>, according to a report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/build-a-rocket-boy-io-interactive/">Insider-Gaming</a>. MindsEye was the first game that <a href="https://wccftech.com/io-interactive-wants-to-create-a-007-gaming-franchise-will-publish-mindseye-from-rocket-boy/">IO Interactive published under its new publishing label</a>, and it might just be its last, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-disastrous-launch-io-ionteractive-publishing/">if reports from <strong>last year</strong></a>, and now this, are to be believed. </p>



<p>That said, according to the report, the decision to end the deal came from Build a Rocket Boy's side, not IO Interactive. This is said to come from Build a Rocket Boy wanting to start publishing its games internally and ultimately have more control over its future. This also reportedly means that the previously planned MindsEye and Hitman collaboration has been cancelled.</p>



<p>Now that 2025 is in the books, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-most-awarded-game-wccftech-awards-elden-ring/"><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> has more GOTY awards than any other game before it</a>, if you were wondering what's at the opposite end of the spectrum, that would be MindsEye, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/2025/metascore/?page=19">at least according to Metacritic</a>. Only earning a <strong>37</strong>, it was the <strong>worst-reviewed game of 2025</strong>, after it had a <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-heartbroken-over-the-games-launch-details-patches-coming-throughout-june/">disastrous launch</a></strong>.</p>



<p>To say it was an extremely bug-plagued game at launch would be an understatement. It was bad enough that <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-giving-players-refunds-for-mindseye/">PlayStation gave players refunds</a></strong> because the game was so broken. And when it was working, critics and players hammered the lack of anything to do and its less-than-enticing story.</p>



<p>It was a bad situation for Build a Rocket Boy. <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-reportedly-has-just-under-250k-players-while-junes-other-major-releases-like-fbc-firebreak-dune-awakening-and-rematch-all-exceed-1m/">The game didn't have the worst sales launch,</a> all things considered, but the word-of-mouth and the barrage of memes and clips of the game's worst moments killed any momentum the team at Build a Rocket Boy could have had. The studio <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/">suffered layoffs</a>,</strong> and developers called out the studio leadership, which included former <strong>Rockstar</strong> producer <strong>Leslie Benzies</strong>, in a <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developers-call-out-leslie-benzies-mark-gerhard-build-a-rocket-boy/">damning open letter</a>.</p>



<p>An even more <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-report-details-how-leslie-benzies-leadership-failed-staff/">damning report from the BBC a week later</a> revealed more about the internal issues at Build a Rocket Boy, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-updates-less-frequent-hitman-crossover-delayed/">while the studio has tried to update and fix the game</a>, it feels more likely that it will run out of financial runway and get shut down before it has a chance to see its full vision for MindsEye realized.</p>



<p>Considering all of this, it's interesting that the report indicates the decision to cut ties came from Build a Rocket Boy's side, and not IO Interactive. Maybe this is because Build a Rocket Boy has a comeback plan it wants full autonomy over. We'll see if that's the case, though it's worth noting that so far, neither Build a Rocket Boy or IO Interactive have officially confirmed or denied this report.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Valentine’s Day is just around the corner, and what better way to show your love than flowers that you can build together and never have to replace? We’re talking about LEGO roses, which aren’t just a sweet gesture, but also look incredibly beautiful and require zero upkeep.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6962/">If you haven’t picked a gift up yet, or are looking for a second one, the LEGO Roses set is available for just under $10 at Amazon, after a nice $5 discount</a>. It’s a great time to grab one without overspending, and even pick up a few, because a bouquet never hurts.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6962/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Quick to Build</h2>
<p>It’s not one of those massive builds that takes days and weeks to complete. LEGO keeps it short and sweet with this one. You’re getting a total of just 120 pieces, which come together to make two beautiful roses with adjustable stems. The stem of each rose measures over 10 in. (26 cm) long, so it’s perfect for displaying in a vase. You can plan a cute LEGO date around building these with your partner, while also asking each other thoughtful questions for a meaningful conversation, or go down memory lane together. Maybe stream a cute, romantic movie as you build – the possibilities are endless!</p>
<p>These are great as Valentine’s Day gifts, but also make a thoughtful present for Mother’s Day, Women’s Day, birthdays, and anniversaries. You can even treat yourself to a set because hey, you need to appreciate yourself too.</p>



<p>Building these is pretty straightforward. The set comes with a detailed instruction booklet that takes you through each step one-by-one. The book includes visuals to assist you, which makes the process even easier. LEGO also has its own building app – the LEGO Builder – which offers 3D instructions. You can zoom in on the blocks from each angle to understand the steps better. The app also lets you track your progress, build with friends, and save sets.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6962/">You can now grab the LEGO Roses set for just under $10, after Amazon took $5 off its usual $15 price.</a> If you’re open to spending a bit more, it’s also worth checking out other sets in LEGO’s Botanical collection. Several options are discounted right now, so you can mix and match flowers for a fuller, more colorful bouquet!</p>

<p>Over a quarter of a century after the initial release, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is putting a fresh lick of paint and a new look on the classic title, with gamers across various platforms able to enjoy the game.</p>



<p>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launches on February 5</a>, though players can jump in up to 48 hours early by purchasing the Digital Deluxe Edition.</p>

<p><strong>Yes, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is available to play on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a> on the February 5 release date, with two options available.</strong></p>



<p>The Standard Edition of the game comes with an additional bonus of a Blue Slime Shield, and those who want to splash out on the Digital Deluxe Edition receive 48 hours of early access, The Road of Regal Wretches, Luminary’s Livery, and the White Wolf Costume.</p>



<p>Of course, that extra content comes at a price, and the biggest incentive is the early access period if you can’t wait for the game.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-on-xbox-series-x-s">Can You Play Dragon Quest VII Reimagined on Xbox Series X|S?</h2>

<p>None of the bonuses in the Digital Deluxe Edition is platform-exclusive, so Xbox players can get their hands on the same loot as PS5 players, including entry into the 48-hour early-access period.</p>



<p>There is also an Early Bird Bonus for those who purchase the game before March 4, 2026, providing the Trodain Togs outfit and three Seed of Proficiency.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/huntdown-overtime-is-a-goofy-retro-and-delightfully-violent-roguelike-ign-game-preview</link>
            <guid>1420948</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">I confess that I had never heard of 2020’s pixelated arcade shooter Huntdown, but after playing (and replaying) through the demo for its upcoming prequel, Huntdown: Overtime, I immediately went back and did so. That’s because I was so completely hooked by the hour or so of roguelike action that I was fiending for more. Playing the original was also a lot of fun, but this followup seeks to improve in just about every way, making it a bit hard to go back. The cheeky retro ‘80’s tone appeals to my thirst for nonsense, the run-and-gun sidescrolling action channels the likes of Contra or Metal Slug, and the roguelike system of upgrades and repeated failure against daunting odds made it extremely hard to put down. I went from this not being on my radar at all, to eagerly anticipating when it comes to Steam Early Access later this year, making this an early contender for my most anticipated indie game of 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can infer almost everything you need to know about Huntdown: Overtime’s absurd 80s pulp action vibe by its title alone. Taking place in the dystopian, crime-ridden city of Detroit in 2084, you play a cybernetic rogue robocop who battles against flamboyant street gangs like something out of every VHS action movie you’ve ever seen. You’ll go toe-to-toe against the likes of a shirtless bouncer who pummels you with his fists and climbs around on the ceiling like a monkey, to a six-fingered rockstar called Sammy Sixfingers who tries to kill you with an electric guitar while performing a guitar solo in front of a live audience. The whole thing is just incredibly over the top in the right kind of way, making it very easy to replay each section as you try and fail to get through levels in typical roguelike fashion.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It certainly helps that even when you’re replaying through the same series of levels, things are always a little different. For one, the bosses and levels you end up with on each run have a bit of randomness to them in terms of which you’ll get and in what order, which is aided by the fact that you’re given two routes to choose from if you’d like to avoid one you’ve seen more of than you’d like. The levels themselves seem to be procedurally generated as well, and kept me on my toes with slightly different layouts and enemies never appearing in the same order. This procedural component isn’t anything we haven’t seen before, and the level layouts and enemies you’ll find are similar enough playthrough-to-playthrough that you’ll figure out the patterns pretty quick and run out of things to be surprised by (at least in the short section I played).</p><p>It actually sort of reminded me of Hotline Miami, reimagined from a sidescrolling perspective.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is also not anything new, modeled after the likes of Contra or Mega Man, where you’re running and jumping through 2D levels blasting everytc hing in sight as you avoid incoming bullets and environmental hazards. That said, though it doesn’t have many new tricks, the formula it apes is extremely polished here, even in this pre-release state. While initially I was dying a lot and felt destined to be outmaneuvered by the numerous gangsters coming after me, it took less than an hour before I was sliding around, flying through the air, and shooting my way through entire sections without taking a single hit. That’s the kind of rewarding mastery I look for in games like this. It actually sort of reminded me of Hotline Miami, reimagined from a sidescrolling perspective, because although you can take more than one hit, there’s something very pleasantly familiar about the crisp gunplay and melee combat, especially when you hit someone with a baseball bat and see their pink, pixelated giblets go soaring across the screen.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Huntdown: Overtime – First Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The highlight of each run is when you come into contact with the larger-than-life bosses that can be found in each level. Some of these appear in regular sidescrolling levels, whe  re maybe someone named Frankie Starsimmon Sr. will attack you with a big ol’ shotgun and leave you with the option to damage her before taking her alive, or just killing her for a lesser bounty. The ability to take bounties alive for an added bonus to your reward is a particularly nice touch that I’m glad to see they added after the original. But things get especially crazy during the boss fights where you go up against someone with a dedicated boss health bar. The main fight in the demo was against a rockstar who used his stage’s pyrotechnics to try and burn you alive, and always had his stagehand nearby to hand him a new electric guitar after he lost the last one trying to hurl it through the back of your head. These fights can be really challenging, as roguelikes are wont to do, and nine times out of ten when I failed a run it was the fault of one of these deadly weirdos. But they were also some of my favorite moments, and made gearing up for the next big fight that much more exciting.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The retreaded ground you’ll encounter as part of the roguelike formula feels especially easy to get through because of the steady stream of unlockables, upgrades, and buildcrafting options that come with each new playthrough. In one playthrough, for example, you might decide to forgo guns for a pure melee weapon build, grabbing perks and upgrades that enhance your close-range combat skills, while in another you might get your hands on a new plasma rifle you just unlocked and blast your way through rows of thugs with ease. Like many of its genre peers, the joy is in having a build come together perfectly so you can bring it to bear against the string of challenging bosses that have been sending you back to the beginning again and again. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/29/screenshot-3-1769730902329.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The impressive thing about Huntdown: Overtime is that, at least in the full region I played during the demo, I never started a new run without a ton of new stuff to level up and try out. Sometimes that meant I’d unlock a new weapon that could then be found and powered up during runs, while other times it meant buying a certain permanent upgrade that made my healing items more potent, made me move faster, or some other useful boon to give me an edge on my next run. The pace of unlocks and progression felt perfectly balanced so I never felt like I’d hit a wall or had nothing interesting and new to bring into battle next time. It was so easy to immediately go from one run to the next, that even though I originally sat down for a 20-minute session, I ended up playing until I beat every boss in the demo in a single sitting, completely unable to tear myself away when I was sure the next playthrough would bring me victory. And even after I had my first successful run, I then was returned to base to find even more stuff had unlocked that I just had to try, and found myself immediately going straight into my next run just to try out some new stuff. I can’t remember the last time I found myself so instantly hooked!</p><p>Even though I originally sat down for a 20-minute session, I ended up playing until I beat every boss in the demo in a single sitting, completely unable to tear myself away.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing that piqued my interest after I went back to play the original Huntdown is the fact that this prequel only has one playable character versus the numerous agents you could take on the role of in the first game. While it feels weird to go backwards with the number of playable characters, Overtime’s demo was so polished and finely tuned that I honestly didn’t feel like I was missing much. It seems to be their focusing in on one specific playstyle and trying to make that work extremely well vs. the buffet-style protagonists, each with their own bag of tricks, that was in the first Huntdown.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I wasn’t expecting to end up so completely won over by such a short glimpse into Huntdown: Overtime, especially after seeing its dorky story and retro art style, but you can count me among the believers. For any roguelike fans out there, this is absolutely one to watch.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/huntdown-overtime-is-a-goofy-retro-and-delightfully-violent-roguelike-ign-game-preview]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Google has begun selling access to Project Genie, an interactive world creation tool that lets you generate playable environments from a prompt — including those featuring Nintendo characters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The technology is certainly remarkable, as Google's Genie 3 models playable 3D spaces in real time based upon user inputs, and allows you to run, swim, fly, or ride in vehicles around its AI-generated worlds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the AI technology has also launched with a telling lack of restrictions around copyrighted material — which the model also appears to have been trained upon. A preview of the possibilities published by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/869726/google-ai-project-genie-3-world-model-hands-on" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Verge</a> shows its reporter able to create playable 3D scenes that look a direct copy of Super Mario 64, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and Kingdom Hearts.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Step inside Project Genie: our experimental research prototype that lets you create, edit, and explore virtual worlds. 🌎 <a href="https://t.co/HQr1FRNlpy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/HQr1FRNlpy</a></p>— Google DeepMind (@GoogleDeepMind) <a href="https://twitter.com/GoogleDeepMind/status/2016919756440240479?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">January 29, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Footage published on social media shows gameplay clearly based on Nintendo's actual Breath of the Wild, where a knock-off Link runs around a world similar to Hyrule, and accurately deploys a glider as he leaps off a cliff. Other creations include a generated world with similarities to Rockstar's Grand Theft Auto.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">There is no map pre-loaded in memory.

Still, Google is selling access as part of its Google AI Ultra subscription, its top level of access to AI features that costs $124.99 per month when signing up for a three-month package. (Also, Project Genie access is currently just for U.S. subscribers aged 18 or over.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Project Genie is an experimental research prototype designed to follow prompts a user provides," Google Deepmind product manager Diego Rivas told The Verge when asked why the the product generated material that was clearly based on Nintendo intellectual property. "As with all experiments, we are monitoring closely and listening to user feedback." The Verge noted that its ability to generate worlds based on Mario had subsequently been halted, with a warning message that blamed the "interests of third-party content providers." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has contacted Nintendo for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The situation feels reminiscent to the rollout of OpenAI's Sora 2 video model last October, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-dont-sue-me-sora-2-app-opens-floodgates-to-ai-videos-of-pikachu-mario-and-more">initially allowed users to generate clips featuring licensed Nintendo and Disney characters</a>, including Mario, Darth Vader, Pikachu and an array of other Pokémon.

		<p>Wildlight Entertainment has released patch 1.0.4 for its free to play hero shooter Highguard, with the update adding field of view sliders for console players, and addressed some bug and crash issues. Highguard was released earlier this week and since launch the game has received a mixed response. You can check out Highguard update 1.0.4 patch notes below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gameplay Launch Trailer | Highguard" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gqFccBZyTaA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<h2>Highguard 1.0.4 update patch notes</h2>

<p><i>Note: in an effort to release these changes to our players as quickly as possible, a number of menu options are not yet localized in languages other than English. Properly localized settings will be prepared for a future patch.</i><wbr><wbr></p>

<ul>
<li>Added the ability to set Crouch to Hold or Toggle for all platforms.<wbr></li>
<li>Added the ability to set Aim Down Sights to Hold or Toggle for PC only (for now).<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><i>Toggling into ADS then tapping Sprint (shift on PC, left stick on controller) will swap your scope. This is disorienting on controller. PC players are recommended to rebind scope swap if using Toggle ADS. We will continue to look into adding this for console players who can’t rebind buttons yet, but we will need more time.</i><wbr><wbr></p>

<ul>
<li>Console users can now adjust FoV to 110.<wbr></li>
<li>Low scalability settings for shadows and reflections are tuned for even more performance at the cost of some image quality.<wbr></li>
<li>Low shadow setting now also disables volumetric fog.<wbr></li>
<li>Added a new “View Distance Quality” setting that controls skeletal mesh LODs, which can be another useful control to tune GPU and CPU usage.<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p>Players now have the ability to toggle the following features on or off, irrespective of other quality options:<wbr></p>

<ul>
<li>Anisotropic Materials<wbr></li>
<li>Chromatic Aberration<wbr></li>
<li>Bloom<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><i>Motion Blur and Depth of Field need more testing to disable safely. Look for these options very soon.</i><wbr></p>
<ul>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/28/highguard-review-in-progress/">Highguard Review in Progress</a></h2>
<p>While we haven’t got a full review for Highguard yet, Dom gave some early impressions saying, <em>“Highguard’s first steps into the PvP arena are confident and unashamed, despite what the angry voices on the internet might tell you. The slightly odd mix of Apex Legends, Rainbow Six and He-Man actually makes for a good time, and there’s so much room for more to happen here. That will take time, and I hope that it finds the audience it needs to thrive.”</em></p>

This controversial site has repeatedly caused consternation in Japan when visited by political figures, and even by previous Pokémon employees, and once again people were upset to see the location listed as the site of a TCG tournament.</p> <p>The Yasukuni Shrine commemorates the Japanese people who died in conflicts from 1869 to 1954, and thus includes the soldiers who died as part of Japan’s forces fighting for the Axis powers in World War II, many of whom were charged with the most serious of war crimes. As such, it’s a very controversial site, both within and without the country, and it causes serious stirs whenever anyone of prominence chooses to make a public visit. Indeed, The Pokémon Company discovered this for itself in 2019 when a number of employees from Creatures visited the Shinto shrine for its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatsum%C5%8Dde"><i>hatsumōde</i></a>.</p>

 <p>Given its hugely complicated politics and the controversies that arise every time it’s visited, TPC clearly doesn’t want it used as the site of a <em>PTCG</em> event. However, live events are added to the company’s site by those with an official <em>Pokémon&nbsp;</em>Play certification, rather than by TPC itself. It works the same all around the world—if you want to find a local Play event near you, <a href="https://events.pokemon.com/EventLocator/?locale=en-us">you can look them up on the U.S. version of the site</a>. So it seems someone with such a certification in Japan added the event to the vast numbers listed for the country.</p> <p>“On the event search page of the ‘Pokémon Card Game Trainers Website’ operated by our company,” <a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/media/news/detail/368.html">begins a statement on&nbsp;<em>Pokémon</em>‘s corporate site</a> (via machine translation), “information about an event scheduled to be held at Yasukuni Shrine was posted.” The statement goes on to call allowing this Yasukuni Shrine event to be listed the result of a “lack of due diligence,” adding, “even though it should not have been held in the first place.”</p>

 <p>The event was canceled once discovered, say TPC, adding an apology (again, via machine translation). “We have received feedback and opinions from various parties since the information about this event was released, and we sincerely apologize for this.” The company adds that it will “fundamentally change and strengthen the review system and confirmation process for event information” to prevent something like this happening again.</p>

<p>Over 25 years since its initial release, Dragon Quest VII Reimagined provides players with a huge modernization of the classic game, and the release date is right around the corner.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/genres/rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RPG</a> title was a huge hit when it was initially released at the turn of the millennium, and the remastered version is one of the most eagerly anticipated titles releasing in the early part of 2026.</p>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for all the release date and start time details for Dragon Quest VII Reimagined, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>

<p><strong>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined is set for launch on February 5, though the date may vary based on your region and the platform you are playing on.</strong></p>



<p>For those that purchase the Digital Deluxe Edition, 48 hours of early access are available as an incentive.</p>



<p>Dragon Quest VII Reimaged is available across multiple platforms, but the release time and date vary across them; however, for the vast majority, it will be February 5 when you can start playing.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-start-times">What Are The Dragon Quest VII Reimagined Start Times?</h2>



<p><strong>The start time for Dragon Quest VII Reimagined varies based on platform, with a 12 AM PT release on consoles, and a 9 AM PT release on Steam.</strong> <strong>Those with early access can jump in up to 48 hours before these times. </strong></p>



<p>As is customary for platforms like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/xbox-series-x/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Series X</a>|S, Dragon Quest VII Reimaged has a staggered release date, which means that you can play early in your time zone if you adjust your settings accordingly, which is very easy to do on Xbox.</p>



<p>For <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/platforms/steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> players, however, the release time is global and set in stone, with a morning release for those in the United States, while European players have to wait until the afternoon, and other regions may need to wait until the early hours of the morning on February 6.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Former Skyrim Lead Says Elder Scrolls TV Show Wouldn’t Work]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/former-skyrim-lead-elder-scrolls-tv-show-not-work/</link>
            <guid>1420906</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bethesda Game Studios has seen immense success with the delivery of the Fallout television show. It has won awards, pulled millions of eyes to the Fallout universe, and opened the door to collaborations across the ecosystem. But would that success roll over into The Elder Scrolls if <strong>that franchise </strong>were to be adapted into a live-action production?</p>



<p>According to Bruce Nesmith, former design lead on The Elder Scrolls IV: Skyrim, and a quest writer on Fallout 3 (amongst other things), a live-action adaptation of The Elder Scrolls <strong>probably wouldn’t work</strong>.</p>











<p>Nesmith worked at Bethesda Game Studios for several years, leaving in 2021 to chase new horizons. But before he departed, he offered key contributions to some of the company’s most ambitious projects, including 2011’s Elder Scrolls game, <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-is-being-released-again/">Skyrim</a></strong>. It’s widely considered one of the best games ever made, and he played a pivotal part in bringing it to life.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.pressboxpr.co.uk/news/bruce-nesmith-exclusive-skyrims-design-lead-on-where-he-would-set-the-elder-scrolls-6-and-what-to-expect-from-the-future-of-fallout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Press Box PR</a>, Nesmith spoke at length about Fallout, The Elder Scrolls, and the world around him and what he has created – and continues to create.</p>



<p>One segment turned to talking about the Fallout TV show and the success it has seen since debuting in April 2024.</p>



<p>The interviewer asked Nesmith if he could see The Elder Scrolls receiving the live-action treatment, but the former Bethesda Game Studios developer was sceptical and pretty on the money with his opinion:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Do they really need marketing for Elder Scrolls 6?</p>



<p>There’s something very special and different and unique about Fallout that lends itself to becoming a TV or movie experience whereas The Elder Scrolls is trying to be a standard kind of fantasy. That’s not as interesting.</p>



<p>You look at Fallout, everything is special about it. There is nothing like the Fallout universe anywhere else in gaming.</p>



<p>That makes it easy to make a TV show and draw eyeballs as opposed to going into a fantasy world where I’ve got elves and people throwing spells around. You’d have to raise those stakes. There’s a dragon? I’ve seen dragons 20 times before. What are you giving to viewers that’s new?&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don’t know that The Elder Scrolls would fit that media well. Maybe a movie but I would struggle to see a TV show.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a good point. Nesmith pointed to brands like Game of Thrones and Lord of the Rings, which could be seen as very Elder Scrolls-coded. There are plenty of television shows and movies with fantasy themes, even adaptations like The Witcher walk a close line to the Bethesda-backed brand, for instance.</p>



<p>It’s highly unlikely Bethesda Game Studios will turn anything other than Fallout into a show, especially as the series could run <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-tv-show-could-run-more-than-a-decade/">for up to a <strong>decade</strong></a>, all being well.</p>



<p>Now, if we could just start talking about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-wants-play-fallout-5-600-hours-rookie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">making Fallout 5 a reality</a>…</p>
