<p>The Call of Duty League has been the pinnacle of COD esports for the last five years. It’s the top-most tier of the competitive ecosystem, a multi-million-dollar league backed by the biggest names in modern gaming such as FaZe, OpTic, Cloud9, and 100 Thieves. Behind the scenes, one company has worked tirelessly to bring several teams to the next level in the Call of Duty League.</p>



<p>Enter Adamas, a performance, leadership, and development coaching organisation that has supported more than half the teams in the Call of Duty League. This effective, invaluable group has been a secret power for many of today’s CDL squads, including those that have gone on to claim the most lucrative prizes in the competitive space.</p>



<p>I was recently fortunate enough to catch up with Adamas at the CDL Madrid Major, and I took the opportunity to question some of the COD League’s players about the impact this organisation has on their performance.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-power-of-adamas">The Power of Adamas</h2>



<p>I’ve been connected with <a href="https://www.adamasesports.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Adamas</a> for more than two years, taking a special interest in the organisation around the time that the New York Subliners went on a phenomenal run through the 2023 CDL season. The squad managed to secure two Major trophies and then won COD Champs, all while under the guidance and gravity of Adamas Esports.</p>



<p>In the last three years, Adamas has directly influenced the performances of the teams that have claimed seven out of 13 possible major tournaments, including the Call of Duty League Championship and the inaugural Esports World Cup in Riyadh.</p>



<p>At the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overactive-media-cdl-major-in-madrid-results/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CDL Major in Madrid</a>, Atlanta FaZe stormed to victory just weeks after winning the first CDL Minor, all while being closely aligned with Adamas and singing the company’s praises. I connected with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-faze-abezy-cellium-madrid-major/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atlanta FaZe’s superstar players</a> at the Major in Spain, catching up on their impressions of Adamas.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>(They have) <strong>helped us tremendously</strong>. I feel like with everything — every aspect of our team, when it comes to trusting each other, being more of a team in all those ways, I feel like (they’ve) been just insane.</em></p>



<p><em>They’ve done so much for us already.</em></p>



<p>– Tyler ‘aBeZy’ Pharris</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tyler went on to note that Adamas has made the team’s mentality ‘<em>tenfold better</em>‘.</p>



<p>Even those who don’t ‘believe’ in the practices that Adamas preaches eventually see the benefit in what the company offers. I caught up with Cellium, one of the best Call of Duty players in the world, to get his two cents on Adamas:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Yeah, I was going to say I’ve never really been a believer in that whole ‘thing’. (They have) <strong>definitely proved me wrong with that</strong>, because (they’ve) helped me and the team a lot.</em></p>



<p>– McArthur ‘Cellium’ Jovel</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I also had a chance to chat <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lat-scrap-and-ghosty-interview-cdl-super-team/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the LA Thieves</a>, sitting down with Scrap and Ghosty, two of the team’s more prolific players. They shared similar sentiments about Adamas, which also acts as a performance and development resource for the 100 Thieves-backed CDL team.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>I feel like <strong>it helps a lot with the team cameraderie</strong>, just being comfortable with each other, fully trusting each other, calming yourself down if you need to. Mostly the team cameraderie aspect.</em></p>



<p><em>We’re a brand-new team, only been playing with each other two, three months total, and speedening up the process, (they’ve) helped quite a bit with that.</em></p>



<p>– Dan ‘Ghosty’ Rothe</p>
</blockquote>



<blockquote>
<p><em>We’re all just a fun team to be around, we be hanging out outside of the game as well, I think we’re super comfortable on stage together. I think (they’ve) <strong>made it even better for us</strong>.</em></p>



<p>– Thomas ‘Scrap’ Ernst</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 id="h-from-the-source">From the Source</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Matt Fisher has worked with the biggest names in Call of Duty esports</figcaption></figure>







<p>I had an extended chat with Matt ‘Fish’ Fisher, the Director of Performance at Adamas Esports and one of the nicest and most confident people I’ve ever met. He started his CDL journey with the New York Subliners, aligning himself with the industry greats like James ‘Clayster’ Eubanks and working to instil an ‘identity of athlete’ where the concept had never before surfaced.</p>



<p>He gave me the secret recipe for the company’s work inside the Call of Duty League:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>One of our core philosophies at Adamas is that we take a human-centered approach. Regardless of the game you play, the happier and healthier you are as a human being, the better you will perform both in game and in life. </em></p>



<p><em>We haven’t taught a single COD player or coach how to improve their strategies or technical skills, but we have helped them recognise how optimising other aspects of their lives will have a carry-over effect to in-game.</em></p>



<p><em>Much of our work is in helping to establish and maintain a team culture and environment that is conducive to both wellness and performance. Our goal is to set these organisations up with a foundation that will lead to consistent performance year after year, and allow their talent to perform to their full potential.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>And the results are certainly front and centre for all to see. Fish gave me critical insights into the end-to-end process, from the team-building exercises to pre-match traditions and preparations. He noted that while we were talking, the Atlanta FaZe team was ‘meditating’ backstage, suggesting that it’s a practice that might seem unorthodox or invalid to some players.</p>



<p>That was shortly before <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/drazah-shots-fired-lat-madrid-major/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FaZe went on to win</a> the first CDL Major of the 2025 season.</p>



<p>Last season, the Adamas folks teamed up with the LA Guerrillas, a squad that almost went dark for a while as it tussled with internal issues and a lack of funding.</p>



<p>The roster was made up mostly of untested talent, but as Fish put it,<em> ‘We feel like they were able to prove that a ‘bare bones’ team with minimum investment in player salaries and staff, supported by Adamas’ expertise, could lead to results that many considered a huge ‘overachievement’.’</em></p>



<p>From the top to the bottom, Adamas supports the Call of Duty League. The organisation helps the players immeasurably, but there’s also plenty of time spent with organisation owners and general managers, with the company promoting a growth mindset that allows the key decision-makers to <strong>make the <em>right</em> decisions</strong>, which at the end of the day, benefits <strong>everyone</strong>.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cdl-major-iv-dreamhack-first-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty League’s 2025 season</a> continues to unravel. From this Friday, the qualifiers are back for Major II, and beyond that, there are another five months of competitive coverage lined up.</p>

PlayStation and Xbox both charge for online multiplayer, so why not Nintendo? Well, no native voice chat for one, but hey, Nintendo’s gonna Nintendo. To sweeten the pot, the company threw in access to a growing library of classic NES games. For anyone who hadn’t already purchased a NES Classic two years earlier, it was a nice trip down memory lane for just $20 a year. </p><p>But since then it’s grown, and so has the price. Switch Online added SNES games in 2019, followed by Nintendo 64 and Sega Genesis games in 2021, which it bundled together in a separate Expansion Pack that increased the total annual price to $50. Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and Game Boy Advance games are the latest to join that tiered library, which now includes over 200 games total across three generations of consoles and handhelds. </p><p>It feels more than a little absurd that the only way to (legally) access these games in the year 2025 is to effectively rent them for an annual fee. What started off as a welcome novelty drafting off the broader incorruptible enthusiasm for the Switch in its early years has now become a bit of a ripoff. I’m long past the point of wanting a giant buffet of retro games to occasionally peruse at my leisure. I know what I want to play and what I’ll keep returning to. Why am I spending $50 to show<em> The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</em> to my kid for the first time? It was not always thus.</p><p>Nintendo has often lagged behind its competitors when it comes to online features and digital marketplaces, but it was actually first in letting players pay to download and play old games on modern consoles. The Wii launched in 2006 with the Virtual Console, offering old NES games for sale digitally including <em>Donkey Kong</em>, <em>Mario Bros.</em>, and <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>. I still remember, during my first semester home from college, popping in my debit card to buy <em>Military Madness</em> and experiencing its amazing sci-fi soundtrack and moon-based warfare for the first time in a decade. </p><figure id="" data-id="736aae99131396ed81520eb393844dbc" data-recommend-id="image://736aae99131396ed81520eb393844dbc" data-format="jpg" data-width="4000" data-height="2250" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Switch Online is displayed on a Switch.

It was a perfect model with one glaring flaw on Nintendo’s hardware: your purchase history didn’t carry over from console to console. The Virtual Console on Wii was different from the one on 3DS which was different from the one on Wii U. Players had to keep buying the same games over and over again which became something of a joke, a bit of shorthand for how out of touch Nintendo was.</p><p>This frustration potentially paved the way for some of the initial positivity surrounding the launch of Switch Online. Finally a single, permanent library. No more buying<em> Excitebike</em> for the fourth time. Instead, it turns out the Switch would have been the perfect time to <em>keep</em> doing the Virtual Console. Nintendo has already confirmed backwards compatibility for the Switch 2. All those downloaded copies of <em>StarTropics</em>, <em>Mario Kart 64</em>, and <em>Wonder Boy in Monster Land</em> would have actually carried over this time. </p><p>Instead Nintendo is playing the role of the last online Blockbuster, badgering me for $4 every time I want to revisit the original <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> games, but without the option to just buy it by never returning it because it got lost under my car seat. Game Pass may have shattered the value proposition of buying stuff on Xbox, but at least it still lets you. Nintendo was once at the forefront of digital game preservation on console. Now we’ve got Switch Online, which feels like a relic from a stingier, more stubborn era at the company. </p><p>If Nintendo doesn’t bring back the Virtual Console for the Switch 2, things might only get more frustrating this time around. We could be looking at an annual $100 WaveBird Pack that adds all-time great GameCube games that will otherwise never get remade or ported, like <em>Mario Kart: Double Dash </em>and <em>Star Wars Rogue Squadron II: Rogue Leader</em>. And I will pay it because I am a fanboy ruled by nostalgia and a chump. It doesn’t have to be this way. </p><p>Other publishers, including Capcom and Konami, have shown it’s possible to sell great anthologies of old games on Switch. Some have even partnered with companies like Digital Eclipse to add all kinds of extra bells and whistles, like auto-play options and vast in-game archives of everything from scans of original booklets to developer notes and sketches. Others have released HD collections, like Square Enix’s<em> Mana</em> and <em>Final Fantasy</em>  remasters.</p><p>“The existence of [Switch Online] doesn’t preclude Nintendo from <em>selling</em> these games, either, no more so than the existence of Netflix negates the idea of Blu-ray,” former <em>Kotaku </em>editor Chris Kohler (who now works at Digital Eclipse) <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-can-do-so-much-better-than-virtual-console-1825871773&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-can-do-so-much-better-than-virtual-console-1825871773">wrote back in 2018</a></span>.

<p>The competitive Rainbow Six Siege community has come to the support of a Team Secret player after the CEO of his team released him and criticized him for showing emotion after a loss. Numerous players and personalities are now calling out the CEO for their behavior.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-team-secret-ceo-s-actions-uncover-the-need-to-talk-about-mental-health">Team Secret CEO’s Actions Uncover the Need to Talk About Mental Health</h2>



<p>After being released by Team Secret following a group stage elimination at The Six Invitational, Australian player Jake “Virtue” Grannan posted on X that the move caught him by surprise. “Didn’t see this coming at all, after all the energy and work that I’ve been putting in,” he <a href="https://x.com/Virtue_R6/status/1889005812346941812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>. “One bad tournament has now lead me to be LFT [looking for team].”</p>



<p>However, a day later, Virtue and almost the entire Siege community were stunned by <a href="https://x.com/zypher84/status/1889338159739347427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a reply</a> to this post made by Secret CEO John Yao. Yao shared a screenshot of the team after they were eliminated, showing Virtue facing away from the group. The caption reads: “I am also very surprised.”</p>



<p>This reply, which appears to disparage Virtue, has drawn the ire of several members of the Siege community. Virtue confirmed that he was very emotional, that he was “almost crying,” and that he “couldn’t look at anyone” after a bad series. Some of the game’s biggest stars came to Virtue’s defense, including M80’s Leonardo “Kyno” Figueiredo and DarkZero’s Jason “Beaulo” Doty. The replies and quote reposts are littered with players, casters, coaches, and others criticizing Yao and defending Virtue.</p>



<p>While many are clearly upset about Yao’s comments, they have at least opened the door for a greater conversation about men’s mental health. It’s okay to cry, and it’s okay to cry in front of others.</p>



<p>Did the Team Secret CEO cross the line? Should mental health become a bigger talking point in esports? Let us know down below and on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>In 2013, John Riccitiello <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-resigns/1100-6405525/" data-ref-id="1100-6405525">stepped down as EA's CEO</a> following a tumultuous six-year run on top of the company. During Riccitiello's reign, Activision's Call of Duty franchise overtook Battlefield in terms of popularity, and it didn't help when Riccitiello <a href="https://stealthoptional.com/article/unitys-ceo-devs-pay-per-install-charge-fps-gamers-per-bullet" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">joked that Battlefield players should be charged to reload</a>. Now, ex-Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick has shared his belief that Riccitiello was the worst CEO in the video game industry.</p><p>During a joint appearance on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grit</a> with former EA Chief Creative Officer Bing Gordon, Kotick revealed that Activision was afraid that Gordon would assume control of EA and prove to be a good leader for the company.</p><p>"I'm not saying this because [Gordon is] sitting here," said Kotick. "Our fear was always that Bing was going to run [EA]. And we would have paid for Riccitiello to stay a CEO forever... like we thought he was the worst CEO in video games." Gordon also noted that Riccitiello may have hastened his departure from EA as well.</p><p>Regardless of his feelings about Riccitiello, Kotick said that there were multiple attempts in the past to bring EA and Activision together as a single company.</p><p>"[EA] tried to buy us a bunch of times. We had merger conversations," recalled Kotick. Later in the podcast, Kotick admitted that Activision thought that EA's "business [was] in a lot of ways was better than ours," before Gordon pointed out that Blizzard's business is even better than EA's.</p><p>During that same interview, Gordon recalled that EA <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-passed-on-chances-to-buy-guitar-hero-call-of-duty-and-blizzard/1100-6529398/" data-ref-id="1100-6529398">passed on the chance to buy Guitar Hero, Call of Duty, and Blizzard</a> before Activision ultimately swept up all three. Kotick also called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-activision-blizzard-boss-thought-warcraft-was-one-of-the-worst-movies-ever-made/1100-6529392/" data-ref-id="1100-6529392">the Warcraft film one of the worst movies</a> he's ever seen and explained why it was a mistake for Blizzard to focus so much attention on that project.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-is-10-to-12-hours-long-story-unfolds-over-a-day/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Compulsion Games, the developer for South of Midnight, has revealed that the game's runtime will be around "10 to 12 hours" as the story unfolds over a single day. In total, the game has 14 chapters that players will get to go through, with "a kind of urgency to it" throughout as you begin to unveil Hazel's story. Jasmin Roy, Gameplay Director of South of Midnight,<a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/south-of-midnight-how-long-to-beat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> spoke to GamesRadar+</a> about this title, explaining that the game is a bit bigger than they thought but is in the original ballpark of what they were aiming for at the beginning.</p>
<p><iframe title="Weaving Hazel's Journey: A South of Midnight Documentary" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wLBOyKqw58A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Throughout the journey in South of Midnight, you'll get to go through different environments and biomes, with each new environment having a very specific atmosphere and type of mood. All of this was explained in a 30-minute documentary from Compulsion Games that was released last year, where the developers spoke about the themes they chose to incorporate into the story as a "love letter to the South," making sure to balance all themes carefully throughout. You can find the documentary above, where more of the specific details of the environments are explained, as well as the efforts that went into it.</p>
<p>In the documentary, you are introduced to four of the biomes that you will get to explore. This includes the Swamps, the Delta, the Appalachians, and a biome that is inspired by New Orleans. Considering how short the game is, and with it taking place across a 24-hour time frame, this seems like a lot of new ground to cover in such a short time.</p>
<p>The game is described as "a linear game with some bits of exploration through the sections, and you go through various different types of locations in the deep South, all the span of one day. So you start your adventure in the morning, and it ends at midnight," by Art Director Whitney Clayton.</p>
<p>In this interview with GamesRadar+, it's also mentioned that the game took around five years to plan out and develop, despite the game being a shorter tale for those who play it. This is due to the reverse-engineered 3D-modelled world as well as the extensive research, planning, and prototypes that had to be done through the years. However, Roy states that "the bulk of the game has been made in the last three years."</p>
<p>The narrative of South of Midnight is front and center. "There's a kind of urgency to it that makes it feel like we want you to explore, but it needs to support the momentum of Hazel's journey."</p>
<p>This game was showcased during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/south-of-midnight-is-out-on-april-8/">Xbox Developer Direct</a>, a new title that is being made by Compulsion Games, the minds behind We Happy Few and Contrast. This is their third game to be developed and is set for release on April 8 on PC and Xbox Series X|S. Those who have Game Pass will also have access to this title when it is released.</p>

<p>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2 could be on its way to PlayStation 5 (PS5) sooner rather than later. According to a tease posted on social media by Windows Central’s Jez Corden, the Xbox console exclusive is likely one of the next first-party Xbox games to come to competing consoles.</p>



<p>In a reply to a user on Twitter who questioned “if” the game will come, Corden gave a more definitive tease of the possibility.</p>



<p>“Not if, “when!” and when is pretty soon from what I’ve been hearing,” <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1889342523807527095" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he said</a>. </p>

<p>The plan to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-more-xbox-games-multiplatform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bring more Xbox games</a> to PlayStation—and even Nintendo Switch—is something that Microsoft has been actively discussing for some time now. As sales of Xbox hardware continue to drop, the company is looking at all avenues to increase its gaming revenue moving forward. The most recent Xbox exclusive to be announced for PS5 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forza-horizon-5-playstation-5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forza Horizon 5</a>, which is set to launch this spring on the platform. Also coming in the spring is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>. The latest rumors claim that Bethesda’s newest game is looking at an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-targeting-an-april-2025-release-for-ps5-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">April release</a>.</p>



<p>Sony announced on Tuesday its first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-announces-state-of-play-for-february-12/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation State of Play</a> for the year will take place on February 12. Whether or not an announcement for Hellblade 2 or other Xbox titles on PS5 will be part of the 40+ minute show remains to be seen.</p>

Following its multiplayer launch at the end of last year, free-to-play tactical FPS Delta Force will get its delayed single-player campaign mode, Black Hawk Down, next Friday, 21st February.
</p>
<p>
Delta Force - a revival of defunct developer NovaLogic's long-running shooter series - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencent-reviving-delta-force-fps-franchise">announced by publisher Tencent</a> in 2023. At the time, there was much talk of its single-player story campaign - inspired by Ridley Scott's 2002 movie Black Hawk Down and the classic Delta Force campaign of the same name - but it didn't materialise when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tencents-call-of-duty-challenger-delta-force-hawk-ops-launching-as-pc-open-beta-this-december">Delta Force's multiplayer component launched into PC open beta</a> in December.

Now, however, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> has given Black Hawk Down a (slightly later than expected) 21st February release date. It'll be playable both solo and co-operatively, with players taking on the role of an elite Delta Force operative as they "relive one of the most iconic military operations, where a straightforward capture operation turns into an impossible extraction." There's not much else to report just yet, but Tencent says it'll be sharing more "in the following days".

Eurogamer contributor Rick Lane was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/delta-force-hawk-ops-has-a-real-shot-at-knocking-call-of-duty-and-battlefield-off-their-perch">broadly impressed by Delta Force</a> when he played it ahead of its open beta launch last year, saying it had a "real shot at knocking Call of Duty and Battlefield off their perch". Its reception hasn't been quite so warm on Steam, however, with ongoing player complaints of rampant cheating having <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2507950/Delta_Force/">contributed to its "mixed" rating</a>.
</p>
<p>
Delta Force is currently only available on PC but the game - and its Black Hawk Down campaign - are set to arrive on Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 at a later date.

                <p>According to Activision founder Bobby Kotick, Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger was at one point in time interested in buying Nintendo, or at least interested in exploring the idea of buying Nintendo.</p><p>Kotick said on the <a href="https://open.spotify.com/episode/2MN7nJdijzjfcP232NsHZF?si=mHGPjwjXQMiFbuZZEWcgqA" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Grit podcast</a> that Munger was not a fan of video games, but saw an opportunity to potentially make a bid for Nintendo. Munger is said to have floated the idea of spending some of Berkshire's immense holdings on making moves in the video game space. One of Munger's ideas, apparently, was to buy Nintendo.</p><p>"He goes, 'You know, I was looking at a couple other companies in your sector. I think if we bought yours, we should buy that company Nintendo, too,'" Kotick recalled. "He said, 'Have you guys looked at it? I was like, 'Yeah.' It was trading [at the time] at like 13 billion, with 7 billion in cash. He goes, 'You know, I don't think anything is gonna go really bad before I'm dead, and then if it goes bad after I'm dead, they'll just chalk it up to the folly of an 82-year-old, so you don't have to be so concerned about disappointing me."</p><p>This came about at a time when the French conglomerate Vivendi was forced to sell its stake in Activision, and Berkshire Hathaway was in the mix to buy it. That didn't happen, though, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-blizzard-completes-buyback-from-vivendi/1100-6415550/" data-ref-id="1100-6415550">Activision ultimately bought itself back from Vivendi</a>.</p><p>During one of his weekly Friday lunches with Munger, Kotick asked for advice on how to structure a buyback from Vivendi. It was at this time that Munger reportedly said he wanted to fund the buyback. When he got up to go to the bathroom, Activision's Brian Kelly said to Kotick that if Munger--an adept investor--wanted to buy the stake, then he and Kotick should want that as well. And that's eventually what happened.</p><p>"He didn't like the business [of video games]," Kotick said of Munger. "He thought it was a step removed from gambling. He's like, 'You know, you're preying off people's addictions.' And I was like, 'I'm not. I'm actually giving them joy and fun, and if you ever tried a video game, you'd see that.' He always had this... little bit of an aversion."</p><p>Of course, Berkshire did not buy Nintendo. As for Munger, he passed away in 2023 at the age of 99. Berkshire Hathaway currently has more than <a href="https://www.fool.com/investing/how-to-invest/stocks/what-does-berkshire-hathaway-own/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$325 billion in cash</a> and could theoretically try to buy pretty much any company on the open market, but it has not signaled any intent to buy a video game company.</p><h3><strong>Microsoft also tried to buy Nintendo</strong></h3><p>More than 20 years ago, Microsoft tried to buy Nintendo. Then-CEO Steve Ballmer sent staff to Japan to broach the idea, and the team apparently got <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-tried-to-acquire-nintendo-square-and-midway-years-ago/1100-6485939/" data-ref-id="1100-6485939">laughed out of the room.</a></p><p>Berkshire did make a very big investment in the video game space in 2022, when it <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2022/02/15/investing/warren-buffett-berkshire-hathaway-activision-blizzard-microsoft/index.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">bought almost 15 million shares of Activision Blizzard</a> just before Microsoft announced its intention to buy the company. Berkshire paid an average of about $66.50 per share, and that price surged tremendously after Microsoft announced its plans to buy Activision Blizzard. The deal was ultimately approved at $95 per share, so Berkshire no doubt made a very big profit on the investment.</p><h3><strong>Game Pass issues</strong></h3><p>Also in the interview, Kotick discussed Microsoft's blockbuster $75.4 billion buyout of Activision Blizzard, saying he and Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella "got the deal done in three days." Of course, it took more than a year for regulatory approval, but the framework was apparently decided in just 72 hours. The only disagreement Kotick and Nadella had around the deal focused on Microsoft's vision for Game Pass.</p><p>Kotick mentioned how World of Warcraft has been successful with its $15/month subscription cost, and that's just for one game. "Why would I put that into a Game Pass?" Kotick said. "I said to these guys, 'Why trade our flexible business models where you can do what's actually in the best interest of the customer.' I didn't believe in that. But the beauty if you're Microsoft... you can take that bet."</p><p>Kotick is not the only higher-up who has questioned the economic realities of Game Pass, as companies like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/devolver-is-worried-by-ps-plus-xbox-game-pass-and-/1100-6470836/" data-ref-id="1100-6470836">Devolver Digital have spoken critically of the service since day one.</a> Take-Two's Strauss Zelnick has also discussed why <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-will-help-drive-memberships-for-a-period-of-time/1100-6525664/" data-ref-id="1100-6525664">launching new games in Game Pass makes no sense for the company</a>. There are examples, too, of Game Pass actually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/descenders-publisher-saw-descenders-xbox-one-sales/1100-6469046/" data-ref-id="1100-6469046">helping to drive game sales outside the subscription</a>, and Doom creator John Romero just recently said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-doesnt-hurt-game-companies-says-doom-co-creator/1100-6529136/" data-ref-id="1100-6529136">Game Pass doesn't hurt companies</a>.</p><p>Microsoft itself previously acknowledged that Game Pass can, in some cases, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-does-decrease-base-game-sales-microsoft-says/1100-6511473/" data-ref-id="1100-6511473">cannibalize game sales</a>--but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-clarifies-its-own-admission-that-game-pass-cannibalizes-some-game-sales/1100-6511503/" data-ref-id="1100-6511503">not in every case</a>.</p>

                <p>One of the first and longest-running MMORPGs ever made, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tibia/" data-ref-id="5000-18504">Tibia</a>, will receive a new class for the first time ever in its almost 30-year history, developer CipSoft has announced. The Monk class will join Tibia's four original classes--Sorcerer, Paladin, Druid, and Knight--which launched alongside the top-down 2D MMO in 1997.</p><p dir="ltr">As revealed in a <a href="https://www.tibia.com/news/?subtopic=newsarchive&amp;id=8214" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> and teaser video, the Monk will be a melee fighter that can also provide a support role by healing allies. CipSoft said the Monk can be "played in a very special way" but wanted to make sure it fit seamlessly into the world of Tibia and existed in harmony with the game's existing four classes. The team also knew it wanted to introduce a new melee class that could also heal, but didn't want it to encroach on secondary roles like debuffing filled by Paladin and Sorcerers.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMzXYOz6o7I" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DMzXYOz6o7I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"In fact, one of our main goals was to ensure that the new vocation holds a unique position without undermining the value of others or rendering them obsolete," CipSoft said. "We are very happy about the arrival of the Monk and hope you are just as eager to experience what it is like when they spring into action."</p><p dir="ltr">The Monk will feature a few unique mechanics, such as the Harmony, Virtue, and Serene systems. Using specific attacks will build up Harmony that can then be consumed to heavily boost the Monk's power, while Virtues are powerful buffs the Monk can choose between. Monks in a Serene state will be considerably more powerful, but can only be achieved while playing solo or when there are six or fewer monsters nearby. CipSoft said the Serene system is to ensure that Monks are strong in specific scenarios when Serene, but won't surpass the damage of other classes or the Knight's ability to tank when not in a Serene state.</p><p dir="ltr">CipSoft said it will be rolling out five blogs in the coming days and weeks to dive into the design and development of the Monk. As for when the Monk will be playable, CipSoft said it will officially arrive later this year, with the chance to test the new class starting on February 25.</p><p dir="ltr">Tibia is free-to-play, with the option to pay and upgrade to a premium subscription that grants various perks like an XP boost, access to more areas, the ability to purchase homes, and other benefits.</p>

midseason updates include more game modes, limited-time events, and quality-of-life updates across all modes.</p><p dir="ltr">At the start of Season 2, Activision teased that a melee-focused set of new weapons would be revealed for the midseason update. There is also a St. Patrick's Day: Clover Craze holiday event, and more details should arrive closer to the update.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 2 is themed around ninjas, and multiple dataminers suggest that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-tmnt-crossover-could-be-coming/1100-6529089/">TMNT-themed crossover is planned</a> for the midseason update. This is rumored to have an event and limited-time game mode themed around the turtles. Rumored operator bundles for the skateboarding, pizza-eating Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fit the theme of this midseason update, as we have a set of teased melee weapons and the return of Call of Duty's Grind skatepark map.</p><p dir="ltr">Dual katanas were teased in promos for the launch of Season 2, with the additional melee weapons rumored to be a pair of sais, nunchucks, a bo staff, and a skateboard.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty previously had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-tmnts-shredder-with-a-gun-in-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-2-and-warzone-2/1100-6512543/">TMNT collab with the Shredder operator bundle</a> introduced in 2022's Modern Warfare 2, but the crossover felt odd without mention of the turtles themselves.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4442456-bo6-season-02-announcement-011.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442456" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4442456-bo6-season-02-announcement-011.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4442456"></a><figcaption>Season 2's Grind map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4442456-bo6-season-02-announcement-011.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Black_Ops_6_multiplayer">Black Ops 6 multiplayer</h2><p dir="ltr">Season 2 Reloaded includes two more multiplayer maps: Bullet and Grind. Bullet is a new map that takes place on a moving bullet train, and this will be available in 6v6 playlists as well as 2v2 Gunfight. Grind is the 6v6 skatepark map originally from Black Ops 2.</p><p dir="ltr">The update also adds a new perk. The Hunter's Instinct is an Enforcer perk in slot two, which, when equipped, will mark the nearest enemy whenever the player eliminates someone.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Zombies">Zombies</h2><p dir="ltr">Players shouldn't expect a new Zombies map. The Tomb arrived with the launch of Season 2, so the midseason update will likely be focused on quality-of-life updates for the map. However, there could be special limited-time modes themed around the upcoming holiday or the rumored TMNT event, similar to the Squid Game mode in Zombies for Season 1.</p><p dir="ltr">Directed Mode also arrives for The Tomb, which is the guided mode that helps players complete the main story quest. Completing the quest in Directed Mode won't allow players to earn all the unique rewards, but anyone looking to complete the story quest for the rewards can use our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-zombies-the-tomb-story-easter-egg-guide/2900-6181/">full guide for The Tomb main Easter egg quest</a> here.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Warzone">Warzone</h2><p dir="ltr">Activision hasn't included many midseason announcements for battle royale. However, the update will add a new perk in slot one called Low Profile, which enables players to move more quickly while crouched and prone, as well as move slightly faster when downed.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of Season 2 of Warzone is dedicated to game improvements and anti-cheat updates, and the developer previously confirmed some of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-dev-confirms-plans-to-scale-back-warzone-content-as-it-looks-to-improve-game/1100-6528901/">new content planned for Season 2 was shifted</a> in order to focus on game updates.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-players-wont-be-missing-out-if-they-largely-ignore-one-protagonist<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has assured that Assassin's Creed Shadows players who largely ignore one of the dual protagonists won't be "missing out."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative director Jonathan Dumont told <a href="https://screenrant.com/assassins-creed-shadows-world-protagonists-jonathan-dumont-interview/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Screen Rant</a> said Assassin's Creed Shadows won't force players to play as both the stealthy Naoe and the brutish Yasuke in equal measure when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-again-this-time-by-another-month">it arrives March 20</a>, nor will it lock off certain parts of the game to those who prefer one over the other.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I don't think you're missing out on things too much," Dumont said. "I think it's more on your preference to [say], 'Okay, I'll see how the game will adapt a little bit to the character if you choose one over the other.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"They get individual introductions and then they get their own questline also. Let's say [for] Naoe, a personal questline cannot be played by Yasuke and those are two distinct things. But the core of the game can be pick your character and the game adapts."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naoe has a play style reminiscent of the original Assassin's Creed games or, ironically, the most recent Assassin's Creed Mirage, which prioritises stealth and encourages full combat only as a last resort.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a stark difference to Yasuke who emulates the more aggressive elements of the role-playing game Assassin's Creed entries, meaning Origins, Odyssey, and Valhalla. He charges head on into battle instead of sticking to the shadows like Naoe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're not imposing players try to split the time," Dumont said. "If you prefer one character for any reason, you can play maybe, I don't know, I'm not going to put a percentage, but quite a bit of the game using one of them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But if you want to balance it out... I play quite a bit balanced out and what happens is, I play with one for three, four, five hours, and then I switch, and then I just play two, three hours. Usually I play stealth and then I [say], 'All right, let me destroy some camps and stuff all right for a while.' And then I just change like that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A lot rests on the shoulders of Assassin's Creed Shadows as not only the long-awaited Japan-set entry and the first full Assassin's Creed since 2020, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shares-take-a-hit-as-analysts-predict-lower-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-sales">a struggling Ubisoft needs it to perform well</a> following recent flops and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-investors-grill-ceo-cfo-on-potential-tencent-sale-delays-and-financial-woes">investor frustration</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not enjoyed a particularly positive promotional period so far, however, with the development team having to apologize on separate occasions for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-team-issues-apology-to-japanese-fans-for-marketing-that-has-caused-concern">inaccuracies in Assassin's Creed Shadows' depictions of Japan</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apologizes-to-japanese-historical-re-enactment-group-for-using-its-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-art-without-permission">using a historical recreation group's flag without permission</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet another controversy came as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-figure-removed-from-sale-over-insensitive-design">collectible figure maker PureArts removed an Assassin's Creed Shadows statue from sale</a> over its "insensitive" design, and combined with the two delays, fans are growing increasingly impatient as a result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-publisher-is-not-worried-about-the-game-influencing-violence/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>GTA 6’s parent company has stated they are “not worried” about the game influencing violent behaviour in the real world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Violence in video games has been a controversial subject in the industry for years, with the GTA series often being the poster boy for such campaigns. The popular series will receive a brand new instalment this fall, with Rockstar finally releasing GTA 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-fall-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this year</a>. Many wonder if new allegations related to violence will pop up again, but Take-Two’s CEO, Strauss Zelnick, doesn’t seem to be worried about it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/video/2025/02/10/watch-cnbcs-full-interview-with-take-two-interactive-chairman-and-ceo-strauss-zelnick.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CNBC</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/gta-6-publisher-claps-back-against-tv-media-inciting-disproven-violent-video-game-rhetoric/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Video Gamer</a>), Zelnick was asked whether he had concerns about GTA 6’s violence impacting the real world. He responded that he was “not worried.” Zelnick added, “To be clear: entertainment doesn’t create behaviour; entertainment reflects behaviour.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The CEO explained that entertainment allows people to express and engage with feelings as it tells stories. “The notion [that] entertainment creates behaviour has been tested and disproved over and over again.” Therefore, he isn’t concerned about GTA 6 influencing people to commit violence against others in the real world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Zelnick also discussed TV shows and movies with “very realistic-looking” violence, which doesn’t influence wrong behaviour; hence, he’s “not worried about photorealistic video games” inciting such behaviour.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Take-Two’s CEO recently spoke about GTA 6 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-talks-gta-6-not-coming-to-pc-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helping sell more consoles</a>. Also, the parent company’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-stock-hits-all-time-high-after-gta-6-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stocks rose to an all-time high</a> when they reconfirmed the fall 2025 release window. Do you think GTA 6 will influence violent behaviour in the real world?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our new&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

                <p>Although Activision Blizzard is now owned by Microsoft's gaming division, its rise to become one of the top video game publishers was inadvertently helped by EA's decision to turn down opportunities that could have been transformative. During a recent podcast appearance, former EA Chief Creative Officer Bing Gordon noted that EA had a chance to buy Guitar Hero, Call of Duty, and even Blizzard itself before Activision closed deals for all three.</p><p>"Call of Duty, Guitar Hero, and Blizzard, EA saw all those first and passed on all of them," said Gordon while appearing on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2urSgcuyyo" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grit</a> alongside Bobby Kotick, the former CEO of Activision Blizzard. Gordon went on to praise Kotick for keeping many of the original Blizzard team members in place after the company came under Activision's control.</p><p>Gordon told Kotick that he has "double high respect" for him for realizing that those properties were valuable to own "and then you kept the people around. I'm pretty sure that... the creative leaders would not have stuck around in another company. So you did some kind of a miracle of keeping them productive for long periods of time and probably biting your tongue from time to time."</p><p>In the same interview, Kotick noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ex-activision-blizzard-boss-thought-warcraft-was-one-of-the-worst-movies-ever-made/1100-6529392/" data-ref-id="1100-6529392">Blizzard already had a deal in place for the Warcraft movie</a> when Activision took over the company. And he went on to call it one of the worst movies he's ever seen while recounting why it was a mistake for the company to focus on that over making games.</p><p>Call of Duty is still going strong after EA passed on the deal, and it's been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-selling-games-of-each-of-the-past-25-years-in-the-us/2900-5031/" data-ref-id="2900-5031">the best-selling franchise for the last 25 years</a>. However, Guitar Hero has been dormant since the release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/guitar-hero-live-review/1900-6416284/" data-ref-id="1900-6416284">Guitar Hero Live</a> nearly a decade ago. Earlier this year, Hyperkin released a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-new-guitar-hero-wii-controller-has-been-announced-in-the-year-2025/1100-6528627/" data-ref-id="1100-6528627">new Guitar Hero controller for Wii</a>. But there don't appear to be any plans to resurrect the franchise anytime soon.</p>
