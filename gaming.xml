            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For the last few weeks, I’ve been playing Obsidian Entertainment’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-review-rpg-xbox-ps5-2000638368"><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></a> I really like it! And after wrapping the game up over the weekend, I realized that I just played the closest thing to <em>Fallout 5</em> that I’ll get until Bethesda finally ships the wasteland RPG in, like, a decade from now.</p> <p><em>The Outer Worlds 2,</em> out now on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, is the much bigger and better follow-up to Obsidian’s original<a href="https://kotaku.com/games/the-outer-worlds"><em> Outer Worlds</em> from 2016</a>. While both games are open-world space RPGs, the sequel expands on every part of the original game, featuring more planets, weapons, enemies, skills, factions, and features. And like the original, <em>Outer Worlds 2</em> is clearly inspired by Bethesda’s <em>Fallout</em> games and Obsidian’s own <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/review-fallout-new-vegas-5670346">Fallout: New Vegas</a>.</em> The original got close to emulating the experience of playing (and screwing around in) a <em>Fallout</em> RPG, but due to a limited budget and scope, didn’t quite nail it. <a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-rpg-inventory-weight-encumbered-2000650641"><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></a> does, and it’s wonderful.</p>

 <p>Everything I love about Bethesda’s <em>Fallout</em> games is here. Hand-crafted areas to explore, filled with stretches of empty land, bustling communities, and odd characters and situations to stumble into. <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> also features an in-depth RPG system with a massive list of perks and skills to level up, letting you build a smooth-talking scam artist, a beefy melee warrior, or a super-smart sniper able to hack any robot. Or you could create a murderous, evil idiot who is super lucky. And the best part is, <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-new-vegas-things-never-say-fan-bethesda-xbox-1851467599">like in<em> Fallout 3</em> and <em>New Vegas</em></a>, the world reacts to your choices and offers up ways to use those skills and perks to your advantage.</p>

 <p>I mean, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> even includes the ability to turn on an <a href="https://www.restart.run/articles/the-outer-worlds-2-soundtrack-interview">in-game radio and listen to in-world music, DJs, ads, and more</a> as you hike about the various planets, completing quests and discovering new locations. This is a key part of the <em>Fallout</em> formula for me and something I was happy to see included in <em>The</em> <em>Outer Worlds 2</em>. Blowing up random enemies with a laser gun is just more fun when retro music is blaring in the background.</p>

  <p>And unlike Bethesda’s <em>Fallout</em> games,<em> The Outer Worlds 2</em> doesn’t feel like it’s falling apart as you continue to play. It also features much better writing, more interesting companions, better combat, and far fewer bugs. In my many, many hours with <em>The Outer Worlds 2,</em> I only had to reload a save due to a bug once, and only encountered one other really annoying game-breaking glitch. Beyond that, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is a more stable and better-looking spin on the Bethesda RPG formula.</p> <p>If you’re someone who has been craving a new <em>Fallout</em> and doesn’t want to replay <em>Fallout 3</em> o<em>r New Vegas</em> for the 20th time, I’d highly recommend<em> Outer Worlds 2</em>. It’s probably the closest thing to a <em>Fallout 5</em> we’ll be getting from an Xbox-owned studio any time soon, because <a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-5-v-bethesda-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-starf-1849062025"><em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em> is still likely years away, and the next <em>Fallout</em> will only arrive once Bethesda is done with that</a>. Thankfully, <em>Outer Worlds 2</em> is pretty dang rad and is highly replayable. A good way to kill a few years while you wait for <em>Fallout 5.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Steve Rogers was supposed to retire with Peggy after time-traveling to the past at the end of </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-endgame-rerelease-movie-theater-tickets-doomsday-2000651023"><i><span>Avengers: Endgame</span></i></a><span>, but the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been struggling lately, so the man is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/chris-evans-avengers-doomsday-mcu-robert-downey-jr-1851717766"><span>back in </span><i><span>Avengers: Doomsday</span></i></a><span>, as if Disney has broken him out of an “in case of emergency” case. According to Hollywood leaker </span><a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK/status/2000541109412364416?s=20"><span>Daniel Richtman</span></a><span>, Marvel is reportedly putting out multiple theater-exclusive teasers featuring some returning characters for the film, and the first will star Chris Evans as the man formerly known as Captain America. From the looks of it, the video may have leaked if you want to get a glimpse into the cozy life of the OG Cap.</span></p> <p><span>The supposed teaser that is now circulating online is not of great quality, but it shows Steve getting off a motorcycle and walking into his home to stare nostalgically at his old suit, and then lovingly at a cute little baby. The video plays a sparse piano version of the official Avengers theme, and then the text “Steve Rogers will return in Avengers Doomsday” shows up on a black screen. Because the quality is so poor, it’s entirely possible this could be an AI fake that someone is passing off as a real tease, but any telltale signs of AI slop are masked by the bad recording. However, some folks are reporting that Marvel is hitting these videos with a DMCA strike, so make of that what you will. The teaser will reportedly make an official debut in theaters ahead of </span><i><span>Avatar: Fire and Ash </span></i><span>later this week.</span></p>

   <p><span>Earlier this morning, directors the Russo Brothers posted a close-up image on their Instagram account of…something…with the hashtag #AvengersDoomsday on it. It might be a close-up from this trailer. If you squint hard enough, it kinda looks like a close-up of a motorcycle wheel. Maybe?</span></p>   <p><span>According to Richtman, more teasers will follow, including ones featuring Chris Hemsworth’s Thor and Robert Downey Jr. as Doctor Doom. A fourth teaser and final teaser will be more “general” and focus on the broader cast.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It’s not a groundbreaking observation, but Marvel </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-4-cast-announcement-stream-mcu-marvel-1851772474"><span>leaning into the original </span><i><span>Avengers </span></i><span>cast</span></a><span> to tease the next movie, which was once </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-5-kang-dynasty-name-change-rework-1851275299"><span>supposed to be about a different group of heroes and villains</span></a><span>, is one of the most pathetic, groveling moves the company could be making right now. But it was clear from the moment the company cast Downey Jr. as Doom that </span><i><span>Doomsday </span></i><span>would be an expensive exercise in playing the hits. Why would you bring back a bunch of actors from the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-x-men-patrick-stewart-ian-mckellen-1851772571"><span>old </span><i><span>X-Men </span></i><span>movies</span></a><span> unless you were banking on nostalgia above all else? Yanking Steve Rogers out of his cozy life is one of the most transparent examples of this. We’ll see how Marvel uses the character when </span><i><span>Doomsday </span></i><span>premieres on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-secret-wars-delay-gta-6-1851782163"><span>December 18, 2026</span></a><span>.</span></p>

		<p>Multiverse has revealed that its mashup colony sim and roguelite first person shooter Pax Autocratica will launch into early access on February 2nd. A new trailer has been released to confirm the news of the release, showing elements of the colony building and the first person shooter action. You can get a glimpse of Pax Autocratica below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pax Autocratica - Official Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8AF-giWpYuk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Pax Autocratica, you are Leader of Auroria and it is your role to build a fully totalitarian state in your vision. It can be a place of utter ruthlessness to one or benevolence. You need to find a balance to keep your citizens Fear, Happiness, Hunger, and Loyalty in check so they will follow you. The civilisation starts as a small cluster of shelters but through resource gathering, management of your citizens, and issuing decrees you can build a bustling autocratic state.</p>
<p>You might be wondering where the first person shooting comes into all of this. Well, you are not the only civisilation around. There are other regimes in the Tyris System and each one presents a danger. The FPS side will see you face off against these enemies of the state through small skirmishes to big battles that will involve mechs, tanks, and infantry. There will be hundreds of different of different buffs that will shape how these expeditions will play out. The studio has also confirmed AI has been used to generate some portraits and icons in Pax Autocratica, but is looking to remove all of them before the game is launched and replaced with the work of the game’s artists.</p>
<p>Multiverse made a statement about donations to the Norwegian Refugee Council saying,<em> “1% of all net revenue from Pax Autocratica will be donated to support people forced too flee violence in conflict areas through the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC), a politically neutral humanitarian organization assisting civilians affected by war, displacement, and oppression.”</em></p>

<p>Pax Autocratica has so far only been confirmed for PC.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-wildcards-ltm-celebrates-10-years-of-rainbow-six-siege-with-chaotic-modifiers/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Rainbow Six Siege celebrated its 10-year anniversary at the beginning of this month, on December 1, 2025, and as part of the celebrations, Ubisoft has put out <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/events/wildcards-siege">a new limited-time mode titled Wildcards</a>, which'll be available from December 15, 2025, to January 5, 2026.</p>



<p>The new mode takes players back through the game's history by making every match more chaotic than the last with different modifiers. A modifier could limit your choice of operator, of weapons, and even add a new element to gameplay, like a massive Chicken appearing in your face as a callback to an iconic moment in Rainbow Six Siege's 10-year history.</p>



<p>There are 28 total modifiers, including Multipick, which lets teams pick the same Operator multiple times. Frag Domination, which randomly spawns frag grenades during the round. Frag Grenade Cooking, which equips attackers with the 556XI and defenders with the MP5K. Both teams still get grenades they can cook and throw.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Rainbow Six Siege X: Wildcards Siege - Gameplay trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ByYAfy-i3Iw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Each round begins with a vote, where players will vote for their preferred modifier. Votes from both attackers and defenders are tallied together, and in the case of a tie, a modifier is randomly selected. It's a purposely chaotic mode that seems to try to hit at all of Siege's best points.</p>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege recently underwent its most significant change in the last decade when it became a free-to-play game with the Rainbow Six Siege X update, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-is-out-now-brings-free-access-to-the-game/">which Ubisoft released this past June</a>. It was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-x-announced-with-graphical-audio-and-gameplay-improvements-showcase-set-for-march-13/">biggest graphical update in the game's history</a>, and gave players the chance to, for free, play unranked, quick match, and dual front modes and play as a small selection of Operators. </p>



<p>You can take advantage of that free content as much as you like, and if you do want to go further in the game, you can grab the Elite Edition, which adds 16 more Operators and access to all game modes, ranked playlists, and the Siege Cup for $19.99. The Ultimate Edition includes all of that and access to all 52 Operators for $39.99.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marathon Devs Reveal Pricing, Battle Pass Details, Improvements and More]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-devs-reveal-pricing-battle-pass-details-improvements-and-more/</link>
            <guid>1383883</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bungie has arrived with new details about Marathon, discussing all the improvements, reconfirming the March 2026 release window, pricing, new features, and more. </p>



<p>Marathon and Bungie have not had the best time since the title’s reveal and initial playtests, thanks to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-artist-satisfied/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plagiarism fiasco</a> and all the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-delayed-by-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strong player feedback</a>. The title has been undergoing constant playtesting since then, and the developers have finally arrived with new information about their vision for Marathon. </p>







<h2 id="h-marathon-pricing-details-revealed-battle-passes-never-expire">Marathon Pricing Details Revealed, Battle Passes Never Expire</h2>



<p>A new video by Bungie confirms Marathon’s March 2026 release window, reveals pricing details, provides new battle pass information, and much more. The developers are targeting a price of $39.99/€39.99/£34.99 currently and will announce regional pricing closer to launch. Purchasing the title will give players full access to the base game, including free gameplay updates, new maps, Runner shells, events, and more. </p>



<p>Moreover, Marathon Battle Passes will never expire, which means players don’t need to keep logging in due to the “fear of missing out”. You will be able to purchase and unlock prior passes. The developers have also confirmed that “survival will never come down to how much money you spend,” so there will be no pay-to-win elements in Marathon. </p>



<h2 id="h-marathon-devs-reveal-new-features-and-improvements">Marathon Devs Reveal New Features and Improvements</h2>



<p>Coming to the improvements, the new Vision of Marathon video on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjzmhROTv28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> reveals all the changes the developers have made since the alpha and their plan for the game. Starting with the latest features since alpha, players will see that Proximity chat and solo queue have been added. There’s also a new Runner Shell called Rook, which is designed to let players enter matches in progress, loot a bit, and escape without too much risk. </p>



<p>The game has also made some improvements to visual fidelity, with corpses now remaining in the match and decaying over time. Additionally, environmental storytelling has been deepened. Immersion has also improved thanks to the role audio plays. The developers have stated that audio is a major gameplay element in Marathon, with every sound serving a purpose. </p>



<h2 id="h-marathon-map-details">Marathon Map Details</h2>



<p>The developers then dived into Marathon’s Zones, the game’s maps. First is Perimeter, which is on the outskirts of the colony and spread out. The next is Dire Marsh, where players not only get a sense of the game’s story but also experience a different style of gameplay, focused more on action. The third map is called Outpost, a UESC facility with many PvE elements, including guards, drones, trip wires, and more.</p>



<p>The fourth map is The Marathon Ship’s Cryo Archive, which is the hardest place to survive in the game, and no point going there without the best loot. Each map features different weather systems and dynamic events. These events don’t happen all the time, but the players will know when they do, and then it is up to them whether they want to risk it all.</p>



<h2 id="h-marathon-weapons-and-loot-details">Marathon Weapons and Loot Details </h2>



<p>There’s a lot of loot for Marathon players to look forward to, including Runner cores, implants, and over 400 weapon mods. The game also offers a lot of customisation, allowing players to mix and match their weapons in unique ways. The devs showed examples of turning the Battery SMG into a needler and turning invisible with mods on their sidearm. Each of the game’s launch Runner Shell is an archetype of gameplay, which can be upgraded upon. </p>



<p>Lastly, the game has Factions, and agents of these Factions can ask you to jobs like “blow up a UESC dropship”, etc. Factions have upgrade trees and capstone rewards that players can earn each season. </p>

                <p dir="ltr">You would think stabbing a foe with a sword was enough. But a new update for Assassin's Creed Shadows will let you twist the weapon, elbow the enemy in the face, and then stab them again in the head. It's pretty gnarly, and it's part of title update 1.1.7, which is planned to start arriving December 16.</p><p dir="ltr">On <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/7xrzBsElcQq2dubHcOdGz3/ac-shadows-title-update-117-release-notes">the Ubisoft website</a>, the patch notes highlight the bloody new finishers, saying they "bring more flair to your encounters." The official Assassin's Creed account <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNoK1tClsFg">on YouTube</a> shared a video--seen below--showcasing the gruesome maneuvers for Naoe and Yasuke.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNoK1tClsFg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wNoK1tClsFg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The new update also brings quite a few improvements to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2-and-really-soon/1100-6535663/">the recently released Switch 2 edition of Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. Ubisoft says that frame rate issues have been addressed, along with "various visual issues." However, this title update will come a day later, December 17, on Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, Ubisoft confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-wont-get-second-dlc-expansion/1100-6536570/">Assassin's Creed Shadows won't get a second DLC expansion</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Bungie’s Marathon has a new release window after it was <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/17/marathon-delayed-indefinitely-from-september-release">pushed out</a> of its original September 23 launch date. The upcoming multiplayer extraction shooter will now be released in March, and Bungie has shared a new documentary sharing its updated vision for the game</p><p>Among other things, the near-23-minute documentary discusses how Bungie is “doubling down” on the Marathon's dark, grounded sci-fi world. The game centers on players controlling bio-cybernetic characters called Runners exploring and scavenging the lost colony of Tau Ceti IV. Runners accomplish this by transferring their consciousness into Shells, high-tech bodies sporting unique capabilities.</p><p>The video dives into the new features added to the PvPvE experience since the playable alpha, such as proximity chat, solo queue, and a new Runner shell called Rook. We also get a look at Marathon’s four maps, its copious amount of loot, the various factions players will perform jobs for, and a showcase of the game’s improved visual fidelity, audio, and environmental storytelling.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fjzmhROTv28"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fjzmhROTv28" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In addition to sharing the March launch window. Bungie states that the game will be priced at $39.99. Owners will be treated to free gameplay updates throughout the first year, including new maps, new Runner shells, live events, and more. This will kick off with the Season 1 exploration of UESC Marathon’s Cryo Archive.&nbsp;</p><p>Bungie also shares that Marathon’s Reward Pass – essentially a battle pass – does not expire, and you can also purchase and unlock prior passes. Bungie hopes this will eliminate the FOMO that players can feel by not logging in regularly. The studio promises that Marathon will never devolve into a “pay-to-win” experience. “We believe in preserving competitive integrity in Marathon, so survival will never come down to how much money you spend,” reads the team’s <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonvidoc">blog post.</a></p><p>It seems Bungie is taking players' concerns to heart, but it remains to be seen if Marathon can right the ship after some shaky first impressions. First revealed in May 2023, the game now faces some stiff competition in the form of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/arc-raiders/consequential-and-worthwhile-multiplayer">Arc Raiders</a>, a similarly designed extraction shooter that launched on October 30 to a glowing reception from critics and fans. Marathon has also been a subject of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/16/bungie-confirms-unauthorized-use-of-art-after-artist-claims-her-work-is-present">controversy surrounding plagiarized art assets</a> that appeared in the game. Earlier this month, it was reported that the issue <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-bungie-antireal-art-plagiarism-extraction-2000649685">had been resolved</a>.&nbsp;Here's hoping Marathon is back on track on the road to its launch next spring.&nbsp;</p><p>Marathon launches in March 2026 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/15/marathon-launches-next-march-as-bungie-shares-an-updated-look-at-the-game-in-action]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Six month after announcing an indefinite delay for Marathon in response to "passionate" community feedback, Bungie has slapped its live-service extraction shooter with a release window and price, confirming it'll launch for PlayStation 5 and PC in March next year for £35.
</p>
<p>
Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-returns-to-its-roots-with-a-pvp-twist-on-classic-fps-series-marathon">formally unveiled its Marathon reboot</a> in May 2023, but it wasn't until April this year - following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-gets-new-director-as-part-of-creative-leadership-shakeup">leadership changes</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-responds-to-marathon-reboot-directors-200m-wrongful-dismissal-lawsuit-alleges-disturbing-communications-with-female-employees">legal challenges</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">plagiarism scandal</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-management-vehemently-shut-down-destiny-2-subscription-idea-as-reports-of-toxicity-continue">more</a> - that the troubled project finally got its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-finally-shows-off-marathon-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">big reveal</a>. Unfortunately, the response was less-than-positive, and a subsequent alpha playtest proved equally divisive. As a result, Bungie revealed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-delayed-indefinitely-in-response-to-passionate-fan-feedback">Marathon would no longer launch on 23rd September as originally announced</a>, and would instead be indefinitely delayed to make improvements.

<p>
There's been little concrete news on Marathon's progress since then, although Sony chief financial officer Lin Tao did <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-troubled-extraction-shooter-marathon-still-aiming-for-release-by-march-2026">reference the title last month</a>, revealing it was still set to release within the company's current financial year. And Bungie has now <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/15/marathon-vidoc-highlights-the-extraction-shooters-dark-world-and-survival-challenge/">narrowed that down further</a>, confirming the extraction shooter will launch in March 2026. Additionally, it'll cost £34.99/$39.99/€39.99 - the same price as Sony's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> and its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-shuts-down-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-game-will-remain-permanently-offline">ill-fated shooter Concord</a>.
</p><p>
Confirmation of Marathon's release window was accompanied by a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4J91kh56jiA">20-minute gameplay breakdown</a>, with Bungie outlining a number of enhancements made since April's divisive play test. These include improvements to visual fidelity, proximity chat, a Solo Runner queue, and a "solo scavenger experience" titled Rook. 
</p>
<p>
"Whether you were with us back in April for our first Alpha or you're just joining us now," Bungie wrote on the PlayStation Blog, "there's a rich world full of lore and loot for you to discover when your cybernetic biosynthetic shell takes its first steps into our new world."

And, by and large, there have been a <em>lot</em> of good video games in 2025. But there will always be a few that hit the bottom. And, well, if you've been keeping up with gaming news this year, number one shouldn't surprise you.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the aggregate site determines the list based on games released between <strong>1st January and 31st December 2025</strong> and with at least four critic reviews. Obviously some games will have more than others on this list, so make of that what you will. And in multiplatform releases, only the lowest-scoring platform will appear here.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067thzxow&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>So, while number one should be fairly obvious to guess, number two was a bit of a sobering reminder. Remember earlier this year when Nintendo shadow-dropped a Fire Emblem game on mobile? And that it's a social deduction game? Uh, yeah, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/fire_emblem_shadows">Fire Emblem Shadows</a> happened, and, yeah it seems like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/mobile/fire-emblem-shadows">we weren't the only ones who didn't like the game</a>.

            <guid>1383850</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Bungie has just <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjzmhROTv28" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released</a> a new ViDoc for Marathon, the upcoming first-person extraction shooter game based on the studio's classic sci-fi franchise. The developer, known for creating the Halo and Destiny IPs, has confirmed that the game will be released in March 2026, as its parent company (Sony Interactive Entertainment) <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-release-march-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had previously suggested</a>.</p>



<p>The ViDoc, titled 'Vision of Marathon', goes in-depth to present the developers' design for their new project. According to the creators, Marathon is designed to showcase Bungie's core strengths, chiefly tight, satisfying gunplay; deep, strange science-fiction worldbuilding; and high-stakes PvP, layered into a larger PvPvE experience. Ultimately, the goal is for every part of the game to align, allowing controllers and interfaces to disappear, so that players can fully immerse themselves in the tension and risk/reward of their run. On that note, Bungie described Marathon as 'gunfight poker' precisely because every session is all about deciding what to risk, when to push deeper, and when to extract before losing the hard-earned gear. By the way, proximity chat has been added to the game in response to community feedback.  The tool can conceivable be used to create fragile, temporary alliances even outside the premade group players joined the session with.</p>



<p>Visually, the developers envisioned gritty, grounded visuals that clearly differentiate between bright, bleached sunny days and oppressive storms. It's all in service of making Tau Ceti IV feel like a very real, very hostile place. Corpses are persistent and decay over time; intact bodies signal recent kills and imminent danger, while decomposed ones suggest older fights and relative safety, turning environmental storytelling into a gameplay read. Marathon's audio design focuses on providing positional information to the keenest-eared players, such as how footsteps sound on different materials, vertical cues, and AI bark. Similarly, composer Ryan Lott describes a score that purposely accentuates tension, horror, and adrenaline rather than traditional heroics, reinforcing specific locations and situations.</p>



<p>Marathon will feature four named zones, each with distinct layouts, threats, and pacing.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Outer Rim</strong> is the beginner‑friendly edge of the colony: more spread out, with safer pockets and clearer sightlines that showcase the settlement’s scale, but still lethal thanks to UESC patrols that treat Runners as trespassing criminals.</li>



<li><strong>Dread Swamp</strong> pushes deeper into environmental horror, featuring anomalous aberration sites where strange entities erupt from the ground; its overlapping combat spaces and near‑continuous fights make it ideal for players seeking dense PvE action and enemy farming.</li>



<li><strong>The Outpost</strong> is a compact yet highly vertical UESC facility dominated by the Windmill, a spiraling maze of corridors, traps, drones, tripwires, and harsh weather, offering top-tier loot at a high risk.</li>



<li><strong>Cryo Archive (the Marathon ship)</strong> is billed as the apex endgame zone, which, as you would expect, also features the game's hardest content. It is massive, freezing, and hostile, combining the most dangerous environmental hazards, the toughest UESC units yet, and sequential vaults that grow in difficulty, culminating in a seventh vault that holds both the best rewards and crucial revelations about what really happened.</li>
</ul>



<p>Each zone has dynamic weather and large scale events that will not trigger every run, but when they do, they can dramatically reshape a session, forcing players to reassess plans and routes.</p>



<p>Bungie devs claimed that there will be 'absurd' amounts of loot to find in the zones, including over 400 weapon mods, multiple implant types, Runner cores, and shell variants with different playstyles (tank, stealth assassin, hunter of stealth players, etc.). Weapons are designed to be visually distinctive and readable in animation, with gold‑tier mods capable of radically changing behavior, even going as far as turning an SMG into a needle rifle, or making a melee‑oriented pistol gain a suppressor that grants invisibility on kills, which in turn combines with other perks and shell abilities to create stealth‑focused builds. Cores, implants, and shell traits can be combined to raise stats and alter mechanics. For example, a Thief shell could gain a second grappling hook, and a Destroyer could deploy a riot barrier that converts absorbed shield damage into offensive output.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>To keep Marathon approachable to newcomers to the extraction shooter genre, Bungie introduced <strong>Rook</strong>, a prototype Runner shell and special mode in the game. Joining a match as Rook makes it easier to drop into in‑progress runs with minimal gear but no real risk: players can roam zones, scavenge freely, and extract without putting their main inventory on the line, providing a way to learn maps, test tactics, or stage comebacks after heavy losses.</p>



<p>In-game progression is tied to <strong>faction agents</strong>, each representing different corporations or groups (Trelex, MIDA, Arachne, CyberAcme, New Calorie, and others) who hire Runners for specific contract objectives. Each faction features a reputation track with apex unlocks at the top, granting the best gold‑tier items and also permanent base‑stat upgrades to Runners that persist for the rest of a season, thus adding a seasonal metagame layer.</p>



<p>The progression hub is also the lore hub in this game. Players will find everything in <strong>The</strong> <strong>Codex</strong>, which tracks achievements, collectibles, audio logs, and items discovered during runs. As players find more artifacts, they are bound to unlock deeper narrative context about what the items are, why they are so valuable, and who once cared about them, while simultaneously earning cosmetic rewards such as Runner skins, weapon skins, charms, stickers, emblems, profile backgrounds, and titles.</p>



<p>There won't be any pay-to-win mechanics, and gameplay outcomes (exfil or death) are never determined by spending, the developers have promised. Rewards passes will not expire, and players can earn rewards from previously purchased passes at any time. It is also going to be possible to buy past Rewards Passes.</p>



<p>As we already knew, the game (which will be available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X) won't use the free-to-play model, but it <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-wont-be-a-full-priced-game-according-to-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won't be a full-price premium title</a>, either. Today, it was confirmed that the studio is targeting a price of $39.99/€39.99/£34.99, with additional regional pricing to be announced later. Buying the game provides access to all gameplay updates (maps, Runner shells, events, etc.) as the year progresses. The Cryo Archive, the first deck on the UESC Marathon ship, will open during Season 1. More details on seasonal content and roadmap are coming closer to launch, in January 2026.</p>



<p>As a reminder, Marathon was internally supposed to launch in 2024, but it was quietly <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-is-the-latest-gaming-studio-to-suffer-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed to 2025</a> when the studio suffered a round of layoffs in October 2023. Later, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-showcases-marathon-gameplay-release-date-announced-for-september-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the official launch date to be September 23, 2025. However, following a mixed reception to previous testing rounds (and the weight of <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-ceo-shares-learnings-from-concord-failure-reckons-psn-requirement-will-keep-pc-games-safe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concord's recent failure</a>, as far as Sony was concerned), Bungie <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-announces-marathon-delay-new-release-date-to-be-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed a delay in June</a>.</p>

		<p>Devolver Digital has confirmed that Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven, the new DLC content for the sheep based strategy game, will be launching on January 22nd. As part of the announcement, a new trailer has been released with a majority showing an animation that seems to set up events, while the latter part gives a look at some of the gameplay in small snippets.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cult of the Lamb | Woolhaven Release Date Trailer | Launching on January 22" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9YH21SghaUU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven players are tasked with finding the souls of dead Lambs for Yngya, the God of Winter. With each soul, Yngya gets stronger and the challenges for the Cult can get more difficult. As well as appeasing Yngya, you need to survive the cold winter that has descended on the land. You will need to keep cult members fed and warm so they do not freeze, there are new traits and quests to discover, and you will be able to expand your base. There are also new structures such as the Exorcism Altar, and you can expand the base with new shops and a ranch.</p>
<p>Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven will also have two new dungeons, and those are Ewefall and The Rot. Ewefall is the exterior snowy part of the mountain which is the domain of Marchosias, the leader of the Free Pack. The Free Pack are not welcoming to the Gods and will not let them have the mountain, so they have to be defeated. The Rot is the interior of the mountain where anything living inside is corrupted. In The Rot, some of the quests include helping a dragon hatch her eggs and making a garden bloom.</p>

<p>Cult of the Lamb: Woolhaven will be available for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series XS, Xbox One, and Switch.</p>

		<p>The Chinese Room and Paradox Interactive have released the Winter Update for Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2, with one of the main features being custom difficulty. With this, players can change things like starting health, the amount of damage Phyre can inflict, and allows passive ability recharging. However, this is not a setting that is accessible for new players but those who have the An Elder Unchained achievement or trophy. Custom difficulty cannot be changed after a playthrough has started either.</p>
<p>In addition to the custom difficulty option, Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 is getting some suitably festive and Christmassy items including a Santa hat and beard, with The Chinese Room also confirming beards will be added in a later update. An FOV Slider and a Motion Blur Toggle have also been added, and you can read the full patch notes below.</p>

            <guid>1383823</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Ubisoft announced it has acquired the MOBA game March of Giants from Amazon, with the Montreal-based team becoming a part of Ubisoft when the deal closes on its expected date of December 16, 2025. Though the MOBA will be officially owned by Ubisoft, as part of the deal, Amazon will still provide marketing support for the game on Twitch.</p>



<p>The news was announced in a press release, where Ubisoft says it "<em>sees March of Giants as an innovative and differentiated project with the potential to offer something new to current MOBA fans, attract new audiences, and grow into a successful live competitive game</em>."</p>



<p>The March of Giants team is led by creative director Xavier Marquis and senior production leader Alexandre Parizeau, two developers who have previously worked at Ubisoft in their careers. Marquis was the original creative director of Rainbow Six Siege, and Parizeau was the former managing director of the Ubisoft Toronto studio.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="March of Giants: Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zn2aJ3UmVnk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>"<em>Returning to Ubisoft brings things full circle</em>," Marquis said in a press release. "<em>We built some of our most meaningful work here, and we’re excited to continue developing March of Giants from within Ubisoft. This game has enormous potential, and I know Ubisoft can help us take it to the next level</em>."</p>



<p>Parizeau added, "<em>My thanks go to Amazon for their commitment during the first chapters of March of Giants. Our closed alpha was an important milestone and showed a glimpse of the game’s real promise. Now, by joining Ubisoft, we’re uniting behind a shared vision to build March of Giants into one of the next great, enduring MOBAs</em>."</p>



<p>For Amazon's part, Steve Boom, vice president of audio, Twitch, and games at Amazon, added, "<em>We're proud of what our team in Montreal has built with March of Giants. We're confident that under Ubisoft's leadership, the talented developers in Montreal will continue to thrive and create amazing game experiences</em>."</p>



<p>This acquisition comes shortly after Amazon <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-video-game-division-hit-significant-cuts-amid-mass-14000-layoff/">laid off 14,000+ workers this past October</a>, with a significant portion of those cuts impacting the teams at Amazon Game Studios. As a result of the cuts, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-gets-killed-off-amazon-just-as-people-were-returning/">New World: Aeternum's development was shuttered</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-game-studios-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-again-amidst-mass-layoffs/">an MMO Lord of the Rings game was cancelled for a second time</a>. </p>



<p>Though Amazon recently revealed<a href="https://wccftech.com/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-2026-tomb-raider-catalyst-new-entry-in-2027/"> two upcoming Tomb Raider games at The Game Awards</a>, this sale to Ubisoft is the latest sign of the company narrowing its focus in the video game industry and seemingly prioritizing game development only with established IPs and adaptations of video games, since the company doesn't seem inclined to slow down production on adaptations like<a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-officially-renewed-by-amazon-for-second-season/"> Fallout</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wolfenstein-tv-show-amazon-fallout-producer/">Wolfenstein</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/amazon-mass-effect-tv-show-same-production-team-behind-fallout-tv-show/">Mass Effect</a>.</p>



<p>That said, Amazon's loss seems like a win for Ubisoft. Regarding the acquisition, chief executive officer Yves Guillemot said, "<em>March of Giants has a real opportunity to bring something fresh and dynamic to players, and to help Ubisoft compete in one of gaming’s biggest arenas</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>We’re looking forward to welcoming back Alexandre, Xavier, and many of the seasoned March of Giants team who have previously worked at Ubisoft, and the entire team’s ambition, creativity and talent align perfectly with our desire to build bold new experiences for players. We look forward to supporting them as they shape the future of this promising new IP</em>."</p>

            <p>
If this is a single flavour of genre that, if you put a gun to my head and forced me to pick a favourite, I would say is my favourite, it's probably body <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a>. There are a seemingly infinite amount of ways to project images of devolving flesh and altered bodies into your eyeballs, many of which I find strangely relatable, occasionally comforting. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/graft">Graft</a>, the next game from the studio behind Battletech and the Shadowrun series, does none of that for me, but its first gameplay trailer successfully twisted my guts into a collection of pretzels, so it's doing something right (though perhaps avoid the trailer if you're quite squeamish).
</p>
<p>
So, that trailer. It opens us up with a man seemingly grafting the torso of a woman onto his body, bloody tendrils tenderly protruding from each person involved, beams of light like live wires helping the fusion along. It's certainly mesmerising, and I question every disquieting second of it considering the gender politics that might be at play - the woman appears to be almost hugging the man in the gameplay portion of the trailer itself, so I'm curious which way the story may lean.

<p>
The gameplay shown in the trailer itself doesn't suggest much different from the usual survival horror affair, though Graft is also an RPG. Details on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3141390/GRAFT/">Steam page</a> open things up a bit more, as it sounds like there are relationships to be forged and choices to be made that can "shape your journey and decide the fates of those you meet." 
</p><p>
The titular grafting is a gameplay mechanic too, as you're able to change your body by picking up parts from fallen enemies or hidden locales (hence the Ship of Theseus angle). These graftings also bring forth "strange cravings and half-glimpsed memories" like the impulse to be cruel and sadistic, or "the hot breath of a lover you never touched." Curious, and yet more that ropes me into this almost Blame! esque world.
</p>
<p>
No release date attached to Graft as of writing, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3141390/GRAFT/">wishlist it on Steam</a>, if ya like!

            <title><![CDATA[Bungie’s Marathon Resurfaces With $40 Price Tag And A March 2026 Release Date]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/marathon-release-date-price-battle-pass-proximity-chat-2000653472</link>
            <guid>1383808</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Marathon</em> was supposed to be out months ago. Instead, its coming in March 2026. <a href="https://kotaku.com/playstation-bungie-marathon-destiny-2-acquisition-fiscal-2000642935">Bungie revealed the new launch timing</a> in a surprise video documentary that went live on Monday in which the game’s developers promise a sci-fi survival extraction shooter that’s full of mysteries and hidden dangers.</p> <p>The fresh 22-minute deep-dive goes over all of the elements of the project the studio’s been rehabbing since it was indefinitely delayed earlier this year following <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-alpha-review-impressions-bungie-extraction-fps-1851777775">harsh fan feedback</a> form its initial public alpha test. During that quiet period, Bungie’s held multiple closed beta tests to re-examine gameplay and introduced completely new features, including proximity chat. After becoming a cornerstone of this fall’s hit rival extraction shooter, <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-review-extraction-loot-shooter-embark-2000642198"><em>Arc Raiders</em></a>, the feature will now be a staple of <em>Marathon</em> as well.</p>

  <p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjzmhROTv28">documentary also details</a> the development team’s evolving approach to everything from audio and visuals to zone design and loot mechanics. The goal is clear: make <em>Marathon</em>‘s maps and the experiences that take place there have more of an identity beyond repetitive beats within a grindy, quick-match PVP shooter. “We’ve brought a little bit of grounded-ness, a little bit of grit, a little bit of darkness, a little bit of that mood, that kind of is necessary for an extraction shooter to feel dangerous,” said producer Emanuel Rosu.</p>

 <p>The video goes on to address a bunch of other complaints players had from the original public alpha test. That includes prioritizing solo play options, improving the visuals, and even making it so that opponent runners leave corpses behind that decay instead of just having their dropped loot appear as static back packs. There will be four maps at launch, including an end-game area onboard UESC Marathon.</p>

 <p>In addition to upgrade trees, faction ranks, and unlockable rewards, Bungie is also promising some level of gun customization to change how weapons play, letting players invent iconic gear from the studio’s past by doing things like changing an SMG into Halo’s Needler.</p>

 <h2><em>Marathon</em> won’t be free-to-play</h2> <p><a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonvidoc">In a blog post</a>, Bungie outlined what the game’s approach to monetization will be, including battle passes that don’t expire and no pay-to-win mechanics:</p> <blockquote><p>Purchasing <em>Marathon</em> will give you full access to the game, including a roadmap of free gameplay updates as the year progresses. This will include new maps, new Runner shells, events, and more, starting with the exploration of UESC Marathon’s Cryo Archive in Season 1.</p> <p>We also want to ensure you are logging in because you love the game, not from fear of missing out—so Marathon’s Rewards Passes will not expire, and you’ll be able to purchase and unlock prior Passes.</p> <p>Finally, and most importantly, we believe in preserving competitive integrity in Marathon, so survival will never come down to how much money you spend.</p></blockquote> <p>This is essentially the <em>Helldivers 2</em> playbook, which served that smash-hit live service game well. As a PVEVP game, however, <em>Marathon</em> will face the additional challenge of balancing other hostile players with its bespoke world-building. We’ll see how that works in practice in just a few months.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's that time again to hang some Poké Balls on your Trevenant or Exeggutor and get festive, but it's not Christmas without spending some Pokédollars on some good old Pokémon merch, right? I'm a massive Pokémon trainer (both in circumference and fandom), and I know a thing or two about the video games, TCG, plushies, and Funko.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So I thought this is the best time of year for a Pokémon Gift Guide, with the back end of 2025 focusing on the return of Mega Evolution. First introduced in the Pokémon X and Y video games and TCG, it's the most favored Pokémon gimmick, and it's back for the mainline games’ return to Kalos in Pokémon Legends: Z-A. So let's get into it, because there's a gift here for every budget and Pokéfan:</p><p id="tcg-gifts"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="TCG Gifts">Best Pokémon TCG Gifts</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop">Pokémon Trading Card Game</a> has seen the end of the Scarlet and Violet era this year, ending with the Black Bolt and White Flare expansions. We're now a base set and expansion into the Mega Evolution era, with the most recent set being the Mega Charizard X-fronted Phantasmal Flames. Speaking of:</p><p id="mega-charizard-x-ex-ultra-premium-co"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Co">Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection</h3></p><div catalogid="8c2b65e5-eb62-4ba4-9042-a68913f09135" id="210682"><div id="210682" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>At market value on Amazon</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Charizard X ex Ultra-Premium Collection</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It's been a pain in the Mudbray trying to get hold of the Mega Charizard X ex Ultra Premium Collection, but it looks like stock is freeing up just in time for the Christmas rush. Plus, Amazon is currently selling it near MSRP and at market value when compared to TCGplayer. It contains the following booster packs alongside Mega Charizard X-themed card sleeves, deck box, damage counter dice, playmat, and a metal coin:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>4 x Phantasmal Flames</li><li>4 x Mega Evolution</li><li>4 x Destined Rivals</li><li>4 x Journey Together</li><li>2 x Surging Sparks</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">The main pull of this UPC is the Mega Charizard X ex Mega Attack Rare and Oricorio ex SIR promo cards, which, frankly, are the best couple of promo cards we've had in a big box collection for a while.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">The Best Pokémon Chase Cards You Can Pull in Packs Right Now</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you follow my Crashers and Climbers weekly column, you'll know by now that Pokémon TCG is starting to find a new floor with individual card values thanks to better stock levels nationwide. That means it's going to save trainers even more money buying single chase cards over ripping hundreds of booster packs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The carousel above contains the top 5 Pokémon TCG chase cards from each expansion from the current Mega Evolution and previous Scarlet and Violet eras. Any of these cards would make a great gift this Christmas; it just depends on your budget!</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Pokémon TCG</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Prefer to gift sealed products? No problem, I've gone through the regularly stocked products by big box retailers like Amazon and price-checked them against TCGplayer to make sure you're getting the best bang for your Pokébucks. TCGplayer is an online marketplace where vendors sell single cards and sealed products for multiple different trading card games, including Pokémon TCG. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's owned by eBay, and sellers have their own review ratings on there, so you can check over a seller before you buy. It's also a great price-tracking tool for Pokémon trainers and collectors in the US, so you can see what the value of any particular card or sealed product was up to 12 months ago. It's always worth a check to make sure you're getting the best deal before you buy from pretty much anywhere.</p></div><p id="video-games"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Video Games">Pokémon Video Games</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'd be shocked if you haven't at least tried a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-games-in-order">mainline Pokémon gam</a>e, seeing as they've been around since 1999, but there's a first time for everything. I've focused on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-pokemon-games-on-nintendo-switch">Nintendo Switch 1 and 2 Pokémon games</a> here, and there's currently some great discounts going. I've even managed to work out the cheapest way to get the Switch 2 version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Cheapest Pokémon Legends: Z-A Deal</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Obviously, this is while stocks last, but if you pick up the Nintendo Switch 1 version of Pokémon Legends: Z-A for $44.99 on Woot, then upgrade it to the Switch 2 version for $9.99 via the Amazon digital code service, you're saving $15 over buying the usual Switch 2 copy of Legends: Z-A. If you're going to dive into the Mega Dimension DLC too, you're paying a total of $84.97 vs. the full-fat price of $98.99.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Pokémon Video Games</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Legends: Z-A isn't the only Pokémon game getting a nice discount right now, either. One of the top games for Nintendo Switch is Pokémon Legends: Arceus, a pseudo-prequel to Z-A that showcases similar mechanics and carries on the trend of turning the traditional gameplay of Pokémon games on its head.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're rocking a Switch 2 this Christmas, I'd highly recommend getting Pokémon Scarlet and Violet. They're the latest traditional Pokémon games that get a much-needed and free upgrade for Nintendo Switch 2. That means it now runs at a full 60 frames per second in handheld and docked mode, with 4K resolution when playing through the TV. There's more Pokémon hanging around in the wild now, too, and some other quality-of-life improvements that fix most of the issues it had at launch.</p><p id="funko-pop"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Funko Pop!">Pokémon Gifts: Funko Pop!</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, I won't collect Funko Pops, as I'd end up not feeding my kids, and you have to do that every now and again, apparently. But they're awesome nonetheless; I just have zero self-control with collectibles. There's some bargains to be had right now, such as 2 for $24 on select Pokémon Funkos on Amazon, to some cheeky discounts on others.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Funko Pop Moments Deluxe: Pokémon Starters</h3><div catalogid="8c2b65e5-eb62-4ba4-9042-a68913f09135" id="233657"><div id="233657" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Funko Pop Moments Deluxe: Pokemon - Starters - Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle </h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Some bigger Funko sets are just worth every penny, such as one of the most nostalgic moments for ’90s kids. This represents a simpler time for me, and an iconic one for many that's been copied in some way, shape, or form in every Pokémon game since. Choosing your first-ever starter Pokémon is a big deal, and looking at this display piece just makes me smile. I picked Bulbasaur, and I will die on that hill.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">More Pokémon Funko Pops</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">From giant Funko Pops to double packs and single Pops, there's something here for every Funko and Pokémon fan.

            <guid>1383793</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It's tough to really wrap your head around 2025 for Xbox. There were some real hits from Xbox Game Studios, fantastic day-one, third-party launches on Game Pass… and then a whole lot of baffling moves from Xbox as a platform, with multiple rounds of price increases, project cancellations, and layoffs. It was a year that constantly had our collective heads spinning. But hey, if you've been subscribed to Game Pass and playing on your Xbox Series X/S (or PC, or anything deemed an Xbox) this year, there was no shortage of great games to celebrate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here at IGN, we’ve voted across several categories for our end of the year awards, including our shortlist of the five best games that landed on Xbox in 2025. Those votes have determined the one winner that represents our pick for the best Xbox game of the year. With exclusives largely a thing of the past now, especially for Xbox – which published some high-profile games on PS5 this year – our contenders are simply what's been available on Xbox consoles this year, regardless of exclusivity or publishing status. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, let's get to it by first recognizing the honorable mentions that made Xbox's year one banger after another, and then revealing the Best Xbox Game of 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Xbox Game of 2025</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Honorable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Obsidian had an all-time year with three launches in 2025, all of which hit in different ways. It gave a jolt to start the year with a tightly packed fantasy RPG in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a> to stave off the appetite for a new Elder Scrolls, then brought its co-op survival sequel into early access with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/grounded-2">Grounded 2</a>, which got off to a great start. Compulsion Games weaved a unique artistic vision into a love letter to the American South with the action-adventure game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a>, while id Software brought us back to Hell with a bit of a melee twist on its shooter roots in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a>. If Avowed wasn't enough, we kicked it like it was 2006 in Cyrodiil with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a>, which remindeding us that Bethesda’s long-running fantasy series had the sauce well before Skyrim. We busted out the notepads and corkboards for the roguelike puzzler <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered">Blue Prince</a> that hit Game Pass on day one, but we also champed at the bit for more stylish action after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ninja-gaiden-2-black">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a> whet our appetite for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>, which Xbox published for Team Ninja. Oh yeah, and there's an Xbox handheld now with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/rog-xbox-ally">Asus ROG Xbox Ally</a> – well, sort of; rather it's an Xbox-branded PC handheld, that is arguably one of the best ones yet. And since everything is an Xbox now, it doesn't really matter where you play these hits. The sheer variety of games that launched under the Xbox banner this year was indicative of how vast and great the medium can be – and none represent that quite as well as our five best Xbox games of 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/best-xbox-hollow-knight-silksong-1765365891628.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems that every year has an indie darling that folks rally around loudly, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> was certainly that game in 2025. The jokes about Silksong never coming out have finally been laid to rest, and Team Cherry's long development journey resulted in a dense, daunting, and satisfying action-adventure – or "metroidvania", if you will. While it hit Game Pass on launch, its impressive sales figures and $20 price tag made it the talk of the town... aside from it being the wildly anticipated follow up to Hollow Knight, of course. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">On its own merits, Silksong's dark and foreboding atmosphere matches the gruesome platforming challenges that make its exploration more involved than many of its contemporaries. Hornet's traversal mechanics are smooth and will have you flowing through Silksong's sprawling, web-like map, leading you towards some of the hardest-fought battles we've experienced this year. Being smart, nimble, and aggressive against these tough and unpredictable bosses is the key to victory, but you must stay committed and locked in, try after try, even if the runback can be grueling. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But for as punishing as Silksong may be, it's also frequently adorable, blessed with cute, memorable bug friends like Sherma, who sings his song and is generally a precious little guy!  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Split Fiction</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/best-xbox-split-fiction-1765365921513.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Coming off of It Takes Two, which swooped in to secure Game of the Year back at The Game Awards 2021, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> continues developer Hazelight's catalogue of great split-screen co-op adventure games. Its premise – two novel writers trapped in their respective fictional worlds made manifest – paves the way for imaginative worlds and a mashup of gameplay mechanics and genres that are consistently exciting to play alongside a friend. Coordinating with your partner in puzzles, platforming, and high-speed action is a ton of fun as you phase in and out of fantasy and sci-fi worlds. Oftentimes it blends the two remarkably well, and packs in references that reflect where its two protagonists, Mio and Zoe, are as creatives (and, as any writer knows, that sometimes means they’re not very creative themselves.) </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that's the thing about Split Fiction – art doesn't always have to be good, but it's the process through which art is created that should be respected, and that can't be treated as a commodity to be manufactured. And just when you think you had Split Fiction figured out, its finale delivers some of the most memorable sequences in recent memory, elevating the experience to one of the best games of this year. If you haven't played it yet, find a friend, give them the free co-op pass, and see what it's all about.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Keeper</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/best-xbox-keeper-1765365865292.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">We hadn't heard from the team at Double Fine in quite some time after Psychonauts 2 headlined many best of lists back in 2021, but this year we got a pleasant surprise in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/keeper">Keeper</a>. Playing as a walking lighthouse may not seem too appealing on paper, but the Double Fine charm and distinct art style brings to life a world that's about showing rather than telling. Its puzzles have you looking at the environments with intent, and the little interactions you have with characters living in a seemingly abandoned world create tiny stories without having to say a word. Our review described Keeper as "a psychedelic exploration of life packed into a brief runtime" and it's a prime example of what a studio can do when left to its own creative devices – it's easygoing and impactful, and one of the standouts for 2025.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - The Outer Worlds 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/the-best-xbox-game-the-outer-worlds-2-1765365942245.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Back when we saw <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> in action for the first time earlier this year, we could tell it had the makings of a top-tier Obsidian RPG. We liked the original entry well enough, but it was just as much an attempt to create a foundation for a new universe as it was the team trying to separate itself from Fallout and build atop the reputation it earned from New Vegas years ago. With this year’s sequel, it seems as if Obsidian recognized the shortcomings of The Outer Worlds and has addressed almost all of them, creating a sequel that delivers what the studio is known for: dense, story-driven RPGs with a whole load of interconnected systems that let you play exactly how you want.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a concerted effort to improving gunplay and melee combat, which goes a long way in making its violent encounters a lot more fun. But it’s the deeper progression systems, along with intricate level design reminiscent of immersive sims like Deus Ex, that makes the overall RPG experience feel so much more dynamic. The game itself observes how you play, and offers tangible perks at the expense of some unusually creative debuffs as part of its Flaws system, with each one offered based on your actions. Such as system demonstrates in microcosm how The Outer Worlds 2 better accounts for your playstyle and shows you the consequences of how you interact with its world. And with a universe still rooted in dystopian satire, but with a good crew of companions and a tighter story told across much bigger worlds, The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian firing on all cylinders.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winner - Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/best-xbox-clair-obscur-expedition-33-1765365967609.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps to the surprise of absolutely no one, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> is IGN’s choice for the best game to hit Xbox this year. And if you're a Game Pass subscriber, you were treated to one of the best RPGs in recent memory on day one. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In its debut as a development team, Sandfall Interactive has drawn inspiration from classic Japanese RPGs (looking at Final Fantasy 10 and Persona 5 directly) to tell its own harrowing story about grief and the sometimes ugly ways it changes us. But while JRPGs are a clear influence, the studio’s French roots are significantly responsible for making Clair Obscur what it is, from its artistic vision to its storytelling style, right down to the unqiue music that both captures the hype of big boss fights and the atmosphere of its magical, painterly world. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like any great RPG, Clair Obscur strives to give you an intimate understanding of its characters, drawing you in and making you feel for them in their moments of triumph and despair. It’s a credit to the studio's strong writing team, and performances from an incredible cast, that Expedition 33 is able to effortlessly pull you in through all the wild twists and turns of its story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a top-tier turn-based combat system, bolstered by timing-based inputs for attacking and defending. That active element keeps you locked in during each and every battle with an intensity you wouldn’t feel otherwise. The intricate progression and customization systems for each character make you feel like a genius tactician, creating the best builds for their unique moveset and mechanics. And damn does it look good when it all comes together. Clair Obscur is a wonderful example of executing on a clear creative vision while simultaneously recognizing what made its inspirations so great. And it very easily won the hearts and minds of us here at IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What was your favourite Xbox game of 2025?

Great news, Larian just made it a much nicer experience on modern consoles with a free upgrade for PS5, Xbox Series, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This was announced in a new trailer, which highlights the differences in the new versions. It's nothing too crazy - just better resolution and framerate. But it's free if you own the game already on any of the previous platforms (PS4, Nintendo Switch, or Xbox One) and it will hopefully bring the eight-year-old game up to par with current technology on consoles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don't own the game already anywhere, now's probably a good time to grab it. At the time of this writing, it's on sale in a few places. It's 50% off if you buy the regular NIntendo Switch edition down to $25, and then you get the free upgrade on Switch 2. On Xbox, it's down to $17.49. If you own the game on PC, don't worry, as you don't need an upgrade. You're already set with a great version of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Divinity: Original Sin 2 is fantastic and well-worth checking out if you haven't yet. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/01/divinity-original-sin-2-definitive-edition-review">gave the most recent Definitive Edition in 2018 at 9.6/10</a>, saying it's "a new way to play one of the absolute best RPGs in years. And whether you’re diving back in on PC, or booting it up on the console for the first time, it’s flexibility, personality, and charm make for an amazing adventure."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also may be worth checking out before the new Divinity comes out, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yup-that-weird-statue-was-teasing-a-new-divinity-game-the-game-awards-2025">Larian has said</a> that players of Original Sin 1 and 2 might "be able to enjoy greater understanding and continuity."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>Bungie's new game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/" data-ref-id="1100-6514617">Marathon</a>, will launch in March 2026, priced at $40 USD. The game's release timing and price were two of the biggest unanswered questions, with many speculating that Marathon would be priced less than $70. In the end, Bungie chose $40, the same price as Arc Raiders.</p><p>Buying Marathon provides "full access to the game," along with its free updates, including new maps, Runner shells, events, and other content. Season 1 will introduce UESC Marathon's Cryo Archive, Bungie said.</p><p>"We also want to ensure you are logging in because you love the game, not from fear of missing out--so Marathon's Rewards Passes will not expire, and you’ll be able purchase and unlock prior Passes," Bungie said, modeling what other games, like Halo Infinite, have done with their own battle passes.</p><p>Bungie also stressed that Marathon will not be pay-to-win with its microtransactions. "Most importantly, we believe in preserving competitive integrity in Marathon, so survival will never come down to how much money you spend," the developer said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fjzmhROTv28" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fjzmhROTv28" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Bungie made these announcements alongside the release of a new, 22-minute video that dives deep into a variety of facets of Marathon. The video includes new details on Marathon's proximity chat, solo queue, and the "Rook" Runner shell. The video also provides a new look at the game's world, what Bungie has done to improve the game's visual fidelity since we last saw it, and an overview of how the game's weapons and mods work, among other things.</p><p>Looking ahead, Bungie said it will share more details on Marathon's gameplay, along with "other surprises," in the time leading up to launch in March 2026.</p><p>In June, Bungie <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-delayed-with-no-new-date-announced/1100-6532505/" data-ref-id="1100-6532505">delayed Marathon indefinitely</a> after gathering feedback from its alpha tests.</p><p>People have questioned publisher Sony's committment to live-service games after Concord stumbled, but Sony is pushing ahead. The company said it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-re-commits-to-live-service-games-says-bungies-marathon-wont-suffer-concords-fate/1100-6532419/" data-ref-id="1100-6532419">put new systems in place to help ensure Marathon doesn't suffer the same fate as Concord.</a></p><p>PlayStation boss Hermen Hulst said feedback from Marathon's latest alpha test was "varied," but Sony maintains that the live-service category remains a "great opportunity" for the company. Concord, Hulst said, was "insufficiently differentiated" in a "hyper-competitive segment" of gaming, referring to live-service multiplayer games.</p><p>"We have reviewed our processes in light of this to deeply understand how and why that title failed to meet expectations and to ensure we're not going to make the same mistakes again," he said.</p><p>For Marathon, Hulst said the aim is to create a "very bold, very innovative, and deeply engaging title." The response to the Marathon alpha test was mixed, and Hulst said the whole idea of offering early tests is to gain feedback that can then be used to improve the product.</p><p>"This cycle of test, of iterate, test again, that is such a key component of the live-service success, both leading up to launch but also throughout the life of the game," he said.</p><p>The announcement of Marathon's release timing and price comes just after the artist who <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-responds-to-marathon-art-theft-claims/1100-6531591/" data-ref-id="1100-6531591">accused Bungie of stealing their art</a> announced that they <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-stolen-art-issue-has-been-resolved/1100-6536649/" data-ref-id="1100-6536649">resolved the matter with Bungie.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/" data-ref-id="1100-6530826">GameSpot's Marathon preview</a>, which was conducted on an earlier version of the game, said, "In a world of free-to-play titles, a paid game that is light on content but full of hopes, dreams, and ambitions may not be enough to inspire in others the same confidence I have in Bungie."</p>

            <p>
Following Amazon's decision to 'gut' its video game division in October as part of 14,000 job cuts across the company, Ubisoft has announced the acquisition of one of its studios - Amazon Games Montreal - which is currently working on MOBA March of Giants.
</p>
<p>
As per <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/12/15/3205660/0/en/Ubisoft-accelerates-in-fast-growing-MOBA-market-by-acquiring-March-of-Giants-game-from-Amazon.html">Ubisoft's announcement</a>, the acquisition includes the rights to March of Giants, and will see the Amazon Games Montreal team join the company. That includes former <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege</a> creative director Xavier Marquis, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-recruits-former-rainbow-six-siege-devs-for-new-studio">joined Amazon in 2021</a> after leaving Ubisoft two years prior.
</p>
<p>
As to why Ubisoft wants March of Giants and its team, the company says the global MOBA games market is expected to "continue growing year over year for the rest of the decade, with total revenues roughly doubling by 2030" - and it believes its newly acquired title is "an innovative and differentiated project with the potential to offer something new to current MOBA fans, attract new audiences, and grow into a successful live competitive game."
</p>
<p>
"March of Giants has a real opportunity to bring something fresh and dynamic to players, and to help Ubisoft compete in one of gaming's biggest arenas," Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot added in a statement. "We're looking forward to welcoming back Alexandre [Parizeau], Xavier, and many of the seasoned March of Giants team who have previously worked at Ubisoft, and the entire team's ambition, creativity and talent align perfectly with our desire to build bold new experiences for players. We look forward to supporting them as they shape the future of this promising new IP."
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft notes the terms of its acquisition deal "are not being disclosed", but it does reveal the agreement includes Amazon's commitment to providing marketing support for March of Giants on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>.
</p>
<p>
Amazon Games Montreal's sale follows radical changes to Amazon's video game strategy in October, when - according to Bloomberg - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-reportedly-gutting-its-video-game-division-as-part-of-14000-company-wide-job-cuts">company 'gutted' its games division as part of sweeping layoffs</a>. At the time, Steven Boom (Amazon's vice president of Audio, Twitch, and Game) reportedly told employees the company had "made the difficult decision to halt a significant amount of our first-party AAA game development work – specifically around MMOs", resulting in "significant role reductions in our studios in Irvine and San Diego, as well as our central publishing team."
</p>
<p>
In the aftermath of Amazon's announcement, it was confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazon-isnt-closing-mmo-new-world-right-away-but-it-wont-guarantee-the-life-of-the-game-past-2026">ongoing work on its New World MMO would cease</a>, and word emerged <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-amazon-dev-suggests-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-cancelled-following-recent-studio-gutting">suggesting its Lord of the Rings MMO had also been canned</a>.
