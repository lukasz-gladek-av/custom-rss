<p>Basketball was originally announced to be coming to&nbsp;<em>Nintendo Switch Sports&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-june-2024">during June's Nintendo Direct presentation</a>, when we also saw new&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-announced">Zelda</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Mario &amp; Luigi&nbsp;</em>games being revealed, as well as the first gameplay footage for the long-awaited&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metroid-prime-4-beyond-2025"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a>.</p>

<p>As well as basketball,&nbsp;the game also allows you to partake in sports like tennis, bowling, and chambara swordplay, plus new sports volleyball, soccer, and badminton. A seventh sport, golf, was added via free update in late 2022.</p>

            <p>
Okami was a "huge failure" in terms of initial sales, director Hideki Kamiya has said. Had it been more successful, its developer Clover "would have probably continued" - rather than shutting down the following year.
</p>
<p>
Kamiya discussed the development of Okami with Ikumi Nakamura for the YouTube channel of her new studio Unseen. The pair worked together for the first time on the Zelda-like adventure game.
</p>
<p>
Okami has received plenty of cult acclaim since its release on PS2 in 2006, but was one of only a handful of games made by the Capcom-owned studio before it was dissolved.

<p>
Discussing his recipe for success, Kamiya said in the video: "There is no secret recipe". The pair agreed they haven't succeeded purely in terms of sales.
</p>
<p>
"Even Okami, did it make 150,000 units?" asked Kamiya. "The initial shipment was 90,000. It was a huge failure. If it had been successful, Clover would have probably continued."
</p>
<p>
He admitted: "For us who made it, it turned out something we can be proud of."
</p>
<p>
The pair chatted further in the video about working together, with plenty of banter and anecdotes between them.
</p>
<p>
Nakamura, for instance, recalled a party near the end of Okami's development where Kamiya said: "This team was the worst!"
</p>
<p>
Kamiya then elaborated further, explaining how Okami's development team was meant to be a "dream team" and Okami "Clover Studio's signature title". However, he described the team as a whole as "weak", due to different levels of passion from staff. Nakamura agreed and Kamiya stated he can be honest "because we're friends".
</p>
<p>
Later Kamiya said: "If [enthusiasm] had been a bit higher, Okami would have been even better. So to be honest, I'm a bit torn by the voices saying that the game is amazing."
</p>
<p>
"We could have done more," agreed Nakamura.
</p>
<figure>

<p>
In another anecdote, Kamiya said Okami was originally intended to be photo-realistic, instead of the traditional Japanese art style eventually used.
</p>
<p>
"At the very beginning before you joined, we were trying to use a photo-realistic style," Kamiya told Nakamura. "But it became clear that it was impossible to create this vast natural environment on PlayStation 2."
</p>
<p>
Later in the discussion, Kamiya said he was inspired by the GameCube remake of Resident Evil Capcom was working on at the time. "When I saw that I thought the sense of realism was amazing," said Kamiya. "The level of photo-realism was very high. I thought it could be nice if we used that for something more light-hearted instead of horror."
</p>
<p>
However, once character designer Kenichiro Yoshimura created the Celestial Brush, the pieces of Okami's style and gameplay fell into place. "That Japanese touch struck a chord," said Kamiya, "so we decided to completely change the entire game."
</p>
<p>
After its initial launch in 2006, Okami was ported to the Wii with motion controls, before a HD version was released across PS3, PS4, Xbox One, Switch and PC. It's become a beloved game, despite its seemingly troubled development.
</p>
<p>
Having moved on from Clover, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hideki-kamiya-left-platinum-games-due-to-issue-of-trust">Kamiya left his next studio Platinum Games</a> late last year due to "issues of trust". It's unclear what he's working on next.

</p>
<p>
Nakamura, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ikumi-nakamura-unveils-first-independent-project-kemuri">unveiled her first independent project Kemuri</a> around the same time, though it's currently without a release date.

<p>There’s yet another controversy surrounding a recently released game as The First Descendent is accused of copying certain icons and even a weapon design from Destiny 2. </p>



<p>The kicker is that it’s not a clear 1-1 copy of any thing, but more of a case of making a slight change to try and make it look different.</p>







<p>The icons, which you can see courtesy of Forbes’ Paul Tassi all look a bit too similar to be merely a coincidence. On top of that, there’s also a weapon that seems to be, at the very least, <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/07/07/the-first-descendant-is-using-barely-changed-destiny-2-icons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">inspired by</a> Destiny 2. It’s unclear if there are any more examples of this as only a small amount of assets have been compared. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to both Bungie and Nexon for comment on these claims. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly.</p>

<p>I’m going to be honest; I didn’t expect to enjoy Zenless Zone Zero as much as I have over the past week. I’m playing it on PC, but I thought about booting up my Xbox Series S to download the game there. Like many of you, I’m wondering whether the game is available on Xbox and, if not, then when. Is Zenless Zone Zero coming to Xbox?</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-zenless-zone-zero-on-xbox">Can You Play Zenless Zone Zero on Xbox?</h2>



<p>Currently, you cannot play Zenless Zone Zero on Xbox. Unfortunately, developer HoYoverse does not officially support Xbox for any of its games. They’ve promised the community in the past that titles such as Genshin Impact and Honkai: Star Rail would launch on Xbox Series X|S, and that day never came. Some fans continue waiting, rather impatiently, for the console launch. But it’s unlikely ever to happen.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, the same is likely to occur with Zenless Zone Zero. While the studio did not state they would launch ZZZ on Xbox, it’s best not to hold up hope.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-zenless-zone-zero-ever-coming-to-xbox">Is Zenless Zone Zero Ever Coming to Xbox?</h2>



<p>As mentioned, there is no word on whether the gacha game is coming to Xbox Series X|S. We must assume that it’s never happening. If you’re keen on playing Zenless Zone Zero, you can do so on PC, PlayStation 5, Android, and iOS.</p>



<p>I completely understand that, for many, a PlayStation 5 is out of the question. Even this late into its lifespan, it’s rather expensive. But there’s a chance if you have a laptop or a smartphone. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/zenless-zone-zero-pc-requirements-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s system requirements</a> aren’t too demanding!</p>



<hr>



<p>Most impressively, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/zenless-zone-zero-crosses-50-million-downloads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zenless Zone Zero recently crossed 50 million downloads</a>! If you’re one of those players waiting for the download to finish, now’s a good time to sign up for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Newsletter</a>!</p>

At the time of this article's publication, more people are playing the first Cities Skylines game than its sequel on Steam.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>As for the console release, the plan was to release it in the spring of 2024 after missing last year's launch, but it was was delayed to October. There is no new release window. Back in April, Colossal Order and Paradox insisted that the team working on the console release operates separately from the PC development team, “so it will be progressing without splitting our focus or time.”</p><p>Missing October 2024 means Cities Skylines 2 will now launch on console over a year after it came out on PC, which was clearly not in Paradox or Colossal Order’s original plan. Meanwhile, both companies are battling a disgruntled player base by releasing updates aimed at improving the core PC version.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/manor-lords-publisher-hits-back-at-claims-it-should-have-better-prepared-to-provide-more-post-launch-content<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Not every game should be aimed at becoming some live-service boom or bust."</h2></div><section><p>The publisher of Steam hit medieval city builder <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/manor-lords">Manor Lords</a> has hit back at claims it has become the latest Early Access game to fail to provide players with enough content to keep them interested and therefore has suffered a significant drop-off.</p><p>In a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7215509660999503874/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Linkedin</a>, publisher Hooded Horse boss Tim Bender took issue with another Linkedin post from a video game developer that called Manor Lords “a pretty interesting case-study in the pitfalls of Early Access development when a game with a small team (and heavily marketed as such) hits the reality of a hungry audience.”</p><p>“As a result of the lack of updates, the concurrent users have plummeted since launch (which isn't that unusual — it's the current trend for a lot of Early Access titles that blow up these days),” the post continued.</p><p>“But given the huge number of wishlists and hype around it leading up to launch, this is something the developer and publisher should have been better prepared for, in my opinion.</p><p>“Early Access is a marathon, and when you launch you need to have your next major content expansion pretty much in the queue. The game has been out for 2.5 months and there have been three fairly small patches with no new features or content.</p><p>“As such, I've put the game aside and don't expect to look at it again for another six months, at which point I'll probably be focused on playing something else. It's really hard to get people's attention back once you've lost it.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Manor Lords Early Access Launch Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Bender responded directly to this post by calling it “exactly the kind of distorted endless growth/burden of expectations/line must go up perspective that causes so much trouble in the games industry.”</p><p>Bender said Manor Lords sold 250,000 copies in the last month after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/manor-lords-sells-2-million-copies-in-just-three-weeks-exceeding-publishers-wild-hopes">selling over two million copies in its first three weeks</a>, and pointed to its ‘very positive’ Steam user review rating of 88% and its median playtime of eight hours and 48 minutes per player.</p><p>“Players are happy, the developer is happy, and we as publisher are thrilled beyond belief,” Bender said. “And yet here we are — Manor Lords is apparently a ‘case-study in the pitfalls of Early Access’ because the ‘game has been out for 2.5 months and there have been three fairly small patches’ (one of the patch notes being called 'small' here runs over 3,000 words and over 10 single-spaced pages) leading to "concurrent users have plummeted since launch" (yes, we didn't maintain the 173,000 concurrent player peak) and the apparently dark reality that some people, after enjoying their purchase of a premium, single-player title, might decide to go on and play another game (The horror! The horror!).”</p><p>Solo developer Greg Styczeń, aka Slavic Magic, debuted Manor Lords on Steam priced $39.99 and straight into PC Game Pass in Early Access form on April 26. IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/manor-lords-review-early-access"><u>Manor Lords Early Access review</u></a> returned a 7/10. We said: “Manor Lords is a gorgeous medieval city-builder that kept me occupied for hours building my perfect, cozy hamlets, but it definitely feels very early in its Early Access development.”</p><p>Manor Lords hit its impressive Steam peak concurrent player count two month ago, and is now sitting on 10,671 peak concurrent players in the last 24 hours. That’s not enough to make Steam’s top 100 most-played games list, but it’s not far off.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Not every game should be aimed at becoming some live-service boom or bust.</p></div><p>Bender said that before Manor Lords came out, he told Styczeń to expect “all sorts of commenters talking about missed opportunities because he failed to grow as fast as they wanted, and judging the game a failure by some kind of expectation they formed.”</p><p>“I told him to ignore all that — to focus on his core vision for the game, and to keep in mind that the Early Access road is long and that he should not feel any sense of pressure from the expectations of others — for both his own health and stress levels over the coming years and for preserving the state of calm and peaceful mind that supports his creative vision.</p><p>“If this industry is to find a more sustainable path forward, we need to move away from takes like the below. Success should not create an ever raising bar of new growth expectations. Not every game should be aimed at becoming some live-service boom or bust. And a release should not begin an ever-accelerating treadmill on which devs are forced to run until their mental or physical health breaks down.”</p><p>Bender’s comment drew praise from Pocketpair community chief Bucky, who called it “a fantastic response.” Pocketpair’s controversial ‘Pokémon with guns’ survival and crafting game <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> has itself been accused of becoming a “dead game” after peak concurrent player numbers on Steam fell dramatically following the game’s record-breaking launch earlier this year. Palworld, incidentally, is currently Steam's 14th most-played game with 110,182 peak concurrent players in the last 24 hours following the Sakurajima update in June 2024.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Tim Bender, CEO of Hooded Horse, with a fantastic response to someone saying “Manor Lords is a pretty interesting case-study in the pitfalls of Early Access”.</p><p>I didn’t think Hooded Horse could get any cooler but here we are 👑 <a href="https://t.co/Rrff3UrIww" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Rrff3UrIww</a></p></div>— Bucky 🔜 BitSummit | Palworld (@Bucky_cm) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bucky_cm/status/1810098209945166032?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">July 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>The “dead game” moniker is often used to describe games that have seen a fall in player numbers, but it’s also often used without context or the understanding of a developer or publisher’s metric for success. Arrowhead’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a>, for example, has been called a “dead game” in recent weeks because Steam peak concurrents are not what they were in the months after the game came out, but it sold well enough to become the fastest-selling PlayStation game of all-time.</p><p>While the live service ‘numbers go up’ burden is one that all publishers and developers who dare to enter this most crowded and competitive of markets must shoulder, when it comes to premium, single-player Early Access games made by a small team, perhaps, as Bender suggests, a new way of thinking is required.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-ps5-xbox-release-delayed-again<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paradox has announced that the&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>PS5 and Xbox Series X|S release&nbsp;has once again been delayed, so you won't be playing this one on consoles this fall.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/console-development-status.1694383/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on the official Paradox forums</a>, the studio says that it has "not yet met the stability and performance targets" internally set for the game's console release, which means it'll miss its previously-mooted October release window.</p>
<p>The publisher says it's making "slow but steady progress" on&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2</em>&nbsp;for consoles, but that "unresolved issues" which "harm the player experience" are still hanging around.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cities-skylines-2-ps5-xbox-series-release-date-delayed-greenery.jpg?itok=RoLqSJSS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cities-skylines-2-ps5-xbox-series-release-date-delayed-greenery.jpg?itok=yUpxsHCM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>is going to take a little longer to arrive on consoles.</figcaption></figure><p>If all goes well, a new Release Candidate build, i.e. a build that could be suitable for release on consoles, will be submitted soon and will be reviewed in August.</p>
<p>Assuming that build is up to scratch, then the submission process will begin and a "solid release date" can be provided, but if the build doesn't pass muster, then there's a good chance the&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>console release could take a while longer yet.</p>
<p>This is far from the first time&nbsp;<em>Cities: Skylines 2&nbsp;</em>has been delayed on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. The game was originally due to arrive alongside its PC counterpart in October last year, but was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-console-delay">pushed back to spring 2024</a>&nbsp;shortly before release.</p>
<p>Following that, the game was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-ps5-xbox-delayed-apology">delayed further back in April</a>, and at that point, Paradox tentatively suggested that October could be the console versions' release window. However, an October release was never officially confirmed.</p>

<p>Paradox has since released a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-update-dlss-super-resolution">number of updates</a> intended to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-economy-20-patch">address these problems</a>, although the publisher has also acknowledged that many issues remain and that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cities-skylines-2-word-of-the-week-february-26th">has a "mountain to climb"</a> before they're all fixed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dark-souls-2-dlaa-fsr-mod-now-available-for-download/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While the Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin Lighting Engine mod has been developing since 2023, it now has <a href="https://wccftech.com/dark-souls-2-dlaa-dlss-mod-shows-greatly-reduced-aliasing/">NVIDIA DLAA</a> and AMD FSR Super Resolution support. Over time, it has added improvements by adding volumetric fog, ground truth ambient occlusion, and many more graphical updates to make Dark Souls 2 a more visually enjoyable experience.</p>
<p>Utilizing NVIDIA DLAA or AMD FSR Super Resolution significantly reduces the number of visual artifacts (specifically, aliasing) that a player might see when exploring the Kingdom of Drangleic, making it look prettier. The author admits DLAA is the superior solution for those who can enable it (owners of RTX 20/30/40 Series GPUs).</p>
<p>The mod created by Ganaboy now has many toggle-able features to create the visual dynamic you want from the game. Whether you want the screen to be brighter or dimmer or you want to turn on HDR Monitor support, the Dark Souls 2 Lighting Engine Mod has plenty on offer.</p>
<p>This mod is still listed as being in the Alpha stages of creation, meaning there is plenty more on the horizon regarding technical changes to ensure the best possible environments in Dark Souls 2. However, it has already added many new fixtures to the lighting systems and better shadow casting from environmental objects.</p>
<p>This update's main focus was adding DLSS and AMD FSR Super Resolution support, which is a game-changer for many players who utilize it. However, it's also added preset selections, a huge reduction in dithering and fixing God Rays throughout the game.</p>
<p>For a full list of changes that have been added in the latest update to the Dark Souls 2 Lighting Engine Mod, check out <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls2/mods/1146?tab=description">the Nexus page</a>, which lists all of the changes listed for each mod version.</p>
<p><iframe title="Antialiasing - LightingEngine UX" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5P8QdyhRvbk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you don't wish to utilize the DLSS/DLAA feature, even a measly GTX 1050TI graphics cards run the mod. Dark Souls 2: Scholar of the First Sin is widely seen as one of the most unpopular games in the franchise, but using this mod may make all the difference and allow players to have an enjoyable experience, as the world won't seem so massively outdated.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-games-done-quick-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Summer Games Done Quick 2024, a week-long charity marathon featuring 24 hours of streams daily, has concluded, and it's raised a seriously impressive amount of money for charity.</p>
<p>Per a press release, SGDQ 2024 managed to raise $2.5 million for the charity organization <a href="https://www.msf.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Doctors Without Borders</a>, otherwise known as&nbsp;Médecins Sans Frontières, or MSF. It's a charity SGDQ has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-games-done-quick-2016-concludes-raises-13-million">worked to benefit</a> on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/summer-games-done-quick-2017-schedule-announced">number of occasions</a> in the past.</p>
<p>That sum contributes to a lifetime total of $51 million for Games Done Quick as an organization, all of which has gone to charities like <a href="https://ablegamers.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">AbleGamers</a>, the <a href="https://researchautism.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Organization for Autism Research</a>, and the <a href="https://malala.org/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Malala Fund</a> over the course of the charity's 14-year lifespan.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/summer-games-done-quick-2024-marathon.jpeg?itok=VD9mxgv_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/summer-games-done-quick-2024-marathon.jpeg?itok=XMP72Dxj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Summer Games Done Quick 2024 is over, but what a marathon it's been.</figcaption></figure><p>Highlights of this year's Summer Games Done Quick include the adorable Shiba Inu Peanut Butter, who took part in a speedrun of the SNES baseball game&nbsp;<em>Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major League Baseball</em>.</p>
<p>As SGDQ says, Peanut Butter's run was accompanied by whoops, chants, and generally supportive noises from the crowd, all of whom were clearly just as in love with the lil' fella as I am.</p>
<p>Other big moments included a co-ordinated dance of the musical number "Herald of Darkness" from Remedy's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/alan-wake-2-review-mesmerizing-murder-mystery"><em>Alan Wake 2</em></a>, as well as a musical performance accompanying a run of the 1991 game&nbsp;<em>Sunset Riders</em>.</p>
<p>All of this, of course, was accompanied by runs of popular games like <i>Elden Ring&nbsp;</i>and its <i>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</i>DLC, <i>Celeste 64: Fragments of the Mountain</i>, and&nbsp;<em>Halo 3</em>, among many others.</p>

<p>Just because SGDQ is over, however, doesn't mean Games Done Quick will be resting on its laurels.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another major event, Flame Fatales, will be held between August 18th and August 25th, and will celebrate women in speedrunning culture, revolving around an all-women lineup who you'll be able to watch kicking ass on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GDQ Twitch channel</a>.</p>
<p>That's all before Awesome Games Done Quick, another event that has historically <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/awesome-games-done-quick-raises-26-million-for-prevent-cancer-foundation">raised impressive amounts of cash for charity</a>, returns in January. There's plenty to look forward to if you love speedrunning!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gothic-developer-piranha-bytes-reportedly-shut-down.921369/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gothic-developer-piranha-bytes-reportedly-shut-down/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>According to a loosely translated report <a href="https://www.cdaction.pl/newsy/piranha-bytes-zamkniete-to-koniec-tworcow-gothica" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by CD-Action</a>, an employee at Piranha Bytes told them the studio shut down by the end of June.</p>



<p>This was reportedly due to investors drying up, including Embracer Group itself, though the devs apparently expected new funding. Embracer’s lack of funding for the team may not surprise players, given <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-lay-offs-shareholder-value/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the extensive layoffs</a>.</p>



<p>The CD-Action report also seems to feature images of Piranha Bytes’ inactive studio after being shut down.</p>



<p>At this time, Piranha Bytes has not issued an official statement about any closure. Its most recent statement <a href="https://x.com/Piranha_Bytes/status/1749416801262297324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Twitter/X</a> was in January 2024. </p>



<p>It did address the studio was “in a difficult situation,” though the devs remained optimistic. The team said it would “do whatever it takes to find a partner” for their project.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Fans will likely recognize Piranha Bytes for their work on Gothic, Gothic 2, Elex, and the Risen series. Gothic 2 Complete Classic <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gothic-2-complete-classic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released on the Nintendo Switch</a> last November. </p>



<p>THQ Nordic recently mentioned plans for a Gothic 1 Remake, with more news coming to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/thq-nordic-showcase-announced-for-august-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an August showcase</a>. However, Steam lists Alkimia Interactive as the developer for that remake. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/PitheadStudio/status/1810222288484389201" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on X today, two veterans from Piranha Bytes did announce they are forming Pithead Studio. Jennifer and Bjorn Pankratz stated that Pithead will “develop immersive and fantastic indie games” in the future.</p>

The end is in sight."</p><p>Fallout: London was previously due to arrive on April 23, 2024 but actual Fallout developer Bethesda announced a surprise update for Fallout 4, which the mod developer feared would impact its release.</p><p>"We've just been tweaking and testing non-stop in order to get things as stable as we can for you all in time for that release," <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-london-creators-forced-to-delay-hotly-anticipated-mod-out-of-fear-fallout-4s-next-gen-update-will-break-it">said Team FOLON project lead Dean Carter at the time</a>.

"That has, for lack of a better term, sort of screwed us over, somewhat,” Carter said.</p><p>Fallout London is one of the most high-profile mods in development and will let players explore a post-apocalyptic version of the English capital. Players will engage with everything from “stuffy parliamentary aristocrats to a resurrection of the Knights of the Round Table to an uncompromising cult of revolutionaries." <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-star-joins-cast-of-fallout-london-mod">It even stars Baldur's Gate 3's Astarion actor Neil Newbon</a>.</p><p>Bethesda development chief Todd Howard has confirmed <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/todd-howard-bethesda-fallout-5-elder-scrolls-6-starfield">Fallout 5 will arrive after the Elder Scrolls 6</a>, which is still years away itself, but it continues to update MMO <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-downloads-50-million</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/zenless-zone-zero-downloads-cross-50-million-worldwide.921348/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zenless-zone-zero-downloads-50-million<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced that&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero</em>, the studio's latest gacha action RPG, has amassed a pretty impressive number of downloads worldwide in just a couple of days.</p>
<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/ZZZ_EN/status/1809527720768074217" rel="noopener" target="_blank">on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, HoYoverse revealed this weekend that&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>downloads have topped 50 million around the world "since its release". That's pretty impressive given that the game launched on July 4th.</p>
<p>The dev team says that although it's grateful for the support it's received thus far, it's also aware that "there are still lots of improvements to be made", and so it encourages players to provide feedback via the in-game Feedback menu.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-downloads-artwork.jpg?itok=gpoaT0Dt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/zenless-zone-zero-downloads-artwork.jpg?itok=qDbRZg5K 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>has amassed a ton of downloads.</figcaption></figure><p>As a thank-you for the download milestone, HoYoverse has also granted a free gift of 1,600 Polychrome to&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>players.</p>
<p>If you want to receive this gift, you'll have to reach Inter-Knot Level 1 or higher before Version 1.1 is released, although since there's no official release date for that update yet, you've likely got a little while to claim your reward.</p>
<p><em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>is the latest gacha action RPG from&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail&nbsp;</em>developer HoYoverse. Set in a post-apocalyptic world, the game sees players delving into anomalies known as Hollows in order to dispatch monsters and gather resources.</p>
<p>The game uses a similar gacha system to&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>, although a number of the game's <a href="https://naavik.co/digest/zzz-hoyoverse-friendliest-gacha/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">drop rates are higher</a>, perhaps indicating that HoYoverse wants to experiment with more forgiving and free-to-play-friendly gacha systems in future.</p>

<p>Where&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>differs from previous HoYoverse games is in its emphasis on urban fantasy and its hack-and-slash-inspired combat, which feels closer to&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry&nbsp;</em>or a Platinum game than to, say,&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>'s turn-based approach.</p>
<p>If you'd like to check out&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero&nbsp;</em>for yourself, you can <a href="https://zenless.hoyoverse.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">do so right now</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and mobile devices.</p>
<p>We've also got some guides to help you get started in the game, so make sure you check them out if you want to learn all about the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/all-currencies-in-zenless-zone-zero">currency</a>, how to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-to-modify-w-engines-in-zenless-zone-zero">modify W-Engines</a>, or how to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/how-to-promote-characters-in-zenless-zone-zero">promote your characters</a>.</p>

            <p>
I don't plan on having kids, but in the event that I change my mind, commissioning a forest Witch to grow one from a mushroom seems a lot easier than the usual human procreative process, though possibly just as abundant in screaming. I've been playing the demo for "cute-creepy" RPG and life sim Mushroom Musume, in which you - an unnamed "Recluse" - cultivate and play as a series of mushroom daughters. My current mushroom daughter is called Alia. She's a Common Turquoise Truffle. She's got a small pig acquaintance, who so far hasn't tried to devour her, and a cute fuzzy hat, which she stole from outside a church - precise impact on character development still TBC. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
I have done my best to raise Alia as a gentle but self-assertive soul, the kind of public-spirited girl who lops off pieces of her own body to distribute as candies in town, and who stands up for herself when she's followed home by rogue chefs. I must confess, though, I've blundered here and there. For example, when she was a pinhead she once saw me cut somebody's throat, and I must admit, I was once <em>sorely</em> tempted to gamble her away during a dice game with a fairy (the fairy took my little finger, instead). It's perhaps thanks to these missteps that Alia is moderately damp, which I understand is a sign of good health for mushrooms in general, but may indicate, here, a certain "murkiness of the soul". Hmm.
</p>
<p>
You can find Mushroom Musume on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2484580/Mushroom_Musume/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://mortallymoonstruckgames.itch.io/mushroom-musume">Itch</a> (the WIP Itch version is part of Itch's latest <a href="https://itch.io/b/2506/queer-games-bundle-2024-with-10-option">Queer Games Bundle</a>). I think it could be something special. Each round of the game begins with you fetching various ingredients for your filial fungus, at the behest of the aforesaid Witch. A colour, for example, which you might glean from a flower or the bottom of the river, and an heirloom, like the hairpin you gave to your previous lost child. 
</p>

</figure>
<p>
Then you try to do things that shape the form and persona of your budding porcini or juvenile shiitake, for better and worse. I managed to procure solid connections among the fairy folk for Alia, after deciding not to gamble her away, by refraining from murdering a fairy that snuck into her fungarium. I get the sense that each and every one of these decisions will have both nice and nasty outcomes. For example: making your daughter more outgoing and sociable might backfire if the local villagers decide that, on the whole, they'd rather eat mushrooms than talk to them.
</p>
<p>
After a few turns in the fungarium, your daughter reaches fruition and moves out, whereupon the game becomes a light-touch journalling RPG that reminds me a little of Reigns, made up of short text-based quests whose outcomes are often decided using dice. You've got ability cards, including a self-explanatory "Nope" card and a limited supply of "Soma" (aka, your own lifeforce) to spend on quests. Choices in quests affect your mushroom's personality stats and thus, presumably, the other quests you'll discover, while occasionally rewarding you with an item such as a magic handbell.  
</p>
<p>
The full game will include a "meta-progression" element whereby you raise a whole family of 'shroomans, and try to fill out your Mushroom Almanac with different species, which lends this Grimm fantasy the savour of a Balatro-style hunt for every last permutation. Your mushroom children may encounter each other in the world. For example, Alia has just been asked by the Witch to track down and kill another mycelium maiden who has gone a bit wrong. I swear, I had nothing to do with that one.
</p>
<p>
I <em>really</em> like Mushroom Musume. It's cuddly yet nasty, whimsical but rotten, eerie but enchanting and perhaps, endearing - a fairytale of the old school, in short. The premise is gloriously unwholesome, the visuals are a pleasing scrapbook of Game Boy photography, and the writing is as slight and flavourful with mounting bitter undertones as any redcap you'd find in the woods. Small flourishes abound: choosing a colour for your mushroom also decides the colour of the HUD, and there's a music player in top-right which you can turn on and off. Go on, <a href="https://mortallymoonstruckgames.itch.io/mushroom-musume">try the pre-release build</a>. It's free, but they're accepting donations.

It launches in Japan on iOS and Android devices this September, and is expected to be released in other regions of the world at a later date.&nbsp;</p>

<p>According to the game's <a href="https://d-rpg.com/en/">website</a>, Disney Pixel RPG will feature a story about merging worlds, fast-paced strategic battles (with simple controls for mobile and even an auto-play function), customization for your own avatar character, and expeditions that allow you to send pixelated Disney characters out on missions to gather materials and more. Players in Japan can pre-register for Disney Pixel RPG right now ahead of the game's September 9 launch – there's no word on if other regions will be able to pre-register anytime soon, however.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The game's listing on Apple's App Store notes it will be free-to-play but will feature microtransactions.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>Transformers: Galactic Trials will feature "exciting rogue-lite combat".</p>
<p>In a departure from the typical Transformer treatment – most of the dozens of Transformer games to have released over the last 20 years or so have been shooters or RPGs – this Transformer adventure will feature 10 racing circuits for Autobots and Decepticons to race against in "both vehicle and bot form".</p>
<p>Check out the action in the trailer below:</p>

<p>"Choose your loyalty by playing as iconic Autobots or Decepticons including Bumblebee, Megatron and Optimus Prime, and collect the stolen Prime Relics across the tracks to unlock new skills," Outright Games teases.</p>
<p>"Make it to the finish line by racing around 10 battle-race circuits in both vehicle and bot form, beating enemies along the way in exciting rogue-lite combat!"</p>
<p>You'll be able to choose from a roster of favourites, including Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Arcee, Wheeljack, Elita-1, Megatron, Shockwave, and Soundwave – yes, even Transformers that previously didn't get to transform into cars and trucks get a vehicular reimagining here – and take on driving and combat challenges, gather collectibles, all with "rogue-lite combat elements".</p>
<p>Transformers: Galactic Trials' "electrifying fusion of arcade racing and robot combat" is slated to arrive on PC via Steam, Switch, PS5, Xbox Series X/S and last-gen consoles on 11th October.</p>
<p>This time last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-says-activision-has-lost-its-transformers-games-on-a-hard-drive-in-its-offices-somewhere">Hasbro had to apologise for incorrectly intimating Activision lost its Transformers games</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/pc/windows-on-arm-is-not-ready-for-the-complexities-of-the-pc-gaming-landscape<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content"><p><span>Image via RDNE Stock Project.</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The relaunch of Windows on Arm has coincided with the arrival of Copilot+ PCs – devices that can execute Microsoft’s vision for the future of the Windows PC. Copilot+ PCs feature dedicated hardware that can run AI models on-device, unlocking new functionality ranging from generative AI-powered content creation to automatic image upscaling for games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For now, Copilot+ PCs are exclusively powered by Qualcomm’s Arm-based Snapdragon X hardware platform, with over a dozen PC makers having already launched devices.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This renewed investment by Microsoft and partners marks a significant milestone for Windows on Arm, which previously has seen meager support. Previous-generation processors built using the Arm architecture were unable to compete with processors on the x86 architecture from Intel and AMD, while software compatibility was not robust enough for most users’ requirements.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For instance, 2012’s ill-fated Windows RT only supported software specifically built for Arm, leaving behind support for decades of Windows software that users still depended on. While Windows 10 improved the situation with support for emulation of x86 software, this did not extend to increasingly predominant 64-bit software. Meanwhile, support for graphics-reliant applications was limited, rendering PC gaming off limits on Arm devices.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fast forward to 2024 and Microsoft and Qualcomm have promised Arm devices that offer greater power efficiency and performance than previous generation x86 processors from AMD and Intel.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Microsoft has also developed an improved translation layer, called Prism, to improve Windows on Arm’s compatibility with x86 software. Qualcomm is so confident in Prism’s capabilities that it assured game developers at GDC 2024 that most of their games should work without additional tweaking.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is an ambitious claim, considering the huge library of PC games native to the x86 architecture –over 110,000 games have been published on Steam at the time of writing. For many, the PC platform is synonymous with backwards compatibility, as users invest in building up a library of games over generations of PC ownership.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Gaming remains a core weakness of Windows on Arm">Gaming remains a core weakness of Windows on Arm</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite the big promises Qualcomm has made to game developers, gaming remains a core weakness of Windows on Arm, as compatibility with the huge library of Windows PC games remains patchy at best.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So far, just over 1,300 PC games have been independently tested for compatibility on Windows on Arm by the PC gaming community, which includes players and developers. Omdia analysis of this subset of tested games shows that barely half (55%) of games run smoothly without bugs or glitches (see Figure 1). That still leaves an large number of games that either fail to work or exhibit serious problems.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Figure 1: Around half currently tested titles exhibit issues on Windows on Arm</span></span></p><p>Source: Omdia, Linaro, Works on Windows on Arm</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To make matters worse, popular multiplayer games such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>League of Legends</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Destiny 2, Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Apex Legends, </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>PUBG: Battlegrounds </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">are currently unplayable via Windows on Arm due to incompatibility with anti-cheat software.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another critical issue holding back robust support for gaming is Qualcomm’s nascent hardware. It is still early days for Qualcomm’s Adreno GPUs in the PC space. Its drivers are in an immature state and don’t allow its graphics hardware to fully interface with the graphical demands of PC games, posing a further challenge to compatibility and performance.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="PC gaming does not have an immediate future on Arm">PC gaming does not have an immediate future on Arm</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With a large swathe of publishers’ PC games catalogs left in various states of incompatibility, what can be done? The PC gaming landscape isn’t just defined by the publishers and developers releasing games for the Windows operating system, but the hardware those games run on, and the numerous distribution platforms from which games are sold.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">First, the hardware: Following the relaunch of Windows on Arm in June 2024, Arm-based Windows devices accounted for just 0.05% of Steam users according to Valve’s Steam hardware survey. Until mass adoption occurs, games publishers are not incentivized to produce native versions of their software.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is unlikely to change in the short term. Omdia’s </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://omdia.tech.informa.com/collections/afccd056/mobile-pc-market-tracker">Mobile PC Market Tracker</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> estimates that Arm-based laptops will only account for just 1% of shipments of consumer laptops shipped with the Windows operating system in 2024 (see Figure 2). However, in the longer-term, this share is expected to grow to 30% by 2029.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Figure 2: Sales volumes of Arm-powered consumer laptops to remain low in the short term</span></span></p><p>Source: Omdia Mobile PC Market Tracker - July 2024</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Secondly, PC games distribution: even if publishers were producing Arm-native versions of their games today, the vast majority release games via third-party distribution platforms. This creates its own set of issues.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Moreover, Microsoft doesn’t support local playback of Xbox PC games on Arm devices via the preinstalled Xbox app on Windows 11. Even more importantly, Steam, the world’s largest PC games distribution platform, is firmly focused on serving the existing x86 audience, including its own handheld gaming device, Steam Deck.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Publishers cannot distribute Arm versions of their software on Steam, and there is no indication that this will change. This in turn reduces publishers’ incentive to better support the currently small audience on Windows on Arm, reducing Steam’s incentive to support Arm devices.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The situation ultimately leaves game developers and publishers dependent on two key aspects to the Windows on Arm ecosystem that they do not control: Microsoft’s Prism translation layer and improvements made to Qualcomm’s graphics drivers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Neither are quick fixes. In early 2024, Sarah Bond, President of Xbox, announced the formation of a team dedicated to forwards-compatibility of its games catalog that spans PC and console. Yet this is unlikely to be a task accomplished before 2026 at the earliest.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Meanwhile, Qualcomm’s graphics drivers are unlikely to reach a robust level of compatibility with PC games for several years. As a new entrant in this space, it will need to optimize its drivers on a per-game basis, which is time-consuming and expensive. Other hardware vendors such as Nvidia entering the Windows on Arm space could improve the situation with their mature graphics drivers, but Omdia does not anticipate this to occur until 2026.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">PC gaming on Arm is ultimately faced with the classic chicken-and-egg situation. Without a sufficiently large and proven audience of players on Arm devices, both publishers and PC games distribution platforms have little incentive to support the Arm platform, putting the onus on companies such as Microsoft and Qualcomm to improve compatibility in a bid to foster developer adoption.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the meantime, publishers and developers of PC games should focus on communicating what this means for their audience, utilizing social media channels and game store pages to inform players and potential buyers about what level of playability they should anticipate if they were using an Arm-based machine.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Despite Microsoft’s eagerness to push the Arm architecture at the center of its new Copilot+ PC vision, the reality is that dedicated PC gaming enthusiasts will continue to favor PCs powered by the x86 architecture. While a move to Arm promises users with lighter and more efficient PC hardware, the state of PC gaming on Arm has a lot of catching up to do as the developer ecosystem remains in infancy.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Analyst, Games, Omdia</p><div data-testid="contributor-summary-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">James is part of Omdia’s games team, specializing in the markets for PC and mobile gaming.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/reworking-war-robots-prize-system-with-style-and-user-friendliness<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Implementing a new game feature starts with planning; this is true whether it’s adding a layer of content, revising core mechanics, reworking the interface, or making quality-of-life changes. Any successful planning begins with clear goals. And our goal was ambitious: completely overhauling the event prize system in War Robots.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hello! I'm Nikolay Berezkin, Senior Game Designer at War Robots, and I'm joined by Anton Trofimov, Lead 2D Artist at Pixonic (MY.GAMES). Today, we're excited to share with you the story of how Data Pads, our new content system in War Robots, came to be.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Why revamp the prize system?">Why revamp the prize system?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Data Pads were born out of a desire to revolutionize our outdated event prize system, which had remained largely unchanged for years. We wanted to transform the way players experience event prizes, making it more visually appealing and user-friendly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Further, we wanted to expand the range of offers during events so that every player could receive something valuable and reduce production costs and the frequency of visual updates.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was also important for us to introduce a narrative element to the prize-receiving process, hinting at why a small "container" could hold massive robots and spaceships. This was no easy feat, given the game's 10-year history and the numerous legacy systems in place.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A change of appearance">A change of appearance</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first step of our overhaul was ditching the outdated visuals for something modern, universal, and easy to read. The form factor decision was a no-brainer: the name "Data Pads" itself suggested a card-like design – a futuristic storage medium, like a tablet from the future.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Initially, we envisioned each Data Pad displaying a 3D picture or render of the main prize. However, we considered this idea again and ultimately opted to abandon renders due to their high development costs and limited benefits. Despite this change, players can still easily identify which Data Pads contain the most valuable and desirable rewards, thanks to our clever design concept and engaging visual effects when opening the pads. Each data pad has two types of color differentiation: a silver or golden border indicating the quality of the data pad, and the color of the data pad itself – blue, purple, or red – which corresponds to the content of the prize pack.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of our other key objectives was to break free from the cycle of updating visuals for every event. We wanted players to become familiar with the consistent Data Pad design and eliminate any confusion with other elements. To achieve this, we introduced "card backs", which are event-specific updates that add a fresh touch to the Data Pads without altering their core design.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first event to feature Data Pads was themed around Beast Knights. As a fitting touch, we chose animal crests as card backs: a wolf, lion, and bear. By examining the Data Pads, players could infer, based on their crests, the rewards they might expect from both the regular and premium (gold) versions.</span></p><p>Examples of ordinary Data Pads and golden Data Pads. The latter aren’t available for direct purchase and can only be obtained through in-game activities, like leaderboard competitions</p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Streamlining how users open the Data Pad">Streamlining how users open the Data Pad</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our next mini-task was to facilitate seamless collaboration between departments in order to develop a new feature for opening Data Pads. This was a rare opportunity for us to work on a large feature that heavily relies on visual elements. However, the game's age presented certain constraints on client development and art, which we had to carefully consider.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To overcome these hurdles, we had to revamp the entire prize-opening workflow. We broke down the feature into several key stages: event HUD, cinematic, prize reveal, and returning to the HUD. Each stage required the expertise of different specialists. Meanwhile, the producer and game designer oversaw the overall vision of the feature, ensuring that the entire team was aligned throughout the development process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We started with a small UI prototype that simulated navigating the main screens. At the same time, we started working on a cinematic – a short video that would play in the game engine when a Data Pad is opened.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At this stage, we needed to clarify a couple of crucial aspects. We had a rough idea about the appearance of the Data Pads, but how would we present them to the player? During one meeting, an idea cropped up: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>"Let's have it fall from the sky, with a teleport beam and FX, then boom, the player gets a reward!"</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> And the final version as implemented isn't far from this concept. We knew the feature needed a build-up to the prize, filling the player with anticipation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A lot of time was spent brainstorming how the player would receive the reward, where it would appear, and how it would materialize. After numerous experiments, the "heavenly wham" concept evolved into a camera flying through a corridor into a room, where the reward would suddenly appear in a flash of light.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The second crucial question: what exactly is a Data Pad? These are carriers of information, but in the game, it can actually contain a massive robot and a gun. We were concerned about the realism of this device and how to avoid violating the game's logical world. To address this, we came up with a new concept: Data Pads contain encrypted information, like coordinates pointing to the location of prizes won by the player, including in-game currencies, robots, and other content.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The player-commander uses a decoder key located on their ship to crack the code, and the coordinates are instantly displayed on their screen. This idea became the foundation for our development.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To showcase the connection between the Data Pad card and the prize, we introduced the spotlight pedestal concept. The Data Pad is first revealed and "decrypted" on the pedestal, and then, at the end of the cinematic, the prize itself materializes on a similar pedestal.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the final version, this pedestal concept doesn't always shine through as clearly as we'd have liked; the pedestal's visibility varies across different screens, and we didn't want to increase the card's height, fearing it would disrupt the composition. At present, we're exploring ways to fine-tune the design to make it even more stunning.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A UI overhaul">A UI overhaul</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also focused on making sure the player has a clear understanding of the prizes they can expect. Previously, the loot box displayed a dull, outdated list of prizes – this is a far cry from user-friendliness. Functionally, it was a lengthy carousel with cards, where players had to scroll through to see possible rewards, with prizes seemingly placed haphazardly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now, we've updated the UI and breathed new life into it – players can better see the value of the prizes, can categorize them more easily and choose something of interest to them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We've also thoroughly overhauled the mechanics of the system. The old system consisted of a static screen featuring a selection of chests, which players could open by spending a set number of event coins, and they had the option to open either one or ten chests at once with a simple tap.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Through experimentation, we settled on a 3-chest, 3-currency system. Each chest and currency feature distinct visuals, creating a sense of progression, and contain different rewards to reinforce this. The coins used to open chests were also utilized in various monetization features, such as in-game quests, offers, and more.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Additionally, the original interface fell short in one crucial aspect: it didn't provide players with any information about the potential rewards they could earn with their coins. To get that info, players had to waste time navigating to a separate screen, searching for the chest that corresponded to their coins.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The old system was plagued by issues that made it difficult for players to understand what was going on: coins and chests were often confusingly similar or vastly different, leading to player frustration and confusion.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our rework addressed these problems head-on. First of all, we now offer Data Pads directly, rather than the keys to unlock them. This eliminates the need for players to keep track of unnecessary information and clears up confusion about which coin corresponds to which chest. This change also optimized our production pipelines, allowing our art team to focus on a single entity without having to create intermediate links in the form of event currencies.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Second, each Data Pad now features a button that opens an information window, displaying the potential prizes within. This simplifies the purchasing process because players can now easily find out which Data Pad contains a more desirable reward. This button is conveniently available at all points where Data Pads can be obtained, including battle passes, leaderboards, and offers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Third, the event interface has undergone a significant overhaul. It no longer displays Data Pads that are inaccessible to the player. Unlike the static presence of three chests on the screen, Data Pads may be absent, and if a player only has one type of Data Pad, they can only interact with that one.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">***</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is far from the end of our journey. With all of our work, we continue to push further, refine our features, and Data Pads are no exception.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Not everything went smoothly, but we've learned from our experiences. As an example of that last point, the idea of connecting screens through pedestals didn't quite work out as planned.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also needed to improve the readability of the value between the first Data Pads, which was accomplished by the next event. Additionally, we refined the polishing effects, which had a significant impact on players' perceptions of Data Pad rarity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most importantly, the feature resonated with players and achieved its primary goal of reversing the trend of fading interest in events, creating a truly explosive "wow" effect. The metrics we collected confirmed the importance of offering a wide range of choices in such features. To bring things to a close, I'd like to commend the entire team for their outstanding work with Data Pads!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Another year, another huge amount raised for charity by obscenely skilled gamers. Popular speedrunning event Summer Games Done Quick took place last week and <a href="https://x.com/GamesDoneQuick/status/1809859576709132544">raised more than $2.5 million</a> for Doctors Without Borders, fielding runners who took on a mix of modern and retro games with various quirky goals or challenging requirements. Like an attempt at getting through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sekiro-shadows-die-twice">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a> without being hit (oh god) and a hasty anti-gravitational swim through the solar system of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outer-wilds">Outer Wilds</a> but without using the game's spaceship (what). Let us be glad these folks use their powers for good.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The event saw seven days of speedrunning with <a href="https://tracker.gamesdonequick.com/tracker/runs/SGDQ2024">lots of games covered</a>. A glitchless <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> speedrun saw the moment the charity stream broke the $2 million mark, with even speedrunner "Blanxz" briefly <a href="https://youtu.be/HxfaFmhzUno?si=tDv_SMnf4ParmGwj&amp;t=4108">pausing to cheer in-game</a>. But not before a previous From Software game took the stage. A 37-minute speedrun of Sekiro included a comedy aside when the run was <a href="https://youtu.be/2m-YAWJcjjQ?si=lbK6AbDN0egJ9fGq&amp;t=1648">interrupted by sticky keys</a>. Runner "Mitchriz" had to contain his own laughter while pausing to disable the annoying sound effect. The intended goal of a completely hitless run in the Sengoku-era slicer didn't pan out, but never mind, we got our giggles. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, a speedrun of Outer Wilds was done without a ship, which involved runner "PTMinsker" <a href="https://youtu.be/M1wD9R5LJV8?si=L7BJ54diQdRk8UWB&amp;t=423">firing himself into space</a> using the scout probe launcher for extra momentum, and then matching the orbit of the sun station - a solar research post in extremely low orbit. Absolutely bonkers behaviour. Well done.</p>
<p>There are a lot of other highlights from the various recent games, should you <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule/48">choose to peruse</a>. Including <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XuzAVXp6pUk">a 14-minute sprint through Animal Well</a> that saw lots of precise air bubble platforming and a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVJDx8b_EWI">Balatro playthrough</a> which the commentators joked would be affected by "just a little bit of RNG." </p>
<p>I don't watch speedruns with the regularity of other rapidity likers. But Games Done Quick events are good for even the non-hardcore, since commentators (and even the runner) will usually explain things as they go, making glitches or exploits clear. Previous years have raised <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/awesome-games-done-quick-2023-raised-more-than-26-million-for-charity">similar amounts of cash</a> and the event has been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gdq-founder-steps-down-after-13-years-and-more-than-41-million-raised">fundraising for good causes since 2010</a>. In other speedrunning news, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/quake">Quake</a> player last week broke a record in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RqRtxlng2co">the first level on Nightmare difficulty</a>, an infamously hideous difficulty setting for a cramped bunny hop through E1M1. Nice.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cities-skylines-2-console-release-window-delayed.921312/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-console-release-window-delayed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/console-development-status.1694383/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new statement</a> on the community forum, the Cities Skylines 2 team announced that the console release window for October 2024 is now delayed.</p>



<p>The developers explain that they did not meet “the stability and performance targets we set.” They added that “there are still unresolved issues impacting the game in ways that harm the player experience.”</p>



<p>The team did not announce a new release date or window. However, they do say that fans might expect another update soon. </p>



<p>The devs aim to receive a new ‘Release Candidate’ in August, which will “undergo a thorough review.” The results will either result in a solid release date or require another delay.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The devs also thanked fans for their understanding and support, and players do remain patient for a proper experience. </p>



<p>The game previously faced some backlash over the unfinished elements at launch and in the first DLC. Later, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/paradox-apologizes-again-after-even-more-cities-skylines-2-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paradox even apologized</a> for the state of the base game and DLC. So, a patient approach for Cities: Skylines 2 on console will surely benefit fans.</p>



<p>Last month, Cities: Skylines 2 introduced a massive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-economy-rework-coming-june-24-devs-address-console-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Economy 2.0 rework patch</a>, though it arrived a bit late for “last minute fixes.” </p>



<p>It also took months for the game to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-is-finally-getting-mod-support/">add mod support</a> after launch, back in March. However, the devs continue to address key issues, such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-rent-was-too-high-so-they-removed-landlords/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removing landlords</a> to balance rent.</p>

		<p>Fourteen years ago, Image &amp; Form established the SteamWorld universe with the release of SteamWorld Tower Defense, but it wasn’t until the release of SteamWorld Dig a few years later that the series truly made its mark. I took a journey back to Tumbleton and El Machino to see if SteamWorld Dig and SteamWorld Dig 2 have stood the test of time.</p>
<p><em><strong>Spoiler Warning:</strong> Looking back on these two games so many years after release, we delve into some major plot points and spoilers.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><iframe title="SteamWorld Dig 2 - Official Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/trLZKer9uPI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>From the day that Rusty first strode into town after receiving a deed from his uncle for the local mine, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2013/08/22/steamworld-dig-review/">SteamWorld Dig</a> stood out in large part thank to its simplicity and purity of concept. Armed with nothing but a red scarf and a pickaxe, Rusty starts digging in the mine to find out what happened to his uncle, and to rediscover secrets that were buried long ago. The core gameplay loop is to dig in the mine, find ore, return to town, sell the ore, and upgrade your equipment. What makes it so fondly looked upon is the game design, the characters, and the writing. At no point is there a feeling that no progress is being made, with every strike of the pickaxe taking you forward – well, downward.</p>
<p>Rusty may be on the quieter side, but Tumbleton’s inhabitants, from Dot the merchant to her inventor dad Hank ‘Cranky’ McCrank, and the bartender Lola, are never short on witty remarks. As Tumbleton’s economy flourishes, all thanks to Rusty’s relentless mining, new Steambots arrive with more upgrades in hand for you to use. The mine’s map is a marvellous design, pushing you to delve deeper, but also guiding you to upgrades through its environmental design, tucking the metroidvania format behind an individualistic veneer. Beyond the main mineshaft, there are forgotten rooms brimming with extra upgrades and challenges that aid Rusty on his journey to uncover the mine’s ultimate secret. These rooms, with their standalone puzzles, strike the right balance of challenge without causing frustration. As you play, you grow attached to Rusty, and the conclusion of SteamWorld Dig delivers an emotional blow, setting up SteamWorld Dig 2 as an ideal follow-up.</p>


<p>The sequel see you step into the boots of Dorothy, who is on a mission to unravel the mystery of Rusty’s disappearance. Her quest leads her to the vibrant yet endangered town of El Machino, which is plagued by relentless earthquakes. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/26/steamworld-heist-2-preview-a-sequel-worth-diving-back-in-for/">SteamWorld Dig 2</a> expands upon its predecessor with larger mines, a host of new enemies with new attacks, and a Cog system that enhances your tools’ abilities. While the ability to purchase items such as dynamite and teleporters is absent, there is an improved distribution of transport tubes allowing you to get back to the surface regularly to sell ore and purchase upgrades.</p>
<p>SteamWorld Dig 2 not only broadens the range of player activities but also delves deeper into series themes. In the first game, the Shiners are humans that have been driven mad due to the effects of moon juice, and living underground. They’ll lob dynamite and acid as soon as Rusty gets near them. Rusty deals with them by killing them to remove the threat. In SteamWorld Dig 2, the Shiners are given more depth outside of the mindless people they appear to be in the first game. Partway through the game we find a Shiner village where the inhabitants have some intelligence, though have been affected by moon juice. That is everyone except Rosie, who is trying to keep her people safe from the outside world, and does not drink moon juice.</p>

<p>We see that the way the Steambots have dealt with Shiners in the past, causing the Shiners to be scared and act angrily towards them. Initially, Rosie appears to put past conflicts aside to collaborate with Dot, but it is later revealed that she was manipulating Dot from the beginning. Although depicted as a villain, Rosie’s motives are somewhat relatable. She created a machine to protect her people from the dangers of the mines and, in her eyes, the Steambots, considering the resulting earthquakes on the surface a necessary sacrifice. SteamWorld Dig 2 conveys that division, hatred, and violence will only lead to destruction and loss for all – something that is taken quite literally when Rosie’s actions cause the planet to blow up, all stemming from that fear for her people’s safety, previously harmed and killed by Steambots, including Rusty.</p>
<p>SteamWorld Dig 1 &amp; 2 definitely hold up as games worth playing today, and are a great entry point to the SteamWorld universe. Of the two main characters, Dot has more of a personality, but that would be down to the fact she is present through both games. The gameplay loop is solid, the puzzles are fun to work out, and the vibe is generally chilled out.</p>
